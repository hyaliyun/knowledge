The phrase has been used for this purpose since at least the 1930s, but became more widely used in the United States after the Watergate scandal. History Compelled by a subpoena to provide the contents of the White House taping system to the House Judiciary Committee in April 1974, President Richard Nixon ordered transcripts of the tapes to be prepared. After a cursory inspection of the transcripts, Nixon, shocked at viewing several profanity- laced discussions amongst the White House's inner-circle, ordered that every use of profanity be replaced by \\"[EXPLETIVE DELETED]\\". The transcripts were published in The New York Times and elicited shock in much of the country, given Nixon's generally staid public image and the fact that contemporary media coverage of politicians did not usually report candidates' profanity use. As Nixon biographer Jonathan Aitken noted, Nixon had a rather broad view on what constituted profanity, and had ordered comparatively minor outbursts like Christ and hell to be replaced as expletives. Seeing the jarring phrase repeatedly within the transcripts seemed to give the public the impression that the words used were far harsher than what actually appeared on the tapes.Aitken, Johnathan: \\"Nixon, A Life\\" Page 515 The phrase entered the public imagination to the point where protesters outside the White House held up picket signs reading, \\"IMPEACH THE (EXPLETIVE DELETED)!\\" In later years, the phrase became commonplace as an ironic expression which indicates that a profanity has been omitted; this catchphrase has passed into general usage as a convenient linguistic figleaf. Technical definition The term expletive is commonly used outside linguistics to refer to any bad language (or profanity), used with or without meaning. Expletives in this wide sense may be adjectives, adverbs, nouns, or (most commonly), interjections, or (rarely) verbs. Within linguistics, an expletive always refers to a word without meaning, namely a syntactic expletive or expletive attributive. In this technical sense, an expletive is not necessarily rude.

The club that finished second, Paris Saint Germain refused it, making it unattributed. Affaire VA-OM In 1993 Olympique de Marseille reached both the very pinnacle and the very bottom of the European club game. A corruption scandal and a Canal+'s shining light for Paris Saint-Germain would threaten their hegemony. The European Cup was denied, but the glory would eventually come for Marseille. As the European Cup was renamed the Champions League in 1992‚Äì93, Marseille reached the final for the second time in three years, but this time they prevailed. Marseille won Group A and suddenly found themselves in the final against Milan. Basile Boli hit home the winning goal as Marseille became the first French side to win a European trophy and the only to win the Champions League. Didier Deschamps and Fabien Barthez became the youngest captain and goalkeeper, respectively, to capture the title. Their fans greeted the triumph by chanting \\"A jamais les premiers\\" because they won the first \\"Classico\\" against PSG in 1971. The city exploded with a joy shared across the nation but no sooner had the trophy been hoist aloft than the celebrations were brought to a halt. A corruption scandal revolving around a match against Valenciennes emerged a few days before the Champions League final. Allegations of match fixing were levelled at them and their president Bernard Tapie. It is believed that Tapie bribed Valenciennes to lose so that Olympique de Marseille would win the French League earlier, giving them more time to prepare for the Champions League Final. Valenciennes players Christophe Robert, Jorge Burruchaga and Jacques Glassmann claimed that the Marseille midfielder Jean- Jacques Eydelie offered them ‚Ç£250,000 to \\"take the foot off of the gas\\" in a May 20 match against Marseille. Marseille was later stripped of their league title and relegated to Division 2 by the French Football Federation, while Bernard Tapie was forced to step down as its president. Marseille was not stripped of the Champions League, as the match in question was not in the competition, but lost the right of title-defense in the 1993‚Äì94 UEFA Champions League, as well as regular reigning European champions match in 1993 Intercontinental Cup and 1993 European Super Cup. No winner was declared for the 1992‚Äì1993 season. The LFP allotted the title to Paris Saint-Germain but Canal + refused it. The TV chain feared the reactions of their subscribers in Provence and threatened to withdraw football completely if the title was allotted to PSG. Ultimately the LFP decided that the 1993 title would remain unattributed. Canal+ refused letting the club participate in the following season's Champions League after Marseille's exclusion by the UEFA.Le PSG est vice-champion d'un championnat sans champion suite au d√©classement de l'Olympique de Marseille (Affaire VA-OM).

The short films were produced and written by Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black, David Wain, who also star in the shorts with a number of guest actors. They have gained considerable popularity on the Internet, after initially appearing on CollegeHumor. A collection of the short films, Stella Shorts 1998-2002, was released on DVD in 2002, but is no longer being produced. Since the short films are not currently available on DVD, they are often distributed freely online by fans on video sharing websites such as YouTube and Dailymotion. Many of the shorts can also be found on Stella's official website. Origin of the shorts Stella collectively self-produced the short films from 1998 to 2004. The short films were originally shown at the group's live stage shows at nightclubs. The shorts spawned a number of running jokes and consistencies in the troupe's act, such as Michael Showalter's line \\"We don't have...this money\\" and group discussions about the nature of God. Many of the shorts contain raunchy humour, including various instances of people engaging in comical, non-graphic sex acts while being completely clothed or a sudden, casual appearance of a dildo. Some of the actors to guest star in the shorts include Sam Rockwell, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Julie Bowen, and A.D. Miles, as well as several members of Stella's alma mater The State, such as Joe Lo Truglio. Comedian Zak Orth appears in many of the shorts as well.

Early life He was the eldest of six sons of Jeremiah Mathews, a Worcestershire land agent, and his wife Mary Guest. Of his brothers, Charles Edward Mathews (1834‚Äì1905) and George Spencer Mathews (1836‚Äì1904) were also noted mountaineers. William was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. Founding of the Alpine Club Mathews had corresponded with F. J. A. Hort about the idea of founding a national mountaineering club in February 1857 and took the idea up with E. S. Kennedy on an ascent of the Finsteraarhorn on 13 August 1857 (the fifth ascent of the mountain and the first British ascent).Finsteraarhorn at stnet.ch (accessed 7 January 2008): On this ascent Mathews and Kennedy were accompanied by J. C. W. Ellis, John Frederick Hardy, Benjamin St John Attwood-Mathews, and by four guides, Auguste Simond and Jean Baptiste Croz, of Chamonix, Johann Jaun the Elder, of Meiringen, Aloys Bortis, of Fiesch, and by one porter, Alexander Guntern. Ad-hoc meetings at Mathews's house near Birmingham proceeded during November,Claire Engel, Mountaineering in the Alps, London: George Allen and Unwin, 1971, p. 112.

Background In 1996, Schlusser published a book, Men's Rights in the Family?, which argued that family law in the State of Israel is biased against men. Issues such as divorce, alimony, false accusations of abuse, and child support are addressed. Schlusser subsequently contested the 1996 Knesset elections as the head of the Man's Rights in the Family Party. The platform of the party called for the abolition of the clause granting automatic custody to the mother in cases of divorce for small children. It also called for basing child support on other factors besides the cost-of-living index. Other issues the party dealt with was more housing for young couples, lowering taxes, and a call for state pensions. It also called for the option of a secular civil marriage in addition to a religiously recognized marriage. It received 2,388 votes (0.1%), failing to win a seat. In the 1999 Knesset elections, the party ran under the name \\"Justice for All\\", and received 1,257 votes (0.04%), the second lowest number of votes with a 1.5% electoral threshold. In 2003, the party was accused by the Israel Women's Lobby of inciting violence against women and misrepresenting facts in their campaign broadcasts. However, according to an article in Haaretz, the chairman of the Central Elections Committee rejected the women's lobby petition to censor the campaign. In the subsequent Knesset elections, the party received 1,284 votes (0.04%). The 2006 elections saw the party run as \\"Justice for All\\" again, this time receiving 3,819 votes (0.12%). Prior to the 2009 Knesset elections, Schlusser said in an interview with Yedioth Achronoth that one out of every two fathers loses the right to see their children as a result of messy divorces, adding, \\"children have a right to see their fathers\\", also claiming that \\"a child that sees a woman in control, in contradiction to nature, may turn homosexual\\". In the elections, the party received only 921 votes (0.03%). In 2012, Schusser was profiled in Makor Rishon about his personal experiences which led him to run for public office. In 2013, he advocated changing laws that stipulate stay-at- home men must pay National Insurance, while housewives are exempt. In an interview with Haaretz, he stated, \\"When it comes to the age of retirement, for example, women can retire at age 62, but I can't.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Defunct political parties in Israel Category:Political parties established in 1996 Category:Men's rights ","title":"Man's Rights in the Family Party"},{"id":"10119686","text":"Joseph Denis Patrick Labrecque (born March 6, 1971) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player.

IRMA was founded with the belief, borne out by Verghese Kurien‚Äôs work in the dairy co-operatives which revolutionized the dairy industry in the country (Operation Flood), that the key to effective rural development is professional management.It is consistently ranked as one of India's best business schools. Also it is considered as the best business school in the Rural and Agricultural Business Management Sector of India. The Institute was established with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Corporation, the Government of India, the erstwhile Indian Dairy Corporation, the NDDB (National Dairy Development Board) and the Government of Gujarat.IRMA campus was designed by the famous architect Achyut Kanvinde. IRMA provides management training, support and research facilities to students committed to rural development; in this process it has brought within its ambit several co- operatives, non-government organisations, government development agencies, international development organisations and funding agencies. Over the years the convocation of IRMA is graced by National and International luminaries from the academic , cultural , spiritual and political spheres. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi attended IRMA's first annual convocation in 1982 . History Former Prime Minister - Indira Gandhi , Rajiv Gandhi , Atal Bihari Vajpayee & Manmohan Singh visited IRMA to attend the Annual Convocation. Michael Halse, then a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) planning adviser with NDDB, was one of the members responsible for conceptualizing this new discipline of rural management.Halse, Michael, A new institute of rural management - and a new developmental discipline?, IRMA Occasional Papers # 1. Another person involved with the institute was the organizational behavior academic Dr. Kamala Chowdhary, who also served briefly as the director of the institute and played a key mentoring role in its formative years. The former director of Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Ravi J. Matthai contributed; through his documented learning from the Jawaja experiment.http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/iima-cases/cases-list.html&more;=CMA0666 Matthai stressed the need for a new type of management education, different from the conventional Indian Institute of Management one: for working on rural development problems. The institute was initially budgeted as a center for management and consultancy for rural development, under the second phase of the Operation Flood program. Under the chairmanship of Dr. Verghese Kurien, IRMA evolved quickly to enlarge its mandate to professionalize management of rural producers‚Äô organisations and create a body of knowledge in the field of rural management. Infrastructure of IRMA , Anand One of the pioneering and senior faculty in the initial years was anthropologist and equity-feminist scholar Leela Dube. One of her studies, through field work in five Southeast Asian countries, put the organisation on the international social science research map. Beginning with co-operatives funded by NDDB, IRMA has reached out to the rural sector through development organizations engaged with issues of rural life such as natural resource management (especially water and forests), rural health, local governance institution, livelihood, migration, micro finance, and deploying IT for rural areas. Since inception, the focus of IRMA has been on strengthening the management capacities in non-governmental organisations and organisations that are controlled by users of the services (rather than the conventional capital investor-centered business corporate). IRMA claims that its branding and commitment to a unique field of management makes it unique among management institutes of India.

While similar to the related Huaxiagnathus, Sinocalliopteryx were larger. The type specimen, at 2.37 meters (7.78 ft) in length, in 2007 was the largest known compsognathid exemplar. In 2012 an even larger specimen was reported. Description Sinocalliopteryx was a bipedal predator. The preserved length of the holotype specimen is 237 centimetres. Its weight was estimated by Gregory S. Paul in 2010 at twenty kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 121 Sinocalliopteryx is distinguished from Huaxiagnathus, as well as other compsognathids, by its relatively long hands in relation to its arms. The arms and hindlimbs were also longer overall than in other compsognathids, a feature possibly related to its size. Restoration Sinocalliopteryx had an elongated head with a pointed snout, showing a convex upper profile. There were four teeth in the premaxilla which were small but exceptionally had denticles on their front edges. Only six, larger, teeth were present in the maxilla of the holotype specimen but the number of its tooth positions could not be adequately determined. Specimen CAGS-IG-T1 preserves ten maxillary tooth sockets with room for one or two more in damaged areas. The jugal was a strongly built element with a high-rising front branch that formed part of the lower front edge of the eye socket. The lower jaw lacked an opening in its outer side. The vertebral column consisted of eleven cervical, twelve dorsal, five sacral and at least forty-nine caudal vertebrae. The point of the tail is missing. In the tail, the spines and chevrons strongly inclined to the back. The gastralia had very short lateral segments. The arm had a short humerus and also the lower arm was short and elegant with an ulna showing only a weakly developed olecranon process on its back upper end. The hand was very elongated though, as long as the ulna and upper arm combined. The second metacarpal was expanded at the top at the side of the first metacarpal, making the entire metacarpus more compact. The second claw was elongated, as long as the thumb claw. The third metacarpal was rather short and carried a thin, third, finger. In the pelvis there was a little notch in the front edge of the ilium. The relatively long shaft of the ischium curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the metatarsus. Like many other theropods of the Yixian Formation, Sinocalliopteryx was preserved with \\"protofeathers,\\" simple filamentous integument (hairlike structures covering the skin), very similar to that found in Sinosauropteryx. The integument of Sinocalliopteryx differ in length across the body, with the longest protofeathers covering the hips, base of the tail, and back of the thighs. These longest protofeathers measured up to ten centimeters (4 in) in length. Protofeathers were also found on the metatarsus (upper part of the foot). While these were not nearly as long or modern as the corresponding feathers of \\"four-winged\\" dinosaurs such as Microraptor and Pedopenna, they do indicate that foot-feathers or similar structures first arose in dinosaurs much more basal or \\"primitive\\" than previously known. Discovery and naming Specimen CAGS-IG-T1 The type species Sinocalliopteryx gigas was named and described in 2007 by Ji Shu'an, Ji Qiang, L√º Junchang and Yuan Chongxi. The generic name is derived from Sinae, Latin for the Chinese and Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÇ, kalos, \\"beautiful\\", and œÄœÑŒ≠œÅœÖŒæ, pteryx, \\"feather\\". The large size of this \\"giant compsognathid\\" lent Sinocalliopteryx its specific name, gigas, meaning 'giant'.Ji, S., Ji, Q., Lu J., and Yuan, C. (2007). \\"A new giant compsognathid dinosaur with long filamentous integuments from Lower Cretaceous of Northeastern China.\\" Acta Geologica Sinica, 81(1): 8-15 The holotype, JMP-V-05-8-01, was discovered at Hengdaozi, in Sihetun, in Liaoning Province, from the Jianshangou Beds of the Yixian Formation dating from the Barremian-Aptian, about 125 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a single plate, of an adult individual. Extensive remains of protofeathers have been preserved. In 2012 a second specimen was described, CAGS-IG-T1, of an individual larger than the holotype. The skull was about 10% longer, the feet about a third, a difference explained by positive allometry. The specimen consists of a partial skull, tail, hands, feet and ribcage. It shows filaments on the tail.Lida Xing, Phil R. Bell, W. Scott Persons IV, Shuan Ji, Tetsuto Miyashita, Michael E. Burns, Qiang Ji, Philip J. Currie, 2012, \\"Abdominal Contents from Two Large Early Cretaceous Compsognathids (Dinosauria: Theropoda) Demonstrate Feeding on Confuciusornithids and Dromaeosaurids\\", PLoS ONE 7(8): e44012. Phylogeny Sinocalliopteryx was by its describers assigned to the Compsognathidae. This cladogram shows the position of Sinocalliopteryx in the Compsognathidae according to a study by dal Sasso & Maganuco in 2011:Cristiano dal Sasso & Simone Maganuco, 2011, Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Italy ‚Äî Osteology, ontogenetic assessment, phylogeny, soft tissue anatomy, taphonomy and palaeobiology. Memorie della Societ√† Italiana de Scienze Naturali e del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano XXXVII(I): 1-281 The large size of Sinocalliopteryx compared to its relatives is also notable, and may indicate a trend towards large size among compsognathids (a group well known for their small size compared to other, giant theropod dinosaurs), similar to the trends towards larger sizes in other dinosaurian lineages. Paleobiology Sinocalliopteryx feeding on Sinornithosaurus The well-preserved skeleton of the Sinocalliopteryx holotype contained the partial leg of a dromaeosaurid within the abdominal cavity, comprising a complete lower leg and foot with toes and claws in their natural, articulated position. While the leg part, about one foot long, is very large in relation to the abdominal cavity, it is clearly situated within it, lying between the ribs. Ji and colleagues in 2007 suggested that this could indicate it preyed upon the smaller, bird-like dinosaur. This discovery indicated that Sinocalliopteryx may have been an agile, active, \\"fierce\\" predator, especially since other compsognathids have been found with (presumably fast-moving) lizards and small mammals in their abdominal cavities. In 2012 the dromaeosaurid was tentatively identified as an individual of Sinornithosaurus with a length of 1.2 metres (3.9 ft). The 2012 study also reported newly discovered remains of prey animals. Above the dromaeosaurid leg, feathers are visible. Below it two clusters of digested food can be seen. It was suggested that the feathers had belonged to a bird and were with the leg still present in the stomach. The digested food would, using the preserved digestive tract of Scipionyx as a reference, have been positioned in the duodenum. The C-shaped abdominal contents of this specimen appear to reflect of the original contour of the digestive tract.Dal Sasso C, Maganuco S (2011) Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Italy; osteology, ontogenetic assessment, phylogeny, soft tissue anatomy taphonomy and palaeobiology. Memorie 37: 1‚Äì281. . Sinocalliopteryx feeding on Confuciusornis In addition to the dromaeosaurid leg, four irregularly-shaped stones with a diameter between fifteen and twenty millimetres were found in the abdomen, with no similar stones present in any other portions of the skeleton or embedded in the surrounding rock. The authors interpreted these as gastroliths (gizzard stones) similar to those found with Nqwebasaurus and Baryonyx. Other theropods, such as Caudipteryx and a Mongolian ornithomimid, were also found with gastroliths, though in those cases the stones were much more numerous and smaller in size. Ji and colleagues speculated that, since the later two dinosaurs were probably primarily herbivores, the number and size of gastroliths may correspond with diet; that is, herbivores ingested many small stones, while carnivores ingested only a few larger stones to aid in digestion. However, the 2012 study could find no gastroliths with the second specimen and therefore concluded that the stones with the holotype were swallowed by accident. In any case no special gizzard would have been present. The second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also preserves the remains of several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, in front of the lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species. The bone surface of the scapula looked as if it had been etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This again would indicate a high metabolism for Sinocalliopteryx, necessitating a regular food intake. That the second specimen in a short period of time caught two birds, together with the bird feather remains in the holotype stomach, might be an indication that Sinocalliopteryx specialised in such prey. Even the Sinornithosaurus might conform to this pattern as the authors considered it a possibly volant form. In 2011 a specimen of Microraptor was reported with a bird in its stomach and seen as proof that the former were arboreal. The 2012 study denied the relevance of flying prey for this issue as Sinocalliopteryx was in all likelihood cursorial, or ground-dwelling, and yet apparently quite capable of catching birds, e.g. by using stealth attack, a method employed by many modern cursorial predators of fowl.

Georgian cuisine has similarities with Caucasus cuisine. Every region of Georgia has its own distinct style of food preparation. Eating and drinking are important parts of Georgian culture. Georgia was one of the countries on the Silk Road, which resulted in travelers influencing Georgian cuisine. The Georgian love of family and friends is one of the reasons why the supra (tablecloth) is so important in Georgia. Supra is offered spontaneously to relatives, friends or guests. Every supra has its tamada (toastmaster), who gives the toast and entertains the guests.

The bread is leavened and allowed to rise and is shaped in various ways, usually with cheese in the middle and a crust which is ripped off and used to dip in the cheese. The filling contains cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly sulguni), eggs and other ingredients.

Wine  Georgia is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. The fertile valleys and protective slopes of the Transcaucasia were home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production (, …£vino) for at least 8000 years. Due to the many millennia of wine in Georgian history and its prominent economic role, the traditions of wine are considered entwined with and inseparable from the national identity. Among the best-known Georgian wine regions are Kakheti (further divided into the micro-regions of Telavi and Kvareli), Kartli, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Adjara and Abkhazia. UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.Georgian Winemaking Makes UNESCO Protected Heritage List RIA Novosti Alcoholic drinks from Georgia include chacha and wine (especially Georgian wine). Some of the most well-known Georgian wines include Pirosmani, Alazani, Akhasheni, Saperavi, and Kindzmarauli. Wine culture in Georgia dates back thousands of years, and many Georgian wines are made from traditional Georgian grape varieties that are little known in the West, such as Saperavi and Rkatsiteli. Georgian wine is well known throughout Eastern Europe, and is a significant national export, with exports of over 10 million bottles of wine per year. Georgia is also home to many beer brands, including Natakhtari, Kazbegi, Argo, Kasri, and Karva. Lagidze water is a Georgian flavored soda drink, made with a variety of natural syrups, sold bottled or mixed directly in a glass from a soda fountain. Common types of mineral water from Georgia include Borjomi, Nabeghlavi, Likani, and Sairme.

It was formed in 1989. As an organisation maintained entirely by current and former sex workers, Scarlet Alliance aims to achieve equality, social, legal, political, cultural and economic justice for workers in the sex industry. Funding Since its inception, Scarlet Alliance has primarily relied on volunteers to manage the organisation. Despite receiving various funding grants over the last decade and a half, the majority of Scarlet Alliance's work has remained unfunded. The organisation has stated its commitment to aims and objectives, to its membership and the broader sex worker community as always coming first. However, if funding can be sourced towards supporting key areas of this work without compromising political objectives, then it has been sought in order to boost the organisation's capacity as well as to support greater equity and access to events such as the annual national forum. In 2004 Scarlet Alliance was granted government funding to undertake project work in Australia and within the Asia/ Pacific region. This funding came to an end in 2012 when the Australian government allocated a greater amount of \\"foreign aid\\" towards running offshore detention facilities (defunding other projects). Scarlet Alliance also employed two part-time bilingual migrant sex workers (Thai, Chinese and/or Korean) for nine years as part of a successful migration project with Empower Thailand. The project was informed by a steering committee of migrant sex workers across Australia and ensured migrant sex workers were represented in Australia's round table which met to response to trafficking. Aim Scarlet Alliance advocates on behalf of a membership consisting of: * individual sex workers * funded state level sex worker organizations * peer led sex worker projects * unfunded sex worker activist networks * sex worker interest groups The organisation aims to inform and influence the policies of: * state and national governments * primary health care service providing medical services to sex workers * state and federal police * the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) * the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department * political parties * interest groups within the sex industry * regional and international funding bodies Scarlet Alliance aims to promote an increased understanding of sex workers and the issues affecting them. The organisation lobbies for policies which recognize sex workers as self-determining agents, with the option to choose where and how they work. Scarlet Alliance has undertaken campaigns to increase occupational health and safety standards in the sex industry, to recognize the human rights and labour rights of sex workers, and to repeal laws and policies which discriminate against sex workers. Organisation As a national organisation, Scarlet Alliance facilitates an annual membership forum which is attended by sex worker delegates from around Australia. Every year the forum is held in a different state to maximise the inclusion of local sex workers. An Annual General Meeting (AGM) and public symposium or rally are also included within the forum's program. Scarlet Alliance holds training, participates in forums and presents workshops at universities in Australia and within the Asia/ Pacific region. The organisation aims to break down the stigma, negative stereotyping and popular misconceptions surrounding sex work. Advocates from the organisation present evidence based research and information about who sex workers are, what is involved in sex work and why sex workers choose sex work. Scarlet Alliance produces an annual magazine, proVision. The magazine contains information about the organisation's activities, articles exploring current sex work policy issues and contributions from national and international sex workers. In keeping with the principle of community ownership, proVision is produced entirely by sex workers. Scarlet Alliance networks with sister peer led sex worker organisations including: * Friends Frangipani Association in Papua New Guinea * Empower in Thailand * IUSW on the United Kingdom * DMSC in India * Women's Network for Unity in CambodiaWomen's Network for Unity in Cambodia * COSWAS in Taiwan * Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics (COYOTE) in the United States * Ziteng in Hong Kong Scarlet Alliance is a member of the Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers and the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP). Training The Scarlet Alliance National Training and Assessment Program (SANTAP) contains two parts- a learning tool and an assessment framework. The assessment framework offers sex workers the opportunity to have their skills in peer education and community mobilisation formally recognised through recognition of prior learning by peer assessors. On completion of the multi-module assessment process, participants are awarded a nationally recognised diploma. The learning tool provides new or existing sex worker peer educators the required knowledge and grounding to apply for the diploma. The Scarlet Alliance National Training Project (SANTP) is an assessment package consisting of 14 core modules and 4 elective modules. The project provides sex worker peer educators with an assessment tool which formally recognizes the unique skills they utilize in undertaking health promotion and community development work within sex worker communities. Participants in the training project are required to undertake an assessment process, supported by a qualified peer assessor, to achieve a nationally recognized Diploma of Community Education qualification. To successfully achieve the qualification, participants are required to demonstrate and document how they have employed peer education principles in their work with sex workers. Modules in the training project include: * communication * community development * project management * public and community education * working with sex workers The training package was developed as a strategy to assist sex worker organisations and projects to deliver a nationally consistent standard of peer education. Lobbying Scarlet Alliance is a key advocate and participant in HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention work in Australia. Sex worker communities in Australia have high rates of condom use, and low rates of STIs, including HIV/AIDS. The Australian sex industry's low rates of STIs and HIV has been attributed to sex worker communities self organizing to form peer led sex worker advocacy organisations in the early years of the HIV epidemic. Sex worker organisations, including Scarlet Alliance, employed community development principles to educate sex workers, sex industry business owners and sex industry clients about the need to adopt safer sex practices and harm reduction strategies to avoid potentially contracting HIV. Scarlet Alliance continues to lobby state and national governments about the difficulties of effective HIV prevention whilst sex work remains a criminalized occupation. Scarlet Alliance has advocated for the rights of migrant sex workers for more than 15 years, and currently works to assist the Australian government to develop anti-trafficking policy which does not single out the sex industry for \\"raids and rescues\\". Scarlet Alliance advocates for the provision of work visas for migrant sex workers. The organisation argues that through accessing legal migration options, migrant sex workers are less susceptible to entering into verbal \\"debt bondage\\" contracts as an incentive to obtain passage to, and work within, Australia. Scarlet Alliance's objectives, policies and current campaign issues are available on their website.

The website enables consumers to compare prices on a range of insurance and financial products, including car insurance, home insurance and life insurance. History Confused.com launched in 2002, becoming the UK‚Äôs first car insurance comparison site. It is based in Cardiff, Wales, with offices located near the headquarters of the Admiral Group. The Admiral Group floated on the London Stock Exchange in September 2004, and is currently the only FTSE100 listed company headquartered in Wales. Confused.com is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Management Confused.com has undergone a high degree of management churn in recent years. At the top level, founding Managing Director Kate Armstrong, an IT consultant originally from Sydney, retired from the business in 2005, following the successful flotation of the Admiral Group. She was succeeded by Deborah Williams who took the reins from 2005 to 2007. The business underwent expansive growth in this period with profit hitting ¬£36 million in 2007. It was with some degree of surprise therefore that the industry received news of Williams' departure to join a relatively unknown insurance broker. Williams was succeeded by Carlton Hood in the newly created position of CEO. The sector was shaken up by the ground breaking Compare the Market campaign in 2009; Confused.com, along with other established competitors, lost market share. Hood resigned abruptly in 2010 and was succeeded by Group FD Kevin Chidwick as an interim measure. Chidwick remained in place until January 2012 and was succeeded by Admiral Group senior manager Nic Weng Kan followed by Martin Coriat. Coriat was MD of Admiral-owned French comparison site LeLynx.fr until he took up the position of Confused.com CEO in October 2013. In August 2012, Joby Russell stepped into the role of Marketing Director. After overseeing the launch of the 'Brian the Robot' campaign and later toy promotions, Russell left the role in May 2015 to take up the role of CMO at online estate agents Purplebricks.com. In late 2015 Paul Troy was appointed the CMO role at Confused.com. Troy had previously worked for Moneysupermarket between 2011 and 2013 where he created the 'You're so money supermarket' campaign. In September 2017, Louise O'Shea was appointed as CEO of Confused.com taking over from Martin Coriat who himself was appointed as chief executive of Admiral-owned French comparison website LeLynx. O'Shea was promoted to the CEO position from her role as finance director at Confused.com. In May 2018, Confused.com announced the appointment of Sam Day as chief marketing officer, replacing Troy. Awards Confused.com have been recipients of a number of marketing and industry awards: * Winners - Best in house team - 2014 European Search Awards * Winners - Best systems integration (marketing specialist category) - 2013 UK Sitecore site of the year awards * Joint winners - Best financial services site (joint winners with HSBC) in the financial services category - 2013 UK Sitecore site of the year awards * Highly commended - What Mortgage Best comparison site category - 2013/2014 personal finance awards * Winners - Marketing Excellence award (PR category) - 'Driving in heels campaign' - South Wales Chamber of Commerce Marketing Excellence Awards 2013 * Winners - PR award - 'Driving in heels campaign' - Canmol Marketing awards 2012 * Winners - PR award - 'Middle lane hoggers campaign' - PR Moment Awards 2017 *Winners - PPC Best Use of Data - 'Data driving fractional attribution' - The Drum Search Awards 2017 *Winners - Best Financial Services Campaign - 'The true depth of the UK's pothole problem' - The Drum Search Awards 2018 *Winners - Digital and social media campaign of the year - 'The depth of the UK's pothole problem' - PRCA Dare Awards 2018 - SW & Wales Advertising In early years, Confused.com achieved success with a simple, repetitive direct response advertising format, in which a man with a megaphone described what Confused.com was offering. This led to the longest running of Confused.com‚Äôs campaigns, featuring simple cardboard props on a white background, later with a man and later a youth with out megaphones saying they were \\"So confused.com!\\" by the depicted marketplace. In later years as competitors Moneysupermarket.com, Gocompare.com and Comparethemarket.com have entered the market, Confused.com has tried numerous different advertising vehicles. None have emulated the success of the initial campaign and Confused.com has slipped from the position of market leader to being the fourth largest car insurance comparison website in the UK. The popularity of the company's slogan 'Confused.com' rose to prominence after the success of the 2001 campaign. A 2002 study by Webster showed that the slogan was the third most used phrase of the year behind 'Hey you' and 'Naughty Soldier'. Later adverts containing real life testimonials, featuring customers and prolific social media users talking about their experiences while using the website, as well as showcasing the website‚Äôs simplicity by explaining how it works. Adverts in early 2010 focused on the concept of regret and featured members of the public lamenting that they could have purchased something they wanted if they had purchased their car insurance through Confused.com. In September 2010, Confused.com introduced the character of \\"Cara Confused\\" a wild-haired animated version of the original company mascot that was present on the former Confused.com logo. The inspiration for the creation of Cara came from Kate Armstrong, the founder and former managing director of Confused.com. The campaign used the tagline, \\"it pays to be Confused.com\\". In February 2011 an advert started featuring Cara (voiced by West End star Louise Dearman) singing the Diana Ross track \\"Chain Reaction\\". Marketing Director Mike Hoban claimed that this campaign gained Confused.com 2 million customers since launch. On 1 June 2013 a campaign launched featuring a robot named Brian, depicted as being on a mission to help people to \\"save pounds\\". On 24 December 2014, an advert was launched where scrap dealers kidnap Brian. Instead of melting him down straight away, they leave him hanging through the night on a magnet. However, his robot friends at headquarters receive his distress call and go to help him. A couple of weeks later the succeeding advert shows the same five co-robots, known as the Herberts (Chief Herbert, Miss Herbert, Stunt Herbert, Clever Herbert and Baby Herbert), go to help Brian. They stop the incinerator at the last moment, saving Brian and continuing the 'Brian' advertising campaigns after they repair him. In 2015, an advert was launched featuring Brian and the Herberts dancing to \\"Jump on It!\\" promoting the brand new Brian toy available by buying insurance through Confused.com. In early 2016, two more toys were launched, Miss Herbert and Stunt Herbert, with a corresponding campaign showing both characters competing with each other. On 1 August 2016, the adverts featuring the Robots were scrapped in favour of a new advertisement featuring James Corden. On 17 August 2018, following a run of 6 adverts, James Corden was replaced in favour of a new direction and new frontman Timothy Murphy. The advert features Murphy driving a car through a busy mass of confusing messaging and advertising before ending with Murphy driving down a clear road. Sponsorship Confused.com has sponsored programmes on ITV such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Ninja Warrior UK, Sunday Night at the Palladium, Celebrity Squares and Catchphrase and The Simpsons on Sky 1. It also previously sponsored the ITV National Weather. In 2019, along with Land Rover, they were a sponsor of ITV's coverage of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

Its name in medieval times was Saint-Jehan-des-Neiges. The castle dominates the valley of the Lignon and it was built to be an impregnable fortress on the instructions of the Count of Forez.  History  Construction of the fortress began in 1231. The work was carried out by seigneur (Lord) Arnaud de Marcilly to the order of Guy IV du Forez who financed it. The site was covered by forest and almost inaccessible. Initially, it functioned rather as a fortified house, but it was transformed into a genuine medieval fortress, intended to counteract the ambitions of the powerful neighbours of the seigneurie of Couzan, then in the hands of the Damas family, linked to the Germanic emperor. The castle appeared gloomy and severe, with four round towers dominated by a square keep, with no openings on the sides. When Antoine de Marcilly died aged 25 with no direct heirs in 1371, the castle passed to his sister B√©atrix, last of the Marcilly line. She had married Mathieu de Talaru in 1364; thus the seigneurie of Chalmazel passed to the Talarus, an old noble family from the Lyonnais. Following the destruction of the Ch√¢teau de Marcilly, the Talarus withdrew to the castle at Chamazel and, in 1400, they built the ramparts, in the form of a pentagonal enceinte and added machicolations to the keep. After the incorporation of Forez into the Kingdom of France, the Talarus served the king in his armies. During the Renaissance, the Marquis de Talaru, returning from the Italian Wars, added Renaissance style embellishments: openwork facade, galleries to the inner court, painting in the chapel, sculptures. But the winters were harsh, and from 1533, the Talarus preferred to live in their Ch√¢teau d'√âcotay or in Saint-Marcel-de-F√©lines, acquired by marriage in 1559. Chalmazel was transformed into a summer residence and began to be neglected. In the 18th century, the Talarus inherited by marriage the Ch√¢teau de Chamarande, near Arpajon, to the south of Paris, and they moved there to be closer to Versailles where Louis de Talaru held important posts in the royal court and the army. They abandoned the castle in 1650, carrying out only the most urgent work. The castle began a slow but sure deterioration. In 1850, Louis-Justin, last Marquis of Talaru, 25th lord of Chalmazel, peer of France and ambassador, with no heirs, left the castle and the forest to the nuns of the S≈ìurs de Saint-Joseph, in order to establish a hospital for the canton for the care of the sick. The nuns carried out some repair work (roof, round walk, rebuilding a tower) and decoration. Later, they transformed it into a boarding school for children from the school at Chamazel. The nuns finally left the castle in 1972 and rented it to the commune, on condition that it was maintained and opened to the public during the summer months. The castle is now owned by new proprietors who intend to open it to visitors and to create chambres d'h√¥tes (bed and breakfast accommodation).  Tourism  Guest suite with two adjoining bedrooms, shared modern bath and toilet. The castle, with its medieval aspect, has kept the elements of a fortified house from the year 1231, but with all of the later modifications and additions by the Talarus over the centuries: murder-holes, walls, keep, round walk with machicolations - but it also has Renaissance elements: the facade, the inner courtyard, galleries and chapel. The castle is open to visitors from June to September. It is possible to rent rooms and a suite. The Ch√¢teau de Chalmazel is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

In all, he stood in a record 570 County Championship matches and 701 first-class fixtures, a total second only to Chester. His death in 1995 was reported in the local media in the North East, where he had lived for many years, but overlooked in the wider cricketing world. His obituary did not appear in Wisden or The Cricketer until 2003.

She was also the shortest-serving Holy Roman Empress, dying three weeks into her marriage.  Life  Born at Worms in Rhenish Franconia in April or June 1198, Beatrice was the eldest daughter and first child of Duke Philip of Swabia, who during the time of her birth was elected German king (King of the Romans or Rex Francorum according to Salic law), and his wife, the Byzantine princess Irene Angelina. After her father Philip, a younger brother of late Emperor Henry VI, had been elected king on 8 March 1198, her future husband Otto of Brunswick was elected Anti- king of Germany on 9 June.  Struggles for betrothal  Already in 1203, King Philip attempted to betroth Beatrice to the nephew of Pope Innocent III, in order to gain the support of the Roman Curia. However, his plans failed and the rivals continued to fight. In 1207 Philip made an attempt to reconcile with Otto by offering him the hands of his daughter. Though Otto's strategic position had become unfavourable, he did not accept until Philip on 21 June was killed by the Bavarian count palatine Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. Otto of Wittelsbach, who had to dissolve his former engagement with Philip's daughter Kunigunde, had asked for the hand of either Beatrice or one of her three younger sisters in compensation. His request had been denied and he reacted violently. Beatrice was orphaned, when her mother Irene, renamed Maria, fled to Hohenstaufen Castle and died there on 27 August after delivering her youngest child. Otto IV, suspected of being involved in the assassination, had by this point lost the support of his two main allies, Pope Innocent III and King John of England. He had been forced to retire to his hereditary lands near Brunswick in Saxony. However, the murder of Philip left him the only King of Germany. He took advantage to make amends with the remaining members and supporters of the House of Hohenstaufen and finally accepted late Philip's offer. Their new alliance was sealed with the betrothal of Beatrice to Otto IV. On 11 November 1208, Otto IV was again elected King of Germany in Frankfurt. This time he was supported by members of both sides of the previous civil war. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III on 4 October 1209. Beatrice was only eleven years old and remained betrothed to Otto IV, approximately thirty-four years old.  Marriage and death  As the bride was related to the Welf dynasty by her great-grandmother Judith of Bavaria, a papal consent had to be obtained, granted by Pope Innocent III in return for donations to the Cistercian abbeys of Walkenried and Riddagshausen. They were married in Nordhausen on 22 July 1212. The bride then was fourteen years old and the groom about thirty-seven. The marriage with the granddaughter of late Emperor Frederick Barbarossa helped to reinforce Otto's position after Philip's nephew Frederick II, Beatrice's cousin, had been elected anti-king a year before. However, Beatrice soon fell sick and died only nineteen days after the marriage. She was childless at the time of her death. Beatrice was buried in Brunswick Cathedral. A few weeks later, Frederick II arrived in Germany and on 9 December was crowned king in Mainz Cathedral. Otto IV retired six years later in retirement at Harzburg Castle.

Several types of mismatches are possible. For example, a bank that chose to borrow entirely in US dollars and lend in Russian rubles would have a significant currency mismatch: if the value of the ruble were to fall dramatically, the bank would lose money. In extreme cases, such movements in the value of the assets and liabilities could lead to bankruptcy, liquidity problems and wealth transfer. A bank could also have substantial long-term assets (such as fixed-rate mortgages) funded by short-term liabilities, such as deposits. If short-term interest rates rise, the short-term liabilities re-price at maturity, while the yield on the longer-term, fixed-rate assets remains unchanged. Income from the longer-term assets remains unchanged, while the cost of the newly re- priced liabilities funding these assets increases. This is sometimes called a maturity mismatch, which can be measured by the duration gap. An interest rate mismatch occurs when a bank borrows at one interest rate but lends at another. For example, a bank might borrow money by issuing floating interest rate bonds, but lend money with fixed-rate mortgages. If interest rates rise, the bank must increase the interest it pays to its bondholders, even though the interest it earns on its mortgages has not increased. Mismatches are handled by asset liability management. Asset‚Äìliability mismatches are important to insurance companies and various pension plans, which may have long-term liabilities (promises to pay the insured or pension plan participants) that must be backed by assets. Choosing assets that are appropriately matched to their financial obligations is therefore an important part of their long-term strategy. Few companies or financial institutions have perfect matches between their assets and liabilities. In particular, the mismatch between the maturities of banks' deposits and loans makes banks susceptible to bank runs. On the other hand, 'controlled' mismatch, such as between short-term deposits and somewhat longer-term, higher-interest loans to customers is central to many financial institutions' business model. Asset‚Äìliability mismatches can be controlled, mitigated or hedged.

She won five medals at the FIBT World Championships, competed in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and won the silver medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. 2014 Winter Olympics Career Pikus-Pace won the women's Skeleton World Cup overall title in 2004‚Äì05. After winning the silver medal in the women's skeleton event at the 2005 FIBT World Championships in Calgary, Pikus-Pace emerged as one of the favorites to medal at the upcoming Winter Olympics in Turin. Her medal ambitions would be dashed on October 19, 2005 at the Canada Olympic Park bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Calgary when her right leg was broken by a four-man bobsleigh that failed to brake at the finish line. The bobsleigh ejected out of the end of the track and hit Pikus-Pace and teammate Lea Ann Parsley, narrowly missing three other team members. Pikus-Pace underwent surgery to repair her broken leg, which included an insertion of a titanium rod into her leg. She would return to competition seven weeks later at Igls, Austria, finishing 20th. She would chronicle her comeback from the 2005 freak accident which prevented her participation in Turin. This story was told in the critically acclaimed documentary 114 Days: The Race to Save a Dream. The US Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation petitioned to both the FIBT and the IOC to include Pikus-Pace in the women's skeleton competition, but to no avail. The only American representative in women's skeleton was Katie Uhlaender who finished sixth. Pikus-Pace, who at the time was six weeks pregnant, announced on October 3, 2007 that she would take the 2007‚Äì08 Skeleton World Cup off to give birth to her baby. She finished fifth in the 2008-09 Skeleton World Cup season opener in Winterberg, Germany on November 28, 2008. It was announced on January 17, 2010 that Pikus-Pace had qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics. She competed in the 2010 Games, finishing in fourth place, with a sled designed by her husband after two of her other sleds had been damaged. The first sled had been damaged by the runaway bobsled in Calgary and her second sled was damaged during transport to the FIBT World Championships 2009 in Lake Placid, New York. Pikus-Pace's husband, a project manager of a metal fabrication company in South Salt Lake, Utah, designed a skeleton sled in accordance to FIBT regulations to allow her to race. Retirement and return to skeleton Pikus-Pace retired after the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics. She announced her intention to come out of retirement in the summer of 2012 with the intent of qualifying for the 2014 Winter Olympics. On January 11, 2013, Pikus-Pace placed first in her event at the K√∂nigssee, Germany track. This win was her first on the World Cup level since 2004. She would build upon this breakthrough by helping Team USA-1 win gold in the team event at the FIBT World Championships 2013 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Her 1:08:92 time vaulted the team into the lead and was 0.84 seconds quicker than the other competitors who sleighed her leg of the event. Pikus-Pace would then go on to win silver in the women's event. She closed the 2012/13 FIBT World Cup season with a win in Sochi. On January 18, 2014, Pikus-Pace was named to the 2014 Olympic team. On February 14, 2014, Pikus-Pace won her first Olympic medal, a silver, coming full circle and completing her comeback before retiring for good. Personal life Pikus-Pace is the youngest of the eight children in her family. She married her husband, Janson Pace, in 2002. The couple welcomed their first child, daughter Lacee Lynne Pace, on January 19, 2008. They also have a son named Traycen. In an interview on NBC on February 14, 2014 after winning the silver medal in the Olympics in Sochi, she revealed that she had a miscarriage at 18 weeks while carrying her third child. Pikus- Pace said the pain of this loss and her difficulties coping with it caused her husband to encourage her to get back into the sport and compete in skeleton again. In July 2015 she gave birth to twins Payton and Makai. She is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Throughout the Olympics in Sochi, she wore a medallion she earned from the young woman program of the church. ReferencesExternal links  * . November 28, 2008. Accessed November 29, 2008.

From left to right, Sniff, Snufkin, Moominpappa, Moominmamma, Moomintroll (Moomin), Mymble, Groke, Snork Maiden and Hattifatteners. A large number of characters appear in the Moomin series by Tove Jansson. The original Swedish names are given with the etymologies and word associations suggested by Yvonne Bertills in her 2003 dissertation.Yvonne Bertills, Beyond Identification: Proper Names in Children's Literature, 2003, dissertation for √Öbo Akademi University  The Moomin family  Moominmamma and Moominpappa Moomintroll Moomintroll ( ‚Äì invented mumin + troll, \\"troll\\"; also simply Moomin) is the protagonist of most of the books. Many people believe that Moomin is in love with Snorkmaiden, as they have a very sweet and romantic relationship in the early books. However, later on he and Snorkmaiden are not seen together as often and after ‚ÄòMoominland Midwinter‚Äô Moomin refers to Snorkmaiden as simply just a friend. His best friend is Snufkin. Snufkin is inspired by Atos Wirtanen, Tove Jansson‚Äôs close-friend and at one point, fianc√©. Moomintroll is also an author avatar for Jansson, meaning the two characters were based on real-life lovers. In the cartoon strip he finds himself beset by endless problems. He is a \\"moomin\\" ‚Äì a little white troll with a hippopotamus-like big round snout. Moomintroll was initially called \\"snork\\". Jansson described him as her alter ego. The character has a mostly positive reception from critics. The asteroid 58345 Moomintroll was named in his honor. Moominmamma Moominmamma ( ) ‚Äì the mother of Moomintroll. She is almost never without her handbag, which contains essentials like woolly socks, tummy powder, and bark. She makes bark boats every summer, and the first one goes to her favorite. Moominpappa Moominpappa () ‚Äì orphaned in his younger years, he is a somewhat restless soul who left the orphanage to venture out into the world in his youth but has now settled down. He usually wears a black top-hat.  Close friends  Sniff in Moomin World theme park, Naantali, Finland. Sniff ( ‚Äì sniffa, \\"to snuff/sob; to sniff\\") ‚Äì Moomintroll's immature friend. He is one of the few characters who is interested in money, and is always on the lookout for another way to get rich quick. Snufkin ( ‚Äì dialectical snusmumrik or mumrik, \\"old man who talks carelessly; old codger, old bore; old snuff-taker; snotty or scruffy old man,\\" derived from snus, \\"snuff,\\" + interjection mum, also in mumla \\"mumble,\\" with pejorative ending -ik) ‚Äì Moomintroll's best friend, the son of the elder Mymble and the Joxter, and half-brother to the Mymble's daughter and Little My. Snufkin wears old green clothes and a wide- brimmed hat that he has had since birth. He lives in a tent, smokes a pipe, and plays the harmonica. He is based on Tove Jansson's close friend Atos Wirtanen.Anne Laitinen: Muumit ensimm√§isen√§ lehten√§ julkaissut Ny Tid palkittiin (Turun Sanomat 7.11.2006) He lives a nomadic lifestyle, only staying in Moominvalley in the spring and summer, but leaving for warmer climates down south every winter. The character has a mostly positive reception. The Mymble's Daughter () ‚Äì later known as simply The Mymble (Mymlan), she is the oldest of Mymble's many children. Every bit as independent as her youngest sibling, little My, Mymble's daughter is very proud of being the oldest sibling, and considers it her duty to raise Little My. Little My ( ‚Äì my, \\"micron, mu\\") ‚Äì She is a small, determined and fiercely independent Mymble. When she wants something done, she does it straight away. She is very aggressive and totally disrespectful, but can be a good friend. She is Snufkin's half-sister. Snork Maiden ( ‚Äì snorkig, \\"snooty, snotty\\"; fr√∂ken, \\"Miss\\") ‚Äì Moomintroll's fair lady friend and admirer. She does fall in love with others sometimes, but returns to Moomintroll before things get too serious. She has blonde hair and sports a golden anklet. She changes color according to her mood, with her baseline color in the books described as pale yellow. Snorks are almost identical to Moomins except that Snorks come in different colors (Moomins are white) and have hair on their heads, and their fur changes color depending on their mood. Snorkmaiden is known as Floren in the Japanese dub of the 1990s animated series. Snork () ‚Äì The Snork Maiden's older brother, also friends with Moomintroll. He and his sister first meet Moomintroll in Comet in Moominland. After that he appears only in Finn Family Moomintroll. He is described as mauve in colour, though changes to a pale green when frightened. His character is obsessive over details, rules, and protocol in the books. In the Japanese TV series, he is described as an avid inventor who has strong belief in the power of science and an obsession with building a flying vehicle.  Other characters  Hemulen in Moomin World theme park, Naantali, Finland. The Groke ( ‚Äì morra \\"to growl; to grumble\\") ‚Äì She is cold and ghostlike, and represents loneliness and all that is scary in the world of Moomin. She seeks warmth and fire, but is unable to do anything but to put them out. She has a scary appearance and is dangerous to approach due to the cold that she radiates, and yet, she is not truly evil, just very lonely. Makes first appearance in Finn Family Moomintroll and returns in Moominland Midwinter and Moominpappa at Sea. The Groke is used for an exclamation, often like the word 'Lord' (\\"The Groke knows‚Ä¶\\"). She is the only character whom Little My is genuinely afraid of. In the Japanese dub of the Japanese TV series, she is referred to as Morran. Hemulens ( ‚Äì hemul, a legal term, \\"authority or warrant for something (n.), entitled (adj.)\\") (In Swedish \\"Hemulen\\" means \\"the hemul\\") ‚Äì Hemulens feature frequently in the books. One of them is an avid stamp collector, and another is an avid skier. A female Hemulen raised Moominpappa in an orphanage, and later Moominpappa met her aunt, who looked confusingly like her. Other characters frequently find the Hemulens annoying or overwhelming, as they can be somewhat loud, bossy, abrasive and insensitive, but they are well-intentioned and usually have other redeeming qualities. In the beginning of Finn Family Moomintroll, a hemulen who is a keen stamp collector is depressed, as he has every stamp on the face of earth and has lost his purpose in life. Later on, he finds a new purpose: to collect plants. In Finn Family Moomintroll, \\"un-Hemulenish\\" (ohemul) contains a sense of \\"unwarranted, unjustified\\". Hattifatteners Hattifatteners ( ‚Äì with the first element compare hatta, \\"dither\\", or in reference to Moominpappa's hat, with -i indicating smallness; the second element is related to fnatta (omkring), \\"flutter around\\"; f√• fnatt, \\"go crazy or get excited over something\\"; poss. fnatt, \\"squirrel\\") ‚Äì Small white ghost-like creatures that resemble worn socks. Hattifatteners are always on the move and travel the sea in large groups (but always in odd numbers), such as boat convoys. They meet every year on a lonely island. Their only goal in life is to reach the horizon. They may communicate using telepathy. The Hattifatteners cannot see very well, but their sense of touch is very strong, and they can feel ground vibrations and electricity. Hattifatteners assemble once a year when they \\"recharge\\" in a thunderstorm, when they can cause electrical burns. Hattifatteners grow from seeds, but only if this seed is sown on Midsummer Eve. Too-Ticky () ‚Äì A friend of the family, craftsman and practical philosopher. Has her first appearance in the novel Moominland Midwinter and returns in the short stories of Tales from Moominvalley and in comics. The character and the name are modelled after Tuulikki Pietil√§, Tove Jansson's life partner. The Mymbles ( ‚Äì mymla, a slang word used in Tove Jansson's circle, with the meaning \\"to love\\";Bertills 2003, p. 126 compare mumla, \\"to mumble\\";Bertills 2003, p. 132) ‚Äì \\"The Mymble\\" is a description given to two different characters. In The Exploits of Moominpappa there is a matriarchal character known as \\"The Mymble\\". She is the mother of a very large and unspecified number of children, including Little My, Snufkin, and a girl referred to simply as \\"the Mymble's Daughter\\", who appears to be the eldest of the Mymble's children, and helps her mother with child care for her younger brothers and sisters. In later books and in the comic strips the Mymble's Daughter comes to be known as just \\"The Mymble\\". She appears again as a relatively minor character in Moominsummer Madness, Moominland Midwinter and the comic strips, and is a significant character in Moominvalley in November and in The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My.The Moomin Trove: The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My The Police Inspector (Swedish: Polism√§staren) a by-the-book Hemulen in charge of law enforcement in the valley. He has a crush on Mymble. Fillyjonk at Moominworld Fillyjonk ( ‚Äì no semantic meaning, but with the first element compare filibuffare \\"joker\\", filidera, \\"make bad noise\\", and with the second, fjompa/fjanta/fjolla + -an = \\"silly/foolish/fussy woman\\") ‚Äì Known as The Fillyjonk in some English translations, the first we hear of is the late theatre director in Moominsummer Madness (the Rat is his widow) and the young Fillyjonk who joins the Snork Maiden in the late night jaunt to the wishing well. Later we meet the wonderful psychological study of the \\"Fillyjonk Who Believed In Disasters\\" in Tales from Moominvalley. Not a single moment of fantasy or joy, only duties and discipline; she is an extremely methodical person tied down with principles and has a deep rooted belief in prestige and tradition. Nevertheless, after a catastrophe, The Fillyjonk can be freed from the trammels of social expectation and can discover the joys of freedom, irrationality and self-expression. Deep inside she has had a wish to live freely as the Moomin family does, without any worries. Fillyjonks resemble humanoid rodents; they are tall and thin, with long muzzles and raccoon-like rings around their eyes. Ninny (Swedish ‚Äì a real female first name, mostly used as a nickname, e.g. for Anna) ‚Äì Ninny first appears in Tales from Moominvalley in the story \\"The Invisible Child\\". She turned invisible by being frightened too much by her former caretaker. This caretaker gave Ninny to Too- ticky, who then brought her to Moominmama to help make Ninny visible again. Moominmamma succeeds with one of her granny's 'Infallible Household Remedies' and lots of love. Ninny at first is a bore and doesn't know how to play games or have fun. She becomes completely visible during a day on the beach. Moominpappa plans on sneaking up and scaring Moominmamma, but Ninny rushes up behind and shoves Moominpappa into the sea.

When referring to persons, it is slightly depreciatory, used especially for inferior, sick, incompetent or weak persons (the noun often denotes older persons: skr√∂plig gubbe, \\"weak old man\\"). But the noun is also used for small beings with supernatural characteristics, particularly in fairy tales. Toffle's love- object in Who Will Comfort Toffle?

Moomintroll himself is changed into a strange creature by the hat when he uses it to hide in during a game. The hat also changes the Moominhouse into a sort of jungle. The Hobgoblin has a quite intimidating appearance, but is friendly.

'Mot nutch,' said Bob\\", in the English translation) and are pursued by the Groke who wants the contents. They upset Moominmamma by stealing her handbag. They eventually return it and the whole family throws a party to celebrate. The Hobgoblin arrives when Thingumy and Bob open the suitcase, exposing the King's Ruby for all to see.

Perhaps he was Galician. Cardinal, and canon lawyer. He became a papal legate and leader of the Fifth Crusade. His early life is little known. It is repeatedly claimed that he entered the Order of Benedictines but this is not proven.According to Maleczek,p. 166, the theory that he was Benedictine is based only on the fact that he died at Montecassino, and, therefore, his death has been recorded in the necrology of the abbey. Pope Innocent III created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Lucia in Septisolio around 1206.S. Miranda places his promotion in 1205. Maleczek, p. 290 and 385, says that he was possibly created in the great consistory celebrated on 27 May 1206 but that the first documentary certification of his cardinalate is dated May 4, 1207. In any case, he was created no later than in the spring of 1207. Later, he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal-Priest of S. Cecilia (probably on 2 April 1211Maleczek, p. 290), and finally opted for the suburbicarian see of Albano in the spring of 1213. He subscribed the papal bulls between 4 May 1207 and 26 January 1230. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople in 1213.Maleczek, p. 167 During this two-year mission he attempted to close Orthodox churches and imprison the clergy, but this caused such domestic upset that Henry of Flanders, the Latin Emperor, reversed his actions which had caused the \\"tempest which held the city of Constantine in its grip\\", as noted a contemporary historian.George Akropolites, p. 155. Three years later he was elected Latin Patriarch of Antioch but his election was not ratified by the Holy See. Dispatched by Pope Honorius III to lead the Fifth Crusade at Damietta in Egypt, he made a poor strategic decision in turning down peace offers made by Al-Kamil. He became dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals at the election to the papacy of Cardinal Ugolino Conti (Pope Gregory IX) on 19 March 1227.He was Cardinal-Bishop next to Ugolino Conti in the order of seniority.

Prince Regent was built at the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada and launched on 14 April 1814. Rated as a fourth-rate frigate, Prince Regent took part in the Raid on Fort Oswego in 1814. Following the War of 1812 the frigate was renamed HMS Kingston on 9 December 1814. In 1817, the vessel was placed in reserve following the Rush- Bagot Treaty that demilitarized all the lakes along the United States-Canada border. Discarded in 1832, the vessel found no buyer and sank in Deadman Bay off Kingston after 1832. Description Prince Regent, rated by the Royal Navy as a fourth-rate frigate, measured 1,293 tons burthen and was long at the keel and overall. Prince Regent was of similar design to and , constructed in 1813, and was the first frigate to ever be constructed on inland waters. The vessel had a beam of and a maximum draught of . The frigate's depth of hold was . A full-rigged ship, Prince Regent was armed with twenty-eight long guns on the lower deck and four carronades and twenty-four long guns on the upper deck at launch. By 1830, the armament had changed, with thirty 24-pounder long guns on the lower deck and two 24-pounder long guns, six 68-pounder carronades and twenty-two 32-pounder carronades on the upper deck. Prince Regent had a complement of 280. Service history In September 1813, the commander-in- chief of British North America, Sir George Prevost approved further construction which was initially set to a brig, but was later revised to two frigates. This was in response to new vessels under construction by the Americans. By the third week of October 1813, work began on the second frigate. The design of the vessel is in dispute, with Malcomson stating that Patrick Fleming was the designer, with Master Shipwrights George Record and John Goudie sharing responsibility for construction, while Winfield states that it was Record who was named the designer though it was probably Goudie who actually designed the vessel while Patrick Fleming, Goudie's foreman, was responsible for the frigate's construction. The frigate was constructed at Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada. The construction of the vessel did result in the resignation of George Record, who was the master shipwright at Kingston and the frigate was built under private contract. Shortages of men and material at the shipyard led to construction delays. By January 1814, the frigate was completely planked and by February, had been caulked. Prince Regent was launched on 14 April 1814, a half hour after , the other frigate under construction. Prince Regent was made the flagship of Commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo's British squadron on Lake Ontario. Commander Richard O'Connor was advanced to the rank of post-captain and made Yeo's flag captain aboard Prince Regent. The squadron departed Kingston on 4 May with infantry and Royal Marines embarked for an attack on Fort Oswego. The squadron arrived on 5 May with the attack commencing at 06:00 on 6 May. O'Connor was in charge of the landing operation, getting the infantry into the bateaux and gunboats and to the shore. The town and fort were captured by the British late in the day. The British looted the town and returned to Kingston with their captured goods. On 11 May, the squadron set out again, this time along the southern shore of Lake Ontario. On 19 May, Yeo put the naval blockade of Sackett's Harbor in place, pinning the American squadron under Commodore Issac Chauncey within their main naval base. Prince Regent was stationed of Stony Island. On 29 May, a British force that had been detached from Yeo's squadron, commanded by two of the squadron's captains and the majority of the crews of Montreal and Niagara, was defeated and captured at Sandy Creek. This significantly weakened the squadron. Yeo lifted the blockade on 5 June and returned to Kingston. The resulting command shuffle led to Captain Frederick Hickey taking over Prince Regent and becoming Yeo's flag captain. Following the disaster at Sandy Creek, the majority of the squadron, including Prince Regent, remained in Kingston's harbour for the remainder of the summer. The arrival of the first-rate, on Lake Ontario led to another round of command changes. St Lawrence immediately became the new flagship, and Captain Hickey transferred to the new ship. Captain Henry Davies took command of Prince Regent, which came into effect on 1 October. On 16 October, the squadron sailed again with infantry reinforcements for Niagara embarked. On 19 October, while in transit to Niagara, Prince Regent was hit by lightning. The following day, the squadron arrived and began the disembarkation. St Lawrences arrival led Chauncey withdrawing his squadron to Sackett's Harbor and never returned in force to Lake Ontario for the rest of the war. On 1 November, Prince Regent sailed as escort to a convoy transporting infantry reinforcements to Fort George. The vessel then sailed to York, Upper Canada to embark troops returning to Kingston. Following the war, on 9 December 1814, the frigate was renamed Kingston. In January 1816, command of Kingston was given to Captain Sir Robert Hall. In 1817, Kingston was paid off into the ordinary as a result of the Rush-Bagot Treaty which demilitarized the Great Lakes. The vessel was ordered to be sold in January 1832. However, no buyers were found and the vessel sank in Deadman Bay in the mid-1830s. The wrecksite, along with those of St Lawrence and Princess Charlotte were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2015.

The valley runs for a length of from northwest to southeast, cutting through the city of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A string of towns and villages lie along the valley, including Uyaynah, Irqah and Diriyah. The historical city of Riyadh itself is on the northeastern side of the wadi, but the city has now expanded across Wadi Hanifa, with the sub-municipalities of Al-Shifa and Al-Urayja on its southwestern side.  History  In ancient times, the wadi was known as al-Irdh (). Its current name is derived from that of the Banu Hanifa, the principal Arab tribe in the area at the time of the Islamic conquest of Arabia. In pre-historic times, rain fell heavily in the region. This is reflected in the local folk tradition that claims that during the reign of the ancient kingdom of Al-Yamamah, the area was once covered with oases and fertile farmland. God became angry and visited a plague of locusts and drought that the land never recovered from. Modern climate studies would likely show that the local catastrophe was actually the effect of global climate changes. Ongoing and future changes could bring higher precipitation levels back to the region.  Climate  Temperatures in summer reach an average of , and precipitation averages only per year in the driest places. Rain falls with great intensity for short periods, causing flash floods. The nature of the dry, warm climate leads to a high percentage of the scarce rainfall being instantly evaporated. That which remains mostly ends up as groundwater. While abundant, the levels of the water table are being tested by the rapid growth the city of Riyadh has seen in the past fifty years, from a population of 150,000 in 1960 to an estimated 5 million today.  Development  Al-Elb Dam in Diriya Riyadh. It is a part of Wadi Haneefa Project. 2015 While the wadi has traditionally been dry except for during times of flooding, the construction of Riyadh's first large sewage treatment facility in 1982 has channelled of runoff downstream daily, creating a constantly expanding area of small lakes south of Riyadh. A new green corridor nearly 100 kilometers long has been formed. The Saudi government and the Ar-Riyad Development Authority appointed Buro Happold and Moriyama & Teshima architects to plan the preservation of the wetlands of the Wadi Hanifa, as they had become a popular destination for recreational activities such as fishing and picnicking and have also become a stop for migratory birds. The government has invested over $100 million (US) into an environmental rehabilitation project. This includes the construction of dams to regulate water flow, new limits on land use such as the banning of such commercial activities as quarrying and the planting of reeds to further purify the treated and untreated sewage. The completed project won the 2010 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The increase in surface water has led to widespread date palm cultivation along the banks of the wadi. The treated water is given free of charge from the government to farmers which has led to much higher yields. More importantly for the economy, the government uses much of the water to run one of the largest oil refineries in the country. The city of Riyadh also pumps a portion back into the city to irrigate its public gardens and parks.

The prince, who studied at the √âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in France, and travelled to the United States in 1925, was greatly enamoured of the Art Deco movement.

Although many of the interiors were designed according to plans submitted by Henri Rapin, the main architect of the building itself is credited as Gondo Yukichi of the Works Bureau of the Imperial Household Ministry. After World War II the building served as the official residence of the Prime Minister (1947‚Äì50), and as a State Guest House (1950‚Äì74).

Family Maria was the eldest daughter of Duke Henry I of Brabant and his consort Maud of Boulogne. First marriage Maria was betrothed to King Otto IV already in 1198, while he fought for the German throne against rivalling Philip of Swabia. Her father, Duke Henry I, had initially supported the claims of the Welf dynasty, but then adopted a hesitant position. When he changed to the Hohenstaufen side in 1204, the planned marriage seemed obsolete. After Philip of Swabia was assassinated in 1208, Otto IV became undisputed King of the Romans and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III in 1209. Duke Henry of Brabant rushed to reconcile with the Welf ruler, who soon after his coronation, however, steered into conflict with the Pope over the Kingdom of Sicily, then ruled by the young Hohenstaufen prince Frederick II, nephew of the late Philip of Swabia. Otto was excommunicated by his former ally Pope Innocent and had to face the election of Frederick as anti-king in September 1211. One year later, he demonstratively married Beatrice of Swabia, daughter of the late King Philip and Frederick's paternal first cousin. Marriage of Maria and Otto IV, from a 15th century manuscript of the Brabantsche Yeesten by Jan van Boendale. Not until Beatrice's death a few weeks later, the previous engagement with Maria of Brabant once again became significant. At the time Otto was already engaged in a war against rival king Frederick II. While several Hohenstaufen loyalists had initially supported Emperor Otto because of his marriage with Beatrice, most had transferred their allegiance to Frederick II by this point. Crowned king by Archbishop Siegfried II of Mainz in December 1212, Frederick's rise continued and Otto was under increasing pressure. He and Maria of Brabant got married on 19 May 1214 in Maastricht. She was about twenty-four years old and her husband approximately thirty-nine. In view of the ongoing conflict between Welfs and Hohenstaufens, Maria was Empress of a divided Holy Roman Empire. Her husband's rule came to an end, when Frederick forged an alliance with King Philip II of France and provoked Otto to enter into the Anglo-French War. On 27 July 1214, the Imperial army was decisively defeated in the Battle of Bouvines and forced to retreat. King Philip II sent the captured Imperial Reichsadler standard to Frederick. With his forces decimated and having lost supporters to both death and defection, Otto was forced to withdraw to his Welf estates around Brunswick in Saxony with his wife. Otto IV & Maria of Brabant Otto was effectively deposed on 5 July 1215 and Frederick again crowned King of Germany on July 25, unopposed this time. Pope Innocent III, who had previously crowned Otto, acknowledged Frederick's rule as emperor-to- be during the Fourth Council of the Lateran in November. Maria joined her husband in his retirement. Resigned and seriously ill, Otto died at Harzburg castle on 19 May 1218. There were no children from their marriage. Second marriage Maria remained a widow for about two years. In July, 1220, she married her second husband Count William I of Holland. Nevertheless, William died just two years later, on 4 February 1222. He was survived by at least five children. Genealogists believe all five were born by his first wife Adelaide of Guelders. However, there is some uncertainty on their dates of birth. Maria survived her second husband by thirty-eight years, but never remarried. In her later years, she again adopted the title of a Holy Roman Empress, establishing a Cistercian monastery at Binderen, Brabant (today part of Helmond). She is buried in St. Peter's Church, Leuven.

His most well-known work is the award winning stage play Remember Ronald Ryan, a dramatization of the life and subsequent death of Ronald Ryan, the last man executed in Australia. He has also written dramas and comedies about other controversial figures such as poet Sylvia Plath, opera singer Joan Sutherland, criminal Squizzy Taylor, actor Frank Thring, playwright Oscar Wilde and artist Brett Whiteley. reprinted from Dickins primarily writes for Australia's independent theatre scene, frequently collaborating with La Mama Theatre, Malthouse Theatre, The Pram Factory, Griffin Theatre Company, fortyfivedownstairs and St Martin Youth Theatre. Biography Dickins was born in the Melbourne suburb of Reservoir. Leaving school early he worked for five years in a factory in North Melbourne, and then as a set-painter for television programs being produced at Channel 7. Through his association with La Mama Theatre, his first play, a translation of Ibsen's Ghosts, was performed in 1974. He has written a further 50 since then, along with numerous short stories, biographies, opinion pieces, essays and children's books. His play Remember Ronald Ryan won him the 1995 Victorian Premier's Literary Award. He has also had a long career as an educator, spending 41 years teaching English and creative writing at various schools in Melbourne (including Scotch College, Melbourne Grammar and West Preston Primary School). His experiences in the classroom served the basis for his 2013 memoirs, Lessons in Humility: 40 years of teaching. Dickins has made numerous appearances on the stage and on the screen. His first acting role was in Barry Oakley's The Ship's Whistles, which was staged in 1978 at the Pram Factory Front Theatre, under the direction of Paul Hampton. Since then he has appeared in: Paul Cox's Man of Flowers (1983); James Clayden's With Time to Kill (1987); Brian McKenzie's With Love to the Person Next to Me (1987); Paul Cox's The Gift (1988; Paul Cox's Golden Braid (1990) (which Dickins also co-wrote); Brian McKenzie's People Who Still Use Milk Bottles (1990); Frank Howson's Flynn (1993); and Elise McCredie's Strange Fits of Passion (1999). He also had guest roles on the television shows Winners (1985) and Wedlocked (1995) In 1985, he appeared in a revival of Graeme Blundell's Balmain Boys Don't Cry (renamed The Balmain Boys) at the Kinsela's Cabaret Theatre in Darlinghurst, New South Wales. His most recent stage performance was recent a dramatic reading of the monologue, Ryan (a continuation of his earlier work Remember Ronald Ryan), which was performed as part of a QandA event held at Melbourne based bookshop, Collected Works. In 2009, he published his memoirs Unparalleled Sorrow, which discusses his career and his battle with depression./ 2015 saw the publication by Black Pepper publishing of A Line Drawing of My Father, a memoir of the authors' father Len Dickins who served in the Second World War and was a commercial printer thereafter. It also gives a portrait of the working class northern suburbs of Melbourne. In 2015, Dickins became a Writer-in-Residence and Creative Writing lecturer at Victoria University in Footscray, Melbourne. He held the position for less than 12 months, before being unexpectedly let go by the campus coordinators during the Christmas break. In June 2017 Dickins was found guilty of making a false police report after claiming officers had conducted an improper strip search upon him. The Magistrate remarked of Dickins' report \\"for reasons which I truly cannot fathom, Mr Dickins invented a set of facts, which were not true and, in my view, he knew them not to be true\\". For this Dickins was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded. His then employer, The Sunday Age, was later found to have breached Australian Press Council principles in light of their publication of Dickens' account of the alleged police misconduct.

In order to understand porosity better a series of equations have been used to express the quantitative interactions between the three phases of soil. Macropores or fractures play a major role in infiltration rates in many soils as well as preferential flow patterns, hydraulic conductivity and evapotranspiration. Cracks are also very influential in gas exchange, influencing respiration within soils. Modeling cracks therefore helps understand how these processes work and what the effects of changes in soil cracking such as compaction, can have on these processes. The pore space of soil may contain the habitat of plants (rhizosphere) and microorganisms. Background=Bulk density \\\\rho = \\\\frac{M_s}{V_t} The bulk density of soil depends greatly on the mineral make up of soil and the degree of compaction. The density of quartz is around 2.65 g/cm3 but the bulk density of a soil may be less than half that density. Most soils have a bulk density between 1.0 and 1.6 g/cm3 but organic soil and some friable clay may have a bulk density well below 1 g/cm3. Core samples are taken by driving a metal core into the earth at the desired depth and soil horizon. The samples are then oven dried and weighed. Bulk density = (mass of oven dry soil)/volume The bulk density of soil is inversely related to the porosity of the same soil. The more pore space in a soil the lower the value for bulk density. Porosity f = \\\\frac{V_f}{V_t} or f = \\\\frac{V_a+V_w}{V_s+V_a+V_w} Porosity is a measure of the total pore space in the soil. This is measured as a volume or percent. The amount of porosity in a soil depends on the minerals that make up the soil and the amount of sorting that occurs within the soil structure. For example, a sandy soil will have larger porosity than silty sand, because the silt will fill in the gaps between the sand particles. Pore space relations=Hydraulic conductivity Hydraulic conductivity (K) is a property of soil that describes the ease with which water can move through pore spaces. It depends on the permeability of the material (pores, compaction) and on the degree of saturation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ksat, describes water movement through saturated media. Where hydraulic conductivity has the capability to be measured at any state. It can be estimated by numerous kinds of equipment. To calculate hydraulic conductivity, Darcy's law is used. The manipulation of the law depends on the soil saturation and instrument used. Infiltration Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil. The water enters the soil through the pores by the forces of gravity and capillary action. The largest cracks and pores offer a great reservoir for the initial flush of water. This allows a rapid infiltration. The smaller pores take longer to fill and rely on capillary forces as well as gravity. The smaller pores have a slower infiltration as the soil becomes more saturated{{dndate=February 2020). Pore types A pore is not simply a void in the solid structure of soil. The various pore size categories have different characteristics and contribute different attributes to soils depending on the number and frequency of each type. A widely used classification of pore size is that of Brewer (1964): Macropore The pores that are too large to have any significant capillary force. Unless impeded, water will drain from these pores, and they are generally air-filled at field capacity. Macropores can be caused by cracking, division of peds and aggregates, as well as plant roots, and zoological exploration. Size >75 Œºm. Mesopore The largest pores filled with water at field capacity. Also known as storage pores because of the ability to store water useful to plants. They do not have capillary forces too great so that the water does not become limiting to the plants. The properties of mesopores are highly studied by soil scientists because of their impact on agriculture and irrigation. Size 30‚Äì75 Œºm. Micropore These are \\"pores that are sufficiently small that water within these pores is considered immobile, but available for plant extraction.\\" Because there is little movement of water in these pores, solute movement is mainly by the process of diffusion. Size 5‚Äì30 Œºm. Ultramicropore These pores are suitable for habitation by microorganisms. Their distribution is determined by soil texture and soil organic matter, and they are not greatly affected by compaction Size 0.1‚Äì5 Œºm. Cryptopore Pores that are too small to be penetrated by most microorganisms. Organic matter in these pores is therefore protected from microbial decomposition. They are filled with water unless the soil is very dry, but little of this water is available to plants, and water movement is very slow. Size <0.1 Œºm. Modeling methods Basic crack modeling has been undertaken for many years by simple observations and measurements of crack size, distribution, continuity and depth. These observations have either been surface observation or done on profiles in pits. Hand tracing and measurement of crack patterns on paper was one method used prior to advances in modern technology. Another field method was with the use of string and a semicircle of wire. The semi circle was moved along alternating sides of a string line. The cracks within the semicircle were measured for width, length and depth using a ruler. The crack distribution was calculated using the principle of Buffon's needle. Disc permeameter This method relies on the fact that crack sizes have a range of different water potentials. At zero water potential at the soil surface an estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity is produced, with all pores filled with water. As the potential is decreased progressively larger cracks drain. By measuring at the hydraulic conductivity at a range of negative potentials, the pore size distribution can be determined. While this is not a physical model of the cracks, it does give an indication to the sizes of pores within the soil. Horgan and Young model Horgan and Young (2000) produced a computer model to create a two-dimensional prediction of surface crack formation. It used the fact that once cracks come within a certain distance of one another they tend to be attracted to each other. Cracks also tend to turn within a particular range of angles and at some stage a surface aggregate gets to a size that no more cracking will occur. These are often characteristic of a soil and can therefore be measured in the field and used in the model. However it was not able to predict the points at which cracking starts and although random in the formation of crack pattern, in many ways, cracking of soil is often not random, but follows lines of weaknesses. Araldite-impregnation imaging A large core sample is collected. This is then impregnated with araldite and a fluorescent resin. The core is then cut back using a grinding implement, very gradually (~1 mm per time), and at every interval the surface of the core sample is digitally imaged. The images are then loaded into a computer where they can be analysed. Depth, continuity, surface area and a number of other measurements can then be made on the cracks within the soil. Electrical resistivity imaging Using the infinite resistivity of air, the air spaces within a soil can be mapped. A specially designed resistivity meter had improved the meter-soil contact and therefore the area of the reading. This technology can be used to produce images that can be analysed for a range of cracking properties.

He was the first to describe Paraceratherium, also commonly known as Indricotherium or Baluchitherium, the largest known land mammal. Early life He was born on 3 April 1880 in Hampstead, London, the second child and only son of John Forster Cooper and his wife Mary Emily Miley. His maternal grandfather, Miles Miley, was an amateur botanist and naturalist, and encouraged Clive Forster-Cooper in his interest in natural history. He was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, Rugby School.'Forster-Cooper, Sir Clive', in Who Was Who In 1897 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and took a BA in 1901 and MA in 1904. Early career Zoological illustration of spoon worms made by Forster-Cooper during the Maldives expedition In 1900, Forster Cooper travelled with John Stanley Gardiner to the Maldive and Laccadive Islands to undertake collections and study the formation of coral reefs. From 1902 to 1903 he was naturalist to the North Seas Fisheries Commission Scientific Investigations, sailing around the Indian Ocean, taking soundings and collecting fauna and flora of the Seychelles. In 1905 Forster-Cooper joined the Percy Sladen expedition to the Indian Ocean, with Stanley Gardiner. In 1906, he returned to Cambridge and continued to work on the collections made on the expeditions to the Indian Ocean. In 1907 he met Dr C. W. Andrews, a specialist in the history of the elephant, at the British Museum of Natural History and became interested in fossil mammals. As a result of this meeting, in 1907 he joined Dr Andrews' collecting expedition to the Fayum. His increasing interest in vertebrate palaeontology led him to the American Museum of Natural History, New York, where he worked under H. F. Osborn, then Professor of Zoology at Columbia University and Curator of the museum. He spent a year in America working closely Osborn, Matthew, Walter W. Granger and W. K. Gregory, studying the American collections of fossil mammals, and taking part in one of Granger's collecting expeditions to Wyoming. He returned to Cambridge University, where he organized an expedition to collect large mammalian fauna, including specimens of the gigantic rhinoceros Baluchitherium, from the Bugti beds of Baluchistan. Work at the University of Cambridge He became Director of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology in 1914, where he worked until 1938. During the First World War, he worked on human animal parasites at the School of Tropical Medicine in the University of Liverpool, which examined the action of quinine on malaria. On his return to Cambridge University after the war, he held a variety of posts in the Zoological Laboratory, including Lecturer and Reader in Vertebrata, and was a Fellow of Trinity Hall. The museum archives hold five books of Foster Cooper's lecture notes. Directorship of the Natural History Museum Forster-Cooper was appointed Director of the Natural History Museum in London 1938. A large part of its collection was preserved in highly flammable alcohol in glass jars, and during the Second World War, the museum was bombed a number of times. Forster Cooper oversaw the removal of much of the important parts of the collection to storage at Tring. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1936 and knighted in 1946. He was also a foreign member of the New York Academy of Sciences and of the American Museum of Natural History. He died on 23 August 1947. Private life On 25 July 1912 at Holy Trinity Church, Chelsea Borough, London County, Forster Cooper married Rosalie, eldest daughter of R. Tunstall-Smith, of Baltimore, Maryland, USA, by his first wife Emily Rosalie Lee Andrews (1860‚Äì1889). They had two sons and one daughter. He was knighted in 1946 and died on 23 August 1947.

Soccer was not as hard-hit as some other sports, but all leagues felt the impact; in fact the ƒåechie team of Chicago lost every member of its roster to enlistment. The United States Soccer Football Association issued a call to its member associations for teams to resist the temptation to strengthen their teams at the expense of others ‚Äî when wealthy, but decimated teams eye the poorer but complete teams, their wallets and checkbooks should remain pocketed in the name of fair play. A welcome consequence of the war situation was a willingness of the USFA's own warring factions to end their dispute and work together in relative harmony during those trying times. Many soccer organizations launched fund raising campaigns and benefit matches to raise money to provide support for US soldiers through, among other means, the provision of soccer equipment and gear to enhance their recreational opportunities. One such project was the Soccer Football Chain Letter Fund launched by Thomas Cahill and the USFA. Other welcome events included record attendance figures in some late-round games of the National Challenge Cup that were well promoted. One of the major topics of discussion was the pros and cons of substitutes. At the time the laws did not specifically allow nor outlaw substitutes per se, but the consensus was that eventually they would become a reality. For the 1917-18 year, the USFA reported receipts of $6,318.64 and disbursements of $3,034.39, giving the USFA a net worth of $2,784.25 in cash and one $500.00 Liberty Bond.

Warren is also known for sex comedies such as Outer Touch (also known as Outer Spaced and Spaced Out, 1979).Sheridan, Simon (2007). Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema (3rd edition) (Reynolds & Hearn). McGillivray, David (1992). Doing Rude Things: the History of the British Sex Film, 1957-1981 (Sun Tavern Fields).Fenton, Harvey (2001). Ten Years of Terror: British Horror Films of the 1970s (FAB Press, Guildford). Along with the films of Pete Walker, Warren's movies are sometimes dubbed \\"New Wave\\" British horror, on the basis that they upped the ante in terms of sexual explicitness and gore from that of the Hammer and Amicus productions that dominated the genre in UK cinema up to the early 1970s. Career An avid film fan from childhood, Warren entered the film industry as a runner on The Millionairess (1960) and as an assistant director (The Dock Brief, 1962) before directing the short film Fragment in 1965. Calcutta-born Bachoo Sen (1934‚Äì2002), owner of the Astral Cinema in Brewer Street, London, who had an interest in film production, saw Fragment and subsequently hired Warren to direct two feature-length sex films, Her Private Hell (1968) and Loving Feeling (1969). Both were successes, but Warren saw little of the profits. Not wanting to be typecast as a director of sex films, Warren turned down a third directing offer from Sen (Love is a Splendid Illusion, 1970) and had to wait several years to raise the money required to make Satan's Slave (1976), the first of a series of horror films that he directed. Warren's final two films, Bloody New Year and Gunpowder (both 1987), were hampered by low budgets imposed by producer Maxine Julius. Although Warren did not release a feature film between 1987 and 2016, he continued to work in the industry directing music videos and educational short films such as Person to Person, a BBC film designed for students of English. His horror films developed a following, culminating in the making of Evil Heritage, a 1999 documentary about his work, and the release of a DVD box set in 2004. In 2007 Warren worked on the supplementary features for the Region 1 DVD releases of Corridors of Blood (1958), The Haunted Strangler (1958) and First Man into Space (1959). He is a regular guest at Manchester's Festival of Fantastic Films.

It has smooth grey bark, narrow oblong to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds that are square in cross-section, red at maturity and arranged singly in leaf axils, yellow flowers and four-angled, winged fruit. Description Eucalyptus forrestiana is a small tree or mallet that typically grows to a height of and does not from a lignotuber. It has smooth grey over pale brown bark and a dense dark green canopy. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull greyish green, petiolate leaves that are arranged alternately, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are also arranged alternately, lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides when mature, long and wide. The flowers buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a flattened peduncle long, the pedicel long. Mature buds are red, oblong in side view, square in cross-section, long and wide with a narrow wing on each corner and a flat, disc-like operculum. Flowering occurs from January to March or from April to June and the flowers are yellow. The fruit is a similar shape to the flower buds, long and wide with the valves enclosed below the level of the rim. Taxonomy Eucalyptus forrestiana was first formally described in 1904 by the botanist Ludwig Diels in the journal Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie, in an article jointly authored with Georg August Pritzel. The specific epithet (forrestiana) honours \\"Sir John Forrest\\", explorer, botanical collector and later the first Premier of Western Australia and member of the first Federal Parliament. Distribution Fuchsia gum is found around salt lakes and on sand plains in a small area in near-coastal between Ravensthorpe and Cape Arid National Park, extending inland as far as Mt. Nye and Mt. Beaumont in Western Australia, where it grows in clay-sandy soils. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Eucalyptus forrestiana is commonly used as a small street tree in semi-arid areas due to its highly decorative appearance.

He played with Micha≈Ç Urbaniak, Wojciech Karolak and Zbigniew Namys≈Çowski. Blizi≈Ñski was the first Polish world-class jazz guitarist. Stylistically, he belonged to the jazz mainstream, continuing the tradition of electric jazz guitar started by Charlie Christian and represented later by musicians such as Kenny Burrell, Barney Kessel, Wes Montgomery, Jim Hall, Joe Pass, Pat Metheny, and John Scofield. Career Blizi≈Ñski grew up in a family with strong cultural traditions. He got hit first guitar on Christmas 1962 and taught himself how to play. He founded the band Czterech (The Four) in 1966, where he played the music of J.S. Bach transcribed for three guitars and drums. The band won the Igrce Gliwickie competition in 1967; Blizi≈Ñski won the first prize in the instrumental category. He wrote in one of his letters: > I learned a lot while working with this band. I developed my technique and > started to pay more respect to time: tempo and precision in rhythm; most of > all however, I learned inner discipline ‚Äï indispensable in self-development. In 1971 he was already collaborating with Krzysztof Sadowski and Wanda Warska. He founded the quartet Generacja (\\"Generation\\"), which won a prize in the Jazz nad OdrƒÖ festival; Blizi≈Ñski himself won the 3rd prize in the instrumental category. In the years that followed, he played with Zbigniew Namys≈Çowski, Micha≈Ç Urbaniak, Tomasz Sta≈Ñko, Jan Jarczyk, W≈Çodzimierz Nahorny, Adam Makowicz, Novi, Bemibek, the Polish Radio's Jazz Studio conducted by Jan \\"Ptaszyn\\" Wr√≥blewski, the Polish Radio and Television orchestra conducted by A. Trzaskowski, Wojciech Karolak and Janusz Muniak. Blizi≈Ñski's technique was dazzling. He worked very hard, practising constantly, aiming at maximal precision. He started his own trio in the late 70s, with which he played in jazz clubs and recorded his first album, The Wave (Poljazz). When the Jazz Forum magazine held a contest in 1982, Blizi≈Ñski attracted the highest number of votes in the jazz guitar category. In the following years, Marek Blizi≈Ñski and Jaros≈Çaw ≈ömietana became the two most popular jazz guitar players in Poland. Blizi≈Ñski was recruited by Zbigniew Namys≈Çowski in 1983. He played with Air Condition on jazz festivals in Europe and Canada. Johnny Olson wrote in the Swedish paper Nya Wermlands-Tidningen on April 26, 1983: > Shocking. I was knocked out by his strikingly good guitar playing. He stands > still as a statue, with no expression on his face but with what seems to be > a direct connection between his brain and guitar. His playing reveals sound > knowledge of guitar improvisation history. On four bars distance he went up > to his knees in blues mud, somewhere in the Mississippi delta, rendered > guitar canons of the 1950s and finally sailed across some funk patterns of > the kind that make you feel dizzy. Technical problems seem to be totally > unknown to him. He swings strongly when he wants to. Whatever he does, he > does it with a temporal precision sharp as a razor. A noteworthy man: one of > the best I've ever heard, and I've heard quite a few in my life. Despite releasing popular records with other musicians, Blizi≈Ñski's solo records had little success. Disappointed with imperfect recordings, he used all his savings for instruments and his own recording studio. He started working with his fellow musicians for the Royal Viking lines. Between cruises, he worked on his next solo album. He was a universal guitarist and a good bass guitar player. His playing was characterized by perfect technique, moderation and good taste. As a soloist, he represented gentle virtuosity, free from cheap tricks, preferring full sound and a natural use of the instrument. Kazimierz Czy≈º wrote: > His playing is characterised by a synthesis of focus and a unique selection > of sounds. He never performs with the aim of showing off, in a manner where > fingers are faster than thought; instead, he is always focused and seems to > play for himself, without attempting to boast. It's probably this introvert > approach to performing that makes him almost unnoticeable; there is only his > music on the stage. He was an appraised theoretician. Taciturn and not particularly communicative in person, he was vastly knowledgeable. He published the book Jazz Guitar in 1983, written in surprisingly comprehensible language. This compendium of knowledge about guitar playing was complemented by his teaching experience, gained during jazz workshops in Chodzie≈º and MƒÖchocice. He occasionally collaborated with the Jazz Forum and Jazz magazines, writing reviews of records and books related to jazz guitar. Illness Hardly anybody knew about Blizi≈Ñski's illness. He underwent an operation for skin cancer in 1985, which seemed to be a success. He was strongly advised to avoid the sun. He went on another cruise in 1988. Many months spent on sea had a negative effect on him. He started losing moral support, fell into depression and became weaker and weaker. Two weeks before the end of a cruise near Jamaica, the doctor on board ordered his immediate return home. In a Warsaw hospital he was diagnosed with dangerous metastases of an advanced cancer. He died three months later in a hospital in Potocka street in Warsaw, six days before his 42nd birthday. :Original text from note \\"About author\\", written by Janusz Pop≈Çawski, from the book Gitara Jazzowa (Jazz Guitar).

It is located from Appleby-in-Westmorland and from Penrith, in the valley of the River Lyvennet. The river flows just to the west of the village, and is crossed by a ford on the road to Newby and Morland. The village is known for its annual Beer Festival at The White Horse. History Millennium plaque King's Meaburn was thought to be an Anglo-Saxon settlement in the 7th and 8th centuries. This idea is reinforced by the fact that Meaburn is an Anglo-Saxon name. The name is derived from \\"Meadburn\\", which means \\"meadow by a stream\\". The name King's Meaburn goes back to the 12th century. The King at the time, Henry II, gave part of the village's lands to Sir Hugh de Morville, and the other part to his sister, Maud de Veteripont. Sir Hugh eventually fell out of favour with the King, after which the King reclaimed Sir Hugh's section of the land, and hence the name King's Meaburn. The land that belonged to Maud was and to this day (September 2008) is called Maulds Meaburn. One notable event in the village was in 1745 when Charles Edward Stuart aka Bonnie Prince Charlie and some of his soldiers crossed the ford in the village on their way to rendezvous with more of his troops in Shap. Geography and Weather Due to the village's position relative to the nearby mountains, the village can be subject to strong winds known as the Helm Wind. Churches Churches in King's Meaburn include St Mary's, the Wesleyan Chapel and the New Methodist Church. Watermill Steele's Mill is now a holiday cottage. It retains a waterwheel, three grinding stones set into a floor, and the original apple-wood cogs and gearing encased in glass. Public Services The village has an inn called the White Horse Inn which doubles up as a post office. King's Meaburn used to have a school until it closed down in 1983.

The company and the name was bought by Japanese electronics conglomerate Sanyo in 1975. History Fisher Electronics was an American audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1945 by Avery Fisher in New York City, New York. Originally named the Fisher Radio Corporation, the company is considered a pioneer in high fidelity audio equipment. Fisher initially developed, manufactured and marketed high-performance audio products under the trade name \\"The Fisher\\". In February 1969, Emerson Electric announced plans to purchase Fisher Radio. To purchase Fisher, Emerson initially agreed to exchange 736,000 shares in a transaction worth approximately $75 million. Emerson later agreed to pay approximately $37 million in stock to acquire Fisher. The purchase was completed later that year. Emerson subsequently sold Fisher to Sanyo Electric of Japan in 1975, where it remained until 2010 when Sanyo was purchased by Panasonic. But the Fisher brand was phased out owing to the termination of Sanyo by Panasonic in 2012. Fisher's product lineup was eventually re-branded as Panasonic. Avery Fisher remained as a consultant for Emerson and Sanyo. Fisher is generally known to be the first company to introduce separate audio components. Originally, hi-fi systems were integrated all into one chassis. The Fisher  The Fisher was the brand name for high- end, high quality hi-fi electronic equipment manufactured in New York by The Fisher Radio Corp. during the \\"golden age\\" of the vacuum tube, which was named after the company founder, Avery Fisher. During this period, similar brands were H.H. Scott, Marantz, Harman Kardon, and McIntosh. Some of the early 1960s models were also available as kits. Fisher tube equipment is considered quite collectible today. Fisher's first receiver was the model 500, a mono AM/FM receiver using two EL37 output tubes. It had a brass-plated face panel and an optional mahogany or \\"blonde\\" wooden case. This early mono receiver should not be confused with the later stereo tube receiver models, the 500B and 500C. These later receivers made in the early 1960s were stereo using push-pull 7591 output tubes. They were also sold with optional wood cabinets and had aluminum faceplates instead of the brass on the earlier 500 receiver. Well-known models include (but are not limited to): *FM-1000/FMR-1 Broadcast Monitor Tuner, considered one of the best tube tuners, collectibleSalvatore, Arthur. (December 2009).

Fisher FM tuners and receivers often used similar designs and components thus allowing parts to be swapped between various models. A good example is the FM stereo multiplex decoder module. Fisher was the first to introduce stereo receivers with four channels. These innovations were brief and occurred in the mid-1970s which some consider The Second Golden Age of High Fidelity. Like many new concepts of the time such as Beta Format and VHS, there were two competing four channel formats. One was CD-4 and the other was SQ. Neither was successful as the purist found separation from highly defined loudspeakers and low distortion receivers and amplifiers. At the time the concept of a sub-woofer was in its infancy. Now, it is common to see 5+1 systems which had their heritage in the \\"confrontation\\" of four-channel and stereo high fidelity coupled with a sub woofer. Other consumer products Under Sanyo ownership, Fisher also commercialized a range of consumer products including * television sets, projectors and DVD players, digicams and surveillance equipment * audio systems and dictation machines, mobile devices and phones * household machinery and air conditioners In particular, the air conditioning business of Sanyo and Fisher brands was unified in 2000 under the Sanyo Electric Air Conditioning Co. Ltd. scheme, to end up eventually in 2011 with the buyout from Panasonic.

Biography Nancy Adajania was educated at the Princess Alexandra School, Elphinstone College, where she read Politics for her BA, the Sophia Polytechnic, Bombay, where she took a diploma in Social Communications Media, and the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune, where she studied film. Adajania has written and lectured extensively on contemporary Indian art, especially new media art and its political and cultural contexts, at international venues such as Documenta 11, Kassel; the Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM), Karlsruhe; the Neuer Berliner Kunstverein and the Transmediale, Berlin; the Danish Contemporary Art Foundation, Copenhagen; Lottringer 13, Munich, among others. As Editor-in-Chief of Art India (2000‚Äì2002), Adajania developed a discursive space singlehandedly, in an Asian context, for emergent new-media and interactive public art practices and social projects on a global level. She has contributed essays and reviews to Springerin (Vienna), Metamute (London), Art 21 (Paris), Public Art (Minneapolis), Art Asia Pacific (New York), X-Tra (Los Angeles) and the Documenta 12 Magazine (Kassel, 2007). Adajania's film, 'Khichri Ek Khoj' (In Search of Khichri) (1999), weaves the documentary and the global meta-narrative forms together to \\"unveil the workings of a failed postcolonial welfare state\\", and has been screened at various venues in India and internationally, including the Mumbai International Film Festival (Bombay, 2000), in 'First Story: Women Building: New Narratives for the 21st Century' (Galeria do Palacio Cristal, Porto, 2001) and during the international symposium, 'Capital and Karma: Conversations between India and Europe' (Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, April 2002).See ZKM: Nancy Adajania biographical note The focus of Adajania's writing, research and curatorial interests is the relationship between the artistic imagination and the technological resources and potentialities available to it in any particular society and period. She has proposed several conceptual tools with which to examine the consequences of newness across various sectors of cultural production, including the concepts of the 'new folkloric imagination', 'new context media',See The Delhi Declaration, which centrally cites Adajania's concept of 'new context media' and 'mediatic realism'.See Adajania's essay on 'new mediatic realism' Adajania has reflected, in several essays and lectures, on the aesthetic and political effects of what, following the theorist Paul Virilio, she terms dromomania, an obsession with speed produced by the globalisation of communicative and distributive processes.See Adajania's essay, 'Take the Fast with the Slow' In another strand of her engagement with the politics of cultural acts, Adajania has addressed the question of redefining public art within the particularity of regional public spheres.See Nancy Adajania's essay, 'Public Art? Activating the Agoratic Condition'See Nancy Adajania, 'The Sand of the Coliseum, the Glare of Television, and the Hope of Emancipation'See Nancy Adajania, 'The Sand of the Colosseum, the Glare of Television, and the Hope of Emancipation', in Documenta Magazine No: 2/ Life!

Intended by her to revisit and update the debates surrounding this tension, and to generate a new discourse in the field, this cycle of meetings included the national-level seminar, 'Should the Crafts Survive?', which dramatised the rival claims on the terrain of the contemporary, made by academy-trained metropolitan artists and artists of rural, tribal or folk background articulating their own modernity (1995). In 2004‚Äì2005, Adajania was awarded an Independent Research fellowship by Sarai CSDS, a new-media initiative of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi (2004‚Äì2005), under which she studied the popular use of digital manipulation techniques of imaging in metropolitan India. She has since presented her research in the form of an archive-installation, 'In Aladdin's Cave,' exhibited at 'On difference 2/Grenzwertig' (Wuerttembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart, February 2006)See 'In Aladdin's Cave' at 'On difference 2/Grenzwertig' (Wuerttembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart, February 2006) and 'Building Sight' (Watermans Arts Centre, London, Summer 2007).See 'In Aladdin's Cave' at 'Building Sight' (Watermans Arts Centre, London) Adajania has also been developing an account of transcultural artistic practice, with its political and ethical referents as well as its institutional conditions. Adajania's specific concern is with situating the 'entanglements' (she uses the art theorist and curator Sarat Maharaj's term) between regional histories of artistic and intellectual production and a global system that is structured in terms of a Western art-historical understanding.

They experiment with various genres of music including Nepali folk, ragas, rock, funk, blues and jazz. 1974 AD are amongst the most successful recording artists in Nepal. Most of their albums are ranked amongst the top-ten best- selling albums according to Hits FM of Nepal. In 2000, their concert, 'Rock Yatra,' was watched by more than 60,000 people, the largest attendance for a concert in Nepal. Songs and albums produced by 1974 AD 1974 AD are usually in the Nepali language. Lyrics include themes of patriotism, Nepali virtues, unity, love and nationalism. There is a lot of variety in the music of 1974 AD. They have successfully tried various genres of music. Their songs, like \\"Nepali,\\" \\"Sambodhan,\\" \\"Pahilo Junima,\\" \\"Parelima,\\" \\"Samjhi Baschu\\" and \\"Chudaina Timro Mayale\\" and others, were some of the biggest hits in Nepalese music. The song \\"Nepali Ho\\" from their highest selling album Satabdi has been received as the most patriotic commercial song till date.  Formation (1994)  The group was formed during the 90s by a group of teachers from Gyanodaya School in Lalitpur, Nepal. The founding members were guitarist Phiroj Shyangden, bassist Nirakar Yakthumba and drummer Bhanu A. During the early days the band played various genres for music like hard rock, heavy metal, rock and blues. Drummer Bhanu A was influenced by blues music. When they played cover tunes he sang Gary Moore numbers like \\"Walking by Myself\\". They played several gigs in and around Kathmandu where they covered numbers by Bryan Adams, Deep Purple and other rock groups. He is also a good guitarist and his bluesy rock style has inspired many guitarists in Nepal. His style has the flavor of guitarists like Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore and Eddie Van Halen. They mainly performed their own compositions. The hit tune is \\"Mayaluleh\\" from their debut album \\"Time Out\\", established 1974 AD as a household name. During this time, future members Adrian Pradhan and Sanjay Shreshta were involved with their own bands. Adrian used to be in a hard rock band from Kalimpong called \\"The Flame\\". \\"The Flame\\" held their first concert in Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu during the winter of 1994. They were basically a cover band doing songs from Iron Maiden, Metallica, Extreme, and other rock acts. Adrian Pradhan played rhythm guitar and performed vocals. The influence of early heavy metal can be heard in Adrian's singing style. Later during the late 90s Adrian joined 1974 AD as their drummer/vocalist after former drummer Bhanu A went on hiatus. Percussionist Sanjay Shrestha, who used to play the drums for the St Xavier's school band, was involved with Nepali fusion rock act Shristi. Flute maestro Manoj Singh would soon join 1974 AD and enjoy the popularity of the highly successful band and also contribute to the diversity of sound in the band. During the late 90s local guitar enthusiast Manoj K.C from Dhobighat, Lalitpur joined 1974 AD, completing the lineup. Together they would form a solid act and go on to conquer the hearts of millions of die-hard fans.  Fame and fortune  The band was very popular in the Kathmandu and Lalitpur rock scene in mid 90s even before they started churning out big hits like \\"Mayalule\\" and other tunes. But the release of their debut album established them as a household name in Nepali music. Their compositions which includes lyrics on patriotism, self pride as a Nepali and love and unity amongst Nepali people are big hits in Nepali pop culture. They have come up with songs that has helped the nation unite and express the mutual feelings at times of big changes in country as in the form of political and other big events. The songs can be melodic but at the same time very dark with the lyrics and message it carries. The music covers various genres like heavy metal, hard rock, blues, reggae and funk/soul.  Post Phiroj 1974AD (2008‚Äì2012)  While Manose Singh continues to contribute to the bands newer compositions, given his other musical commitment, Phiroj Shyangden has now exited the band for personal reasons. Not surprisingly, many fans feel a loss, some more than others, in the sound and image of the band. But the band, now with Adrian on vocals and Sanjay on drums, continues to find newer sound. Their new album 8:18 (aath:athara) has been received well by the audience. Numbers like Timi Bina, Bardaan and Rain Song from the album emerged to become winner. However, exit of Phiroj Shyangnden, one of the key members of the band and also the most influential guitarist in Nepal was something that severely hit the band's latest album.  Back with Phiroj 1974AD (2010-2012) During their historic US tour of 2012, the band reunited with Phiroj for a few songs in their New York concert on April 21, 2012. After the successful reunion and with the help of the organizer, Karma Tenzing the band decided to collaborate again for their next show in Baltimore, scheduled 2 weeks after. Band members Nirakar and Sanjay stated in Nepali that Phiroj had \\"never left 1974 AD to begin with. He always was and still is a part of them\\". They confirmed to various media outlets that the band had reunited again. In the winter of 2012, Phiroj returned to Nepal and performed in more concerts at St. Xavier's and in various Nepalese cities with the band. The band even recorded a few songs for their next album. Phiroj is now back in New York and according to him, the album release would coincide with the band's 20th anniversary in 2014. The album was cancelled and after the tour theywent on a 6-year long hiatus from recording songs  #thenewlineup and 9th Album (2016-2019)  After six years of inactivity, 1974AD emerged with new faces to record a new studio album. Adrian and Phiroj left the band for personal reasons, and were replaced by singer Rohit John Chettri and pianist Prajjwal Mukhiya. Additionally, the band added a new horn section with Jacko Wacko and Pratik Baniya in trumpet and trombone, respectively. They recorded their new album, Hazaar Sapana and went on a US tour and on the WAVE 'Rock The Nation' Tour to promote the album. The album became a commercial success relative to others in the music industry of Nepal. Shortly after the release of the album, the band released a song titled, 'Pirai Pir', recounting the stories of the people who suffered during the massive 2015 earthquake, and describing how they could rise up from the loss. The band is currently on tour promoting the new songs.  Nirantarta - 1974ad Reunion with original members (2019-present)  In an event titled ‚ÄòNirantarta‚Äô, held at Moksh, Jhamshikhel, Kathmandu, Nepal, on 8 July 2019, the band announced the reunion with their original lineup, Phiroj Shyangden, Adrian Pradhan, Manoj Kumar KC, Nirakar Yakthumba and Sanjay Shrestha.

To reach young people who do not attend church, weekly meetings are held during the school year in various locations throughout local communities. Fellowship, Saturday night prayer, and a number of yearly events offer teens TFC's approaches to present day needs. History of TFC In the 1940s Youth For Christ was formed in Allen County. During the 1980s, the local Youth For Christ became Teens For Christ and started to hold chapter meetings in various homes throughout the area. During the 1990s, TFC accepted the mandate to \\"Turn Teenagers into Fully Committed Followers of Jesus Christ\\" and came under the leadership of its current Executive Director, Buck Sutton (currently age 45). From the 90s, with three senior high chapters totaling 30 teens and 8 volunteer leaders, today's roster encompasses 17 chapters and over 60 volunteers. In October 2008, TFC Arkansas was launched in Gentry, Arkansas, led by TFC alumni David Young. In September 2009, the Rockford, Illinois, chapter was launched.

It is a parameter in atmospheric dynamics and tropical cyclone forecasting. The highest rainfall rates occur near the RMW of tropical cyclones. The extent of a cyclone's storm surge and its maximum potential intensity can be determined using the RMW. As maximum sustained winds increase, the RMW decreases. Recently, RMW has been used in descriptions of tornadoes. When designing buildings to prevent against failure from atmospheric pressure change, RMW can be used in the calculations.Donald W. Burgess and Michael A. Magsig. Understanding WSR-88D Signatures for the 3 May 1999 Oklahoma City Tornado. Retrieved on 2007-03-18. Determination The RMW is traditionally measured by reconnaissance aircraft in the Atlantic basin. It can also be determined on weather maps as the distance between the cyclone center and the system's greatest pressure gradient. Using weather satellite data, the distance between the coldest cloud top temperature and the warmest temperatature within the eye, in infrared satellite imagery, is one method of determining RMW. The reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection, which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops. Use of velocity data from Doppler weather radar can also be used to determine this quantity, both for tornadoes and tropical cyclones near the coast. Tornadoes Wyoming on June 5, 2009. Reflectivity data on the left show the calm interior of the tornado. Velocity data on the right show where the strongest winds are located. In the case of tornadoes, knowledge of the RMW is important as atmospheric pressure change (APC) within sealed buildings can cause failure of the structure. Most buildings have openings totaling one square foot per volume to help equalize air pressure between the inside and outside of the structures. The APC is around one-half of its maximum value at the RMW, which normally ranges between and from the center (or eye) of the tornado. The widest tornado as measured by actual radar wind measurements was the Mulhall tornado in northern Oklahoma, part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, which had a radius of maximum wind of over . Tropical cyclones An average value for the RMW of was calculated as the mean (or average) of all hurricanes with a lowest central atmospheric pressure between a pressure of and . As tropical cyclones intensify, maximum sustained winds increase as the RMW decreases. However, values for RMW produced based on central pressure or maximum wind speed could be substantial scattering around the regression lines. The heaviest rainfall within intense tropical cyclones has been observed in the vicinity of the RMW. The radius of maximum wind helps determine the direct strikes of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones are considered to have made a direct strike to a landmass when a tropical cyclone passes close enough to a landmass that areas inside the radius of maximum wind are experienced on land. The radius of maximum wind is used within the maximum potential intensity equation. The Emanuel equation for Maximum Intensity Potential relies upon the winds near the RMW of a tropical cyclone to determine its ultimate potential.Kerry A. Emanuel. Maximum Intensity Estimation. Retrieved on 2007-03-18. The highest storm surge is normally coincident with the radius of maximum wind. Because the strongest winds within a tropical cyclone lie at the RMW, this is the region of a tropical cyclone which generates the dominant waves near the storm, and ultimately ocean swell away from the cyclone.Edward J. Walsh and C. Wayne Wright. Hurricane Wave Topography and Directional Wave Spectra in Near Real-Time. Retrieved on 2007-03-18. Tropical cyclones mix the ocean water within a radius three times that of the RMW, which lowers sea surface temperatures due to upwelling.

In Latin: Talayrandus, Cardinalis Petracoricensis. (1301 ‚Äì 17 January, 1364) was a French Cardinal,1331 Salvador Miranda, Consistories for the creation of Cardinals 14th Century (1303-1404) from one of the most aristocratic families in P√©rigord, south-west France. H√©lie was born at P√©rigueux, third sonZacour (1956), p. 683. of Elias VII, Count of P√©rigord, and Brunissende of Foix, daughter of Roger Bernard III, comte de Foix. His elder brothers were Archambaud (IV), who inherited the County, and Roger-Bernard (who married Eleanor, daughter of Bouchard, Comte de Vend√¥me); his younger brother was Fortanier, and his sisters were Agnes (who married John of Sicily Duke of Durazzo and de Gravina in 1321), Jeanne (who married Ponce, Seigneur de Castillon), Marguerite (who married √âm√©ric de Lautrec), and Rosemburge (who married Jacques de Lavie, grand-nephew of Pope John XXII). As a third son H√©lie was destined for an ecclesiastical career. His brother, Roger Bernard, too, had an ecclesiastical career, becoming Canon of Lyon. But then, the eldest son died, and Roger-Bernard became the Count of P√©rigord.Zacour (1960), p. 13 and n. 37. H√©lie became a major figure in the Avignon papacy, and also a diplomat engaged in the negotiations of the Hundred Years' War, having friendships in both English and French royal families. In his last months he had been appointed Papal Legate for a crusade against the Turks. Bishoprics In 1308, at the age of six, H√©lie was granted a Canonry in Agen, for which Pope Clement V granted him special dispensation.Zacour (1960), p. 8 and p. 74. He was probably educated at first in the local school of the cathedral of P√©rigueux,Duchesne, Preuves, p. 315 (Talleyrand's Testament): \\"... in the Church of St. Front de P√©rigueux...in which we took the first steps of our upbringing...\\" but in 1320 he was granted permission by Pope John XXII to study Civil Law for five years, even though he was primicerius in the Church of Metz.G. Mollat (ed.), Jean XXII. Lettres communes III, p. 200, no. 12495. Zacour (1960), p. 7. He may have studied at Toulouse, though there is no direct evidence. Early in his career H√©lie became Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Chancelade in the diocese of P√©rigueux, with which the family had long been connected. At the age of twenty-three H√©lie de Talleyrand, who was already Canon of P√©rigueux and Archdeacon of Richmond in the Church of Lincoln, was appointed Bishop of Limoges, which was approved by Pope John XXII on 10 October 1324. He held the diocese until 1328. It appears, however, that he was never consecrated during his years as bishop of Limoges.He got two extensions for his not being consecrated: Zacour (1960), nos. 21-23, the latest on 1 November 1326. Eubel, I, p. 301. In his Testament, Talleyrand calls himself bishop-elect. If he had been consecrated, as Zacour points out, he would have had to resign his other benefices, which might have proved financially disadvantageous.Zacour (1960), pp. 9-10. Then, on 4 January 1328 his translation to the diocese of Auxerre was approved. It is said that he was consecrated bishop by Pope John XXII himself.H. Audiffret, in: No authority for the statement is given. In 1330 Bishop de Talleyrand founded the Chartreuse de Vauclaire.Meusnier, p. 212. The date is much contested. Since the resulting legal proceedings did not end until 1340, it may have been at that date that the Chartreuse was endowed. In his Testament Talleyrand left the monastery 10,000 gold ecus. This was allegedly at the command of the King of France, in reparation for outrages committed against a Franciscan convent on the outskirts of P√©rigueux by Talleyrand's eldest brother Archambeau, Count of P√©rigord, at the time of their mother's funeral in October, 1324.See Zacour (1960), p. 9. Talleyrand held the diocese of Auxerre until he became a cardinal in 1331. His successor was approved on 24 January 1332.Eubel, I, p. 120. Cardinal Cardinal Talleyrand's arms In a Consistory held for the promotion of cardinals on 25 May 1331, Pope John XXII appointed one and only one cardinal, H√©lie de Talleyrand, as a Cardinal-Priest. This was at the request of King Philip VI of France, on the recommendation of √âtienne de Mornay, Ma√Ætre des Comptes and former Chancellor.Du Chesne, Preuves, p. 312. The appointment caused a good deal of friction between the King and the Pope. Philip had asked for two cardinals, which the Pope was quite unwilling to grant. Though he did elevate Talleyrand, Pope John sent off a tart letter to the King on 25 May, the day after he had approved the promotion. He pointed out that the College of Cardinals was already well supplied with the talents required by the Church. Moreover, the Papacy had not been deaf to the requests of the French kings. Of the twenty current cardinals, thirteen were subjects of the King of France. Nonetheless, with the consent of those cardinals (or perhaps one should say 'pressure from'), he had agreed to promote Bishop Talleyrand.Baronio (ed. Theiner), Volume 24, p. 481, under the year 1331, ¬ß 33. Baluze (1693), I, p. 736 [ed. Mollat, II, p. 233]. Zacour (1960), p. 10, ignores Baluze and gets the number of French cardinals subject to King Philip wrong. It is clear from the Pope's letter to the Queen that there were six Italian cardinals. The Pope's complaints seem to have fallen on deaf ears, for the royal family were again begging for more cardinals in September. This time, on 26 September, the Pope wrote to Queen Joanna. He reminded the Queen of the rules observed in the Roman Curia. Appointments were never made in private, only in open Consistory, with votes of the current cardinals heard; appointments were made only for good reason, when the number of cardinals had fallen too low, or when there was an insufficiency in talent in theology or Canon Law, neither of which was the case at the present moment. In fact the number of cardinals was excessively high, and there was talent aplenty. She should also consider that there were now sixteen cardinals of French extraction, and only six Italians. He therefore refused the royal request.Baronio (ed. Theiner), p. 481-482, under the year 1331, ¬ß 34. Baluze (1693), I, p. 736 [ed. Mollat, II, p. 233]. The pressure continued, however, and on 20 December 1331 yet another French cardinal, Pierre Bertrand, was appointed.Eubel, I, p. 16. Of the two names put forward, Talleyrand was the less undesirable choice. He was smart, he had studied the law, and he was a relative by marriage of the Pope. This may also explain the Pope's indulgence in allowing Talleyrand to keep the diocese of Auxerre until 22 July 1332, to finance his move to Avignon. He signed at least two papal bulls on 25 May and 22 June, but not with the name of a titular church, indicating that one had not yet been assigned.Baluze (ed. Mollat) II, p. 272, n. 2. When one was assigned, he became the Cardinal-Priest of S. Pietro in Vincoli.Eubel, I, p. 45. He made his official appearance in Avignon in the third week of July, 1331, at which time there was a banquet with the Pope and Cardinals in his honor.Zacour (1960), p. 11. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pope John finally paid the bill for Talleyrand's cardinal's hat on 9 July 1332: Death of John XXII and Conclave of 1334 Palace of the Popes, Avignon Pope John XXII died on Sunday, December 4, 1334. On the day before, the Pope had a bedside meeting with the Cardinals in Avignon; his successor provides a list of the twenty cardinals, including Talleyrand de P√©rigord, who were present.Baronio (ed. Theiner), Volume 25, p. 15, under the year 1334, ¬ß 36. Four cardinals were not present, Napoleone Orsini and Giovanni Gaetano Orsini among them. It was at this meeting that the Pope recanted his notions about the Beatific Vision, which had so unsettled Christendom. The Conclave opened on 13 December 1334. The early discussions were not about a particular candidate, but about the need to extract a promise from all the candidates that the new Pope would move the Roman Curia back to Rome. John XXII had made promises in that direction, and his failure, with one excuse after another, seriously angered the senior Italian cardinal, Napoleone Orsini.Baronio (ed. Theiner), Volume 25, p. 17, under the year 1334, ¬ß 39. Cardinal Napoleone therefore led a group of cardinals who were demanding a return to Rome. Cardinal H√©lie de Talleyrand led a group of French cardinals who were just as determined to keep the Curia in Avignon. According to Giovanni Villani,Cronica, Book XI, chapter xxi, p. 239 ed. Dragomanni the cardinals led by Talleyrand thought that they had found a pope in Cardinal Jean-Raymond de Comminges. But when he was approached and asked to take the oath that was being demanded, he refused. Finally, on 20 December 1334, a sufficient number of votes was accumulated by the Cistercian Cardinal Jacques Fournier, who became Pope Benedict XII. J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1334. Retrieved: 2016-06-07. In 1336 King Philip VI of France was in Avignon, and a crusade was agreed on. Four cardinals took the cross on that occasion: Annibaldo di Ceccano, H√©lie de Talleyrand, Gauscelin de Jean Du√®se, and Bertrand du Pouget.Baluze (1693), I, p. 817 [ed. Mollat, II, p. 321]. None of them ever made the trip. In the summer of 1340, the King authorized the two parties in a dispute between the Count of Foix and the Monastery of L√©zat to choose their own arbitrators; one of those chosen was Cardinal de Talleyrand. Talleyrand had been assigned by Pope Benedict XII, probably in 1341, as Auditor to hear the case of Lampredius, Bishop of Trau, who refused to cooperate with the proceedings. Talleyrand declared him contumacious and suspended him from office. But then Pope Benedict died. The new pope, Clement VI, supported Talleyrand, however, and renewed the suspension, authorizing the Subdeacon of Trau, Desa Andreae, to assume the spiritual and temporal direction of the diocese. In 1346, Cardinal de Talleyrand negotiated the purchase of the castle of Albarupe (Auberoche) in P√©rigord from the Duke and Duchess of Brittany, which had belonged to their nephew the Count of Limoges but which had been occupied by enemies of the king by stealth and betrayal. The Duke and Duchess were eager to see the Castle in responsible hands, and so they sold it to the brother of the Count of P√©rigord.Du Chesne, Preuves, p. 312. In 1347, Cardinal de Talleyrand founded the Chapel of S. Antoine in the Cathedral of Saint Front de P√©rigueux. It was to be served by twelve chaplains, appointed by the Cathedral Chapter on the recommendation of the Counts of P√©rigord. The action was approved by Pope Clement VI in a bull of 26 June 1347. In his Testament he left the chaplains 150 gold florins.Duchesne, Preuves, p. 315. On 4 November 1348 Pope Clement VI promoted Cardinal de Talleyrand to be Cardinal-Bishop of Albano (1348-1364), and, in 1361 seniority made him Dean of the College of Cardinals (1361-1364), following the death of Cardinal Pierre de Pratis (des Pr√®s).Eubel, I, p. 35. Salvador Miranda, Biographical listing of Elias de Talleyrand Conclave of 1352 Pope Clement died in Avignon on 6 December 1352. The Conclave to elect his successor opened on Sunday, 16 December 1352 in the Apostolic Palace in Avignon, with twenty-six cardinals in attendance, including H√©lie de Talleyrand and his enemy, Guy de Boulogne. At mid-morning on 18 December they elected Cardinal √âtienne Aubert, who took the name Innocent VI. He was crowned on 30 December 1352.Zacour (1960), pp. 23-25. J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1352. Retrieved: 2016-05-28. Benefices A list of Talleyrand's benefices has been worked out through the scholarly efforts of Norman Zacour, which includes a large number of Canonries and Prebends.Zacour (1960), \\"Appendix A.\\", pp. 74-76. He lists sixty-four items, though there are sometimes several references to the same benefice. Not a single Italian benefice is listed, unless one counts the Bishopric of Albano. One must remember that the collections of documents made by members of the French School in Rome concentrated on documents referring to French affairs. It is certain, therefore, that his list is incomplete. See the next note. In addition to what Zacour has listed, it may be stated that Talleyrand was Canon of Gerona. From 1320 to 1323 H√©lie de Talleyrand served as Archdeacon of London. From 1322 to 1328 he was Archdeacon of Richmond, from 1342 to 1345 Dean of York,, publishes a decree of King Edward III showing that he was still being considered Dean of York in 1345. The grant had been made as an \\"expectation\\" or \\"reservation\\" on 30 June 1342, but Talleyrand was never installed, and he was finally granted a Canonry and Prebend on 5 January 1353. Zacour, p. 76. and from 1357 to 1359 Archdeacon of Suffolk. He is also known to have held Whitchurch in the diocese of Canterbury as persona (parson), and was Prebend of Thame in the Church of Lincoln, in 1345.Rymer, 173. Peacemaker Battle of Poitiers, 1356 Cardinal Talleyrand and Cardinal Nicola Capocci were sent to France to attempt to negotiate a peace between France and England. They were in Paris just before the Battle of Poitiers on 19 September 1356. In the first week of October 1356 Pope Innocent VI wrote to Edward, Prince of Wales, the Black Prince, commending his generous conduct to King John II of France, who had been captured in the battle. In a separate letter the Pope asked the Prince to confer with Cardinal de Talleyrand and Cardinal Nicola Capocci in the interests of peace.British History Online: Calendar of Letter-Books of the City of London: G, 1352-1374.

Despite the need for a peace, the Pope sent Cardinal Talleyrand as part of the delegation which travelled to Metz at Christmas time, for the Imperial Diet, to witness the promulgation of the famous Golden Bull of the Emperor Charles IV.Deluz, p. 55. Willy Scheffler (1912), Karl IV. und Innocenz VI.; Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte ihrer Beziehungen (Berlin : E. Ebering), pp. 79, 108-119. In the following year, after intense negotiations, the papal negotiators travelled to London for a conference with King Edward. They arrived on 2 July 1347, and were received by the King. Negotiations continued, but no solution was reached. In 1348 the two cardinals arranged a treaty between Charles King of Navarre and Charles Duke of Normandy.Beluze (1693), I, p. 899 [ed. Mollat, II, p. 411]. Patronage He was also a literary patron, promoting the writing of the 1336 travels of William of Boldensele, whose real name was Otto de Nyenhusen.The Travels of Marco Polo, Volume 2 by Marco Polo and Rustichello of Pisa - Full Text Free Book (Part 16/23) At p. 228: accessit ad Curiam Romanam, et absolutione pro apostasia accepta, ad terram sanctam perrexit, quam ad instantiam unius cardinalium gratiose, sicut legenti patet, descripsit. In his prefatory letter, written from Avignon on St. Michael's Day 1337, before his return to his monastery, Guilelmus writes, \\"And now it is fitting for me to stay for a few days more at my Lord Talleyrand de Perigord's in the Curia at Avignon, because my lord had graciously taken great pleasure from my arrival... I am sending you my little book which I put together at the insistence of my lord Cardinal....\\"Grotefend, pp. 236-237. He stayed more than a year.Deluz, p. 61. Talleyrand also corresponded with Petrarch.Zacour (1960), pp. 29-31. Zacour (1956), passim. He was detested, however, by the Florentine chronicler, Giovanni Villani, who was a Guelph and a republican.Baluze (1693), I, pp. 683, 770 [ed. Mollat, II, pp. 170, 272]. It is Villani (Cronica IX. 58) who puts out the libelous story that Talleyrand's mother, Brunissende, had been the mistress of Pope John XXII. Later years In 1359 Cardinal de Talleyrand was again appointed Legate to the Kings of France and England, and when he was returning to Avignon, he was the subject of a plot to attack and rob him while he was passing through the diocese of Langres. He himself was not taken, since he delayed his trip along the way, but his baggage was taken and plundered. He wrote a letter, ordering all the bishops of France to excommunicate the malefactors. In 1359 Cardinal de Talleyrand, Cardinal Audouin Aubert, and Cardinal Raymond de Canilhac were appointed by Pope Innocent VI as assessors in a dispute between the Master of the Order of S. John of Jerusalem and the Castellan of Emposta.Baluze (1693),I, p. 895 [ed. Mollat, II, p. 407]. Assessors were judges appointed by the Pope in cases which came to the Roman Curia as part of the process of appeal; the assessors investigated and provided a judgment for the Pope's final review and implementation. They also investigated church elections to ensure that the person elected had been chosen in accordance with the rules of Canon Law and was a suitable person for the position. Cardinal de Talleyrand drew up his Testament on 25 October 1360.Baluze, I, p. 780 [ed Mollat, II, p. 282]. Du Chesne, Preuves, pp. 315-319. He added a codicil on 16 January 1364, eleven days before his death, \\"sound in mind, but sick in body\\".Du Chesne, Preuves, pp. 319-320: sani mente, licet corpore, sicut Domino placet, aegri. Zacour (1960), p. 72. Cardinal de Talleyrand was at the height of his influence and power. In September 1362, after the death of Pope Innocent VI, the College of Cardinals was divided (according to Jean Froissart) into two factions, one supporting Guy of Boulogne and the other H√©lie de Talleyrand. The two competitors were strong enough to ensure that the other could not be elected with the two-thirds majority required by Canon Law. In the end, the Cardinals had to go outside the College of Cardinals, and a compromise candidate was elected, Abbot Guillaume Grimoald of S. Vincent in Marseille, who was Legate of the Apostolic See in the Kingdom of Sicily, and was not present at the Conclave.Zacour (1960), pp. 64-65. He was not even a cardinal. The decision was taken perhaps on September 28, but it was not made public until the day after the arrival of Abbot Grimoald in Avignon, 31 October. After he had accepted election, Grimoald was proclaimed Pope Urban V.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1362. Retrieved: 2016-05-26. Shortly after the election, Cardinal Talleyrand is said to have remarked to one of his familiars, \\"Now we have a pope. We honored other ones out of duty, but this one we have to fear and revere, because he is powerful in word and deed.\\"Baluze (1693), I, 413: Modo habemus papam. Alios ex debito honorabamus, et istum necesse est nobis timere et revereri, quia potens est opere et sermone. This is quoted in part by Zacour (1960), p. 65. Crusade and death King John II of France In May 1363, King John II of France wrote to Pope Urban, requesting that Cardinal de Talleyrand be sent on a legation to him. The Pope replied on 25 May, that the College of Cardinals did not think that it was appropriate for him to be sent just at that time, and so the Pope apologized for not being able to carry out the King's request. Zacour (1960), p. 69. The request was sufficiently important that the Pope discussed it with the cardinals, and it is significant that he accepted their viewpoint. The reason for the request is unknown. Zacour conjectures that King John was finding opposition to the planned crusade, and wanted help; it is difficult to see how Talleyrand could have helped, or why the cardinals would refuse. Zacour also conjectures that the College of Cardinals did not authorize the mission because Talleyrand did not want it to, because he was more interested in his affairs in Naples; it is difficult to see how Talleyrand's influence could have outweighed that of King John and Pope Urban with the cardinals, especially in the matter of a crusade.Zacour (1960), p. 69. On 23 August 1363, in the Cathedral of S. Front de P√©rigord, Boson de Talleyrand, Seigneur de Grignols et de Chalais, swore fealty to the Prince of Wales in his capacity as Duke of Aquitaine. In 1363, King John II of France and Peter I, the King of Cyprus, came to Avignon, and it was decided that there should be a war against the Turks.Baluze's 'Third Life' of Pope Urban V, derived from the continuation of the chronicle of Canon Werner, states that the King of Cyprus entered Avignon on Wednesday 29 March, and took the cross on Holy Thursday; Baluze, I, p. 396. The Pope, Urban V held a special ceremony on Holy Saturday, 1363, and bestowed the crusader's cross on the two kings, and on Cardinal Talleyrand as well. John II was appointed Rector and Captain General of the expedition. Setton makes the giving of the crosses take place at Mass on Friday 31 March 1363, the Friday of Holy Week, Good Friday. But there is something wrong with that narrative. Mass is never celebrated on Good Friday, only a Communion service. Baluze, I, p. 982 [ed Mollat, II, p. 499], states that the King of Cyprus entered the Curia on Good Friday, et fuisse per dominum papam ('and was received by the Pope'). That is possible. Baluze then quotes Thomas Walsingham as saying, et sequenti proxima Parasceve Johannem regem Franciae cum aliis regibus et proceribus crucesignavit. That is to say, they took the cross on Holy Saturday. But no Mass is said on Holy Saturday either. Cardinal de Talleyrand was appointed Apostolic Legate for the expedition, but he died on 17 January 1364, before the expedition could set out.Baluze, I, p. 779 [ed Mollat, II, p. 281]. Eubel, I, p. 16. King John returned to prison in England and died in London on April 8, 1364.Baluze (1693), I, p. 386 ('Third Life of Urban V'). Cardinal de Talleyrand's Testament stated that he wished to be buried in the Cathedral of Saint-Front in P√©rigueux, but, if he died at Avignon or its neighborhood, he wished to lie in state in the House of the Franciscans in Avignon, and then he wished his body to be transferred to Saint-Front.Duchesne, Preuves, p. 315. There is today no sign of his place of burial. Legacy: the Coll√®ge de P√©rigord On 5 October 1375 Pope Gregory XI granted faculties to Cardinals Pierre de Salue de Monteruc and Jean de Cros to proceed with the organization and founding of the Coll√®ge de P√©rigord at Toulouse, for which Cardinal Talleyrand had provided in his Testament.Baluze (1693), I, p. 936 [ed. Mollat II, p. 452]. As Pope Gregory ordered, based on Talleyrand's wishes, there were to be twenty students who were to be poor clerics; they were to be provided with four chaplains, and were to be served by seven domestics. Ten of the clerics were to study Civil Law, and ten were to study Canon Law. Ten of the students were to be chosen from the diocese of P√©rigueux, the other ten from elsewhere. They were chosen by the Count of P√©rigueux, and if he did not fill a vacancy within three months, the choice was to be made by the Chancellor of the University of Toulouse. Every candidate was subject to approval by the Chancellor and by a majority of the current students. The students could stay in the college from twelve to fifteen years, according to the statutes of the University of Toulouse for a doctorate in Law. The chaplains were chosen by the students. More than 34,000 livres tournois were invested on behalf of the College by the Cardinal's executors.Meusnier, pp. 212-214.

Expressionism is a modernist movement in drama and theatre that developed in Europe (principally Germany) in the early decades of the 20th century and later in the United States. It forms part of the broader movement of Expressionism in the arts. History There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century German theatre of which Georg Kaiser and Ernst Toller were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included Reinhard Sorge, Walter Hasenclever, Hans Henny Jahnn, and Arnolt Bronnen. They looked back to Swedish playwright August Strindberg and German actor and dramatist Frank Wedekind as precursors of their dramaturgical experiments. Oskar Kokoschka's Murderer, the Hope of Women was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in Vienna.Berghaus (2005, 55-57). In it, an unnamed man and woman struggle for dominance. The Man brands the woman; she stabs and imprisons him. He frees himself and she falls dead at his touch. As the play ends, he slaughters all around him (in the words of the text) \\"like mosquitoes.\\" The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was The Son by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.Rorrison (1998, 475) and Sch√ºrer (1997b, ix, xiv). In the 1920s, Expressionism enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the theatre of the United States, including plays by Eugene O'Neill (The Hairy Ape, The Emperor Jones and The Great God Brown), Sophie Treadwell (Machinal), Lajos Egri (Rapid Transit) and Elmer Rice (The Adding Machine). Style Expressionist plays often dramatize the spiritual awakening and sufferings of their protagonists and are referred to as Stationendramen (station dramas), modeled on the episodic presentation of the suffering and death of Jesus in the Stations of the Cross. August Strindberg had pioneered this form with his autobiographical trilogy To Damascus (1898-1904). Early expressionism in particular testified to the failure of social valuesStyan, J.L., (1981) ‚ÄúExpressionism and Epic Theatre‚Äù: Modern Drama in Theory and Practice, vol. 3, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. with a predilection for ecstasy and despair and hence a tendency towards the inflated and the grotesque; a mystical, even religious element with frequent apocalyptic overtones; an urgent sense of the here and now.Furness, R.S., (1973) Expressionism (Critical Idiom), London: Methuen Young Books. The plays often dramatise the struggle against bourgeois values and established authority, often personified in the figure of the Father. In Reinhard Sorge's The Beggar (Der Bettler), the young hero's mentally ill father raves about the prospect of mining the riches of Mars and is eventually poisoned by his son. In Arnolt Bronnen's Parricide (Vatermord), the son stabs his tyrannical father to death, only to have to fend off the frenzied sexual overtures of his mother. In Expressionist drama, the speech is heightened, whether expansive and rhapsodic, or clipped and telegraphic. Director Leopold Jessner became famous for his Expressionistic productions, often unfolding on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (an idea originally developed by Edward Gordon Craig), which quickly became his trademark.

Since its foundation, six Nobel Prize laureates worked at the Institute: Otto Fritz Meyerhof (Physiology), Richard Kuhn (Chemistry), Walther Bothe (Physics), Andr√© Michel Lwoff (Physiology or Medicine), Rudolf M√∂√übauer (Physics), Bert Sakmann (Physiology or Medicine) and Stefan W. Hell (Chemistry).  History  The institute was opened in 1930 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, and was re-founded as a Max Planck Institute in 1948. Its original goal was to apply the methods of Physics and Chemistry to basic medical research, e.g. radiation therapy for cancer treatment, and it included departments of Chemistry, Physiology, and Biophysics. In the 1960s, new developments in biology were reflected with the establishment of the Department of Molecular Biology. Toward the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s, investigations began into the specific functions of muscle and nerve cells. New departments were established in Cell Physiology (1989-2008), Molecular Cell Research (1992-1999), Molecular Neurobiology (1995), Biomedical Optics (1999) and Biomolecular Mechanisms (2002). The independent junior research groups for Ion Channel Structure (1997-2003) and Developmental Genetics of the Nervous System (1999-2005) were also founded.  The Present  The institute currently has four departments: Biomolecular Mechanisms (Ilme Schlichting), Chemical Biology (Kai Johnsson), Cellular Biophysics (Joachim Spatz) and Optical Nanoscopy (Stefan W. Hell). With the appointment of three new directors in the last few years, the institute has experienced a major reorientation. The new, central topic of research is to observe in real time and manipulate the complex dynamics of the interactions between macromolecules in the living cell, in health and disease. The four departments work in complementary areas: the determination of atomic structures (Ilme Schlichting), optical nanoscopy (Stefan Hell), design of new reporter molecules (Kai Johnson) and cellular material research and biophysics (Joachim Spatz). This institute-wide project involves developing tools for biomedical research.  Departments = Biomolecular Mechanisms  In the general excitement of a time when three-dimensional protein structures of whole genomes are being determined automatically, it is often forgotten that a structure in itself does not tell one how the molecule works or folds.  Chemical Biology  The Department of Chemical Biology focusses on the visualization and manipulation of biological activities in live cells. The in vivo localization and quantification of protein activities, metabolites and other important parameters has become a central quest in biology, but the majority of cellular processes remain invisible, to date.  Cellular Biophysics  The primary scientific goal of the department is to develop technologies, based on physics, chemistry and materials science, for unraveling fundamental problems in cellular science, biomedical science and the engineering of life-like materials. For example, the department fundamentally investigates the organization and decision-making processes of cell collectives and organoides as well as the assembly and function of synthetic cells, designer immune cells and tissues.  Optical Nanoscopy  The Department of Optical Nanoscopy is focused on conceiving, exploring, validating and applying optical microscopy methods with resolution far beyond the classical diffraction limit. The primary scientific direction of this new department is to push the performance of nano-optical molecular analysis in (living) cells and tissues.  Independent Junior Research Groups  There are currently no independent junior research groups at the institute.  Research- and Working Groups  * Group Thomas Barends * Group R. Bruce Doak * Group Tatiana Domratcheva * Group Matthias Fischer * Group Inaam Nakchbandi * Group Jochen Reinstein * Group Rolf Sprengel  Emeritus Groups = Emeritus Group Biophysics  The Emeritus Group on Biophysics (led by Prof. Dr. Kenneth C. Holmes) focuses on structures of actin and myosin at atomic resolution.  Facilities = Light Microscopy  The Light microscopy Facility of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research aims to provide Institute members and guests \\"low threshold\\" access to sophisticated microscopy and data analysis equipment, to provide support and training related to sample preparation, data recording and analysis and to stimulate communication and exchange of experience.

It was created by Marion Pearce and Jon Randall. It is a quarterly magazine published on the dates of the old festivals of Imbolc, Beltaine, Lammas and Samhain, and has a worldwide distribution of 2,500. It was conceived to provide an independent voice for today's Pagan, those not wanting to be told what to believe by the two main organisation-backed pagan magazines of the time. Pentacle has published articles on folklore, ritual, magic, archaeology. Articles have covered many aspects of pagan traditions, including , Druidry, and other classical and modern traditions. The magazine has also included announcements of workshops, conferences, moots, festivals, activities, training, groups and exchange magazines. Most of the articles have been once again aimed at the beginner/intermediate level reader, often written by the Pagan community and readership, whose members cover many levels of expertise. Furthermore, it has contained a large amount of pagan and visionary art throughout, supporting all levels and abilities. History Marion Pearce, the first editor (now the publisher) has included art, animal welfare and poetry. She has also included many articles on archaeology and historical folk practices. She stood down as editor in 2006 to allow the magazine to grow internationally. The subsequent editor, Jon Randall, further expanded the remit of the magazine to include herbalism, counseling and science-backed therapies. This was achieved through a more rigorous academic methodology, contrasted by a more hands-on approach to Paganism as a religion and life choice. His style was more hard-hitting than the previous editor, and he tended to \\"call it as he saw it\\", leading to the inclusion of more in-depth articles that challenged and stretched the readership. As of January 2010, Jon Randall resigned from his position as Designer and Editor. In the meantime, Marion Pearce took over the reins again as editor. There has been a new forum and Facebook page, where readers can contribute ideas for the kind of content they would like to see included. The relaunched magazine has been described there in the following manner: : Back will be the informative articles, with wide ranging pagan and archaeological news, poetry, and classified sections, all illustrated in full colour by high class art work. Back too will be a regular environmental feature. There will also be a new regular feature on sacred sites throughout the UK. All you need to know about the pagan community in the UK - in one magazine. Pentacle has supported the PaganDASH initiative to have Paganism counted in the UK Census 2011.

Proceedings International Conference on Software Engineering 2004 Reprint is a proprietary set of program transformation tools available for automating custom source program analysis, modification, translation or generation of software systems for arbitrary mixtures of source languages for large scale software systems. Usage DMS has been used to implement a wide variety of practical tools, include domain- specific languages (such as code generation for factory control), test coverageBranch Coverage for Arbitrary Languages Made Easy and profiling tools, clone detection, language migration tools, C++ component reengineering., and for research into difficult topics such as refactoring C++ reliably.Small Business Innovation Research (DoE): Refactor++ The toolkit provides means for defining language grammars and will produce parsers which automatically construct abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and prettyprinters to convert original or modified ASTs back into compilable source text. The parse trees capture, and the prettyprinters regenerate, complete detail about the original source program, including source position, comments, radix and format of numbers, etc., to ensure that regenerated source text is as recognizable to a programmer as the original text modulo any applied transformations. Many program analysis and transformation tools are limited to ASCII or Western European character sets such as ISO-8859; DMS can handle these as well as UTF-8, UTF-16, EBCDIC, Shift-JIS and a variety of Microsoft character encodings. DMS uses GLR parsing technology, enabling it to handle all practical context-free grammars. Semantic predicates extend this capability to interesting non-context-free grammars (Fortran requires matching of multiple DO loops with shared CONTINUE statements by label; GLR with semantic predicates enables the DMS Fortran parser to produce ASTs for correctly nested loops as it parses). DMS provides attribute grammar evaluators for computing custom analyses over ASTs, such as metrics, and including special support for symbol table construction. Other program facts can be extracted by built-in control- and data- flow analysis engines, local and global pointer analysis, whole-program call graph extraction, and symbolic range analysis by abstract interpretation. Changes to ASTs can be accomplished by both procedural methods coded in PARLANSE and source-to-source tree transformations coded as rewrite rules using surface-syntax conditioned by any extracted program facts, using DMS's Rule Specification Language (RSL). The rewrite rule engine supporting RSL handles associative and commutative rules. A rewrite rule for C to replace a complex condition by the \`?:\` operator be written as: rule simplify_conditional_assignment(v:left_hand_side,e1:expression,e2:expression,e3:expression) :statement->statement = \\" if (\\\\e1) \\\\v=\\\\e2; else \\\\v=e3; \\" -> \\" \\\\v=\\\\e1?\\\\e2:\\\\e3; \\" if no_side_effects(v); Rewrite rules have names, e.g. simplify_conditional_assignment. Each rule has a \\"match this\\" and \\"replace by that\\" pattern pair separated by ->, in our example, on separate lines for readability. The patterns must correspond to language syntax categories; in this case, both patterns must be of syntax category statement also separated in sympathy with the patterns by ->. Target language (e.g., C) surface syntax is coded inside meta-quotes \\", to separate rewrite-rule syntax from that of the target language. Backslashes inside meta-quotes represent domain escapes, to indicate pattern meta variables (e.g., \\\\v, \\\\e1, \\\\e2) that match any language construct corresponding to the metavariable declaration in the signature line, e.g., e1 must be of syntactic category: (any) expression. If a metavariable is mentioned multiple times in the match pattern, it must match to identical subtrees; the same identically shaped v must occur in both assignments in the match pattern in this example. Metavariables in the replace pattern are replaced by the corresponding matches from the left side. A conditional clause if provides an additional condition that must be met for the rule to apply, e.g., that the matched metavariable v, being an arbitrary left-hand side, must not have a side effect (e.g., cannot be of the form of a[i++]; the no_side_effects predicate is defined by an analyzer built with other DMS mechanisms). Achieving a complex transformation on code is accomplished by providing a number of rules that cooperate to achieve the desired effect. The ruleset is focused on portions of the program by metaprograms coded in PARLANSE. A complete example of a language definition and source-to-source transformation rules defined and applied is shown using high school algebra and a bit of calculus as a domain-specific language. DMS has a variety of predefined language front ends, covering most real dialects of C and C++ including C++0x, C#, Java, Python, PHP, EGL, Fortran, COBOL, Visual Basic, Verilog, VHDL and some 20 or more other languages. Predefined languages enable customizers to immediately focus on their reengineering task rather than on the details of the languages to be processed. DMS is additionally unusual in being implemented in a parallel programming language, PARLANSE, that uses symmetric multiprocessors available on commodity workstations. This enables DMS to provide faster answers for large system analyses and conversions.

Early life and career Schottelkotte grew up in the western Cincinnati suburb of Cheviot. His news career began on his 16th birthday in 1943 while a sophomore in high school. During the height of World War II he was hired as a copy boy for The Cincinnati Enquirer. One month later he was promoted to general assignment reporter, making Schottelkotte the youngest journalist at that time for any major American newspaper. He ultimately attended three high schools, including St. Xavier, but left without graduating to focus on journalism. In 1950, he began a two-year stint in the Army, serving in Korea giving lectures on current affairs. This experience, upon his return to Cincinnati, led to Schottelkotte's being hired by WSAI radio to anchor their evening newscast. He returned to the Enquirer and became a full-time columnist with his \\"Talk of the Town\\" column, which lasted several years. Television career Ten years after WCPO-TV went on the air in 1949, general manager Mort Watters encouraged Schottelkotte to move to television, giving him the task of organizing the station's first news department, consisting of editor Marvin Arth, photographer Frank Jones, and Schottelkotte himself as news director and anchor for their 11 p.m. newscast. For a time, Schottelkotte continued to write for the Enquirer, but by 1961 he had abandoned print journalism to focus on broadcasting. Schottelkotte's tireless work ethic, paired with his terse and prudent on-air delivery made him synonymous with Cincinnati television news, and easily earned him the nickname \\"The Voice of Cincinnati\\". Within one year of becoming news anchor at Channel 9, Schottelkotte supplanted WLWT's Peter Grant as the number one news anchor in Cincinnati. Schottelkotte's newscasts, which would bear his name, consistently led in TV ratings from 1960 to 1982, with shares sometimes leading all of the competing Cincinnati newscasts combined. He was unseated as Cincinnati's news leader in 1982 by WKRC-TV's anchor, Nick Clooney, a long-time talk show favorite in Cincinnati and father of actor George Clooney. 1975 TV Guide ad for \\"The Al Schottelkotte News\\" For many years Schottelkotte anchored the news six days a week (Sunday through Friday), making him far and away the most visible news anchor in Cincinnati. Over time, he took to beginning each newscast with a precis of the day's headlines, and then ending with his signature signoff: \\"That's it for now. So until tomorrow, may it all be good news... to you.\\" Innovations Schottelkotte contributed to numerous pioneering facets of local news: *The Spotlight Report, which he created for radio in 1953. He brought it to television and continued it until he ended his broadcast career in 1994. *He spearheaded the expansion of WCPO's newscasts to a half-hour (from 15 minutes) and created newscast slots at 6 p.m. and even a \\"noon report\\" broadcast, which he himself anchored until 1967 (at the time a newscast at noon was rare in television news). *Schottelkotte relied heavily on visuals, believing they drew more attention to a given story and away from Schottelkotte himself. The WCPO news staff had acquired a library of over 50,000 pieces of film footage and countless slides of noted personalities and local landmarks. *By 1967, Schottelkotte was promoted to general manager of Scripps Howard's fledgling news division. Under his management, WCPO operated the Newsbird, one of the first news helicopters in the U.S. *Schottelkotte was credited with the creation or co-creation of several local programs, both news and non-news oriented. Eric Land, a longtime reporter at WCPO, later said that he modeled the fast-paced format at WIAT in Birmingham, Alabama, on Schottelkotte's newscasts when he became the station's general manager.Lafayette, Jon. \\"News guru whacks WIAT-TV\\", Electronic Media February 16, 1998, pp. 32‚Äì33. Notable appearances Schottelkotte became so popular that he appeared in Gunsmoke as a bailiff in the episode \\"Old Man\\", which aired October 10, 1964,Friedman, Jim (2007), \\"Images of America: Cincinnati Television\\", page 99. Arcadia Publishing, and also made a cameo radio broadcast as himself (even mentioning WCPO's call letters) in the January 6, 1966 \\"Not Guilty\\" episode of Gilligan's Island. In 1973, when the Rembrandt painting \\"Portrait of an Elderly Woman\\" was stolen from the Taft Museum, a local man having found the painting called Schottelkotte personally and produced the portrait to him live on an 11 o'clock newscast; the painting was confirmed to be genuine by then-museum committee chairman John Warrington. In May 1976, Schottelkotte interviewed President Gerald R. Ford at the White House. During a 1977 newscast, an intruder barged into the studio shouting as Schottelkotte began narrating a film report. He punched the prowler with one hand while muting his microphone with the other so viewers could not hear it. The intruder fled and Schottelkotte, unperturbed, continued with the newscast. In the early morning of October 15, 1980, WCPO and most of its news staff became part of a major news story when armed gunman James Hoskins seized control of WCPO's newsroom taking nine hostages including reporter Elaine Green and her cameraman. During a taped interview with Green, Hoskins stated he and his girlfriend (whom he admitted to killing right before seizing the newsroom) planned to cause deadly chaos in Cincinnati. After voicing his displeasure with local authority, Hoskins agreed to let the hostages go, and the eight-hour standoff ended when Hoskins killed himself while on the phone with SWAT negotiators. Schottelkotte ran special newscasts from WCPO's parking lot throughout the morning. =Other= In 1983 Schottelkotte made an unusual cameo in Dan Barr's music video, \\"Bus Full of Nuns\\" lip-synching the chorus while sitting at a nondescript anchor desk.

He continued as anchor for the 6 p.m. news for four more years before anchoring his final newscast in August 1986. He continued doing the Spotlight Report until 1994. Personal life Born in the Cincinnati suburb of Cheviot to Dutch parents, Schottelkotte was reared in the Roman Catholic faith. He married his first wife, Virginia Gleason, in July 1951 and had 12 children, six sons and six daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, one-time WCPO reporter Elaine Green, won a Peabody award in 1981 for her interview with armed gunman James Hoskins during the October 1980 hostage situation in WCPO's newsroom. By this marriage, Schottelkotte had two stepchildren.Profile , scripps.com; accessed July 31, 2014.

Joe franchise since 1996's G.I. Joe Extreme. Story and theme-wise, it was a continuation of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series. G.I. Joe vs. Cobra was preceded by a limited run Toys R Us exclusive line that made use of previous molds for production of G.I. Joe action figures in 1997 and 1998, as well as the 2000-2001 \\"Real American Hero Collection\\" 2-packs, which were available at mass retail. Despite having no major G.I. Joe toy releases, Devil's Due Publishing managed to acquire the license to produce new G.I. Joe comic books. The new comics' success and the media attention it spawned fueled renewed interest in G.I. Joe, and led to the production of a new line of toys featuring both old and new characters. New sculptures and body architecture were utilized for the line. The G.I. Joe vs. Cobra line ran for three years, before being phased out and replaced with the successor line G.I. Joe: Sigma 6. In that time, it was supported by the new comic series and two direct-to-video CGI animated movies. It was also supplemented by several Toys R Us and convention exclusives. Each year of the line‚Äôs release centered on a different theme on the G.I. Joe/Cobra conflict. During the new sculpt era, Hasbro launched G.I. Joe. com that has G. I vs. Cobra games. G.I. Joe vs. Cobra Released in 2002, G.I. Joe vs. Cobra was borne out of the success of Devil‚Äôs Due‚Äôs G.I. Joe comics. The series brought back classic characters, as well as introduced new ones. For the first time, there was a theme to the toy line, this one focusing on the rivalries between members of the G.I. Joe Team and Cobra. The action figures were sold in two- packs carrying a G.I. Joe and a Cobra character. The file cards that came with them explained how their rivalry with each other began. The first wave of figures utilize T-crotch tooling similar to Hasbro's own Star Wars toyline, but the next wave brought back the classic O-ring to new molds, with some of the Wave 1 figures being retooled to accommodate the O-ring. The switch from T-crotch to O-ring resulted in a slight delay in the release of Wave 2. To compensate for this, Hasbro issued a Wave 1.5 consisting of repainted figure molds from the original A Real American Hero line that included characters such as General Tomahawk (a renamed Hawk due to trademark lost) and the Headman (who was rewritten as a Cobra agent). Figures released from Wave 2 and onward all included \\"Sound Attack\\" accessories, which contained sound chips that could be plugged-in into certain vehicles (such as the Night Attack Chopper) and play sound effects based on the weapon. The Sound Attack gimmick was abandoned during the final wave of the Spy Troops sub-line released the following year. A series of CGI animated commercials produced by Reel FX Creative Studios aired in 2002 to promote the new line of figures. The first commercial featured narration by Don LaFontaine. Spy Troops The toyline was re-titled as G.I. Joe vs. Cobra: Spy Troops for the second year. The G.I. Joe logo that has been used on the packaging for the A Real American Hero line since 1982 was replaced with the logo from the original 12-inch figure series, which depicted the face of the original Action Soldier figure above the \\"J\\". Most of the G.I. Joe vehicles released during the Spy Troops sub-line used this logo. The plot involved G.I. Joe and Cobra in espionage against each other via various disguises. Each two-pack featured either Joe with a Cobra disguise or a Cobra with a Joe disguise, or one figure with a camouflage coat to blend into the background. On the back of the box was the mission relating to the two characters. There was a direct-to-video computer-animated movie, G.I. Joe: Spy Troops released towards the end of the line. The line began to incorporate some of the characters from the comics, such as Kamakura and Crosshair. Valor vs. Venom G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom was the third and final series in the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra line. The \\"vs. Cobra\\" part of the title was dropped and the G.I. Joe logo was reverted to the A Real American Hero version. The central plot involved Cobra creating animal/human hybrid soldiers dubbed Venom Troopers (or V-Troops) via a mutagenic chemical known as Venom. G.I. Joe counters with advanced technology. Again, like Spy Troops, it was supported by a direct-to-video film, G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom. Some figures from this series were also available in single packs. The line was geared more towards children, by featuring the return of \\"Action Attack\\". Sub-lines=1:6 scale figures In addition to the standard 1:18 scale, G.I. Joe vs. Cobra characters were also released in a 1:6 scale similar to the Hall of Fame sub-line that was sold during the later years of the original A Real American Hero line between 1991 and 1995. Some of the 12-inch figures released in 2002 (namely Heavy Duty, Grunt, Dusty and Firefly) were actually holdovers from the short-lived Double Duty line sold in late 2001, which featured reversible clothing and transformable accessories. Built to Rule Built to Rule was a building blocks toyline from Hasbro that was marketed as \\"Action Building Sets\\". These sets were released from 2003 to 2005. All sets came with one set of building blocks which could be built into a full sized vehicle, and one specially designed 3 3/4 G.I. Joe figure. The forearms and the calves of the figures sport places where blocks could be attached. The 2003 Built To Rule followed the G.I. Joe: Spy Troops story line. Direct To Consumer/Toys \\"R\\" Us Exclusive line With the cancellation of the Valor vs Venom series Hasbro released a new series simply titled \\"G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero\\". Unlike the most of the previous G.I. JOE vs Cobra/Valor vs Venom series, these figures were released alone on a single card. Each wave of figures had three Joe agents, one named Cobra agent and two Cobra troops. and these Toys can only purchased from online retailers, and not from any retailers such as Toys\\"R\\"Us as of 2007 Figures from this series were initially only available from Hasbro.Com or other online toy shops. Because of this and to differentiate this series from the original Real American Hero line from the 80s and 90s fans dubbed it \\"Direct To Consumer\\" or \\"DTC\\". Later this series was also made available as a Toys \\"R\\" Us exclusive. The figures in this series were made from the same construction as the previous G.I. JOE vs Cobra/Valor vs Venom series and as such are seen as the most recent G.I. Joe vs. Cobra Line and a continuation of the G.I. JOE vs Cobra line, as fans expecting a new G.I. Joe vs. Cobra Line of Figures with a sequel to Valor vs Venom. The line incorporated molds from the unreleased \\"G.I. JOE Robot Rebellion\\" Line that was set to be launched during 2005, however it was put on hiatus and replaced by Sigma 6. DTC Wave 4 was cancelled and later released as G.I. Joe Club Exclusive. it is unknown when DTC Wave 5 will be launched. in 2011-2012 the G.I. Joe Club released a 25th Anniversary style DTC Barrel Roll. Comics The G.I. Joe vs. Cobra did not have a comic book publication that directly supported it. The Devil's Due series that began publication a year before its launch was simply a continuation of the original Marvel series and was not intended to be a tie-in to the toy line's subsequent revival. As a result, the comics' creative team did not have the same pressure from Hasbro in tying up the comics with the toy line. However, several characters and designs from the toy line did manage to be incorporated into the comics and vice versa. Starting with the second wave in 2002, carded figures included pamphlets that featured a mini-comic on one side and a product catalog on the other. All the mini-comics were written by Larry Hama, with the exception of \\"Valor vs. Venom: Part 1\\", which is attributed to Devil's Due Publishing with no particular writers credited. #Bombs Bursting in the Air!! #Ninja Showdown #Chief Torpedo vs. Burn Out #Roadblock Gets Heavy #Tanks for Nothing #Face 2 Face #Dawn of the V-Troops #Dawn of the V-Troops Part Two #Secret Base #Cold Front #Valor vs. Venom: Part 1 Due to the discontinuation of the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra toy line in favor of Sigma 6, the second part of the \\"Valor vs. Venom\\" comic was never produced. ReferencesSee also * List of G.I. Joe series Category:G.I.

Description The Par√¢ng Mountains are located in the south-western part of the Central-Meridional Carpathians. They are the tallest mountains from the local Par√¢ng-Cindrel mountain group and the second largest mountains in the Romanian Carpathians after the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains. They are situated between the »òureanu Mountains (north), Latori»õei Mountains (north-east), CƒÉpƒÉ»õ√¢nii Mountains (east), V√¢lcan Mountains (west) and the Petro»ôani Depression in the north-west. Located south and east of the city of Petro»ôani, the Par√¢ng Mountains form the eastern barrier of the Jiu Valley (a plateau 100 kilometers long from east to west and 70-80 kilometers wide from north to south). Geology 360¬∞ panorama of the Par√¢ng mountains- a mosaic of 23 individual images, taken from the GƒÉuri peak (2244m). The peak to which the ridge just right of the image center leads is Piatra TƒÉiatƒÉ (2255m). On the right, half of the Ghere»ôu saddle (2113m) is visible, leading up to the main Par√¢ng ridge, of which the first peak, Lesu (2375m) is barely visible because of the cloud cover. Just to the right, but almost entirely obscured by clouds, is the talles peak from the mountain group: Par√¢ngu Mare (2519m). On the left of the Piatra TƒÉiatƒÉ peak the Setea Mohor main ridge is visible, with the two most prominent peaks in this image being (from right to left): Setea MicƒÉ (2278m) and Setea Mare (2365m).. The Par√¢ng Mountains consist predominantly of crystalline rocks, peripherally covered with patches of sediments from the Paleozoic, Mesozoic (massive limestone, conglomerates) and Cenozoic eras, mixed with large areas of granite outcrops. On the southern slope, sedimentary rocks from the Mesozoic era can be found, more exactly massive limestone from the Jurassic period. The newest rocks are found on the southern frame of the mountains and in the north-west, where it is bordered by the Petrosani Depression. The nature of the rocks favored the emergence of bulk, rounded ridges, separated by deep valleys. The mountains present an overall asymmetry, with the northern front more steepen, with short ridges, while the southern facade is less inclined and with longer ridge. Especially in the southern part, the slopes are composed of several steps.Alexandru Ro≈üu, Geografia FizicƒÉ a Rom√¢niei. (Trans: The Physical Geography of Romania), 1980, II edition, Ed. DidacticƒÉ & PedagocicƒÉ Bucure≈üti.Mihai Ielenicz, Ileana PƒÉtru, Rom√¢nia - Geografie FizicƒÉ, (Trans: Romania - Physical Geography), 2005, Ed. Universitara, Climate=Temperatures Par√¢ng Mountains 3D The general layout of the main ridge on a west-east axis and its altitudes of over 2000m makes the Par√¢ng mountains an orographic dam in the way of the air masses that flow on the north to north-west and south to south-west directions. Also, the asymmetry of the main ridge, with the steep side to the north, leads to the receiving of different amounts of heat and moisture, more on the southern side. The sun shines approximately 1800‚Äì2000 hours/year, the highest temperatures being recorded in July and August. The average annual temperature is 6 ¬∞C at the bottom of the mountain and 0 ¬∞C at altitudes around 1800m. Above 2000m, the average temperature is below 0 ¬∞C. The difference between the recorded average temperatures of the southern and northern slopes is around 1-2 ¬∞C. Precipitations The average annual rainfall is between 900 and 1200mm. The most abundant rainfall is recorded around the altitude of 1600m to 1800m. June is the month with the highest precipitations, 110mm at the bottom of the mountain and 160mm at altitudes over 1500m. It snows on average 90 days per year above the altitude of 1500m. The first snow comes during the first half of October, while the last one during the first half of May (above 1500m) or late April at lower altitudes. At high altitudes the snow is present on average for 200 days each year. The thickness of the snow layer depends on the weather conditions, the exposure of the slopes to the winds, exposure to the sun, snowfall etc. At over 1500m, the average thickness is greater than 1m. Wind The wind intensity is high all around the year. Above 2000m, the westers winds are dominant, while below this threshold, the wind direction and intensity are influenced by the mountain relief. Above 2000m, the average wind speed is 8‚Äì10 m/s. During the cold season, the wind speed may reach 15 m/s and above on some ridges. Flora In close connection with the relief characteristics of the Par√¢ng mountains, the vegetation is clearly shaped into three layers. The first layer is the broadleaf forest, which starts from the bottom of the mountains and goes as high as 1200m (northern slope) and 1400m (southern slope). They are made up of pedunculate oak, European hornbeam, silver birch and, the most common, but mostly spread on the southern slope, the European beech. The second layer mostly extended on the northern and western slopes, between 1000m and 1750m, and is composed of norway spruce forests and, locally, european silver fir. In the Par√¢ng mountains, the tree line is situated between 1600m and 1800m. Above this limit are located the subalpine and Alpine grasslands. The vegetation here is made up of krummholz trees, such as swiss pine, european larch, mountain pine and net-leaved willow, but also mountain cranberry, green alder and bilberry. Also common are grass family members, such as bentgrass, tufted fescue and highland rush. On limestone rich areas, edelweiss can be found.I. Sircu, Geografia FizicƒÉ a Republicii Socialiste Rom√¢niei. (Trans: The Physical Geography of the Socialist Republic of Romania), 1971, Ed. DidacticƒÉ & PedagocicƒÉ Bucure≈üti. Fauna The southern Charpatians fauna is characteristic also to the Par√¢ng mountains. Among mammals, the grey wolf, fox, wild boar, brown bear, eurasian lynx and red deer can be found.

In his 20s he played first-class cricket while at university and for several seasons afterwards. He was the stepfather of Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Early life Williams was born on 9 February 1933, the son of N. P. Williams and Muriel de L√©risson Cazenove. His mother's brother was Brigadier Arnold de L√©risson Cazenove. He was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in literae humaniores in 1955 and a Master of Arts. Williams was further educated at the London School of Economics, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1964. Between 1955 and 1957, he served as Subaltern in the Headquarters of the King's Royal Rifle Corps in Winchester and in the regiment's 1st Battalion in Derna in Libya. Cricket career A right-handed middle order batsman, Williams played 87 first-class cricket matches, 40 of them for Essex and 42 for Oxford University. He made his first- class debut for Oxford University about halfway through the 1952 university cricket season and hit 53 in his first match, against Sussex in The Parks. In the return match at Worthing, he made 74, but he did not retain his place and he was not selected for the University Match against Cambridge. When the university cricket season was over, Williams played for Oxfordshire in the Minor Counties. In 1953, Williams played regularly for the university side and in the match against Free Foresters, an itinerant amateur side of varying quality whose matches against the universities were considered first-class at this time, he made his first century, scoring 115 in a match ruined by rain. In the University Match, he made 40 and 5 as Oxford lost by two wickets in a close finish. The 1954 season saw Williams achieve 1,000 runs in the season for the first time: he finished with 1128 at an average of 30.48 runs per innings. He was particularly successful for Oxford University, batting generally at No 3 and scoring 115 against Lancashire and then an unbeaten 139 followed by 89 in the second innings in the match against Hampshire. He was not successful in the University Match, batting just once and scoring 14. Later in the summer, he played in 11 matches for Essex, but his highest score for the county was only 54. Williams was captain of the Oxford University cricket team in his final year at the university, 1955. The team was not successful, failing to win any of its first-class matches, and Williams' captaincy attracted some criticism in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. \\"The weather was certainly against them, and in all their ten home games none was played through without some interference from rain and, altogether, nine and a half days of playing time were lost,\\" Wisden wrote. \\"That in itself may have undermined the determination of the side, though a more likely handicap to the individual players was the length of time C. C. P. Williams took to decide who would be in the XI to meet Cambridge. The freshmen were particularly affected and when the weeks passed and they were still playing for their places none of them was able to relax and play a natural game.\\" Williams started the season well with 120 in the first match, against Gloucestershire. But his form declined and Oxford had the worse of a drawn University Match, though Williams' own second innings 47 not out helped save the game for his side. After the university season was over, he again played for Essex, and scored his first century in County Championship cricket, making 119 and sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 200 with Doug Insole in the match against Leicestershire at Leicester. The 1955 season was, in all, Williams' most successful: he made 1219 runs at an average of 31.25, both his highest seasonal aggregate and average. In 1956 and 1957, Williams was on National Service. In the 1956 season, he played a couple of matches for the Combined Services cricket team, making an unbeaten 125 in the match against Warwickshire. There were also a few matches in this season for Essex and one for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's; at the end of the season, he played in two matches at the Scarborough Festival, one for MCC against Yorkshire in which he was used unsuccessfully as an opening batsman, and the second the Gentlemen v Players match in which he made 0 and 1. These were his only games of representative cricket. In 1957, he played no first-class cricket at all. Williams returned to first-class cricket in the second half of the 1958 season, playing 10 matches for Essex and adding what Wisden called \\"extra stability\\" to the county's batting. In 1959, he reappeared for four matches, but with no success, and these were his final first-class matches. Williams had been an amateur cricketer and played for the Gentlemen against the Players. Social change after the Second World War led to a reaction against the cricketing concept of amateurism, often disparaged as \\"shamateurism\\", and in 1963 all first-class cricketers became nominally professional as, in effect, \\"Players\\". The last edition of the annual Gentlemen v Players fixture was at Scarborough in September 1962. The events leading to the abolition of amateurism are described by Williams in his 2012 book, Gentlemen & Players, appropriately subtitled The Death of Amateurism in Cricket. Business career Williams worked for British Petroleum Co. Ltd from 1958 to 1964. From 1964 to 1966, he was personal assistant to the manager of the Guatemala branch of the Bank of London and Montreal and from 1966 to 1970, he was manager of mergers and acquisitions of Eurofinance SA Paris. For Baring Bros & Co. Ltd, he worked between 1970 and 1977, as managing director from 1971. From 1977 to 1979, he was chairman of the Price Commission and from 1985 to 1992 director of Mirror Group Newspapers plc. Between 1979 and 1982, he was managing director of Henry Ansbacher & Co. Ltd and between 1982 and 1985 of Henry Ansbacher Holdings. Public service In the 1964 General Election, Williams stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as the Labour Party candidate for Colchester. In 1976 he unsuccessfully attempted to become the Labour candidate for the Vauxhall constituency.Chris Mullin, Hinterland, 2017 From 1988 to 1990, Williams was chair of the Academy of St Martin-in-the- Fields and from 1989 to 1999 Busby trustee of Westminster School. For the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales (CPRW), he was president between 1989 and 1995, and had been immediate past president and vice-president as well as president of its Radnor branch since 1995. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1980, he was created a life peer on 22 May 1985 taking the title Baron Williams of Elvel, of Llansantffraed in Elvel in the County of Powys. He sat in the House of Lords as a Labour peer. In 2013 he was appointed to the Privy Council. Personal life In 1975, he married Jane Gillian Portal.

The brand manufactures bolt couplings,hook couplings, drawbar eyes, underrund protections and accessories . Ringfeder is part of VBG Truck Equipment, one of the divisions in the VBG Group, a large is an international industrial group.  Description  A bolt coupling device comprises a drawbar, a swivelable cast \\"bell\\" with a horizontal opening in the middle, a machined pin or \\"bolt\\", an automatic pin release mechanism, a safety locking device with actuating handle and a cushioned mounting plate. The design of the pin allows articulation of up to 70 degrees around the drawbar eye in the pitch and yaw directions. The coupling can also rotate through 360 degrees in roll.  Mechanism  A Ringfeder underrun protection with round beam This is the drawbar eye, the part of the drawbar that goes inside the Ringfeder coupling and the locking pin drops into the loop. A Ringfeder is typically mounted to a specially designed and built crossmember on the rear of the vehicle. This could be on the rear of a rigid truck, prime mover or trailer. This mount also includes air, electrical and, if necessary, hydraulic fittings. Firstly, the vehicle is reversed up to the drawbar of the trailer/dolly, stopping short of hitting. The height of the drawbar is checked, and adjusted accordingly. The safety catch handle on the upper left of the Ringfeder is pulled out and turned 90 degrees, and then allowed to return into the upper detent on the shaft collar. This then allows the actuator handle on the right of the body to be lifted to the stop. This pulls the bolt upwards, and sets the automatic tripping function. The Ringfeder is now ready to be coupled. The vehicle is reversed slowly until the drawbar eye enters the bell, tripping the bolt and closing the coupling. A check is made of the coupling to ensure full engagement, air lines and electrics hooked up and drawbar leg stowed.  Uses  Ringfeders are used in nearly all aspects of world transport, the most common being LGVs (large goods vehicles) throughout Europe, and road trains in Australia. America uses a similar product known as a \\"pintle hook\\" or tow hitch.

Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Patan has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 83%, and female literacy is 73%.

SE; p. 3,630) on the Karad-Kumbharli road at the junction of the Koyna and Kera rivers about twenty-five miles south-west of Satara was formerly a sub-divisional headquarters. The town consists of two parts (i) Rampur and (ii) Patan. History The Patankar family was originally in two branches, of which the elder branch alone flourished. The younger branch represented by Hanmantrav resided in Rampur. His mansion, a fine large house was completely destroyed by fire in 1874. Next to it on the south is the mansion of Sardar Nagojirav Patankar, a first-class sardar and honorary magistrate who exercised civil jurisdiction in his area. The mansion with strong high stone walls and ramparts and a gateway flanked by bastions, is well maintained. A rose and plantain garden has been laid out close to it. The Patankars were the deshmukhs under the Marathas of the whole surrounding district and had charge of Dategad fort three miles to the north-west. During the struggles between the Peshvas and the Pratinidhis they did pretty much what they pleased. The elder branch is one of the few prosperous Maratha families in the district. There is no historical mention of Patan. But title deeds show that the Bijapur kings had a well established rule here. The district was assigned to the Pratinidhi by Ram Raja but was wrested from him by the Peshva after the rebellion of Yemaji Shivdev Mutalik in 1750 [ Grant Duff's Marathas Vol. I, 447.]. It was not finally secured to the Peshva till the time of Bapu Gokhale. Throughout the eighteenth century both the authorities issued contradictory orders but the carrying out of these orders largely rested on the will of the Patankars alone. Town The town has a number of public buildings viz., three primary schools, two for boys and one for girls, four high schools in which one is newly formed English medium school, one college, two training colleges, the Nagojirav Vachanalaya, a primary health centre with a family planning center and a maternity home, a District Local Board dispensary, District Judge's court and a number of other offices, Besides of this there is also a big sport complex, a drama hall, banking facilities, Cottage hospital, e.g. Block Development office, Mamlatdar's office, District Local Board office, Post and telegraph office, etc. There is an inspection bungalow and a bridge is built recently on the Kera river.

The Act determines who is, or is eligible to be, a citizen of Singapore. The Act replaced the previous Singapore Citizenship Ordinance 1957 in 1965 from the Constitution of Singapore. Singaporean citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Singapore based on the principle of jus sanguinis, or birth abroad when at least one parent is a Singapore citizen or by adoption by at least one Singaporean citizen. It can also be granted to a permanent resident who has lived in Singapore for a period of time through registration. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is the department of the Government of Singapore responsible for citizenship-related matters, including confirmation, grant, renunciation and revocation of citizenship. History of Singaporean citizenship Singaporean citizenship was first granted in 1959 when Singapore was a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom. At that time, Singapore had already been granted full internal self-government. The Singapore Citizenship Ordinance Act of 1957 provided Singaporean citizenship to all residents who were born in Singapore or the Straits Settlements, British citizens who had been resident for two years, and others who had been resident for ten years., ch. 10 (\\"Road to Independence\\"). Singaporeans were still considered British subjects at that time, and their passports had nationality status of \\"British subject: citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\\". All Singaporean citizens became Malaysian citizens on 16 September 1963 upon Singapore's merger with the latter on that date. Its nationality law provided that Singaporean citizenship to continue to exist as a sub-national citizenship. Singaporean citizenship continued to be legislated by the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, the state Parliament at the time. Upon Singapore's secession on 9 August 1965, Its citizenship was withdrawn from Singaporean citizens. Singaporean nationality law was incorporated into the new Constitution of Singapore. The constitution repealed the 1957 Ordinance, and all persons who were citizens as of 16 September 1963 by virtue of the Ordinance continued to be Singaporean citizens. The Constitution was amended in 2004 to allow female citizens and citizens by descent to transmit their citizenship to children born overseas. For this to occur, citizens by descent must satisfy certain residency requirements. Acquiring Singaporean citizenship There are four ways an individual can acquire Singaporean citizenship: by birth with at least one Singaporean parent; by descent (being born to a Singaporean); by registration; and by adoption. Among these, only citizenship by birth is granted automatically with limited exceptions, while citizenship by descent or adoption is acquired automatically if specified conditions have been met. Citizenship by registation, on the other hand, must be approved by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Citizenship by birth A person is a Singaporean citizen by birth if he or she is born in Singapore with at least one parent who is a Singaporean citizen provided both parents are registered officially as legally married. However, a child whose father is a foreign diplomat who enjoys immunity in Singapore will not be granted Singaporean citizenship even if his or her mother is Singaporean. The gender-specific language of this clause allows an unusual scenario where a child born in Singapore whose mother is a foreign diplomat and whose father is Singaporean will obtain Singaporean citizenship by birth but not if the gender roles are reversed. Citizenship by descent A person born outside Singapore on or after 15 May 2004, with at least one parent who is a Singaporean citizen, is a Singaporean citizen by descent. If the parent from whom the child derives citizenship is a Singaporean citizen by descent, the parent must have been resident in Singapore for a total of at least five years before the child's birth or a total of at least two years out of the five years immediately preceding the child's birth. A person born outside Singapore before 15 May 2004 will be a Singaporean citizen by descent only if his or her father was a Singaporean citizen by birth or by registration at the time of birth. If the parent from whom the child derives citizenship is a Singaporean citizen by registration, the child will be granted Singaporean citizenship by descent only if they do not acquire citizenship of the country of their birth. Citizenship by registration Registration is the term used in the Constitution to refer to the process commonly known as naturalisation. A person can apply for registration as a Singaporean citizen if he or she has been a Permanent Resident for at least two years and is gainfully employed or married to a Singaporean citizen. A male Permanent Resident may also apply upon satisfactory completion of full-time National Service, as may children of Singaporean citizens resident in Singapore. Each application is considered on its own merits. Citizenship by naturalisation Although provided for in the Constitution, citizenship by naturalisation is no longer granted. The government instead uses the constitutional provision for citizenship by registration to grant citizenship to residents. Dual citizenship The position of the Singapore Government is that dual citizenship is not allowed. The laws regarding Singapore citizenship are found in the Constitution of Singapore. A dual citizen may have acquired citizenship by birth in a foreign country, by descent from a foreign citizen parent, or by naturalisation. Singapore citizens who voluntarily and intentionally acquire citizenship of a foreign country after the age of 18 may be deprived of their Singapore citizenship by the Government.Article 134(1)(a) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Foreigners who naturalise as Singaporean citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.Article 126(1) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Persons who are born outside of Singapore and have at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen may register with a Singapore consulate within a year to acquire Singapore citizenship by descent. However, such persons must renounce their foreign citizenship, if any, before reaching 22 years of age. The Constitution of Singapore is silent on a Singapore citizen who acquired citizenship by birth and is a foreign citizen by descent. So long as such a person refrains from exercising the rights of foreign citizenship, the Government has no grounds for depriving them of his Singapore citizenship and they may hold on to dual citizenship.Articles 122(4) and 126(3) for Singaporean citizens by descent and registration respectively, no provision for Singaporean citizens by birth The prohibition of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship even though they may feel a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Immigrants who have been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenship may be reluctant to become naturalized citizens as it would mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries. The government argues that authorising its citizens to concurrently hold foreign nationalities would be undesirable since, due to Singapore's geopolitical position, it cannot afford to allow its citizens multiple allegiances which may be compromised in times of national crisis. The government also fears that those without a second citizenship may feel aggrieved if dual citizens enjoy the benefits of citizenship during periods of wealth but leave the country in trying times. Nevertheless, the government is open to the possibility of allowing dual citizenship if local and global circumstances demand so. Renunciation of citizenship Citizens of Singapore can only renounce Singaporean citizenship if they have acquired citizenship of another country. At the time of renunciation, renunciants must submit their Singaporean passports and National Registration Identity Cards for cancellation. Male Singaporeans cannot renounce their citizenship until completing national service as is the case with countries such as Austria, Switzerland and South Korea; however, exceptions are made for males who emigrated as an infant or at a young age. Commonwealth citizenship All Singaporean citizens are Commonwealth citizens and are entitled to certain rights in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. For example, they can vote in all elections, hold public office and serve on juries in the UK. Singaporeans are entitled to consular assistance from British embassies in non-Commonwealth countries without a Singaporean representative. These rights include: * The right, unless otherwise disqualified (e.g. imprisoned), to vote in all elections (i.e., parliamentary, local elections) as long as they have registered to vote (they must possess valid leave to enter/remain or not require such leave on the date of their electoral registration applicationRepresentation of the People Act 1983, Section 4(6)) * The right, unless otherwise disqualified, to stand for election to the British House of Commons as long as they possess indefinite leave to remain or do not require leave under the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) to enter or remain in the UK * The right, if a qualifying peer or bishop, to sit in the House of Lords * Eligibility to hold public office (e.g., as a judge, magistrate, minister, police constable, member of the armed forces, etc.) Other Commonwealth countries recognize Singaporean citizens as Commonwealth citizens, though the significance of this designation varies from one member state to another. For example, Singaporeans may be entitled to certain rights or privileges offered by the United Kingdom under British law, including: * The ability to join the British Armed Forces, subject to certain residency requirements. * If resident in the UK with indefinite leave to remain or right of abode, the ability to join the police service. * For those with a British-born grandparent, access to the UK Ancestry visa. * For those born before 1983 who meet the requirements, right of abode in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971. * If resident in the UK, the right to vote and stand for public office in the UK. * If in need of consular assistance in a country that does not have a Singaporean embassy and access to British consular service provided by the local branch of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  Rights and obligations of Singaporean citizens  Singapore passport Singaporean citizens are entitled to *vote in general elections and referendums upon reaching the age of 21; *run for political office: the Parliament of Singapore, the State and Supreme Court; *obtain a Singapore passport and a National Registration Identity Card; *return to Singapore at any time; *avoid deportation from Singapore; *be able to live, work, study, buy property, and open up a business anywhere in the city-state; Male Singaporean citizens, including second- generation permanent residents, are required to perform military service (women can do it voluntarily). Singaporean citizens are not allowed to work for a foreign (non-Singaporean) military. Travel freedom of Singaporean citizens Visa requirements for Singapore Visa requirements for Singaporeans are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Singapore. According to the 2020 Henley Passport Index, holders of a Singapore passport had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 191 countries and territories, ranking Singapore 1st in travel freedom, tied with Japan. Singaporean nationality is ranked thirteenth, together with Luxembourg and Portugal, in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

The company eventually disassembled in 2002 after their last dubbing effort, Digimon Adventure, was taken over by Tuotantotalo Werne following public outrage (Only for the last half of the second season being aired in its original language with Finnish subtitles). About the Company Agapio Racing Team has received mixed to negative opinions, mostly for their voice actors being accused of lacking any immersion in their performances. The recording voice-level for the dubs were often low and the actors would rarely go to any great lengths to make actions such as screaming, laughing or crying seem credible on screen.. Retrieved 2020-04-24. The actors were mostly teenagers who were inexperienced. The quality of the scripts has been criticized as well, though a former Agapio employee stated that the translations usually came from translators outside the studio and were often nonsensical, and the breakneck speed that Agapio was forced to work at due to these delays only made things worse.Nyt: Agapio Racing Teamin tarina: T√§m√§ mies oli luomassa Digimonia ja muita legendaarisia dubbauksia, Jutta Sarhimaa.

The corporation consists of about 30 companies with about 28,000 employees. The main business includes coal mining and oil shale processing. According to figures released by FMG, this company is one of the world's largest shale oil producers.  History  With the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia and signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the South Manchuria branch (from Changchun to L√ºshun) of the China Far East Railway was transferred to Japanese control. South Manchuria Railway Company quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions, one of their actions were developing coal mines at Fushun. Under the control of Japanese, Fushun area became a highly industrialized area via 30 years development. After World War II, Fushun Coal Mine of the South Manchuria Railway Company was taken over by the Kuomintang and Fushun Mining Administration Bureau was established by the Kuomintang Government in 1946 . In 1948, Fushun Coal Mine went under control of the China Communist Party and became one of industrial centers for People's Republic of China. Operations The corporation consists of about 30 companies with about 28,000 employees. Although FMG has so many sub-companies, most of profit is mainly from Laohutai Coal Mine, West Open Pit, East Open Pit and Oil Shale Plant. Other subsidiaries like transporting company, machinery factory and machine repairing factory are under deficit according to the financing report released by FMG in 2013.Since 2002, the development strategy of FMG is non- coal industry. Therefore, FMG invested heavily in non-coal industry such as shale oil retorting, paper making and oil processing. Coal mining Fushun is known as \\"the capital of coal\\" for which once had great coal reserves. As a state-owned company, most of Fushun coal reserves are in the hands of FMG. FMG has three main coal mines including Laohutai Coal Mine, West Open Pit and East Open Pit. Due to the decline of coal reserve, the coal production has great decreasing for recent years compared with its history records. According to the information announced by FMG, West Open Pit will be closed in 2019 and Laohutai Coal Mine be closed in 2026. The main coal products for these three coal mines include blending coking coal and steam coal which are high quality coal for steel making. To confront this situation, the business focus is planned to be shift from coal mining industry to oil industry and paper making industry. Also according to the latest financing report, FMG have borrowed several billion RMB from several government banks to invest the oil processing industry and paper making industry. Moreover, FMG is also rich in coalbed methane resources that total around . However, there is a great risk for FMG to run the non-coal business for whose management system is a very state-owned company style. Oil shale industry Commercial retorting of oil shale in FMG started in 1991 with an oil shale retorting plant being established at that year. Fushun Mining Group owns geological reserve of high grade oil shale about 3.5 billion tons, of which exploitable reserve is 920 million tons. Among them, East Open Pit has oil shale reserve about(760 million tons) and West Open Pit has (160 million tons). At the end of 2008, the company operated the largest oil shale plant in the world consisting eleven retorting units with 20 retorts in each unit, total 220 sets of Fushun-type retort. Annual oil shale processing capacity is designed to be 11 million tons of oil shale, and annual shale oil yields to be 330,000 tons. FMG is constructing the Alberta Taciuk processor (ATP) to treat small size oil shale (particulate oil shale) which can not be processed by Fushun retort. The 250 tonnes per hour ATP processor, scheduled to start operation at the end of 2010, is engineered and constructed by cement and mineral equipment supplier, Polysius AG of the ThyssenKrupp and uses technology developed by UMATAC Industrial Processes, a Canadian subsidiary of Polysius AG. It seems that ATP Project like a Gordian Knot for FMG as which lasts more than 8 years. An Australian company named Procom had been invited since September 2012 to help FMG for the commissioning of ATP Processor as Procom claimed that they had ATP Processor commissioning experience. Procom operated the first industrial ATP application in Gladstone, QLD Australia. In late August 2013 the first oil was produced from oil shale out of the ATP, but it is still very hard to have continuous running for ATP plant.  Management board  Currently, FMG president is Li Qing who was the former vice director of Liaoning Coal Mining Administration. However, the former president Yin Liang still have great influence on this company after he retired in 2012.

Life Born in Saint Petersburg in 1891 to a Jewish family, Zhirmunsky was a professor at universities in Saratov and Leningrad, and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was a representative of Russian formal studies, though in certain respects he was less inclined to accept formalism as sufficient for all literary analysis. His critique of the ahistorical nature of formalism, in the introduction to his translation of Oskar Walzel‚Ä≤s Die k√ºnstlerische Form des Dichtwerkes (1919) helped speed the end of Russian formalism's initial phase, as critics began to accommodate their work to the developing ideology of the Soviet regime. Though originally trained in German Romanticism, he started to research the epics of the Asian people of the Soviet Union after he was settled in Tashkent following the evacuation of Leningrad. In particular, he studied the akyn of Kazakh and Kyrgyz culture. This research created a foundation that allowed Eleazar M. Meletinskii to make his considerations on the relations between myth and epos. In April 1948, Zhirmunsky was among the scholars and critics who recanted their supposed \\"comparativism\\" and \\"Veselovskyism\\" in Andrei Zhdanov‚Ä≤s purge of that year. \\"Comparativism,\\" or the study of possible borrowing and dissemination of motifs and stories among cultures, was deprecated. In response, Zhirmunsky developed a historical-typological theory, according to which such similarities arose not from historical influence but rather from a similarity of social and cultural institutions.

History East Lancs bodied Leyland Atlantean Northern Counties bodied Leyland Olympian in Loughborough Nottingham City Transport Scania OmniDekka in Gotham in September 2011 In March 1926, Christopher Dabell commenced operating a service between Gotham and Nottingham with a 20-seat Guy BB. Barton Transport already provided a bus service on this route but Dabell gained enough local customers to make his service successful. In 1929, an agreement was made with Barton Transport which involved Barton acquiring a 50% share of South Notts whilst withdrawing from the South Notts route. The South Notts service was extended to Loughborough, and this continued to be the company's main route until its takeover.History of the South Notts Bus Company South Notts BusesHappy 80th Birthday South Notts Buses Nottingham City Transport March 2006 Single-deck buses, mainly Guys, joined the fleet until 1932, when Leylands started to arrive, followed by Gilfords, Bedfords and Dennises. The first double-decker did not arrive until 1951, when an ex Hants & Dorset Leyland Titan was acquired. This proved useful on services to the new Clifton Estate, which were provided jointly with Nottingham City Transport and West Bridgford UDC. More followed, with the fleet size increasing rapidly to meet the new demand, and it was not long before the fleet became predominantly double-deck. However, a small coach fleet was also maintained, for which Bedfords were the preferred vehicles until the mid-1980s when the Bedfords were supplanted by secondhand Leyland Leopards. The double-deck fleet was of lowbridge or lowheight types, due to the height of the bridge where the Great Central Railway crossed Wilford Lane. By the early 1960s these were sunken gangway Leyland PD3s, with either Metro Cammell or Northern Counties bodies, later Albion Lowlanders again with Northern Counties bodies, which negated the sunken gangway requirement. after the Lowlander ceased production, Leyland Atlantean PDR1/3s with Northern Counties bodies were purchased. However, when this bridge was removed, South Notts continued to buy lowheight Leyland Atlantean PDR1/3s and Daimler Fleetlines with either Northern Counties or Eastern Coach Works bodies. On 13 March 1991, the business was sold to Nottingham City Transport. East Lancs bodied Leyland Olympian and Volvo Olympians with were added to the fleet to oust the remaining Atlanteans and Fleetlines. Newer Olympians did operate the main service, now numbered 1. Since 21 September 2009 the route has been branded as South Notts The One.South Notts \\"The One\\" Nottingham City Transport Scania OmniDekkas cascaded from Clifton service 48, were re- liveried, replacing the last Volvo Olympians, making the fleet fully low floor. Nottingham City Transport have also transferred the operation of other routes, not traditionally associated with South Notts, to Gotham garage. A number of Scania single-deckers, articulated buses, and double-deckers are allocated to the depot to operate these services. On 1 April 2015, seven new Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 bodied Scania N230UDs were introduced.Brand New Buses on South Notts Launched with Smart Paint Technology Nottingham City Transport 1 April 2015NCT Invests in South Notts 1 Nottingham Local News 2 April 2015Fleetlist NCT Fleetlist Liveries The original livery was dark blue and cream; maroon was later added. For much of the company's existence, the livery for double-deckers was dark blue with a cream relief band and a maroon roof, whilst coaches had a slightly different livery of two-tone blue and cream. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the company in 1986, Leyland Fleetline 117 was repainted with a cream roof, as the original livery, as well as receiving special branding, and later the rest of the fleet also saw the maroon replaced with cream. Following takeover, the blue and cream livery was retained, with the area of cream expanded, and variants were created for minibuses and single-deckers, the latter involving two shades of blue. The livery was changed to NCT's two-tone green livery, with navy blue around the upper deck windscreen and front and rear sections of the roof. The South Notts fleetname was dropped in 2014. Coinciding with the introduction of new vehicles, on 1 April 2015, a new livery of navy front and rear with silver in between was introduced and the South Notts name reinstated.

Retrieved on 2007.03.29 About 4,500 pieces of amber are exhibited; many of these are items of artwork and jewelry. History and background The Baltic Sea coast has been a source of Eurasian amber trade since prehistoric times (see Amber Road). Neolithic artifacts made of amber were discovered in nearby Juodkrantƒó in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century. Lithuanian mythology, folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of J≈´ratƒó and Kastytis imagines an undersea palace of amber under the Baltic, which was shattered by Perk≈´nas, the god of thunder. Its fragments were said to be the source of the amber that still washes up on the beaches nearby. Amber workshops appeared in Palanga during the 17th century; guilds devoted to the material functioned in Br√ºgge, L√ºbeck, Danzig, and K√∂nigsberg. By the end of the 18th century Palanga was the center of the Russian Empire's amber industry. In the years preceding World War I about 2,000 kilograms of raw amber were processed in Palanga annually. In 1897 Feliks Tyszkiewicz, a member of an old Ruthenian/Lithuanian noble family that had long had a presence in Palanga, built the Neo-Renaissance-style palace that now houses the museum.Gediminas Gri≈°keviƒçius.

Background  Clea Bella is a theatre-based doll, created in 2001 by Christina Bougas, of the Bella Productions Doll Company. The first Clea Bella doll she sculpted was called \\"Peacock Paradise\\" and was an \\"en pointe\\" foot doll with straight, non- bending arms and legs. The doll featured theatrical style make-up, a blue and green dance costume with bird feathers, a matching headdress fashioned after the peacock's crest, white tights and pink en pointe ballet shoes. This was the original en pointe 41 cm (16 in) dancer doll. Clea Bella is the name of the main character doll, and is a shortening of her full name, Cleopatra Bellisimo. The doll's character is a dancer, singer and actress. The company provides a story line behind each character, outfit and dressed doll, with each product coming with a story card about that item.  Body styles  The current style of articulated dolls features multiple points of articulation at the shoulders, waist, hips and knees. The dolls currently come in two body types: a \\"fashion foot\\" doll with arched feet for wearing high heeled shoes, and an en pointe style foot for wearing en pointe ballet shoes. Additionally, there are two body constructions: The original style with non-bending straight legs and arms. They come in both the \\"fashion foot\\" and en pointe ballet foot styles. The doll bodies were made of plastic and their head molded of softer vinyl with rooted hair. Their legs were strung together with a rubber band joint in the hips, allowing for a large range of movement in the legs. These older dolls were produced from 2001 through 2004, and are still sold online. In 2005, the company introduced their second body construction type, which was the first wave of articulated dolls, and featured bending knees that swivel, an improved rotational hip, and swivel waists which tilt slightly in all directions, offering a dropped-shoulder pose, as well as a more arched back for an arabesque pose for their ballet dancers. The doll creators changed to rotomolding for the manufacture of the new articulated dolls in the softer vinyl material, allowing the dolls to be seamless. At this time, they also introduced a new character, Clea Bella's best friend, DeeDee Hunt, a Native American doll of Haida Gwaii origin. Clea and DeeDee share the same body type. The DeeDee character is not currently offered with an en pointe body. In April 2007, Bella Productions introduced fully articulated doll body, featuring bending elbows and wrists. These dolls will have the same articulated lower- body type bodies introduced in 2005, and will be fully strung with elastic. This was the first vinyl doll to be strung instead of hard jointed.

Meerwein's representation is top, the modern view on the bottom He originally trained to be a chemistry technician or 'chemotechnician' at the Fresenius University of Applied Sciences (between 1898 and 1900) before studying for a chemistry degree at the University of Bonn. After finishing his PhD with Richard Ansch√ºtz he worked at the University of Berlin, before returning to Bonn where he became professor in 1914. From 1922 till 1928 he was professor for organic chemistry at the University of K√∂nigsberg. The last change in his academic career was to the University of Marburg. The war devastated the Institute and Meerwein was planning the rebuilding which was finished in 1953, the year he retired from lecturing. He conducted experimental work with the help of two postdocs until his death in 1965. His greatest impact upon organic chemistry was to propose the carbocation 2 as a reactive intermediate, originally as a rationalization of the racemization of isobornyl chloride 1 catalysed by a Lewis acid such as SnCl4. His proposed mechanism for racemization involved a subsequent [2,6] hydride transfer, which allows the carbocation to be located at either of these two symmetric positions.

It is notable for being the first episode aired after the death of Dermot Morgan, who had died the day after filming for the final episode had been completed. As a mark of respect to Morgan, the original transmission of the first episode was delayed by a week.  Plot  In the cold opening, Ted has been promoted to a luxurious Dublin parish, and is quite happy with the living arrangements, which he considers much better than on cold, rainy Craggy Island. However, a church accountant soon asks Ted about a discrepancy with the church expenses. Ted is subsequently sent straight back to Craggy Island. Ted goes to collect a copy of a book he had given to Father Seamus Fitzpatrick, and surprised to see his collection of Nazi and Third Reich memorabilia. Returning to the parish, Ted finds that Mrs. Doyle has fallen and injured her back, so he and Dougal are required to take over the cleaning duties. The two become quickly bored, and to liven the mood, Ted puts a lampshade on his head, giving the appearance of a coolie hat, and does an offensive impression of a Chinese person, only to then turn around to see the Yin family, a Chinese family living on the island, watching him from outside. Dougal tells Ted that Craggy Island has a Chinese community, a fact that Ted did not previously know. Ted catches up with the Yin family just before they leave in their car and comes up with a story to provide an excuse for his actions. He later leaves the house again to go shopping and discovers that rumours that he is a racist are spreading across the island. Ted tries to disprove the rumours but his explanations are either rejected or hampered by ill luck. At one point, Ted stands at the window, which has a perfectly square black piece of dirt on it, and waves to the Yin family, whom he invited round to convince them that he is not a racist. However, from outside, the dirt makes Ted appear to have a toothbrush moustache similar to Adolf Hitler's, and his gestures appear similar to Hitler's. The Yins leave, angering Ted. Ted decides the only way to put things right is to hold a celebration of the diversity of Craggy Island at a local pub. While his laughable presentation is mocked at, the Yins gracefully accept his apology in part for the free alcohol. In the meanwhile, Father Fitzpatrick has died suddenly (after accidentally ingesting cyanide instead of valium) and left his collection of Nazi memorabilia to Ted via mail, which Mrs. Doyle unpacks. After the bar closes, Ted brings back the Yins for a nightcap at the parochial house, only to discover that Mrs Doyle put the entire collection of Nazi memorabilia on full display in the living room. Ted says that he can explain, only to then realise that actually, he can't. The next day, Ted frantically calls the Yin family to tell them about a large package of whiskey that he sent them as a further apology, but says that there has been a \\"change of plan\\". Father Jack then emerges from the box in an SS uniform, having drunk all of the liquor. In the book Father Ted: The Complete Scripts, Arthur Mathews observes that the islanders' actions in this episode are the opposite of those in \\"The Passion of Saint Tibulus\\": in the earlier episode, they completely fail to do what Ted wants them to, while in this episode they enthusiastically follow what they imagine to be Ted's example, even though he desperately wants them not to. Trivia *Ted's new parish, Castlelawn, is clearly meant to be a far more pleasant and civilised parish than Craggy Island, considering that the episode begins with Ted asking Father Smith, an elderly priest, who happens to be drinking a glass of port, about the times when he can say Mass. This reflects the opening of \\"Good Luck, Father Ted\\" when he asks Father Jack, another elderly priest with a fondness for drink, the same thing. Also, Ted lives with a young, sporty priest named Darren in his new parish, who is obviously meant to a more posh version of Father Dougal. *The pub Ted visits is Vaughan's, a real pub in Kilfenora, County Clare. *Ted's slides feature: **An unnamed black man who visited the island a few years ago **The Great Wall of China (\\"So big you can see it from anywhere in the world,\\" Ted remarks) **Mao Zedong **Mr. Miyagi from the film The Karate Kid (Mr. Miyagi is actually Japanese, not Chinese) **Cato from the Pink Panther films **A MƒÅori man (Ted claims this is an accident as there are no Maori on Craggy Island, even though a Maori is sitting in the audience) **Ming the Merciless, fictional character from Flash Gordon (Ming is often criticised as a negative Chinese stereotype) **Two photographs of groups of Chinese people **Ted himself **The words \\"NOT A RACIST\\" (This and the previous slide are switched between each other very quickly several times, in an attempt at subliminal messaging) *Father Jack's agoraphobia in this episode contrasts with the claustrophobia he had in \\"Grant unto Him Eternal Rest\\" that had Ted and Dougal waiting by his coffin the night before the funeral to make sure he is not buried alive (which was prevented by his \\"resurrection\\"). Ted mentioned he always had a fear of enclosed spaces like the kind he now hides in. *The ending theme is redone in a Chinese Folk style.

He was exposed to art at a very young age, and became a pupil of Benedetto Luti and painted mainly historical and devotional subjects. He painted a St. Camillus in Santa Maria Maddalena in Florence, in which he has aspired to the imitation of Domenichino. Many of his works decorate Rome's churches. His Resuscitation of Tabitha in Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri replicates a mosaic in St. Peter's Basilica. He also painted in fresco the ceilings of the tribunes in Santa Maria in Vallicella and San Gregorio, and was much employed in painting figures in the landscapes of other artists, particularly in those of Jan Frans van Bloemen (also known as \\"Orizzonte\\", which means horizon in Italian). In Rome he became a member of the prestigious Academy of Saint Luke, in which he served also as director (Principe) since 1758. One of his pupils was Pietro Antonio Gualdi Lodrini. Costanzi also traveled to France and Spain. Costanzi painted a portrait of George Keith, Earl Mareschal of Scotland, in Rome in 1752, now in the National Portrait Gallery, and St. Pancras & Infant Christ, now in the Dublin National Gallery.

Early years Born in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, Edwards began drawing horses as a child and continued drawing as he grew up on a Wyoming ranch. From this lifestyle, Bill was to become a championship rodeo rider. Broken bones brought his riding career to a halt, and the 6-foot-5 Bill Edwards became a model in New York City. An agent brought him to Hollywood in the early 1940s. He was under contract to Paramount Pictures for nearly a decade, after which he turned to art. Career In addition to Western films, the blonde, blue-eyed Edwards had featured roles in Our Hearts Were Young and Gay and Hail the Conquering Hero, both released in 1944. In the 1950s, Edwards became a painter. He created illustrations for Hanna-Barbera and Disney as well as creating the artwork for numerous book and novel covers. Edwards was commissioned by the United States Air Force Art Program to paint recruiting posters and paintings of Air Force planes and combat scenes. Several, such as one entitled \\"Generation Gap,\\" were exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution, the Pentagon and a traveling Air Force exhibit. He had an illustrious career as an artist, and he became best known for his paintings of the Old West. His works were sold at numerous galleries throughout California and the Southwest, and many of his paintings of the Old West hang in private collections. Personal life/death In January 1946, Bill married Hazel Allen, to whom he was married until the mid-1970s. He then married a second time to Beryl Margret Hunter, who was born in Middlesex, England; they married in the late 1980s and were happily married until her death on 12 December 1995. Upon her death, he remarried his first wife Hazel Allen. Bill died on December 21, 1999, at the age of 81 in Newport Beach, California of pneumonia caused by an illness that affected his muscular system. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, Linda Edwards.

Track listing controversy Upon initial release, the rear artwork containing the track listing contained only the track titles and not performer names. Former Death Row producer Sam Sneed speculated that this was because most tracks featured Snoop Doggy Dogg and that by adding artist names to the track listing, Snoop's contribution to Death Row's catalogue was glaringly evident. Snoop had recently left Death Row Records, a move that label founder/CEO Suge Knight resented. The re-release distributed by Koch Records added the artist names to the track listing. Furthermore, singles and tracks from Death Row's more recent releases such as Snoop's Tha Doggfather and 2Pac's All Eyez on Me were not included, possibly as a move to counter cannibalisation of sales from the actual releases. 2Pac's Inclusion Out of the five 2Pac tracks on the compilation, only one was actually recorded under his contract with Death Row Records. The other four releases were singles previously released under Interscope Records prior to his signing with Death Row. The tracks were able to be included as Interscope was formerly Death Row's parent and distribution company. Diss Tracks Aimed at former Death Row rappers In an early sign of Death Row's animosity towards former signees Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, the release confusingly included diss tracks directed towards the rappers: \\"Fuck Wit Dre Day\\" was not the original Dr. Dre release, but a cover version performed by Jewell. In addition, \\"Who Been There Who Done That\\" was a diss track aimed at Dr. Dre, parodying his \\"Been There Done That\\" single from the Aftermath compilation \\"Dr. Dre Presents...\\". The absence of artist names within the rear cover track listing meant the potential buyer was unaware of the inclusion of cover versions. The inclusion of Ice Cube's \\"No Vaseline\\", an old diss track aimed towards his fellow N.W.A group members that had no association with Death Row releases, was rumored to be a Suge Knight directive. Chart performance In 1996, Death Row Greatest Hits peaked at #35 on the Billboard 200.

First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis peoples in Canada have a unique relationship with the reigning monarch and, like the MƒÅori and the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, generally view the affiliation as being not between them and the ever-changing Cabinet, but instead with the continuous Crown of Canada, as embodied in the reigning sovereign. These agreements with the Crown are administered by Canadian Aboriginal law and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs. Relations Prince Arthur with the Chiefs of the Six Nations at the Mohawk Chapel, Brantford, 1869 The association between Indigenous peoples in Canada and the Canadian Crown is both statutory and traditional, the treaties being seen by the first peoples both as legal contracts and as perpetual and personal promises by successive reigning kings and queens to protect the welfare of Indigenous peoples, define their rights, and reconcile their sovereignty with that of the monarch in Canada. The agreements are formed with the Crown because the monarchy is thought to have inherent stability and continuity, as opposed to the transitory nature of populist whims that rule the political government, meaning the link between monarch and Indigenous peoples in Canada will theoretically last for \\"as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow.\\" The relationship has thus been described as mutual‚Äî\\"cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein Canada is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada\\"‚Äîand \\"special,\\" having a strong sense of \\"kinship\\" and possessing familial aspects. Constitutional scholars have observed that First Nations are \\"strongly supportive of the monarchy,\\" even if not necessarily regarding the monarch as supreme. The nature of the legal interaction between Canadian sovereign and First Nations has similarly not always been supported. Definition While treaties were signed between European monarchs and First Nations in North America as far back as 1676, the only ones that survived the American Revolution are those in Canada, which date to the beginning of the 18th century. Today, the main guide for relations between the monarchy and Canadian First Nations is King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763; while not a treaty, it is regarded by First Nations as their Magna Carta or \\"Indian Bill of Rights\\", binding on not only the British Crown but the Canadian one as well, as the document remains a part of the Canadian constitution. The proclamation set parts of the King's North American realm aside for colonists and reserved others for the First Nations, thereby affirming native title to their lands and making clear that, though under the sovereignty of the Crown, the Aboriginal bands were autonomous political units in a \\"nation-to-nation\\" association with non-native governments, with the monarch as the intermediary. This created not only a \\"constitutional and moral basis of alliance\\" between indigenous Canadians and the Canadian state as personified in the monarch, but also a fiduciary affiliation in which the Crown is constitutionally charged with providing certain guarantees to the First Nations, as affirmed in Sparrow v. The Queen, meaning that the \\"honour of the Crown\\" is at stake in dealings between it and First Nations leaders. Given the \\"divided\\" nature of the Crown, the sovereign may be party to relations with Inidngeous Canadians distinctly within a provincial jurisdiction. This has at times led to a lack of clarity regarding which of the monarch's jurisdictions should administer his or her duties towards Indigenous peoples. Expressions From time to time, the link between the Crown and Indigenous peoples will be symbolically expressed, through pow-wows or other types of ceremony held to mark the anniversary of a particular treaty ‚Äì sometimes with the participation of the monarch, another member of the Canadian Royal Family, or one of the Sovereign's representatives‚Äîor simply an occasion mounted to coincide with the presence of a member of the Royal Family on a royal tour, Indigenous peoples having always been a part of such tours of Canada. Gifts have been frequently exchanged and titles have been bestowed upon royal and viceregal figures since the early days of Indigenous contact with the Crown: The Ojibwa referred to King George III as the Great Father and Queen Victoria was later dubbed as the Great White Mother. Queen Elizabeth II was named Mother of all People by the Salish nation in 1959 and her son, Prince Charles, was in 1976 given the title of Attaniout Ikeneego by Inuit, meaning Son of the Big Boss. Charles was further honoured in 1986, when Cree and Ojibwa students in Winnipeg named Charles Leading Star, and again in 2001, during the Prince's first visit to Saskatchewan, when he was named Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk, or The Sun Looks at Him in a Good Way, by an elder in a ceremony at Wanuskewin Heritage Park. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, in Halifax, 2014. He was named Attaniout Ikeneego by the Inuit of Nunavut, Leading Star by the Ojibwa of Winnipeg, and Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk by the Cree of Saskatchewan. Since as early as 1710, Indigenous leaders have met to discuss treaty business with Royal Family members or viceroys in private audience and many continue to use their connection to the Crown to further their political aims. The above-mentioned pageants and celebrations have, for instance, been employed as a public platform on which to present complaints to the Monarch or other members of the Royal Family. It has been said that Aboriginal people in Canada appreciate their ability to do this witnessed by both national and international cameras. History=French and British crowns Explorers commissioned by French and English monarchs made contact with Indigenous peoples in North America in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. These interactions were generally peaceful‚Äîthe agents of each sovereign seeking alliances with Indigenous leaders in wresting territories away from the other monarch‚Äîand the partnerships were typically secured through treaties, the first signed in 1676. However, the English also used friendly gestures as a vehicle for establishing Crown dealings with Indigenous peoples, while simultaneously expanding their colonial domain: as fur traders and outposts of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), a crown corporation founded in 1670, spread westward across the continent, they introduced the concept of a just, paternal monarch to \\"guide and animate their exertions,\\" to inspire loyalty, and promote peaceful relations. During the fur trade, before the British Crown was considering permanent settlement, marital alliances between traders and Indigenous women were a form of alliance between Indigenous peoples and the Crown. When a land settlement was being planned by the Crown, treaties become the more official and permanent form of relations.Van Kirk, Sylvia. \\"The Role of Native Women in the Fur Trade Society of Western Canada, 1670‚Äì1830.\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies (1984): 9‚Äì13. They also brought with them images of the English monarch, such as the medal that bore the effigy of King Charles II (founder of the HBC) and which was presented to native chiefs as a mark of distinction; these medallions were passed down through the generations of the chiefs' descendants and those who wore them received particular honour and recognition at HBC posts. Portraits of the Four Mohawk Kings, painted in 1710, during their visit with Queen Anne. The Great Peace of Montreal was in 1701 signed by the Governor of New France, representing King Louis XIV, and the chiefs of 39 First Nations. Then, in 1710, Indigenous leaders were visiting personally with the British monarch; in that year, Queen Anne held an audience at St. James' Palace with three Mohawk‚ÄîSa Ga Yeath Qua Pieth Tow of the Bear Clan (called Peter Brant, King of Maguas), Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row of the Wolf Clan (called King John of Canojaharie), and Tee Yee Ho Ga Row, or \\"Double Life\\", of the Wolf Clan (called King Hendrick Peters)‚Äîand one Mahican Chief‚ÄîEtow Oh Koam of the Turtle Clan (called Emperor of the Six Nations). The four, dubbed the Four Mohawk Kings, were received in London as diplomats, being transported through the streets in royal carriages and visiting the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. But, their business was to request military aid for defence against the French, as well as missionaries for spiritual guidance. The latter request was passed by Anne to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, and a chapel was eventually built in 1711 at Fort Hunter, near present-day Johnstown, New York, along with the gift of a reed organ and a set of silver chalices in 1712. Map of the North American Eastern Seaboard as divided by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Treaty of Paris gains in pink, and Spanish territorial gains after the Treaty of Fontainebleau in yellow. (Note: The above graphic mistakenly shows King George III's \\"Indian Reserve\\" as only south of the Ohio River after the expansion of Quebec in 1774. In fact, the reserve territory north of the Ohio remained part of the reserve, but under the administration and legal regime of Quebec.) Both British and French monarchs viewed their lands in North America as being held by them in totality, including those occupied by First Nations. Typically, the treaties established delineations between territory reserved for colonial settlement and that distinctly for use by Indigenous peoples. The French kings, though they did not admit claims by Indigenous peoples to lands in New France, granted the natives reserves for their exclusive use; for instance, from 1716 onwards, land north and west of the manorials on the Saint Lawrence River were designated as the pays d'enhaut (upper country), or \\"Indian country\\", and were forbidden to settlement and clearing of land without the expressed authorisation of the King. The same was done by the kings of Great Britain; for example, the Friendship Treaty of 1725, which ended Dummer's War, established a relationship between King George III and the \\"Maeganumbe ... tribes Inhabiting His Majesty's Territories\\" in exchange for the guarantee that the indigenous people \\"not be molested in their persons ... by His Majesty's subjects.\\" The British contended that the Treaty gave them title to Nova Scotia and Acadia, while Acadians and the Mi'kmaq opposed further British settlement in the territory. The Mi'kmaq would later make peace with the British at the signing of the Halifax Treaties. History of colonization The colonization of land, people, culture and bodies was a result of settler colonial actions in the process of resource extraction and the settlement of the land.Alfred, Taiaiakw. \\"Colonial Stains on Our Existence.\\" In Racism, Colonialism, and Indigeneity, edited by Martin J. Cannon and Lina Sunseri, 3‚Äì11. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. An example of this colonization is the imposing of European femininity onto Indigenous women. As Indigenous women adopted Christianity, mostly voluntarily, the social status of Indigenous women changed.Stevenson, Winona. \\"Colonialism and First Nations Women in Canada.\\" In Racism, Colonialism, and Indigeneity, edited by Martin J. Cannon and Lina Sunseri, 3‚Äì11. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. Colonialism was an arm of the crown and its history still influences the Canadian government's policies regarding Indigenous peoples in the country. The Indian Acts exclusion of women from maintaining their own status for example, was a government-enforced policy that was amended in 1985 with Bill C31.Bourassa, Carrie, Kim McKay-McNabb, and Mary Hampton. \\"Racism, sexism and colonialism: The impact on the health of Aboriginal women in Canada.\\"Canadian Woman Studies 24, no. 1 (2004). The sovereigns also sought alliances with the First Nations; the Iroquois siding with Georges II and III and the Algonquin with Louis XIV and XV. These arrangements left questions about the treatment of Aboriginals in the French territories once the latter were ceded in 1760 to George III. Article 40 of the Capitulation of Montreal, signed on 8 September 1760, inferred that First Nations peoples who had been subjects of King Louis XV would then become the same of King George: \\"The Savages or Indian allies of his most Christian Majesty, shall be maintained in the Lands they inhabit; if they chose to remain there; they shall not be molested on any pretence whatsoever, for having carried arms, and served his most Christian Majesty; they shall have, as well as the French, liberty of religion, and shall keep their missionaries ...\\" Yet, two days before, the Algonquin, along with the Hurons of Lorette and eight other tribes, had already ratified a treaty at Fort L√©vis, making them allied with, and subjects of, the British king, who instructed General the Lord Amherst to treat the First Nations \\"upon the same principals of humanity and proper indulgence\\" as the French, and to \\"cultivate the best possible harmony and Friendship with the Chiefs of the Indian Tribes.\\" The retention of civil code in Quebec, though, caused the relations between the Crown and First Nations in that jurisdiction to be viewed as dissimilar to those that existed in the other Canadian colonies. In 1763, George III issued a Royal Proclamation that acknowledged the First Nations as autonomous political units and affirmed their title to their lands; it became the main document governing the parameters of the relationship between the sovereign and Indigenous subjects in North America. The King thereafter ordered Sir William Johnson to make the proclamation known to Indigenous nations under the King's sovereignty and, by 1766, its provisions were already put into practical use. In the prelude to the American Revolution, native leader Joseph Brant took the King up on this offer of protection and voyaged to London between 1775 and 1776 to meet with George III in person and discuss the aggressive expansionist policies of the American colonists. After the American Revolution Frederick Haldimand, Governor of Quebec, who issued the Haldimand Proclamation in 1784 During the course of the American Revolution, First Nations assisted King George III's North American forces, who ultimately lost the conflict. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783 between King George and the American Congress of the Confederation, British North America was divided into the sovereign United States (US) and the still British Canadas, creating a new international border through some of those lands that had been set apart by the Crown for First Nations and completely immersing others within the new republic. As a result, some Indigenous nations felt betrayed by the King and their service to the monarch was detailed in oratories that called on the Crown to keep its promises, especially after nations that had allied themselves with the British sovereign were driven from their lands by Americans. New treaties were drafted and those Indigenous nations that had lost their territories in the United States, or simply wished to not live under the US government, were granted new land in Canada by the King. The Mohawk Nation was one such group, which abandoned its Mohawk Valley territory, in present day New York State, after Americans destroyed the natives' settlement, including the chapel donated by Queen Anne following the visit to London of the Four Mohawk Kings. As compensation, George III promised land in Canada to the Six Nations and, in 1784, some Mohawks settled in what is now the Bay of Quinte and the Grand River Valley, where two of North America's only three Chapels Royal‚ÄîChrist Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks and Her Majesty's Chapel of the Mohawks‚Äîwere built to symbolise the connection between the Mohawk people and the Crown. Thereafter, the treaties with Indigenous peoples across southern Ontario were dubbed the Covenant Chain and ensured the preservation of First Nations' rights not provided elsewhere in the Americas. This treatment encouraged the loyalty of the Indigenouos peoples to the sovereign and, as allies of the King, they aided in defending his North American territories, especially during the War of 1812. The Indian Chiefs Medal, presented to commemorate Treaties 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, bearing the effigy of Queen Victoria In 1860, during one of the first true royal tours of Canada, First Nations put on displays, expressed their loyalty to Queen Victoria, and presented concerns about misconduct on the part of the Indian Department to the Queen's son, Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, when he was in Canada West. In that same year, Nahnebahwequay of the Ojibwa secured an audience with the Queen. When Governor General the Marquess of Lorne and his wife, Princess Louise, a daughter of Queen Victoria, visited British Columbia in 1882, they were greeted upon arrival in New Westminster by a flotilla of local Indigenous peoples in canoes who sang songs of welcome before the royal couple landed and proceeded through a ceremonial arch built by Indigenous people, which was hung with a banner reading \\"Clahowya Queenastenass\\", Chinookian for \\"Welcome Queen.\\" The following day, the Marquess and Marchioness gave their presence to an event attended by thousands of First Nations people and at least 40 chiefs. One presented the Princess with baskets, a bracelet, and a ring of Aboriginal make and Louise said in response that, when she returned to the United Kingdom, she would show these items to the Queen. Edward, Prince of Wales with two Ojibwe guides canoe on the Nipigon River, in Ontario. Once the Dominion Crown purchased what remained of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company and colonial settlement expanded westwards, more treaties were signed between 1871 and 1921, wherein the Crown brokered land exchanges that granted the Indigenous societies reserves and other compensation, such as livestock, ammunition, education, health care, and certain rights to hunt and fish. The treaties did not ensure peace: as evidenced by the North-West Rebellion of 1885, sparked by M√©tis people's concerns over their survival and discontent on the part of Cree people over perceived unfairness in the treaties signed with Queen Victoria. Independent Canada King George VI and Queen Elizabeth meet with Nakoda chieftains, who display an image of the King's great- grandmother, Queen Victoria, in Calgary, 1939 Following Canada's legislative independence from the United Kingdom (codified by the Statute of Westminster, 1931) relations‚Äîboth statutory and ceremonial‚Äîbetween sovereign and First Nations continued unaffected as the British Crown in Canada morphed into a distinctly Canadian monarchy. Indeed, during the 1939 tour of Canada by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth‚Äîan event intended to express the new independence of Canada and its monarchy‚ÄîFirst Nations journeyed to city centres like Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta, to meet with the King and present gifts and other displays of loyalty. In the course of the Second World War that followed soon after George's tour, more than 3,000 First Nations and M√©tis Canadians fought for the Canadian Crown and country, some receiving personal recognition from the King, such as Tommy Prince, who was presented with the Military Medal and, on behalf of the President of the United States, the Silver Star by the King at Buckingham Palace. King George's daughter, Elizabeth, acceded to the throne in 1952. Squamish Nation Chief Joe Mathias was amongst the Canadian dignitaries who were invited to attend her coronation in London the following year. In 1959, the Queen toured Canada and, in Labrador, she was greeted by the Chief of the Montagnais and given a pair of beaded moose-hide jackets; at Gasp√©, Quebec, she and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were presented with deerskin coats by two local Indigenous people; and, in Ottawa, a man from the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory passed to officials a 200-year-old wampum as a gift for Elizabeth. It was during that journey that the Queen became the first member of the Royal Family to meet with Inuit representatives, doing so in Stratford, Ontario, and the royal train stopped in Brantford, Ontario, so that the Queen could sign the Six Nations Queen Anne Bible in the presence of Six Nations leaders. Across the prairies, First Nations were present on the welcoming platforms in numerous cities and towns, and at the Calgary Stampede, more than 300 Blackfoot, Tsuu T'ina, and Nakoda performed a war dance and erected approximately 30 teepees, amongst which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh walked, meeting with various chiefs. In Nanaimo, British Columbia, a longer meeting took place between Elizabeth and the Salish, wherein the latter conferred on the former the title of Mother of all People and, following a dance of welcome, the Queen and her consort spent 45 minutes (20 more than allotted) touring a replica First Nations village and chatting with some 200 people. In 1970, Elizabeth II's presence at The Pas, Manitoba, provided an opportunity for the Opaskwayak Cree Nation to publicly express their perceptions of injustice meted out by the government. Then, during a royal tour by the Queen in 1973, Harold Cardinal delivered a politically charged speech to the monarch and the Queen responded, stating that \\"her government recognized the importance of full compliance with the spirit and intent of treaties\\"; the whole exchange had been pre-arranged between the two. Still, during the same tour, Indigenous people were not always granted the personal time with the Queen that they desired; the meetings with First Nations and Inuit tended to be purely ceremonial affairs wherein treaty issues were not officially discussed. For instance, when Queen Elizabeth arrived in Stoney Creek, Ontario, five chiefs in full feathered headdress and a cortege of 20 braves and their consorts came to present to her a letter outlining their grievances, but were prevented by officials from meeting with the sovereign. In 1976, the Queen did receive First Nations delegations at Buckingham Palace, such as the group of Alberta Aboriginal Chiefs who, along with Lieutenant Governor of Alberta and Cree chief Ralph Steinhauer, held audience with the monarch there. After constitutional patriation In the prelude to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, some First Nations leaders campaigned for and some against the proposed move, many asserting that the federal ministers of the Crown had no right to advise the Queen that she sever, without consent from the First Nations, the treaty rights she and her ancestors had long granted to Indigenous Canadians. Worrying to them was the fact that their relationship with the monarch had, over the preceding century, come to be interpreted by Indian Affairs officials as one of subordination to the government‚Äîa misreading on the part of non- Aboriginals of the terms Great White Mother and her Indian Children. Indeed, First Nations representatives were locked out of constitutional conferences in the late 1970s, leading the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) to make plans to petition the Queen directly. The Liberal Cabinet at the time, not wishing to be embarrassed by having the monarch intervene, extended to the NIB an invitation to talks at the ministerial level, though not the first ministers' meetings. But the invitation came just before the election in May 1979, which put the Progressive Conservative Party into Cabinet and the new ministers of the Crown decided to advise the Queen not to meet with the NIB delegation, while telling the NIB that the Queen had no power. After another election in 18 February 1980, Pierre Trudeau and another Liberal Cabinet were elected into office. On 2 October 1980, Prime Minister Trudeau announced on national television his intention to proceed with unilateral patriation in what he termed the \\"people's package\\". However, the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, led by President George Manuel, opposed the patriation due to the continued exclusion of Indigenous voices from consultations and forums of debate. To protest the lack of consultation and their concerns that the act would strip them of their rights and titles, the UBCIC organised the Indian Constitutional Express by chartering two trains which left Vancouver on 24 November 1980 for Ottawa. Upon arrival in Ottawa on 5 December 1980, the Constitution Express had traveled 5,000 kilometers and was carrying approximately 1,000 people of all ages. Although Pierre Trudeau announced that he would extend the timetable for the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution to hear from Indigenous representatives, the leaders of the protest presented a petition and a bill of particulars directly to Governor General Ed Schreyer. Unsatisfied with the response from the federal government, 41 people immediately continued on to the United Nations headquarters in New York City to gain international attention. Finally, they embarked for the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium in 1981 to present the concerns and experiences of indigenous Canadians to an international audience. In November 1981, they arrived in London, England and petitioned the British Parliament, eventually gaining audience with the House of Lords. While no meeting with the Queen took place, the position of Indigenous Canadians was confirmed by Master of the Rolls the Lord Denning, who ruled that the relationship was indeed one between sovereign and First Nations directly, clarifying further that, since the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931, the Canadian Crown had come to be distinct from the British Crown, though the two were still held by the same monarch, leaving the treaties sound. Upon their return to Canada, the NIB was granted access to first ministers' meetings and the ability to address the premiers. After extensive negotiations with Indigenous leaders, the Trudeau government agreed to their demands in late January 1982 and therefore introduced Section 35 of the Constitution Act, which officially reaffirmed Aboriginal rights. Some 15 years later, the Governor General-in-Council, per the Inquiry Act and on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, established the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to address a number of concerns surrounding the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada. After 178 days of public hearings, visits by 96 communities, and numerous reviews and reports, the central conclusion reached was that \\"the main policy direction, pursued for more than 150 years, first by colonial then by Canadian governments, has been wrong,\\" focusing on the previous attempts at cultural assimilation. It was recommended that the nation-to-nation relationship of mutual respect be re-established between the Crown and First Nations, specifically calling for the monarch to \\"announce the establishment of a new era of respect for the treaties\\" and renew the treaty process through the issuance of a new royal proclamation as supplement to the Royal Proclamation of 1763. It was argued by Tony Hall, a professor of Native American studies at the University of Lethbridge, that the friendly relations between monarch and indigenous Canadians must continue as a means to exercise Canadian sovereignty. In 1994, while the Queen and her then prime minister, Jean Chr√©tien, were attending an Indigenous cultural festival in Yellowknife, the Dene community of the Northwest Territories presented a list of grievances over stalled land claim negotiations. Similarly, the Queen and Chr√©tien visited in 1997 the community of Sheshatshiu in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the Innu people of Quebec and Labrador presented a letter of grievance over stagnant land claim talks. On both occasions, instead of giving the documents to the Prime Minister, as he was not party to the treaty agreements, they were handed by the chiefs to the Queen, who, after speaking with the First Nations representatives, then passed the list and letter to Chr√©tien for him and the other ministers of the Crown to address and advise the Queen or her viceroy on how to proceed. 21st century During the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2005, First Nations stated that they felt relegated to a merely ceremonial role, having been denied by federal and provincial ministers any access to the Queen in private audience. First Nations leaders have also raised concerns about what they see as a crumbling relationship between their people and the Crown, fueled by the failure of the federal and provincial cabinets to resolve land claim disputes, as well as a perceived intervention of the Crown into Indigenous affairs. Formal relations have also not yet been founded between the monarchy and a number of First Nations around Canada; such as those in British Columbia who are still engaged in the process of treaty making. Regina campus of the First Nations University of Canada, opened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and which contains a stone plaque donated by Queen Elizabeth II Portraits of the Four Mohawk Kings that had been commissioned while the leaders were in London had then hung at Kensington Palace for nearly 270 years, until Queen Elizabeth II in 1977 donated them to the Canadian Collection at the National Archives of Canada, unveiling them personally in Ottawa. That same year, the Queen's son, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, visited Alberta to attend celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of Treaty 7, when he was made a Kainai chieftain, and, as a bicentennial gift in 1984, Elizabeth II gave to the Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks a silver chalice to replace that which was lost from the 1712 Queen Anne set during the American Revolution. In 2003, Elizabeth's other son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, opened the Regina, Saskatchewan, campus of the First Nations University of Canada, where the Queen made her first stop during her 2005 tour of Saskatchewan and Alberta and presented the university with a commemorative granite plaque. A similar scene took place at British Columbia's Government House, when, in 2009, Shawn Atleo, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, presented Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, with a letter of complaint about the Crown's fulfillment of its treaty duties, and requested a meeting with the Queen. Prince Charles then added another dimension to the relationship between the Crown and First Nations when, in a speech in Vancouver, he drew a connection between his own personal interests and concerns in environmentalism and the cultural practices and traditions of Canada's First Nations. Protests and reconciliation In 2010, the Christ Church Royal Chapel was presented sets of handbells from Queen Elizabeth II to symbolise the councils and treaties between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Crown. On 4 July 2010, Queen Elizabeth II presented to Her Majesty's Royal Chapel of the Mohawks and Christ Church Royal Chapel sets of handbells, to symbolise the councils and treaties between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Crown. On the occasion of a visit of Prince Charles to Canada in 2012, the CBC held a round-table discussion between Atleo; John Borrows, a constitutional scholar at the University of Minnesota and an Anishinabe from Ontario; Pamela Palmater, a lawyer and professor at Ryerson University and a Mi'kmaq from New Brunswick; and Taiaiake Alfred, a Mohawk from Kahnawake and a professor at the University of Victoria, asking them to reflect on the relationship between the Crown and First Nations. Alfred stated the Crown's promises to First Nations people were binding on the Canadian state, but Canada had broken all of the promises. Burrows said that the honour of the House of Windsor should demand that Charles guarantee that the treaties be upheld. Palmater, speaking of Prince Charles, said: \\"He is the Crown and given that it was the Crown who signed treaties and made promises and established the relationship with indigenous nations‚Äîhe ought to assume some responsibility for making sure Canada carries out those obligations, which the [British] Crown unilaterally devolved to Canada without input from First Nations.\\" During the Idle No More protest movement of 2012‚Äì2013, Chief Theresa Spence of the Attawapiskat First Nation mounted a liquids-only hunger strike and demanded a meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Governor General David Johnston, Atleo, and the chiefs of various regional and tribal councils. She, as well as several of her supporters and sympathizers, wrote to the Queen, asking Elizabeth II to instruct the Governor General to attend, but the Queen declined to do so, indicating that she was bound to follow the advice of her ministers in the federal Cabinet. Spence then indicated that she would boycott a conference involving other First Nations leaders and the Prime Minister because the Governor General, as a non-partisan figure, declined attendance at a policy meeting. The Globe and Mail supported the idea of the governor general playing a role by listening to grievances from Aboriginal leaders as \\"listener-in-chief\\", but called it \\"wrong\\" to insist that the governor general attend policy discussions and the idea that First Nations people could relate to the Crown and the government \\"as if they were two separate entities\\" ... \\"a fantasy\\". The Canadian Privy Council Office insisted the meeting not include the governor general to ensure no impression the governor general had the constitutional authority to change government policy. Spence and several other chiefs held a \\"ceremonial\\" meeting with the Governor General on 11 January 2013, while the separate working meeting between Harper and other chiefs took place the same day. The report issued at the close of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 contained 94 Calls to Action. Among them were requests for students, lawyers, journalists, employees of private businesses, and public servants to be provided education on Aboriginal‚ÄìCrown relations and for the federal Crown-in-Council \\"to jointly develop with Aboriginal peoples a Royal Proclamation of Reconciliation to be issued by the Crown [which] would build on the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ... and reaffirm the nation-to-nation relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown.\\" It was desired the proclamation would, in part, \\"[r]econcile Aboriginal and Crown constitutional and legal orders to ensure that Aboriginal peoples are full partners in Confederation ...\\" Viceroys and Indigenous peoples Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir in native headdress, 1937 As the representatives in Canada and the provinces of the reigning monarch, both governors general and lieutenant governors have been closely associated with First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis peoples. This dates back to the colonial era, when the sovereign did not travel from Europe to Canada and so dealt with Aboriginal societies through his or her viceroy. After the American Revolution, a tradition was initiated in eastern Canada of appealing to the viceregal representatives for redress of grievances and later, after returning from a cross-country tour in 1901, during which he met with First Nations in the Yukon, Governor General the Earl of Minto urged his ministers to redress the wrongs he had witnessed in the north and to preserve native heritage and folklore. Federal and provincial viceroys also met with First Nations leaders for more ceremonial occasions, such as when in 1867 Canada's first governor general, the Viscount Monck, received a native chief, in full feathers, among some of the first guests at Rideau Hall. The Marquess of Lansdowne smoked a calumet with Aboriginal people in the Prairies, the Marquess of Lorne was there named Great Brother-in-Law, and the Lord Tweedsmuir was honoured by the Kainai Nation through being made a chief of the Blood Indians and met with Grey Owl in Saskatchewan. The Earl Alexander of Tunis was presented with a totem pole by Kwakiutl carver Mungo Martin, which Alexander erected on the grounds of Rideau Hall, where it stands today with the inukshuk by artist Kananginak Pootoogook that was commissioned in 1997 by Governor General Rom√©o LeBlanc to commemorate the second National Aboriginal Day. Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy undertook a far-reaching tour of the north in 1925, during which he met with First Nations and heard their grievances at Fort Providence and Fort Simpson. Later, Governor General Edward Schreyer was in 1984 made an honorary member of the Kainai Chieftainship, as was one of his viceregal successors, Adrienne Clarkson, who was made such on 23 July 2005, along with being adopted into the Blood Tribe with the name Grandmother of Many Nations. Clarkson was an avid supporter of Canada's north and Inuit culture, employing students from Nunavut Arctic College to assist in designing the Clarkson Cup and creating the Governor General's Northern Medal. Governor General Vincent Massey (left) shares a laugh with an Inuit inhabitant of Frobisher Bay Five persons from First Nations have been appointed as the monarch's representative, all in the provincial spheres. Ralph Steinhauer was the first, having been made Lieutenant Governor of Alberta on 2 July 1974; Steinhauer was from the Cree nation. Yvon Dumont was of M√©tis heritage and served as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba between 1993 and 1999. The first Lieutenant Governor of Ontario of Aboriginal heritage was James Bartleman, who was appointed to the position on 7 March 2002. A member of the Mnjikaning First Nation, Bartleman listed the encouragement of indigenous young people as one of his key priorities and, during his time in the Queen's service, launched several initiatives to promote literacy and social bridge building, travelling to remote native communities in northern Ontario, pairing native and non-native schools, and creating the Lieutenant Governor's Book Program, which collected 1.4 million books that were flown into the province's north to stock shelves of First Nations community libraries. On 1 October 2007, Steven Point, from the Skowkale First Nation, was installed as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and Graydon Nicholas, born on the Tobique Indian Reserve, was made Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick on 30 September 2009.

The Dutch colonized Taiwan as a base for trade with Japan in 1624. Kingdom of Tungning & Taiwan under Qing rule During the Kingdom of Tungning era (1662‚Äì83), Japan bought deerskin, sugar and silk from Taiwan and sold precious metal, porcelain, armors and cotton cloth.

ROC in TaiwanEstablishment, early 1950s= Japan‚ÄìTaiwan Exchange Association in Taipei Association of Taiwan-Japan Relations in Tokyo After the war between China and Japan, during the occupation of Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida (officially the last prime minister under the royal decree by the Japanese emperor), intended to approach the newly established People's Republic of China economically and diplomatically. However, the US rectified this initiative and threatened to boycott the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco if Japan did not to engage with KMT-led Nationalist China (now Taiwan) and the later formation of the Treaty of Taipei (a parallel treaty to the Treaty of San Francisco between Japan and the two Chinas that were excluded). The US required Japan to accept diplomatic relations with the KMT-led Nationalist China otherwise sovereignty to the country would not be restored, effectively maintaining war with the US and keeping it under US military occupation. By taking everything into consideration, in the midst of the US creating its containment policy in Asia, Prime Minister Yoshida shifted his stance with regard to the US administration (to then-US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles), as detailed in the Yoshida Letter,Cohen, J p. 50-56, Iriye, A. Cohen, W p. 21-34, Schonberger, H p. 275-285 to negotiate a peace treaty with Taipei instead. Also as a result of ratification of the Treaty of San Francisco by the US Congress and Senate, he officially ended Japan's status as an imperial power, officially relinquishing of the island of Taiwan and Pescadores. These actions were drafted into Article 9 of the new liberal democratic Japanese Constitution which dismantled the country's military capabilities to declare war on another country with the reservation of self-defense limitations and later stipulated the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan, which was also passed and enacted by the majority members of the new Japanese Diet with subsequent security treaties in the post-war era. With the eruption of Korean War and US and UN intervention into that war, diplomatic relations between the governments of Japan and KMT-led Nationalist China were established following the termination of US occupation of Japan in 1952. Japan led the logistics and artillery production/manufacturing to support the US in the Korean War, which acted as the major stimulus for the revival of the its economy, especially in heavy and light industry, soon evident in the Japanese post-war economic miracle. On April 28, 1952, a formal peace treaty was concluded between the Japan and what is now Taiwan, as the former refrained from recognizing the People's Republic of China at that time. In Article 10 of the Treaty of Taipei (Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty) that retrospects: Bilaterally, Japan had, and still has from members of the Japan Business Federation, strong trading ties with Taipei. Japan played a key financial role of governmental loans to the ROC government to help with the burgeoning country's economic development on various levels before the Nixon Shock and the severing of ties between the two governments. In 1958, the Sino-Ryukyuan Economic and Cultural Association was established at Naha, Okinawa which was the strategic headquarters of the US Armed Forces in the region. In 1972, Okinawa was returned to Japan by the U.S. but the association remained as an institution to foster relations, dialogue and academic exchange between Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan. =Joint Communiqu√©, 1972= Regarding the One-China policy, Japan had been an earnest ally to Taiwan, however, global politics pushed Japan to overturn its position. As the attempt to belligerently recover mainland China failed and faded and the Taipei-based government was expelled, voted out of UN in a General Assembly vote, by majority UN member states via United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, soon after US President Richard Nixon's visit to People's Republic of China in 1972 and the release of the \\"Joint Communiqu√© of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China,\\" Japan's Liberal Democratic Party-majority government led by Kakuei Tanaka decided to establish formal diplomatic relations with the PRC. Before this, Japan had already had robust non-governmental trading relations with the PRC without formal diplomatic recognition. As a pre- condition for building ties with the PRC, Japan abrogated and made defunct the Treaty of Taipei in relation to then non-recognized Taiwan polity. According to the \\"1972 Japan‚ÄìChina Joint Communiqu√©\\", the Japanese government fully understood and respected the position of the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that Taiwan was an inalienable territory of the PRC, and it firmly maintained its stand under Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation,Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China \\"3.

Japan and the PRC agreed to continue abiding by the treaty when former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe visited Beijing on 8 October 2006. =Japan‚ÄìChina Joint Declaration, 1998= In 1998, Japan and the PRC signed the Japan‚ÄìChina Joint Declaration on Building a Partnership of Friendship and Cooperation for Peace and Development that stated that Japan was to continue to side with the PRC on the One-China policy, that it \\"continues to maintain its stand on the Taiwan issue as set forth in the Joint Communiqu√© of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China and reiterates its understanding that there is only one China.\\" Japan reiterated it will maintain its exchanges with Taiwan, however in a private and regional forms. =Recent initiatives, 2005‚Äìpresent= Member of the House of Representative of Japan Keiji Furuya and President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan on May 20, 2016.

History  Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, from the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, first proposed the Factor 10 and dematerialization concepts in the early 1990s. He concluded in his studies that 80% of the world's resources are distributed among First World nations, which contribute 20% of the global population, so those nations are promoting an unsustainable system of development. The goal of Factor 10 is to assure that nations do not exceed the planet's carrying capacity but leave sufficient resources for future generations.  Factor 4  Factor 10 evolved from the less dramatic Factor 4 was originally proposed by L. Hunter Lovins and Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute and Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the founder of the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment & Energy. Their book Factor 4 explains how simple it is for nations to achieve Factor 4 results with existing technologies. The concept attempts to reduce resource and energy use by 75% by doubling output and halving input of production.  Goals  Factor 10 requires the creation of new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a global economy that is sustainable for a long period of time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward short term relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. Eco-efficiency, environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and environmental taxes have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory. Factor 10 goes farther as a response to the United Nations Environment Programme call for a tenfold reduction in resource consumption in industrialized countries as a necessary long-term target if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of the developing countries.UNEP, Global Environmental Outlook 2000, 1999. With the predicted rise in population and economic growth to maintain the level of pollution we have today, we need to be able to produce the same output for 10% of the impact. Factor 10 concept is the direct way of using metric and various activities that can reduce the throughput of resources and energy in the given process. The essential question is by what factor certain flows can or should be reduced. It is a useful tool to monitor the performance of business in terms of dematerialization.Robert, K.H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., et al.

It is executed by propelling the body away from the floor so that the performer is momentarily airborne, and typically ends with the performer standing in a squatting position. It is performed in a variety of activities, including acro dance, breakdancing, gymnastics, martial arts, professional wrestling, parkour and freerunning. Execution and physics Nip-ups depend in large part on developing momentum in the legs and then using that momentum to lift the body into the air. A nip-up begins with the performer rolling back onto the shoulders while drawing both legs toward the chest. The legs may be either straight or bent, and hands may optionally be placed on the floor near the ears. The legs are then rapidly thrust away from body trunk and floor while simultaneously pushing away from the floor with hands, if used. During the thrust, the acceleration of leg mass away from the floor develops upward linear momentum in the legs. At the same time, the acceleration of the angular expansion between legs and trunk develops angular momentum in the legs. When the thrust is completed, movement of the legs with respect to the trunk ceases suddenly and, as a result, the linear and angular momentum of the legs are transferred to the entire body. The linear momentum of the thrust carries the body into the air feet first, while the angular momentum causes the airborne body to rotate in a face-first direction. The back is arched so that with sufficient thrust, back curvature, and body rotation, the performer will be carried into the air and land on the feet.

History Esimene Eesti P√µlevkivit√∂√∂stus After Estonia gained independence, the state owned oil shale enterprise, Riigi P√µlevkivit√∂√∂stus (), was established as a department of the Ministry for Trade and Industry on 24 November 1918. Shale oil production started in Estonia in 1921 when Riigi P√µlevkivit√∂√∂stus built 14 experimental oil shale processing retorts in Kohtla-J√§rve.Ots (2004), pp. 15‚Äì16 These vertical retorts used the method developed by Julius Pintsch AG that would later evolve into the current Kiviter processing technology. Along with the shale oil extraction plant, an oil shale research laboratory was founded in 1921.Aaloe et al. (2007), p. 21 Following the experimental retorts, the first commercial shale oil plant was put into operation on 24 December 1924. This is considered as a beginning of the history of Viru Keemia Grupp. In October 1936, Riigi P√µlevkivit√∂√∂stus was reorganized as the government-owned joint stock company and was renamed Esimene Eesti P√µlevkivit√∂√∂stus.Holmberg (2008), p. 99 It operated three shale oil extraction plants and was constructing the fourth plant. After occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union, the company was subordinated to the Soviet authorities in December 1940.Holmberg (2008), p. 129 During the subsequent German occupation, the industry was merged into a company named Baltische √ñl GmbH, subordinated to Kontinentale √ñl. Holmberg (2008), pp. 130‚Äì131 During the following Soviet occupation, the company became the Kohtla-J√§rve shale oil combinate ( under the General Directorate of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas of the USSR (Glavgaztopprom).Holmberg (2008), p. 137 In 1948, the company opened an oil shale gas plant, and for several decades the oil shale gas was used as a substitute for natural gas in Saint Petersburg (then known as Leningrad) and in northern Estonian cities. Holmberg (2008), p. 139 It was the first time in history that synthetic gas from oil shale was used in households.Holmberg (2008), p. 135 In 1995, the Kohtla-J√§rve factory and factory in Kivi√µli were merged into the single company named RAS Kiviter. In 1997, Kiviter was privatized and a year later it declared insolvency. Its factory in Kohtla-J√§rve was acquired by newly established Viru Keemia Grupp. In 2008, the company received a permit for developing the Boltysh oil shale deposit in Ukraine. VKG Oil opened three new Galoter-type oil plants called Petroter correspondingly in December 2009, in October 2014, and in November 2015. In January 2016, the company announced that due to low oil price, it will close the old oil plants using Kiviter technology and lay off 500 workers. Operations VKG's two main areas of operations are shale oil extraction, and electricity and heat production and distribution. Shale oil production VKG Ojamaa mine The subsidiary producing shale oil is VKG Oil. The company utilizes two different processes: Kiviter and Galoter. The company also tested but rejected the Alberta Taciuk Process. In total, VKG Oil processes 2 million tons of oil shale per year, producing 250,000 tons of shale oil. The company operates several Kiviter retorts, the largest of them having a processing capacity of 40 tonnes per hour of oil shale feedstock. These retorts are currently out of operation due to low oil price. It also operates three Galoter-type retorts called Petroter. Engineering of the retort was done by Atomenergoproject of Saint Petersburg; engineering of the condensation and distillation plant was done by Rintekno of Finland. The first Petroter plant has a processing capacity of 1.1 million tonnes of oil shale per year and it produces 100,000 tonnes of shale oil, of oil shale gas, and 150 GWh of steam per year. Power generation and distribution VKG Energia VKG's subsidiary VKG Energia, a power and heat generation company, was established in 2004 after VKG bought the Kohtla-J√§rve Power Plant and the Kohtla-J√§rve heat distribution system from Kohtla-J√§rve Soojus. In 2005, it bought another power plant in Kohtla-J√§rve from Fortum Termest. In 2006, VKG bought a 40,8% stake in Kohtla-J√§rve Soojus, an operator of the Ahtme Power Plant, and in 2010 it took a full control of the company, now VKG Soojus. All generations capacities were transferred to VKG Energia while VKG Soojus is responsible for heat distribution. } All generations capacities were transferred to VKG Energia while VKG Soojus is responsible for heat distribution. VKG Energia has installed electrical capacity of 80 MW and heat capacity of 700 MW. In July 2006, VKG acquired Narva Elektriv√µrk, the second largest power distribution company in Estonia, and renamed it VKG Elektriv√µrgud. Other activities In April 2011, VKG acquired assets of a bankrupt company Silbet Plokk that manufactured cinder blocks for construction from oil shale burning residue. The company was renamed VKG Plokk. The coalition-agreement of J√ºri Ratas' second cabinet formed in 2019 between the Centre Party, EKRE and Pro Patria, expresses support to the development of the local oil industry. Therefore, VKG and Eesti Energia decided to initiate a cost-benefit study aimed at establishing an oil pre-refining plant in Ida-Viru County. The plant would require a 650 million euro investment.

Background Campbell was born in London,https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf the third son of John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll. His mother was Elizabeth Campbell, 1st Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon, who had been ennobled in her own right in 1776. Campbell was baptised on 18 January 1778 at St James's in Westminster. He was educated privately and later attended Christ Church, Oxford.Thorne (1986), p. 375 In 1803, he travelled to Paris, where he met Talleyrand as well as Napoleon; Campbell returned to England the following year. He succeeded his older brother George Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll in his titles in 1839.Dodd (1846), p. 16 Career Campbell was commissioned into the British Army in 1797 as an ensign of the 3rd Foot Guards, commanded by his father. He purchased a lieutenancy in 1799 and shortly afterwards became a captain. During the French Revolutionary Wars, Campbell served in the Netherlands under orders of Sir Ralph Abercromby.Douglas (1904), p. 388 He retired in 1801 forced by ill health and after two years was appointed lieutenant-colonel and commandant of the Argyll Volunteers. Following the rearrangement of the country's militias in 1809, he became colonel of the Argyll and Bute Militia. He entered the British House of Commons in 1799, having been elected for Argyllshire as replacement for his uncle Lord Frederick Campbell. After the Act of Union 1801, he continued to represent the constituency also in the new Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1822. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819. Campbell was nominated Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland in 1841, an office he held for the next five years.Cokayne (1910), p. 211 The British American Colonization Association In 1841, the 7th Duke of Argyll, along with other British and Irish noblemen, established the British American Colonization Association, also known as the British American Association.:\\"Who can wonder if the scheme succeeded to an extent that surpassed the utmost hopes of its projectors? The Duke of Argyll was at its head; and its tail consisted of numerous joints worthy of a head so eminent. Yet of the long list of Lords and Baronets, with a Duke at their head, not one, as it now appears, ever paid a bawbee-the Duke of Argyll and Sir James Cockburn alone, of the entire batch, having even con- sented to take shares in the concern.\\":\\"It was here stated that the Duke of Argyll took the lead at all the public meetings, and made no secret of attaching his high name to the acts of the Association, and that his Grace's correspondence with the late Lord Mayor clearly proved that fact.\\" This entity was involved in monetising the migration of foreign populations to British North America, which was not without Controversy: > We adhere to the opinion we expressed when the affairs of this company were > last year before the public. We consider that the Duke of Argyll, and every > other individual whose name was affixed-with his own knowledge of its being > so ‚Äì to the delusive prospectus, are bound by humanity and justice to > indemnify the sufferers by the failure of the scheme to which they gave the > sanction of their names. We had hoped that a due sense of what the Duke of > Argyll owes to society would have induced his Grace, and every other > individual who was induced to give his sanction to the scheme, to have > voluntarily paid the penalty of his folly. By not doing so, the public may > be induced to suspect that it was something worse than error of judgment. > which brought their names into such a connection. We also went further; and > have seen no reason to retract the opinion we then expressed. Upon bankruptcy of the Association, it was established that the Duke of Argyll was aware of the economic bubble created by the Association,:\\"That Mr Campbell knew the whole concern was a bubble, is evident from his own account to the Lord Mayor. From that account it was evident that the Association was based in dishonesty and fraud\\" which resulted in lost wages for workers,:\\"Of this letter we will only say, that it is not quite consistent with his Grace's own letter to the late Lord Mayor, in which admissions were made, and explanations given as to the objects contemplated by the noble Duke in embarking in this emigration scheme; which, coming immediately from himself, the public will be disposed to credit. A letter also appears this morning in the columns of a contemporary journal, from a poor tradesman, who was induced to supply goods to the order of the Association, to the amount of several hundred pounds, on the faith of the high names which appeared in the prospectus.\\" and non- existent provisions for the migrants who participated in his Colonization scheme.:\\"Confiding in the integrity and stability of the high names attached to their prospectus, several poor persons were induced to become emigrants; and the\\" commissioners\\" of the Association undertook to sell them large tracts of land in Prince Edward's Island. And this contract they entered into, well knowing that the Association had not a single perch of land in the whole Island!\\" Marriages and children Argyll married firstly Elizabeth, eldest daughter of William Campbell against the wishes of his father in 1802.Burke (2001), p. 141 They were divorced six years later having had no children. Argyll married Joan, only daughter of John Glassel in 1820. They had three children:The Peerage, entry for 7th Duke of Argyll * John Henry Campbell, Earl of Campbell (11 January 1821 ‚Äì 27 May 1837) * George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll (30 April 1823 ‚Äì 24 April 1900) he married Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower (30 May 1824 ‚Äì 25 May 1878) on 31 July 1844. They have twelve children. He remarried Amelia Claughton (12 April 1843 ‚Äì 4 January 1894) on 13 August 1881. He remarried, again, Ina McNeill on 30 July 1895 * Lady Emma Augusta Campbell (1825 ‚Äì 30 May 1893) she married Rt. Hon. Sir John McNeill on 26 August 1870. After his second wife's death in 1828, Argyll married thirdly Anne, eldest daughter of John Cuninghame in 1831. She was the widow of George Cunningham Monteath. Argyll died, aged 69, in Inveraray Castle in ArgyllshireRivington (1848), p. 225 and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church. Having been predeceased by his older son John in 1837, he was succeeded in the dukedom and his other titles by his second son George.Douglas (1904), p. 389 He was survived by his third wife until 1874.

History Video resumes, sometimes called Visum√© or Video CV, were first introduced in the 1980s for use and distribution via VHS tape, but the idea never took off beyond the video taping of interviews. However, with the modern capabilities of transmitting streaming video via the internet, video resumes have taken on new popularity. It is way for job seekers to showcase their abilities beyond the capabilities of a traditional paper r√©sum√©. The video resume allows prospective employers to see and hear applicants, and get a feel for how applicants present themselves. Criticism With the popularity of video hosting solutions there has been much debate in the usefulness of video resumes. Most recruiters feel that a video alone does not give an employer enough information about a candidate to make a proper evaluation of the applicant's potential and more importantly skills. One article suggests that :\\"While a video resume introduces applicants on camera, the value such visual imagery adds is debatable. A text resume allows for specific pieces of information to be parsed out and compared across candidates. When the information is delivered verbally, recruiters need to glean the details themselves.\\"Time to Call Pause on Video Resumes CV presented on a video clip of 3 to 5 minutes can be entertaining as it will show the job-seeker as friendly and sociable person. It can be seen as first part of an interview which is to introduce oneself. It may make it possible to reduce the interview time so that a recruiter may be able to know much more about who the applicant is. At the office interview, a candidate will be silent most of the time and will be in a listening mode. He will have very little time to ask questions and tell fully about himself. When a job-seeker has seen the company's videos and webpages and the recruiter has seen him acting on a video, both parties can arrive at a decision on the first face to face interview. The video presentation may be viewed both as a CV and a remote interview. Studies have found that there is a gender discrepancy in video resumes as it is often detrimental for women to exhibit 'masculine' workplace characteristics such as assertiveness, confidence and self-promotion, whereas self-promotion was beneficial for male applicants. There is also an assumption that additional information on age, race, disability, gender and ethnicity provided by video resumes at an early stage in an application process could result in accusations of discrimination. As Hiemstra (2012) states \\"There is empirical evidence that e-recruitment practices that are perceived as unfair and intrusive lead to negative applicant reactions, possible legal action, and a tendency to 'self-select out'.\\"  See also  *Curriculum vitae  References  External links  * Job seekers show rather than tell article from USA Today * Video Resumes: Lights, Camera, Hire Me article from ABC News * Looking for a job?

According to Steiner's view of history, in earlier periods people were capable of direct spiritual perceptions, or clairvoyance, but not yet of rational thought; more recently, rationality has been developed at the cost of spiritual perception, leading to the alienation characteristic of modernity. Steiner proposed that humanity now has the task of synthesizing the rational and contemplative/spiritual components of cognition, whereby spiritual perception would be awakened through intensifying thinking. He considered this relevant not only to personal development, but as a foundation for advanced scientific research.In his foundation works on epistemology, Truth and Science and The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity. For a summation of his argument on the justification of the method he proposed for scientific work, see his 1911 lecture to an audience of philosophers and scientists: Steiner, R. (2003). The psychological foundations of anthroposophy: Its standpoint in relation to the theory of knowledge. In Esoteric development: Selected lectures and writings (Vol. GA35/Schmidt Number: S-2412). Bologna: SteinerBooks. (Original work published 1911.) For an introduction to this lecture by translator Frederick Amrine and an alternative translation, see Steiner, R. (2018). Introductions to Anthroposophy: The Bologna lecture: The psychological foundations and the epistemological stance of anthroposophy (Kindle Edition ed., Vol. 5). Keryx. Moral background of spiritual development A central principle of Steiner's proposed path to spiritual development is that self-development - inner transformation - is a necessary part of the spiritual path: \\"for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development.\\" According to the spiritual philosophy Steiner founded, anthroposophy, moral development:Peter Schneider, Einf√ºhrung in die Waldorfp√§dogogik, Klett-Cotta, 1982, Johannes Hemleben, Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography, Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, , pp. 91-94 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, )L√≠a Tummer, Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy for Beginners, Writers and Readers Publishing, 2001, , pp. 79-84 * reveals the extent to which a person has achieved control over his or her inner life; * ensures that he or she lives in harmony with the surrounding natural and social world; * correlates with his or her progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception; and * guarantees the capacity to distinguish between true perceptions and illusions, or to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements and objective realities. Meditative path Steiner described three stages of meditative progress: imaginative cognition, inspiration and intuition.Olav Hammer, Claiming Knowledge, , pp. 424ff *In imaginative cognition, the meditant aims to achieve thinking independent of sensory perception through concentration on either visual forms of symbolic significance never encountered in the sensory world (e.g. a black cross with a circle of seven red roses superimposed upon it), metamorphoses (e.g. the growth cycle of a plant from seed to mature flower), or mantric verses spoken aloud or silently (e.g. verses for each week of the year intended to connect the meditant with the rhythms of nature). *In inspiration, the meditant seeks to eliminate all consciously chosen meditative content to open a receptive space in which objective spiritual content (impressions stemming from objective spiritual beings) may be encountered. The meditative activity established in inspirative cognition is set forth without concrete content. *The stage of intuition is achieved through practicing exercises of will (e.g. reviewing the sequence of the day's events in reverse order).Carlo Willmann, Waldorfp√§dogogik: Theologische und religionsp√§dagogische Befunde, B√∂hlau Verlag, 1998, , pp. 11-14 At this stage, the meditant seeks unity with the creative forces of the cosmos without any loss of his or her individualized consciousness. This sequence of meditative stages has the ultimate goal of the meditant experiencing his or her own karma and previous incarnations, as well as the \\"Akashic record\\" of historical events. Preliminary requirements for embarking on a spiritual training Steiner believed that in order for a spiritual training to bear \\"healthy fruits,\\" a person would have to attend to the following: Florin Lowndes, 'Enlivening the Chakra of the Heart: The Fundamental Spiritual Exercises of Rudolf Steiner' . *Striving to develop a healthy body and soul. *Feeling connected with all of existence; to recognize oneself in everything, and everything in oneself; not to judge others without standing in their shoes. *Recognizing that one's thoughts and feelings have as significant an influence as one's deeds, and that work on one's inner life is as important as work on one's outer life. *Recognizing that the true essence of a human being does not lie in the person's outer appearance, but rather in the inner nature, in the soul and spiritual existence of this person. *Finding the genuine balance between having an open heart for the demands of the outer world and maintaining inner strength and \\"unshakeable endurance.\\" *The ability to be true to a decision once made, even in the face of daunting adversity, until one comes to the conclusion that it was or is made in error. *Developing thankfulness for everything that meets us, and that universal love which allows the world to reveal itself fully to oneself. Supplementary exercises Steiner suggested that certain exercises should accompany all meditational practices as a measure of protection against possible negative influences caused by the meditation in the life of the individual. These six exercises, meant to foster positive soul qualities, are: * Practice self- control over one's thinking. For example: for a period of time -at least five minutes- contemplate any object and concentrate one's thoughts exclusively on this object. (A pencil or a paper clip might do.) * Exercise willpower by choosing any free deed, i.e. one that nothing is influencing you to do, and choose a regular time of day or day of the week to practice this. (E.g. water plants at the same time each day.) * Practice equanimity: foster calm emotional responses. * Try to see positive aspects in everything and to make the best out of every situation. * Practice being open to new experiences and ideas, never letting expectations based upon the past close your mind to the lessons of the moment. * Find a harmonious, balanced relationship between the above five qualities, practicing each regularly and becoming able to move dynamically between them. The initial three exercises are intended to enable a person to attain self-discipline in thinking, willing and feeling.Robert A. McDermott, \\"Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy\\", in Faivre and Needleman, Modern Esoteric Spirituality, , pp. 303ff The second group of three involve cultivating attitudes toward the world. Individual exercises Exercises developed in anthroposophy include: *Review of the day. Each evening, going backwards through the day recalling its events, its sequential unfolding (experienced here reversed in time), the people one has met, etc. *Experiencing the year's unfolding. Exercises Steiner suggested here include: **Drawing the same plant or tree or landscape over the course of a year. **Meditating the sequence of 52 mantric verses that Steiner wrote to deepen one's experience of the course of the seasons and the year and to bring the inner life of the soul into dialogue with nature, the Soul Calendar.

It was also the name of an English sailing ship, Merchant's Hope, which plied the Atlantic bringing emigrants to Virginia in the early 17th-century. The Merchant's Hope was owned by a man named William Barker who was a wealthy English merchant and mariner who patented land in Virginia. Merchant's Hope Plantation Merchant's Hope Plantation was located west of Flowerdew Hundred on the south shore of the James River near the mouth of Powell's Creek in a portion of Charles City County which was divided to form Prince George County in 1703. It was located on the former site of Powellbrooke Plantation, whose owner Captain Nathaniel Powell (one of the original 1607 colonists), his wife, and ten others were killed during the Indian Massacre of 1622. Merchant's Hope Plantation was patented in 1638 by William Barker, Richard Quiney, and John Sadler, merchants of London. Ownership of the plantation passed to Nathaniel Harrison in 1720. The 4,200 acre (17 km2) James River National Wildlife Refuge now encompasses much of the land that was Merchant's Hope Plantation during the 17th century. Merchant's Hope Church Merchants Hope Church was established in 1657, and the current sanctuary was completed in 1743. Even though the church has undergone renovation and restoration, it is virtually the same structure today as it was when it was built over 250 years ago. In the 21st century, members of Merchant's Hope Episcopal Church still meet in the mid-18th-century structure, which is among the oldest Protestant churches in America still used as a house of worship. The church is listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. Compass Door: note rounded arch. Kicked Eave on North West Corner Dating The church has long been dated by local tradition and a date reputedly carved on one of the roof trusses to 1657,Rawlings 28 Upton ascribes a date of circa 1725,Upton 71 but recent dendrochronological studies of the roof truss timbers showed that they date to circa 1743.There is no published documentation for the 1743 date. The church was primarily part of Martin's Brandon Parish as both an upper and lower church. It is located on the Old River Road that preceded the present Route 10 connecting Suffolk with Hopewell.Mason 79 The parish affiliation changed as parishes were reorganized during the colonial period. The record is somewhat confusing, and recent dating of 1743 tends to change the parish affiliation of this particular building dramatically: *1618: Martin's Brandon Parish was originally a plantation parish that derived its name from nearby Brandon Plantation. It was united with Prince George's Parish at that time. *1639-1640: The church's \\"Great Bible\\" was published in London *There is indirect evidence of an active parish and, therefore some kind of church edifice, in 1665 and 1675.Mason 78 *1676: Nathaniel Bacon of Henrico and many other outraged settlers met at Merchant's Hope Church where they signed petitions to Governor Sir William Berkeley demanding help against attacks by the Native Americans. Berkeley who was engaged in the fur trade with the Native Americans dismissed their petitions leaving Bacon and 211 volunteers to take matters into their own hands which resulted in Bacon's Rebellion. *1655‚Äì1688 ‚Äì 1720: Martin's Brandon Parish was made independent of, absorbed by, and again made independent of Westover Parish, immediately north of the James River.Rawlings 28; Mason 78 *1655-1688: The parish was referred to as Jordan's Parish. *1688: Is mentioned as a chapel of ease for Westover Church. *1702: Prince George County formed from the portion of Charles City County lying South of the James River. *1720: Is mentioned as the upper chapel of Martin's Brandon Parish. *1743: Current sanctuary constructed *1848: Charles Minnigerode appointed rector *1857: Was separated from Martin's Brandon Parish, current communion silver dedicated. *1865: Used as a cavalry picket post by Union Soldiers during the Civil War, most interior furnishings destroyed. *1870: Restoration with interior furnishings reflecting the late 19th-century Victorian influence completed circa 1869/1870 *1968: Listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register *1969: Listed on the National Register of Historic Places *1974: Restoration of the interior to its mid-18th-century appearance completed. *1990: Modern parish house constructed Name The vernacular name Merchant's Hope for the present church is derived from the nearby plantation of the same name. The linking of the church to a sailing bark called Merchant's Hope has no validity. The ship and church derived their names from the plantation.Rawlings 27-8 Architecture Brickwork This church is the outstanding example of the brick, rectangular room church in the state of Virginia. It is as measured on the inside. In colonial contracts for churches this was referred to as \\"in the clear.\\" It consists of walls of solid brick two-and-a-half bricks thick with English bond below the water table five bricks high and Flemish bond above the water table. The transition from the water table to the walls contains a row of beveled bricks. Glazed headers are used throughout the building, and there is a row of glazed headers along the barge boards. Unlike most churches of the early eighteenth century, there is almost no serious reconstruction in the walls. Rubbed brick including queen closers are present in the doorways, the window trim, and at all four corners of the building.Mason 78; Rawlings 28 Doors The main entrance's pediment (west entrance) is of the most simple character; it consists of a compass heading with simple wood panels on the doors which may be of colonial manufacture. The brickwork surrounding the door is an understated pediment with no pilasters, pillars embedded in a wall. Its only decoration consists of rubbed brick accentuated by queen closers and an arch of flat bricks. The door itself is embellished by a wooden lunette, here a half-circle, and its two, center- opening doors have a small horizontal panel over two large vertical panels. The door's wooden trim contains curved cyma reversa, a reversed S-shaped molding, pieces separating three panes. Wooden pegs are used in both the doors and windows. H-L hinges are used throughout the building.Mason 79; Rawlings 29 The south door is identical in detail with the exception that it is a shorter, rectangular opening in the chancel end of the church with a flat arch at the top. Upton comments that \\"the doorways were comparable in size and visual emphasis to the windows, rather than inconspicuous.\\" Upton 70 and that all Virginia brick churches lacking an elaborate pediment have similar doors with a compass head in the west end and a flat head on the south wall.Upton 117 Windows Merchant's Hope has the best preserved compass windows of surviving colonial churches and displays the eventual style of chancel windows universal in eighteenth-century Virginia churches. Although they show systematic repairs, they are \\"very old\\" and \\"surely colonial\\".Rawlings 29 They consist of identically sized windows on the north, east, and south walls. There are four windows on the north, two in the east, and three on the south. The vestry door is directly opposite the north-eastern window. On the west wall above the door is a small compass window. The brick embellishment is the same as the west doorway with rubbed brick, queen closers, and a curved arch. They have two vertical sections made up of 24 over 16 panes. They are true guillotine windows with no counterweights. The wood work on the windows, like the west doorway, is a reverse S-curve, and the muntins are one inch thick. The bottoms consist of wooden sills with a row of beveled bricks below them in oarlock orientation.Mason 79; Rawlings 29; Upton 71 Interior The interior was gutted during the Civil War when the church was reputedly used as a cavalry picket station by the Union army, although there was no damage to the doors, windows, or gallery.Rawlings 30 It was reconstructed and now resembles the general room church configuration with the exception that the T-shaped aisle has been altered to an L-shaped one with the top of the L at the west door and the stem at the south. The chancel has a communion rail while the reconstructed pews are similar to those of Vauter's Church, single row box pews with a door on the aisle end. The pulpit is just south-west of the chancel although it was originally near the middle of the south wall.Rawlings 20 The west gallery still has its original stairway and rail with asymmetrical balusters characteristic of the early eighteenth century.Upton 109 On the east wall is a communion table centered between the windows and tablets of obligatory scripts: from left to right, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments (Exodus XX), and the Apostles' Creed. Most notably lacking is the display of a cross: no Anglican Virginia church displayed a cross or other iconography during the colonial period.Upton 118-121 Floor The floor reputedly contains original 18\\" square flagstones or Portland stone. According to rather dubious evidence, there is a crown mark on the underside of the tiles identifying them as having English origin.Brock 24 An architectural problem with the floor is that the present level is too low for the doorways. Either the door openings as well as the doors were larger or the floor was higher. The present structure of a high door step combined with a low floor is most unlikely to be an original construction characteristic.Rawlings 29-30 Roof / Ceiling The most prominent feature of the exterior roof is the pronounced kick of the eaves, also seen at Blandford, which flattens them, giving the church a distinctive look.Mason 79; Rawlings 30 Of course, the present asphalt shingle roof is not original. The roof truss construction is of considerable interest since it is the earliest known example of a king-post truss that is bent at the feet to allow a curved ceiling.see Upton p 44 Fig 24 for a diagram of the elaborate roof trusses. The present surface is a semi-domed plaster ceiling completely concealing the truss structure.Upton 43-44 It was common for ceilings to be painted blue with clouds though this in not mentioned in regards to Merchant's Hope.Upton 3 Symbolism and Structure This church contains the most pure example of the essential elements of a rectangular room church Upton 60-63 that include: *Dimensions of approximately 60' east-west by 25' north-south. *Lack of a rood screen separating the chancel from the pews. *Oriented with the chancel facing east. *Main doorway on the west wall: vestry door on the south east corner. *Lack of bell tower or south porch. *Plain exterior *Display of tablets containing The Lord's Prayer, the Decalogue, and the Apostles' Creed.Upton 60-63: 118-121 In addition, Upton writes extensively on the symbolism embedded in the general features of the building citing particularly the tendency toward pediments and domes: *\\"The pedimented doorways used on many churches are part of a continuous tradition running from Rome through early Christian and medieval building to post-Reformation England; they recall the gateway symbolism of Mediterranean and medieval architecture, and it turn refer, largely unconsciously to the triumphal arches of imperial Rome. They signal the transition for the secular world to the exalted world of the Church.\\". *\\"Pedimented doorways thus partook of the vault/dome/canopy tradition in dignifying the approach to the honored place, and in their shape. The pediment . . . conveyed honor in itself.\\". He also states that the combination of a compass pediment on the west door and a triangular pediment on the south was characteristic of early eighteenth-century churches in Virginia: *\\" . . . every surviving pedimented church before the 1750s uses a segmental pediment for the main (west) door and a triangular pediment over any secondary doorways . . . in doing so, the gateway/canopy was linked to the compass ceiling and the more general principle that curved or compass forms were more dignified than straight or 'square' ones.\\". Hence the plaster, domed ceiling that symbolically suggests the transition from the secular to the rarefied spiritual world. This transition is also accomplished by the symbolic journey a parishioner takes when entering the church; he progresses from the secular world through the arched west doorway, passes the baptismal font symbolic of entry to the church,Upton 48 walks under a representation of the sacred dome to the pews from which he progresses to the east Rawlings 13 to take the communion meal from a simple table at the chancel rail from which he can see the sacred texts through the clear light from the large east windows.Upton 3-4, 48, 142 Another aspect of the physical structure of Virginia's colonial churches was the social status given to seating. One's social status was reflected in the nearness to the chancel, so parishioners of higher rank sat closest to the pulpit and the chancel while those of low status sat near the west wall. Men and women were also separated by seating them on different sides of the aisle.Upton 3-4 Conclusion All things considered this building is the purest surviving example of the Virginia vernacular church of the colonial era. As Rawlings states: This church is noted for \\"the utter simplicity of its west doorway, a simplicity that is matched among surviving structures only at Jamestown.\\". \\"Merchant's Hope . . . is without a doubt our most enigmatic church. Because of its excellent state of preservation and the details of its masonry, its exterior, which is so devoid of unnecessary adornment, represents the supremely classical example of ecclesiastical architecture in colonial Virginia.\\". Modern church Merchant's Hope Episcopal Church still has an active congregation and is among the oldest Protestant churches in America. Over the past 350 years worshipers have included many members of the prominent Harrison family of Virginia, the Randolph family of Virginia, the Bland family of Virginia, the Cocke Family of Virginia, and noted agriculturalist Edmund Ruffin and his family. Many of its current parishioners can trace their ancestry back to the First Families of Virginia. Merchant's Hope Church is a registered Virginia and National Historic Landmark. One of the church's treasures is the \\"Great Bible\\". Rebound and not totally complete, it was printed in London in 1639-40. The \\"Great Bible\\" is believed to be the Bible with the longest association with one parish in the United States. The silver communion set on display was made in Charleston, South Carolina, and dedicated on the 200th anniversary of the parish in 1857. Following damage during the American Civil War the church was re-modeled with 19th-century interior furnishings. A century later the sanctuary was again in need of renovation and it was restored to its probable 18th-century appearance. Recreation of the furnishings was patterned after five extant Tidewater area churches, with expert documentation. The initial restoration of the church was completed in the mid-1970s. In 1974 a Tetragrammaton, originally erected as a decorative motif in the old St Mary Abbots church in London, England in 1696, was given to Merchants Hope under the condition that it be restored. This early Judeo- Christian symbol for Jehovah now hangs above the altar, the only one of its kind in North America. The church has also undergone more recent renovations that have included masonry repairs to stabilize the structure, the installation of a modern heating and air conditioning system, a security system, and the removal of a slate roof added during the initial restoration that had caused cracking and significant sagging of the roof trusses that were also repaired. A modern parish hall designed by architect James S. Rawlings, a noted authority on Virginia's colonial architecture, and modeled after the half-timbered structures that were common in England and the colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries was constructed in the early 1990s.

Biography Born in Gosport in 1852, Snape worked in a variety of media (oils, watercolours, engraving, etc.). He concentrated mainly on topographical subjects including landscapes from the Meon Valley, and shore and maritime scenes around Portsmouth Harbour and his home town of Gosport. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1874 and 1901. Living in Spring Garden Lane, near Gosport railway station, Snape was associated with the Gosport area all his life. In 1922 he was commissioned to design the seal for the newly created Borough of Gosport (though the council logo is now a stylised modern version, the original design is still used by the Gosport Borough Football Club). In 1923 he was chosen to give the speech of welcome to the 91st Annual conference of the British Medical Association which was being held in Portsmouth. He died in 1930 but his most famous painting, Forton Creek, one of a series, still hangs in the town hall. Snape is buried in the churchyard at St Mary's, the parish church of Rowner. He had a great fondness for the village of Rowner, which was the subject of many of his paintings and was a personal friend of a former rector, the Revd Edward Prideaux-Brune. The new premises of the charity Gosport Voluntary Action has been named Martin Snape House in his memory.

Retrieved 28 November 2018. History The site, occupied since protohistory, was transformed into a castrum in the Middle Ages and later into a castle. In 1373, the King of France, Charles V, sent his brother, Louis I the Duke of Anjou, to besiege the castle and take it from the English. After six weeks, the English surrendered, the water having run out. The king gave the castle to the Count of Armagnac who saw it disputed by Gaston F√©bus, the Prince of Foix and B√©arn. The latter acquired it through his marriage to the Counts daughter, B√©atrix. Gaston F√©bus restored the castle (there is a museum dedicated to him on site) around 1380. With the accession of Henri IV and the merging of Bigorre into the Kingdom of France in 1607, it became crown property, fell into disuse and was dismantled piece by piece, its stones being used for local buildings. In 1862, M. Jubinal, d√©put√© of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, bought the castle intending to create a historical museum there, but died before achieving his aim. In 1906, M. Ribal, mayor of Masseube, bought and restored it and created a Gascon museum. It has been listed since 1941 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Description The inner courtyard within the rectangular enceinte is an example of medieval military architecture.

The concept was originally introduced by Jacobson to encode bit vectors, (unlabeled) trees, and planar graphs. Unlike general lossless data compression algorithms, succinct data structures retain the ability to use them in-place, without decompressing them first. A related notion is that of a compressed data structure, in which the size of the data structure depends upon the particular data being represented. Suppose that Z is the information- theoretical optimal number of bits needed to store some data. A representation of this data is called: * implicit if it takes Z + O(1) bits of space, * succinct if it takes Z + o(Z) bits of space, and * compact if it takes O(Z) bits of space. For example, a data structure that uses 2Z bits of storage is compact, Z + \\\\sqrt{Z} bits is succinct, Z + \\\\lg Z bits is also succinct, and Z + 3 bits is implicit. Implicit structures are thus usually reduced to storing information using some permutation of the input data; the most well-known example of this is the heap. Succinct dictionaries Succinct indexable dictionaries, also called rank/select dictionaries, form the basis of a number of succinct representation techniques, including binary trees, k-ary trees and multisets, as well as suffix trees and arrays. The basic problem is to store a subset S of a universe U = [0 \\\\dots n) = {0, 1, \\\\dots, n - 1}, usually represented as a bit array B[0 \\\\dots n) where B[i] = 1 iff i \\\\in S. An indexable dictionary supports the usual methods on dictionaries (queries, and insertions/deletions in the dynamic case) as well as the following operations: *\\\\mathbf{rank}_q(x) = { k \\\\in [0 \\\\dots x] : B[k] = q } *\\\\mathbf{select}_q(x)= \\\\min {k \\\\in [0 \\\\dots n) : \\\\mathbf{rank}_q(k) = x} for q \\\\in {0, 1}. In other words, \\\\mathbf{rank}_q(x) returns the number of elements equal to q up to position x while \\\\mathbf{select}_q(x) returns the position of the x-th occurrence of q . There is a simple representation which uses n + o(n) bits of storage space (the original bit array and an o(n) auxiliary structure) and supports rank and select in constant time. It uses an idea similar to that for range-minimum queries; there are a constant number of recursions before stopping at a subproblem of a limited size. The bit array B is partitioned into large blocks of size l = \\\\lg^2 n bits and small blocks of size s = \\\\lg n / 2 bits. For each large block, the rank of its first bit is stored in a separate table R_l[0 \\\\dots n/l); each such entry takes \\\\lg n bits for a total of (n/l) \\\\lg n = n / \\\\lg n bits of storage. Within a large block, another directory R_s[0 \\\\dots l/s) stores the rank of each of the l/s = 2 \\\\lg n small blocks it contains. The difference here is that it only needs \\\\lg l = \\\\lg \\\\lg^2 n = 2 \\\\lg \\\\lg n bits for each entry, since only the differences from the rank of the first bit in the containing large block need to be stored. Thus, this table takes a total of (n/s) \\\\lg l = 4 n \\\\lg \\\\lg n / \\\\lg n bits. A lookup table R_p can then be used that stores the answer to every possible rank query on a bit string of length s for i \\\\in [0, s); this requires 2^s s \\\\lg s = O(\\\\sqrt{n} \\\\lg n \\\\lg \\\\lg n) bits of storage space. Thus, since each of these auxiliary tables take o(n) space, this data structure supports rank queries in O(1) time and n + o(n) bits of space. To answer a query for \\\\mathbf{rank}_1(x) in constant time, a constant time algorithm computes: * \\\\mathbf{rank}_1(x) = R_l[\\\\lfloor x / l \\\\rfloor] + R_s[\\\\lfloor x / s\\\\rfloor] + R_p[x \\\\lfloor x / s\\\\rfloor, x \\\\text{ mod } s] In practice, the lookup table R_p can be replaced by bitwise operations and smaller tables that can be used to find the number of bits set in the small blocks. This is often beneficial, since succinct data structures find their uses in large data sets, in which case cache misses become much more frequent and the chances of the lookup table being evicted from closer CPU caches becomes higher. Select queries can be easily supported by doing a binary search on the same auxiliary structure used for rank; however, this takes O(\\\\lg n) time in the worst case. A more complicated structure using 3n/\\\\lg \\\\lg n + O(\\\\sqrt{n} \\\\lg n \\\\lg \\\\lg n) = o(n) bits of additional storage can be used to support select in constant time. In practice, many of these solutions have hidden constants in the O(\\\\cdot) notation which dominate before any asymptotic advantage becomes apparent; implementations using broadword operations and word-aligned blocks often perform better in practice. Entropy-compressed dictionaries The n + o(n) space approach can be improved by noting that there are \\\\textstyle \\\\binom{n}{m} distinct m-subsets of [n) (or binary strings of length n with exactly m 1‚Äôs), and thus \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal{B}(m,n) = \\\\lceil \\\\lg \\\\binom{n}{m} \\\\rceil is an information theoretic lower bound on the number of bits needed to store B. There is a succinct (static) dictionary which attains this bound, namely using \\\\mathcal{B}(m,n) + o(\\\\mathcal{B}(m,n)) space. This structure can be extended to support rank and select queries and takes \\\\mathcal{B}(m,n) + O(m + n \\\\lg \\\\lg n / \\\\lg n) space. Correct rank queries in this structure are however limited to elements contained in the set, analogous to how minimal perfect hashing functions work. This bound can be reduced to a space/time tradeoff by reducing the storage space of the dictionary to \\\\mathcal{B}(m,n) + O(n t^t / \\\\lg^t n + n^{3/4}) with queries taking O(t) time. Examples A null-terminated string (C string) takes Z + 1 space, and is thus implicit. A string with an arbitrary length (Pascal string) takes Z + log(Z) space, and is thus succinct. If there is a maximum length ‚Äì which is the case in practice, since 232 = 4 GiB of data is a very long string, and 264 = 16 EiB of data is larger than any string in practice ‚Äì then a string with a length is also implicit, taking Z + k space, where k is the number of data to represent the maximum length (e.g., 64 bits). When a sequence of variable-length items (such as strings) needs to be encoded, there are various possibilities. A direct approach is to store a length and an item in each record ‚Äì these can then be placed one after another. This allows efficient next, but not finding the kth item. An alternative is to place the items in order with a delimiter (e.g., null-terminated string). This uses a delimiter instead of a length, and is substantially slower, since the entire sequence must be scanned for delimiters. Both of these are space-efficient. An alternative approach is out- of-band separation: the items can simply be placed one after another, with no delimiters. Item bounds can then be stored as a sequence of length, or better, offsets into this sequence. Alternatively, a separate binary string consisting of 1s in the positions where an item begins, and 0s everywhere else is encoded along with it. Given this string, the select function can quickly determine where each item begins, given its index. This is compact but not succinct, as it takes 2Z space, which is O(Z). Another example is the representation of a binary tree: an arbitrary binary tree on n nodes can be represented in 2n + o(n) bits while supporting a variety of operations on any node, which includes finding its parent, its left and right child, and returning the size of its subtree, each in constant time. The number of different binary trees on n nodes is {\\\\tbinom{2n}{n}}/(n+1). For large n, this is about 4^n; thus we need at least about \\\\log_2(4^n)=2n bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy only 2 bits per node.

Because the Atari 400/800 8-bit computers included an RF modulator, stringent FCC regulations limiting radio emissions applied. Consequently, the Atari 400/800 systems internal construction used large metal frames as Faraday cages to prevent emissions. This prevented the use of plug-in internal cards to add connections for peripherals. To permit easy expansion, Atari developed the SIO (Serial Input/Output) bus. This bus daisy chains together all Atari peripherals into a single string‚Äîdisk drives, printers, modems, RS-232 interfaces. Since only one kind of connector plug is used for all devices, the Atari computer was easy for novice users to expand. Devices on the bus have their own IDs and peripherals can deliver downloadable drivers to the computer during the boot process. However, the additional electronics in these \\"intelligent\\" peripherals made them cost more than the \\"dumb\\" devices used by other systems.  List of peripherals  Both the names and styling of Atari's 8-bit peripherals generally matched the current computer range at the time they were released. Thus, they can be divided into one of three groups- those corresponding to the 400/800 era (4xx/8xx), the XL era (10xx) and the XE era (beginning with 'X') respectively.

Apart from the military purpose, it is used for scheduled services, charter flights to Southern Europe during the summer season and cargo flights. After the construction of a new terminal building, apron and ground handling facilities in 2017, Pardubice Airport opened up to serve more passengers and handle standard commercial aircraft such as Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 providing better and faster services. The new terminal building bears the name of Jan Ka≈°par, a Czech aviation pioneer. Airport's 2017 refurbishment and construction costed 256 million CZK and was fully funded by the Pardubice City Council and Pardubice Region through their shared subsidiary company East Bohemian Airport, a.s. that runs the airport. History=Early years In 1910 Jan Ka≈°par, an engineer and aviation enthusiast, and his cousin Eugen ƒåih√°k, bought a Bleriot XI aeroplane and started with flight experiments on the local military exercise ground in Pardubice. On 16 April 1910 Ka≈°par flew for the first time and as the first person in Czech lands. In later years he arranged flight exhibitions over the country, most famously his flight from Pardubice to Prague (120 km) on 13 May 1911. The first flying club in the Czech lands was founded in Pardubice on 26 April 1911. The club, named Pardubice Aviation society (Aviatick√© dru≈æstvo Pardubice) had five hangars but during World War I its activities stopped. After the war the place held occasional flight exhibitions. Since the end of 1929 the airport was used as a training place for aviation enthusiasts; expanded to 25 hectares, it was one of the largest in the country. Since 1933 the airport was also used for glider training. Between 1936 and 1937 new modern airport facilities were built. In 1939 the airfield took receipt of 39 airplanes from the Soviet Union, including 21 twin-engined bombers. During World War II the airport served for training of Luftwaffe pilots, toward the end of the war for combat operations, and was destroyed by bombing. Development since World War II Since 1950 the airport was used only for the military. A 2,500 m long concrete runway was built and a pilot training centre established. The airport hosted the 4th and 18th Fighter Air Wings (4. st√≠haci a 18. st√≠hac√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) equipped with S-199, MiG-15, C-2, C-5, C-11, MiG-19S, MiG-19PM, MiG-21F and Mi-1 helicopters, the 47th Reconnaissance Wing (47. pr≈Øzkumn√Ω leteck√Ω pluk) with MiG-21R, Il-28L, Il-14 and later with Su-22 and since 1986 the 30th Strafer Wing (30. bitevn√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) with Su-25K. Large support military units were located next to the airport and in the city. During the 1990s the military role of the airport gradually declined. Since 1994 the airport was used as a training base (34. z√°kladna ≈°koln√≠ho letectva) but in 2003 the army reduced the role of the airport to provide maintenance and logistics. In 1993 the company East Bohemian Airport a.s. aiming to open the airport for civil use was formed. Officially, the airport was opened for civil operation on 18 May 1995. Since 1 November 1996 the airport has been authorised for operation under the Instrument flight rules. Airlines and destinations The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Pardubice:airport-pardubice.cz - Scheduled flights retrieved 26 December 2016 Statistics In 2007 the airport handled a peak of 93,659 of passengers (about 85% from Russia) and 888 tonnes of cargo; in 2009, hit by the financial crisis, 49,032 passengers, 343 tonnes of cargo and 994 movements.Traffic statistics at the airport website .

Routers perform the \\"traffic directing\\" functions on the Internet; data packets are forwarded through the networks of the internet from router to router until they reach their destination computer. Routing algorithms determine the specific choice of route. Each router has a prior knowledge only of networks attached to it directly. A routing protocol shares this information first among immediate neighbors, and then throughout the network. This way, routers gain knowledge of the topology of the network. The ability of routing protocols to dynamically adjust to changing conditions such as disabled data lines and computers and route data around obstructions is what gives the Internet its fault tolerance and high availability. The specific characteristics of routing protocols include the manner in which they avoid routing loops, the manner in which they select preferred routes, using information about hop costs, the time they require to reach routing convergence, their scalability, and other factors such as relay multiplexing and cloud access framework parameters. Certain additional characteristics such as multilayer interfacing may also be employed as a means of distributing uncompromised networking gateways to authorized ports. This has the added benefit of preventing issues with routing protocol loops. Many routing protocols are defined in technical standards documents called RFCs.INTERNET PROTOCOL, RFC 791, J Postel, September 1981.BROADCASTING INTERNET DATAGRAMS IN THE PRESENCE OF SUBNETS, RFC 922, Jeffrey Mogul, October 1984Towards Requirements for IP Routers, RFC 1716, P. Almquist, November 1994Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers, RFC 1812, F. Baker,June 1995 Types Although there are many types of routing protocols, three major classes are in widespread use on IP networks: * Interior gateway protocols type 1, link-state routing protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS * Interior gateway protocols type 2, distance-vector routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol, RIPv2, IGRP. * Exterior gateway protocols are routing protocols used on the Internet for exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), a path-vector routing protocol. Exterior gateway protocols should not be confused with Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), an obsolete routing protocol. OSI layer designation Routing protocols, according to the OSI routing framework, are layer management protocols for the network layer, regardless of their transport mechanism: * IS-IS runs on the data link layer (Layer 2) * Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is encapsulated in IP, but runs only on the IPv4 subnet, while the IPv6 version runs on the link using only link-local addressing. * IGRP, and EIGRP are directly encapsulated in IP. EIGRP uses its own reliable transmission mechanism, while IGRP assumed an unreliable transport. * Routing Information Protocol (RIP) runs over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Version 1 operates in broadcast mode, while version 2 uses multicast addressing. * BGP runs over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Interior gateway protocols Interior gateway protocols (IGPs) exchange routing information within a single routing domain. Examples of IGPs include: * Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) * Routing Information Protocol (RIP) * Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) * Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Exterior gateway protocols Exterior gateway protocols exchange routing information between autonomous systems. Examples include: * Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) * Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Routing software Many software implementations exist for most of the common routing protocols. Examples of open-source applications are Bird Internet routing daemon, Quagga, GNU Zebra, OpenBGPD, OpenOSPFD, and XORP. Routed protocols Some network certification courses distinguish between routing protocols and routed protocols. A routed protocol is used to deliver application traffic. It provides appropriate addressing information in its internet layer or network layer to allow a packet to be forwarded from one network to another. Examples of routed protocols are the Internet Protocol (IP) and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX).

He was killed by a rival faction on July 16, 1996. Armed Islamic Group of Algeria Cherif Gousmi was succeeded by Djamel Zitouni who became Groupe Islamique Arm√© head on October 27, 1994. Zitouni, 30-year-old son of a poultry merchant had very limited religious education but was adept at killing French citizens.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.267-71 Zitouni extended the GIA's attacks on civilians to French soil, beginning with the hijacking of Air France Flight 8969 at the end of December 1994 and continuing with several bombings and attempted bombings throughout 1995. In Algeria itself, he continued likewise, with car bombs, assassinations of musicians, sportsmen, and unveiled women as well as the usual victims. In February 1995 it issued a communique ordering that \\"for every pure Muslim woman arrested by the government, an apostate's wife would be executed.\\"Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.269 Non GIA Islamists such as Muslim Brotherhood members and Djazarist were condemned as Godless and ordered to repent \\"according to a precise procedure\\". Even at this stage, the seemingly counterproductive nature of many of its attacks led to speculation (encouraged by FIS members abroad) that the group had been infiltrated by Algerian secret services. The region south of Algiers, in particular, came to be virtually dominated by the GIA; they called it the \\"liberated zone\\". Later it would be known as the \\"triangle of death\\". During this period, judging from its London-based magazine Al- Ansar, it worked out ever broader ideological justifications for killing civilians, with the help of fatwas from such figures as Abu Qatada. Reports of battles between the AIS and GIA increased (resulting in an estimated 60 deaths in March 1995 alone), and the GIA reiterated its death threats against FIS and AIS leaders, claiming to be the \\"sole prosecutor of jihad\\" and angered by their attempts to negotiate a settlement with the government. On 11 July, they assassinated a co-founder of FIS, Abdelbaki Sahraoui, in Paris (although some question the authenticity of their statement claiming credit for this.) During the 1995 election, the GIA threatened to kill anyone who voted (using the slogan \\"one vote, one bullet\\"), but turnout was high among the pious middle class. Soon afterwards, the GIA was shaken by internal dissension: shortly after the election, its leadership killed Islamist leaders who had joined the GIA. In December, the GIA killed the number three figure in the MEI who had returned to the AIS, Azzedine Baa. In January Abderrezak Redjam announced he wanted to rejoin the AIS and was killed. The death of Mohammad Said followed in November 1995. The two men's deaths were not announced in Al-Ansar journal until mid-December 1995 when the GIA blamed the killings on the security forces, but a few issues later on January 4 and 11 announced that it had in fact killed the two for being \\"members of the heretic djazarist sect\\" and for plotting a coup d'√©tat. Other Islamists suggested that they had objected to the GIA's indiscriminate violence. Considerable uproar and accusations of manipulation of GIA by security service followed. Militants began \\"to desert in droves\\": Mustapha Kartali, Ali Benhadjar, and Hassan Hattab's factions all refused to recognize Zitouni's leadership starting around late 1995, although they would not formally break away until somewhat later. On May 31, 1996 Al- Ansar suspended publication demanding an explanation from the GIA, and a week later it and two other Islamists groups (including the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya in Egypt) announced their withdrawal of support for Zitouni. In the summer of 1996 the GIA finally released a video of two friends of the victims \\"\`confessing\` to the plot and humbly requesting summary execution for themselves.\\"Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.269-70 In addition the GIA pledged to fight the AIS as an enemy; particularly in the west, full-scale battles between them became common. In July 1996, Zitouni was killed probably by Islamist seeking vengeance for his killing of Mohammed Said and Abderrazaq Redjem, or by one of the breakaway factions ‚Äì Ali Benhadjar's Medea brigade, later to become the AIS-aligned Islamic League for Da'wa and Jihad ‚Äì and was succeeded by Antar Zouabri. Djamel Zitouni had earned notoriety for such acts as the killing of the seven Monks of Tibhirine in March, but his successor would prove to be far bloodier.  GIA in France  The Algerian state pursued a number of strategies against the GIA. One was to encourage France to take an active part in the fight against the networks of the GIA in France, and thus to cut off its principal means of support abroad. To prevent this from happening, brought a campaign of bombings, hijackings, etc. to France, in hopes the French government would conclude that \\"the price of terrorism within France was too high\\" and would withdraw its support from the Algerian regime and \\"hasten its collapse.\\"Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.267 The GIA's first act was to hijack an Air France Flight 8969, which was due to fly from Algiers to Paris in December 1994. During their hijack the GIA announced \\"We are the Soldiers of Mercy\\". Intelligence provided by \\"Omar Nasiri\\"a pseudonym for a Moroccan spy and author of Inside the Jihad (a disgruntled GIA member turned mole) and a police raid of a safe house discovered their plan was to crash it on Paris, a plan prevented when the GIGN stormed the plane at Marseille.(26 minutes into television broadcast) The GIA conducted a series of bombings in France from 1995 to 1996. Analysis of a bomb with a failed trigger mechanism made it possible to identify a conspirator, Khaled Kelkal, who was shot and killed by French gendarmes on 29 September 1995. In late 1999, several GIA members were convicted by a French court for the 1995 bombing campaign.Institute for Counter Terrorism, 2 June 1999 . After the death of Zitouni in 1998, prior to the World Cup, France in collaboration with other European countries launched a vast preventive operation against the GIA. About 100 alleged members of the group were arrested throughout Europe. In Belgium, security forces seized weapons, detonators and forged identity papers.National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, April 1999 . On 11 June 1999, the GIA announced a jihad on French territory in a threatening letter addressed to the media. NotesReferencesBibliography * William J.

He died in Los Angeles aged 72, leaving most of his ¬£70m fortune to his son Lucas.Sunday Times Rich List Early life  White attended De Aston School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. He was a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II in clandestine operations in India, Burma and Thailand. It was during the war that White became friends with Bill Hanson, British show- jumping star and younger brother of James Hanson. Temperamentally and perhaps because of his wartime experiences, after the war White was more interested in having fun than working. Possessed of considerable panache, he set himself up as a Hollywood impresario in the early 1950s. He was a governor of the British Film Institute, 1982‚Äì4. Bill Hanson died aged 27 of cancer, leaving his bereaved elder brother James with the duty of carrying on the Hanson business name. White became a surrogate brother to James, and was eventually the brains of the Hanson takeover machine.Obituary: Lord Hanson - Wheeler-dealer who rose to greater fortune in the Thatcher years; Roger Cowe; Wednesday November 3, 2004; Guardian; referred to below as Lord Hanson obituary Early career  In 1958 in one of their first business ventures together he and James Hanson hit on the idea of importing jokey American greetings cards, then largely unknown in Britain. The business trading as Hanson White became one of Britain's largest suppliers of greeting cards, giftwrap and giftware and was sold to a management buy-out for ¬£10.8m in 1997. The pair's entry into serious business, and the world of takeovers, came through White's connection to Jim Slater, the accountant turned stock market whizz kid who introduced them to the potential in public company shares. White and Hanson concentrated on emulating Slater's takeover techniques, building up a public company through acquisitions and disposals.Lord Hanson obituary By 1964 he and Hanson had started to build up Hanson Trust out of the former Wiles Group. Hanson plc turned into one of the largest British-owned conglomerates with annual profits of more than ¬£1.5 billion and a strategy of growth through acquisition. From 1965-73 White was deputy chairman of Hanson Trust Ltd. Personal life  In 1973 White left Britain for New York City where he developed Hanson's American holdings. He married three times. His first marriage, to Elisabeth Kalen, the daughter of a Swedish diplomat, produced daughters Sita and Carolina,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-tragedy-of- sita-heiress-entangled-in-a-murky-business-51729.html and the second, to an American actress, Virginia North (whom he divorced in 1991), gave him a son, Lucas.

In the 1970s and 80s White and Hanson turned the Hanson group into a multinational encompassing, amongst others, US chemical factories, UK electricity suppliers and Australian gold mines. The Hanson group's other products included batteries, cigarettes, cod liver oil capsules, cranes, golf clubs, Jacuzzis, timber and toys. From 1979 to 1986, Hanson Trust stalked its prey on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, acquiring a succession of ever-larger companies, often in hard-fought takeover battles planned and directed by White but fronted by Hanson. At this time White and Hanson were giving millions of pounds to the Conservative Party. Successful acquisitions included the Ever Ready company Berec, the retail group UDS, and finally Imperial Group which included hotels, the Courage (brewery) and Golden Wonder crisps. At almost ¬£2bn, the Imperial Group takeover set the record as Britain's biggest. It also set the record as the bitterest. The fight was a public one, through full-page newspaper advertisements; but behind the scenes private investigators sought, unsuccessfully, to prove allegations of criminal activities in US side of business which was White's domain. The fight for Imperial took its toll. In 1986 The Times focused on a controversial attempt to take ¬£70m from the Courage (brewery) pension fund. In the City there was speculation as to how the takeover juggernaut could keep going with its aim to acquire ever-larger targets, and as Hanson and White passed normal retirement age there was speculation as to their succession plans. Neither had any intention of stepping down, but attempts to continue the proven method were, not surprisingly, becoming more difficult not least as the class of possible targets got smaller. Then there was the issue of the pair's political connection. In November 1990, Thatcher was ousted as prime minister, seriously weakening the pair's political support. Perhaps as a consolation prize, White was given a life peerage in the resignation honours list (Hanson had been made a life peer in 1983). Prior to being created a life peer with the title Baron White of Hull, of Hull in the County of Humberside on 25 January 1991, White had been appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1979 Birthday Honours. The reduction in political support, signalled by Thatcher's resignation and honours notwithstanding, was the beginning of the end of the pair's takeover career. In 1991 White and Hanson bid for Imperial Chemical Industries (\\"ICI\\"), one of the commanding heights of British industry, in what was supposed to be the ultimate takeover. Apart from being symbolic of Britain's manufacturing and research base, ICI had plants and offices all over Britain, which made it a highly political issue for the many members of parliament whose constituents might be affected - including several in marginal Tory seats. Had they succeeded, White and Hanson may have acquired some of ICI's respectability with which to veneer their own wheeler-dealer reputation. On guard, ICI caused White and Hanson deep embarrassment when it revealed that White was not on Hanson's board and had spent and lost several million pounds of company money on his passionate interest in racehorses.BBC News ICI also showed that White and Hanson ran a string of offshore companies in tax havens. Furthermore, Hanson's son Robert, having been identified as the pair's likely successor, had been put in charge of the bid and had been shown to be na√Øve, dealing a severe blow to White and Hanson's succession plans. Their reputations now seriously damaged, White and Hanson had to withdraw before a formal takeover for ICI could be launched. At the time of White's death in 1995, the climate in which the Hanson group operated had changed as investors looked beyond the conglomerate to single-sector companies. Hanson plc is now a British-based international building materials company, headquartered in London. White's horse Legal Case (b.c. 1986) won the Champion Stakes G1 in 1989 (jockey: R Cochrane; trainer: L Cumani).NatWest Rowley Mile Reference Light (USA) won the Anzio Maiden Stakes (Div II)(2yo) in 1989 at Redcar (trainer: Sir Michael Stoute; jockey: WR Swinburn) and Evasive Prince (USA) won the EBF Willow Maiden Stakes (Div I)(2yo) at Lingfield in 1990 (trainer: Sir Michael Stoute; jockey: WR Swinburn).Racing Post White entered two horses in the Jersey Stakes (Group 3)(3yo) at Ascot in 1990: Bold Russian which came second (trainer: BW Hills; jockey: Michael Hills); and Qui Danzig (USA) which came third (trainer: Sir Michael Stoute; jockey: WR Swinburn). Legacy  Hanson and White were controversial figures who, critics claimed, were devoted to the quick profit. Such was their fame, or notoriety, that White (then Sir Gordon) was written into the script of the 1987 film Wall Street, as the character 'Sir Larry Wildman', in which he was played as a cold-blooded money-making machine by actor Terence Stamp. Family  In May 2004 White's daughter Sita, aged 43, died suddenly during a Santa Monica yoga class, following years of financial troubles. Married three times,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-tragedy-of-sita- heiress-entangled-in-a-murky-business-51729.html she was the mother, from a relationship with Imran Khan, 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan and formerly an international cricketer, of a daughter, Tyrian Jade (born 1992); although Khan denied paternity, a U.S. court ruled that he was her father after Khan failed to contest the paternity suit.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-tragedy-of-sita- heiress-entangled-in-a-murky-business-51729.html In 2007, the Election Commission of Pakistan dismissed this judgement on the grounds that it was neither admissible in evidence before any court or tribunal in Pakistan nor executable against him. In 2004, after Sita White's death, Khan agreed to accept Tyrian as his child and welcomed her to join their house.

In 1934 (one year after the NSDAP came to power in Germany), the meaning changed to \\"immigration/imposition of foreign races\\", and in 1941 it became \\"immigration/imposition of foreign peoples\\". Following the Second World War, the 1951/1952 version of the Duden returned to the strictly economic definition. In 1961, the term \\"foreigner\\" came to replace \\"foreign races\\" or \\"foreign peoples\\". In 1986, the term was no longer used in economics. Since 1991, primarily the verb \\"√ºberfremden\\" has been in use, and one could speak of a country being √ºberfremdet (). In 1993, the Gesellschaft f√ºr deutsche Sprache () declared \\"√úberfremdung\\" to be the Unwort des Jahres (), as it makes \\"undifferentiated xenophobia\\" sound more argumentative and clinical.Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort! on Spiegel Online (in German). Linguists, philologists, political scientists and social scientists criticise the concept for its vagueness, its use under national socialism, and its continuing negative connotation. The word is related to terms in various languages: \\"foreign infiltration\\", \\"foreign penetration\\", French \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", Spanish \\"\\", Italian \\"\\", and \\"\\" (), which have all been used at various times to rally xenophobic sentiment.

Early career Natalie Powers began acting at the age of seven when she played the youngest orphan in the first run of the hit musical Annie. Natalie was brought up with her two brothers in Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham. Natalie's parents, Peter and Gloria, recognised her talent and took her to audition for the lead role in Annie. Natalie toured around the country and between the ages of seven and 14 she starred in a number of musicals and pantomimes. Natalie left school at 16 and moved to London to further her study. Upon leaving college, Natalie moved into the West End to take a principal role in Starlight Express at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. She later appeared alongside Kim Wilde in Tommy at the Shaftesbury Theatre before returning to Starlight. Scooch It was during this period that Natalie spotted an advert in The Stage newspaper for a new pop act. Natalie was called for an audition and after singing and dancing in front of Mike Stock, she was offered a place in the group. Caroline Barnes, David Ducasse and Russ Spencer completed the group. After signing a recording contract with Accolade, the pop imprint of EMI, Scooch set about recording their debut single, \\"When My Baby\\" featuring Natalie on lead vocals. The song gave Scooch their first top 40 single. The group embarked on an arena tour supporting B*witched and later Five to promote their follow-up single \\"More Than I Needed To Know\\". The single was released in January 2000 and entered the top 5. Scooch's third UK release came in the form of no. 12 reaching, \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" in June 2000. They were successful overseas also, in other countries such as Japan, where \\"More Than I Needed To Know\\" reached no. 1. A fourth single followed in the form of the flamenco inspired \\"For Sure\\" which reached no. 15 in the UK singles charts and was followed by the album \\"Four Sure\\" which was released in August 2000. At the end of their EMI record contract the group split up. Solo Years (2001‚Äì2007) Natalie gave birth to a son, Michael, in February 2001 and rested for the next couple of months. Describing motherhood as \\"the most amazing experience of her life\\", she took time out to relax and travelled to Italy with him and her parents to recuperate. Meeting with independent dance label Almighty Records in July 2001, it was agreed that they would work with Natalie on some solo material, the result of which was the top 5 single \\"Music to My Heart\\", a song which originally appeared on Scooch's debut album and was hailed by many fans as the best song Scooch ever recorded. Natalie embarked on a tour around to promote \\"Music to My Heart\\", also performing some old Scooch favorites. The public interest in Pop Idol prompted Almighty to ask Natalie to record a dance version of \\"Unchained Melody\\", which was soon to be released by Gareth Gates, one of the finalists. Natalie's version was released in April 2002 and was well received. While recording \\"Unchained Melody\\", Natalie overheard the producers remixing a track which later turned out to be \\"I Am Who I Am\\" by Belgian-Sicilian singer Lara Fabian. It was soon reworked by Natalie and was included on Almighty's Definitive Collection album. In 2003, Natalie's vocals appeared on two underground-trance tracks \\"Liftin Me Up\\" and \\"Over & Over\\" for production act Echoten and she signed a record deal with Mike Stock's record label Better The Devil, home to the Fast Food Rockers. Although some new tracks were recorded, no singles were released resulting in Natalie and Better The Devil parting company in late 2004. In 2004, the four original members of Scooch decided to do a mini tour of the UK, peaking at G-A-Y. In 2005 Natalie was approached by Northerbeat producer Ross Alexander to record an exclusive track for the Gayfest series. Natalie recorded a version of the Maria Vidal classic \\"Body Rock\\". In the summer of 2006, Natalie was asked to record for a new compilation album Forever Bond which consists of remixes of classic Bond themes. Natalie chose to record \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" from the film of the same name. The album which also includes the likes of Kelly Llorenna, Angie Brown and Hannah Jones was released in Europe and America in late 2006. In 2006, Natalie started a business as a vocal coach, working with both established and new acts for stage and screen. In addition, she recorded a number of new club-oriented tracks, including an original track \\"Drifting Away\\", written and produced by Saint which was released on the Totally Clubbed Up compilation album in early 2007 via Energise Records. Scooch Eurovision Reunion In October 2006, Russ Spencer contacted the other original Scooch members with an idea of recording a new track for the BBC's Making Your Mind Up competition, the winners of which were to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest. Scooch recorded an original track called \\"Flying the Flag (for You)\\", which won the selection competition. Following the success in the Eurovision selections, the group signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records in the UK and set about recording parts of the song in other European languages. Scooch released their Eurovision single on 7 May 2007 and performed at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. They finished joint 22nd out of 24 countries, receiving nineteen points; this did, however, include a maximum score of twelve from Malta. The next day, their single reached number 5 in the UK singles UK Top 40. After Eurovision Subsequent to their Eurovision exposure, the group embarked on a series of gigs across the UK & Ireland. Natalie recorded a new track \\"Shattered Glass\\", originally a hit for Laura Brannigan which was released as a single via Liberty City Music in the Spring of 2008. The release of this new material along with a new club mix of Flying The Flag saw Natalie on a UK club and Gay Pride tour. Following this brief return to recording, Natalie has since married and extended her family with the birth of a second son, Max, in December 2008. Throughout 2010 and into 2011, Natalie has now returned to vocal coaching and regularly performs along with the other original members of Scooch at clubs across the UK. Natalie is currently a singing coach at All Stars Academy, a theatre school in the Hemel Hemstead area which she jointly owns and runs with Amanda Constantinou.

It describes the perils of the national drive toward self-determination following the two unsuccessful uprisings against the Partitions of Poland, in November 1830 and January 1863. The plot is set at the wedding of a member of Krak√≥w intelligentsia (the Bridegroom), and his peasant Bride. Their class-blurring union follows a fashionable trend among friends of the playwright from the modernist Young Poland movement. Wyspia≈Ñski's play was based on a real-life event: the wedding of his contemporary, Lucjan Rydel at St. Mary's Basilica in Krak√≥w, followed by the wedding reception in the village of Bronowice. Plot summary A poet marries a peasant girl and their wedding reception follows. The celebration of the marriage moves from the church to the villager's house. In the rooms adjoining that of the wedding reception, guests continually get into arguments, make love, or simply rest from their merriment, dancing and feasting. Interspersed with the real guests are the ghosts of well-known personas from Polish history and culture, who represent the guilty consciences of the living. The two groups begin a series of dialogues. The wedding guests are hypnotized by a rosebush cane straw-wrap (Chocho≈Ç) who comes to life and joins the party from the farmhouse garden. The \\"Poet\\" is visited successively by the \\"Black Knight\\" (a symbol of the nation's past military glory), the \\"Journalist\\", then by the court jester \\"Sta≈Ñczyk\\" who's a conservative political sage; and by the \\"Ghost of Wernyhora\\" (a paradigm of leadership for Poland). Wernyhora presents the Host with a golden horn symbolizing the national mission, and calls the Polish people to a revolt. One of the farm hands is dispatched to sound the horn at each corner of Poland, but he loses the horn soon after. Thus, the wedding guests, who symbolize the nation, waste their chance at national freedom. They keep on dancing \\"the way it's played for them\\" (a Polish folk proverb) like puppets, failing in their ultimate mission. Influences A defining work of Polish drama written at the turn of the 20th century, staged many times, this drama has had much influence on the Polish culture. It was made into a movie with the same title by the award- winning Polish film director, Andrzej Wajda, in 1972.

Her biography is difficult to establish since several noblewomen in the same area at the same time had the same rare first name. The name Esclarmonde means \\"clarity of the world\\" in the Occitan language.  Family  Esclarmonde of Foix was the daughter of Roger Bernard I, Count of Foix, and C√©cile Trencavel, daughter of Raymond I Trencavel. Raymond-Roger of Foix, Count of Foix was her brother. In 1175, she married Jourdain III, lord of L'Isle-Jourdain. They had 6 children: * Bernard- Jourdain de l'Isle-Jourdain, the eldest and heir * Escaronia * Obica * Jordan * Othon-Bernard * Philippa  Spiritual life  Esclarmonde was widowed in October 1200 and turned to Catharism sometime thereafter. Catharism was a form of Christianity which had developed in southern France at that time, and which was seen as heresy by the Catholic church. She received the Cathar sacrament, the consolamentum, for becoming a Cathar Perfect from the Cathar bishop Guilhabert de Castres in 1204 in Fanjeaux along with three other women of high rank, Aude de Fanjeaux, Fays de Durfort, and Raymonde of Saint-Germain. The ceremony was conducted in the presence of her brother, Raymond-Roger of Foix. She settled in Pamiers and was probably involved in an initiative to rebuild the fortress of the Ch√¢teau de Monts√©gur. She participated in the Conference of Pamiers of 1207, which followed the Conference of Montreal of the previous year. It was the last debate between the Cathars and the Roman Catholic Church, represented by Dominic Guzman, founder of the Dominican order and later known as Saint Dominic, and Diego de Acebo, the bishop of Osma. The following year, in 1208, Pope Innocent III launched the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars after the murder of his delegate Pierre de Castelnau.  Legacy  Esclarmonde of Foix is remembered differently by different groups in France. For the Catholics, she spread heresy in the country and forced people to adopt the rules of the Cathars.

The significance of her name's meaning, i.e. \\"clarity of the world\\", is explored in several medieval epic poems including one referred to as \\"Esclaramonde\\", by Bertran de Born, and in \\"Parzival\\" by Wolfram von Eschenbach.

It is in the Derbyshire Dales district and the nearest towns are Buxton to the northwest and Bakewell to the east. The name Chelmorton derives from Old English (a personal name + d≈´n) and probably means 'Ceolmaer's hill' (or 'Cƒìolm√¶r's hill'). The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 322. Chelmorton village lines a long street in a high, shallow basin on a limestone plateau, part of the White Peak area of the Peak District National Park. The village is surrounded by a regular pattern of rectangular fields that are bordered by limestone walls; the layout of these indicates that the village had one or possibly two medieval open fields, before enclosure occurred at a subsequent unspecified time. In the 12th century the village was known as Chelmerdon(e). The parish church of Saint John the Baptist is 11th century.Pevsner, Nikolaus. 1986. The Buildings of England: Derbyshire. page 140. Harmondsworth, Middx. Penguin. At the opposite end of the village stands its oldest dwelling, Townend Farm, built originally by Isaiah Buxton in 1634. With its four Venetian windows and pedimented doorway it is also known locally as Chelmorton Hall. This ancestral home and family seat of the Marsden family has an enclosed courtyard with elaborate outbuildings. The Church Inn is at the bottom of Chelmorton Low. Other sites of interest are the Rakes, and the source of the village's traditional water supply, Illy Willy Water.

Under the leadership of its first Director Eduard Reimer (1896‚Äì1957), President of the German Patent Office, the Institute quickly gained international importance and recognition.Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition website, 'Brief History'. Consulted on January 07, 2019. His successor Eugen Ulmer (1903‚Äì1988) put a stamp on the research work for decades; he notably promoted the expansion of the national and international copyright and competition law. In 1966, as its founding Director, he established the ‚ÄúMax-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law‚Äù. Alongside Eugen Ulmer, Friedrich-Karl Beier (1926‚Äì1997) and Gerhard Schricker (until 2003) were admitted to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute. In the following decades, the Max Planck Institute would exert a wide-ranging influence on the national and international development of the relevant fields of law. An outstanding example of this influence was research based on comparative law analyses regarding European harmonisation of the law against unfair competition of trademark law, of design law as well as copyright law. Also essential were comparative law studies on the patentability of biotechnological inventions or the exploration of limits between the trademark rights. In 2002, the Institute was modernised significantly, in particular with respect to personnel, areas of expertise, and its facilities. On 1 January 2002, Josef Drexl, Reto M. Hilty and Wolfgang Sch√∂n were appointed to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute, serving alongside Joseph Straus, who was appointed Director in 2001 taking over the directorship from Gerhard Schricker. On 1 July 2002, a new department ‚ÄúAccounting and Taxes‚Äù was added to the newly formed unit ‚ÄúIntellectual Property Law and Competition Law‚Äù. This department was conceived to cover law regarding capital market information and the taxation of companies as constituents of the international economic and competition regime. Also in 2002, the Munich Intellectual Property Law Center (MIPLC) was founded, which from an administrative point of view is managed as an independent department of the Institute, but is supported by the Max Planck Society in cooperation with the University of Augsburg, the Technical University Munich as well as the George Washington Law School, Washington D.C. The MIPLC conducts both research as well as teaching and, since autumn 2003, offers an internationally networked LLM degree, under the direction of Joseph Straus (until 2008) and Josef Drexl (as of 2009) and staffed by world-renowned academics.Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition website, 'Brief History'.

The main field of Public Economics studies the functioning of government, as well as the challenges and the opportunities for reform. The Department analyzes the limits and scope of government, with a special focus on levying taxes to finance its core tasks in a modern nation state. In January 2011 the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law () was split to form the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law under the directorship of Josef Drexl and Reto M.

Overview = Features  While add-ins and macros for word processors, such as Script Wizard for Microsoft Word, can be used to write screenplays, the need for dedicated screenwriting programs arises from the presence of certain peculiarities in standard screenplay format which are not handled well by generic word processors such as page-break constraints imposed by standard screenplay format. Screenplay software often provides specialized shortcuts for quickly typing character names or slug lines, collaborating with other writers, adding production notes, character notes, easy outlining, scene reordering, and other tools to facilitate the creative process. Other features often required when writing shooting scripts include page-locking, scene numbering, revision-tracking, and production-related reports (such as which characters appear in a given scene or which scenes are set during the day or night). Some screenwriting applications, such as Celtx and Sophocles, also incorporate production scheduling and budgeting features. Another class of screenwriting software includes those that, rather than act as specialized word processors, attempt to direct the writer's storytelling process by utilizing story theory to facilitate the planning of a screenplay. Examples of this type of program includes Dramatica and Index Card. Screenwriting software often also provides functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for various characteristics. In 2018, developers began adding functions that allow an analysis of gender representation such as the Bechdel test, e.g. in Highland 2, WriterDuet and the forthcoming Final Draft 11.  Platforms  Screenwriting programs exist for all varieties of platforms and environments including traditional standalone desktop applications that run directly on a personal computer, web applications that run solely within a browser, and mobile apps that run on phones, tablets, and other portable devices.  Plain text markup  The Fountain markup syntax, co-developed by screenwriter John August, facilitates formatting screenplays directly from plain text, be it in dedicated writing software, email programs, or text generated through OCR. There is also a formatting package for LaTeX called screenplay.  History  The first screenwriting software was a standalone script formatter, Scriptor, from Screenplay Systems. It took a text file generated by a word processor and inserted the proper page break tags. When used in conjunction with a TSR program such as SmartKey or ProKey‚Äîkeyboard utilities that assigned a sequence of commands to keystroke combinations‚Äîthe \\"dot commands\\" that Scriptor required could be inserted semi-automatically. Additionally, keyboard macros could be programmed to properly indent and enter abbreviations‚Äîallowing a user to customize the working of the word processor. SmartKey was popular with screenwriters from 1982‚Äì1987, after which word processing programs had their own macro features. An update to Scriptor understood the style sheets used in Microsoft Word for DOS. And so the need for key macro programs was lessened. Scriptor's limitation was that once formatted it was difficult to re-import the resulting text back into a word processor for further editing. The next generation of screenplay software hooked into Microsoft Word. Warren Script Application was initially released as a set of style sheets for Word for DOS. It was updated for Word for Windows circa 1988. gScript, a shareware script formatter/template, was released via CompuServe in 1989. It was included on the disk accompanying the book Take Word for Windows to the Edge, published by Ziff-Davis in 1993. It was subsequently updated and released commercially as ScriptWright. This third generation of screenplay software consists of the standalone script writing programs such as Movie Magic Screenwriter, Final Draft, and Cinovation's Scriptware. The latest generation adds online storage and collaboration and integrates with apps on mobile devices. Many software also integrate outlining tools as well as other creative support, and tools to further integrate the production process.

Battery Way was one of two (Battery Geary the other) mortar batteries at Fort Mills that, with Fort Hughes, Fort Drum, Fort Frank and Fort Wint formed the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. Battery Way was named for Lt. Henry N. Way of the 4th U.S. Artillery. Construction and design Battery Way was constructed as part of the fortifications program initiated by the Taft Board. Constructed between 1908 and 1914, it was the only single-pit mortar battery built as part of the program. Its four coast defense mortars, M1890MI guns on M1896MI carriages, were designed to loft armor-piercing shells in a high trajectory onto the decks of warships threatening Manila Bay. Advances in naval gunnery and ship design rendered these weapons mostly obsolete by the end of World War I. World War II Battery Way played a very limited role during the Philippines Campaign in the Spring of 1942, only becoming active in the last week of the battle. The battery had been out of service for several years, but three of the four mortars were returned to service with a crew from Battery E, 60th Coast Artillery (AA), recently evacuated from Bataan, by 28 April. These were fired for the first time on that day against Japanese positions on nearby Bataan. Its exposure to Japanese artillery, air attack, and its limited supply of high explosive shells greatly diminished its effectiveness. By the time of the Japanese landings on Corregidor island on 5‚Äì6 May 1942, only one mortar tube of Battery Way remained serviceable, the other two having been damaged beyond repair by Japanese artillery.Belote, pp 158-160Morton, p. 540 The battery was manned by the Japanese after the fall of Corregidor in 1942. The guns were permanently damaged during the retaking of Corregidor by U.S. forces in early 1945. Post-war Corregidor Island, its surviving fortifications, and associated war relics are presently maintained as a national park. Daytime and overnight tours are available. The entire island is now maintained by the Cavite Foundation Institute (CFI) of Cavite, Philippines, and the Department of Tourism. Aside from the tours, trekking, hiking, and swimming has become a part of visitors' activities. Battery Way in popular culture * In an episode of the Filipino television show Strangebrew, Tado and Erning are looking for some batteries for Tado's flashlight when a ghost appears to them and tells them to go to Corregidor where there are many batteries (actually the Battery Way).

She represented her country and national broadcaster RTP at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, in Helsinki, Finland, after winning the Festival da Can√ß√£o, the national selection. Due to Portugal's non-qualification to the final, in 2006, Sabrina performed in the semi-final, finishing 11th thus failing to qualify. Biography Sabrina started singing at school and family parties and, at the age of 16, she already had won some karaoke competitions. Her major hobby was playing futsal at the Grupo Desportivo e Recreativo do Bairro do Liceu, achieving a championship runner-up place for local club Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. Professionally, she was part of the third and last line-up of Portuguese girlband Teenagers, from 2003 to 2006, when she planned to start her solo career. In early 2007, with 24 years old, she was selected, through a casting, to participate on RTP's Festival da Can√ß√£o 2007. Her producer, popular artist Emanuel, proposed her to perform under the alias Sabrina. On 10 March, she won the show with almost twice the votes of the runner-up. The song, called \\"Dan√ßa comigo\\", represented Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. Sabrina performed in position number 17 at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 semi-final, backed by a mixed pair of dancers and three female singers. The Eurovision version was more Latino-influenced than the version with which she won the Festival da Can√ß√£o, and the last two choruses were sung in French, Spanish, English and Portuguese. The dance routine was more elaborate also. Sabrina ended up 11th, just 4 points short of qualification, right behind Moldova (to whom incidentally Portugal gave its maximum points). The song's final ranking was 25th out of 42 countries, making \\"Dan√ßa Comigo\\" the most successful Portuguese entry since 1998, and the second highest Portuguese scorer ever, with 88 points (after the 92 points from 1996). 44 points came from western European countries (8 points from neighbouring Spain), and 36 points from eastern Europe. It was the highest western scoring song in the semi-final. In ESC 2008, she was a spokesperson for RTP. Along with the Eurovision Song Contest preparations, she was also working on her debut album, produced by Emanuel.

Biography Virtually nothing is known of Black Moon's early years. He had risen to a position of influence among his tribe by 1869 when he was present at the appointment of Sitting Bull as head war leader of the Lakota. By the time of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, this fifty-five-year-old headman was leader of a small Miniconjou band that chose to remain away from the Cheyenne River Agency. Black Moon is listed as one of the Miniconjou leaders who had joined the northern village by the early summer of 1876 and was present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. He and his family fled to Canada in 1877, joining Sitting Bull near Wood Mountain. When majority of the northern Lakota elected to surrender in 1880-81, Black Moon decided to remain in Canada, as did No Neck and a Brul√© named Black Bull. He and his family lived near Moose Jaw and Willow Bunch and established relationships with Canadians in the region. Black Moon's daughter, Mary, married a corporal in the Royal Mounted Police stationed at nearby Fort Walsh. Black Moon finally departed Canada for the U.S. in the spring of 1889 with eleven lodges. Intercepted by soldiers, they were allowed to continue on to the Standing Rock Agency two weeks later. Black Moon and his family were transferred to the Cheyenne River Agency in October 1890. Part of his family traveled with Big Foot when he fled the agency during the Ghost Dance troubles. According to Dickson, \\"Black Moon's wife, daughter and son were killed\\" at Wounded Knee; and \\"another son and other family members were wounded.\\" Afterwards, survivor Alice War Bonnet Charging Cloud reported seeing Black Moon with his brothers, Iron Horn and Wood Pile, at Pine Ridge, according to her son, William War Bonnet.

Formerly known as Nik≈°iƒáka banka AD, the bank was renamed in March 2007. Prva banka CG assumed continuity from a bank, existing under various forms of ownership, that was founded in 1901. 113 years ago, in 1901, Niksic Saving Bank was founded, as the first bank in Montenegro. It got its name from the city in which it was founded, and which was then writing new and different pages in its history. Beginning of a more progressive society and city was also driving business growth, and foundation of Montenegro brewery \\"Onogost\\" in 1896 and First Niksic Saving Bank in 1901 also meant beginnings of industrial and banking capital. At the same time, this was also a key moment which started a new chapter in further development of Niksic industry and society. Promoter of First Niksic Saving Bank (originally called First Niksic Money Cooperative), and in effect the first bank in Montenegro, was Joco Petrovic, renowned finance expert of the time. At the incorporation general meeting on 6 January 1901, interim board of directors included traders, craftsmen and aristocrats, who voted in favour of document titled \\"Saving Bank Rules\\". According to these rules: \\"It is the Saving Bank‚Äôs goal to develop and support saving and enhance trade and industry in the country by providing favorable credit conditions. Therefore, it will accept and pay interest on saved money from anyone and generate income by providing loans\\". The existence of several corporate governing bodies shows how serious the intention to set up the Saving Bank was: Shareholders General Assembly, Board of Directors with management and Audit Committee. On 5 March 1901, Montenegro‚Äôs king Nikola I Petrovic gave his official support to newly founded First Niksic Saving Bank, and the president of the State Council at the time, Bozo Petrovic, endorsed the ‚ÄûSaving Bank Rules‚Äú with his signature. Saving Bank marked its first anniversary with profit. Although not huge, this profit showed that first bank in Montenegro in its first year managed to overcome many problems, secure survival and created conditions for foundation and development of new units in other business centres. In 1908, Saving Bank opened new branches outside Niksic, in Velimlje and Savnik, and after Balkan Wars, it opened another one, in Pljevlja. In parallel to its expansion in Montenegro, it worked on developing business connections with foreign banks. However, successful existence of the Saving Bank was somewhat disturbed by Balkan Wars in 1912-1913 and official decision by the state to protect indebted population during the war with Law on Extending Loan Terms for Citizens. At its 14th shareholders annual general meeting, on 2 March 1914, Saving Bank changed name to Niksic Credit Bank, but it operated under this name very briefly ‚Äì until the First World War started later in the same year. Niksic Credit Bank continued its operations in 1923, when political and social tensions and currency fluctuations diminished. After it stopped working during the Second World War, it continued its banking activity late towards the end of 1944 and within the system of National Bank of Yugoslavia. With separation between National Bank of Yugoslavia and National Accounting Service, new saving bank was formed in Niksic. To support the regional development in Montenegro, in 1961 Communal Bank for Niksic, Savnik and Pluzine was formed. After its transformation, from 1966 the bank existed under a new name: Commercial Bank of Niksic. In 1967, Montenegro‚Äôs banking system was comprehensively integrated into Investment Bank of Titograd. Commercial Bank of Niksic became a branch of the new system and maintained that status until 1978. In the same year, and in line with the new transformation of the banking system, Niksic Bank was formed, still within the Investment Bank of Titograd, as the main bank in Montenegro. Niksic Bank had significant independence: it constituted its corporate governance and played an important part in investment and other activities of the regional industry. In 1990, once again there is a consolidation of almost all banks in Montenegro into a united system of Montenegrobanka Titograd. At that point, Niksic Bank loses its independence, although it kept the main branch status. In that period, absence of active support to regional development was a result of moving the financial decision making elsewhere. This also stopped further growth of the bank. After a long transformation of the banking system, on 28 February 1992, at the bank‚Äôs general meeting a decision was made to leave the Montenegrobanka system and operate independently under Niksic Bank dd Niksic name. In June 1995, its founders and shareholders transformed it into Niksic Bank ad Niksic, owned by its shareholders. This name associated the bank with its local origins and character and in 2007 complete change of its visual identity took place. The bank became Prva Banka Crne Gore (First Bank of Montenegro) ‚Äì founded in 1901. With these changes, the intention was to maintain the bank‚Äôs tradition, but also promote its activities in all parts of Montenegro. In addition, the bank‚Äôs headquarters moved to new location ‚Äì Podgorica. Nowadays, after 113 years, Prva Banka is a modern financial institution, which represents a mix of experienced banking experts and young, educated people, able to recognise their clients‚Äô needs and help them. Prva Banka follows world trends in banking, respecting regulatory compliance, with always present vision ‚Äì to remain stable commercial bank, based on Montenegro‚Äôs resources and Montenegrin knowledge. Controversies It is alleged that the privatization of the bank in 2007 was done in a way that gave family and friends of the Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, controlling interest on favorable terms. In 2008 the bank, on the verge of collapse, was provided with a ‚Ç¨44 million state-funded bailout. A classified audit conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in late 2009 and early 2010 showed mismanagement of the bank.

Construction and operation  The branch began at Bismarck in Vermilion County, Illinois and ran southeast across neighboring Warren County, Indiana. It crossed the Wabash River near the river town of Baltimore, then continued southeast to Covington in Fountain County, and then a few miles further south to the coal mines near Snoddy's Mill in the Coal Creek area. These mines were operated by Phelps and Company, and by McClelland and Company. The area was known as Stringtown because it consisted of a series of small settlements; this name is still used locally. Construction began in the second week of June 1872. By August, the portion that ran from the mines north to Covington was completed. The remainder was finished by July 1873. The line covered a total distance of about and transported coal for several years in the 1870s. Two trains ran to and from the mines each day. The trip from Bismarck to the coal mines took about 2 hours and 15 minutes, making the average speed about ; there were four stations along the way, including Sumner (Johnsonville), Taylor (or Taylor's Switch), a gravel pit, and Covington.

At this point, the Wabash Railroad ran from northeast to southwest, and the new line ran from northwest to southeast. Local landowner G. W. Johnson saw an opportunity and established the town of Johnsonville at this intersection. A post office opened there in 1875.  Riot and closure  In December 1877, a murder took place in Stringtown, and although the culprit was convicted, problems increased between the 90 black and 225 white miners. The following April, five black miners were killed; at the trial in June, fourteen miners were indicted, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence that they were involved, and a riot began. A telegram was sent to Governor James D. Williams, who sent the Wabash Guards to restore order. Fifty shots were fired and four men were killed.Clifton 1913, pp. 137‚Äì138. The railroad itself had problems with bankruptcy and strikes; according to an 1881 history, an injunction was to be filed against the railroad, but the presiding judge was away, and \\"as a result the road was torn up and never rebuilt\\".Clifton 1913, p. 132. In 1877, the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad, along with two other railroads, was consolidated into the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad. The portion of the line that ran from Covington to Bismarck was closed on June 15, 1879, and the tracks were taken up in 1880. Coal continued to be mined at Stringtown in the 1880s and was taken north to Covington, then on to Danville via the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway. The labor problems at the mine affected its production, and by 1888 the remainder of the line had been taken up. This was the end of the Pumpkin Vine Railroad.  Unfinished portion  The plan had called for this line to continue south from Covington and Snoddy's Mill, into Parke County and past Montezuma, then southeast to Brazil in Clay County. Construction on this portion of the line started, and by 1873, the railroad grade had entered Parke County from the south, moving north along the Raccoon Creek. Some truss bridges were built, but this part of the line was never completed.  Present day  Pumpkin Vine Railroad grade in 2007 There are still several places along the former route where traces of the grade can be seen, and in a few wooded areas small sections of the grade are virtually untouched (though of course grass-covered and with no ties or rails).

No cause of death was determined, although the music journalist Ralph Heibutzki reported in a 2011 edition of Ugly Things that he was the victim of an accidental drug overdose.Heibutzki, Ralph, \\"Traveling Show: The Serendipitous & Surreal Six-Stringed Life & Times Of Ollie Halsall, part 3\\", Ugly Things, issue no.31, Spring 2011. He left behind a widow, Deborah. The song \\"Not For Keith\\" on the album pH7 by Peter Hammill, (1979) was a tribute to Ellis.

A car door is a type of door, typically hinged, but sometimes attached by other mechanisms such as tracks, in front of an opening which is used for entering and exiting a vehicle. A vehicle door can be opened to provide access to the opening, or closed to secure it. These doors can be opened manually, or powered electronically. Powered doors are usually found on minivans, high-end cars, or modified cars. General design Open doors on a Chrysler Airflow Unlike other types of doors, the exterior side of the vehicle door contrasts in its design and finish from its interior side (the interior part is typically equipped with a door card (in British English) or a door panel (in American English) that has decorative and functional features. The exterior side of the door is designed of steel or other material like the rest of the vehicle's exterior. In addition, its decorative appearance, typically colored with a design, is intended to match with the rest of the vehicle's exterior, the central purpose being to add to the overall aesthetic appeal of the vehicle exterior. A vehicle typically has two types of doors: front doors and rear doors. Loosely related are: vehicle hoods and vehicle trunk lids. There are also doors known as a \\"hatch\\" (see \\"door categorization\\" below) A major safety issue with opened vehicle doors is the assumption at night vehicle doors can provide a warning to other vehicle drivers. Unfortunately it is estimated over 50 percent of all vehicle doors have nothing applied to the interior of the vehicle door such as light and/or a reflector. Unfortunately these devices need not meet any US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards since no standards apply. To make matters worse it was reported by the Fatal Accident Reporting System that in the year 2014 not one single death was reported with a person outside the opened vehicle door at night in the entire United States of America. New safety technology such as providing to the lower interior edge of the vehicle door a highly reflective tape provides the ability of other vehicle drivers to see the opened vehicle door at night ( see US Patent No. 9,308,859 for details including diagrams of a typical application ) Parts *Door card *Door handle *Door switch *Glass window *Pillar *Power door locks, which can work on a remote system *Interior storage compartment Door locks and latches Most vehicle doors are secured closed to the vehicle body with latches which may be locked to prevent unauthorized access from the exterior. There are a variety of car door locking systems. Door locks may be manually, or automatically operated, and may be centrally or individually operated. Also, they may be operated by remote control, with the transmitter often integrated into the main vehicle access / ignition key. Additionally, rear passenger doors are frequently fitted with child safety locks to prevent children from exiting the vehicle unless the door is opened from the exterior. These are also frequently used on police cars, to prevent suspect criminals from escaping whilst in police custody. Vehicle door latches on practically all vehicles today are usually operated by use of a handle which requires the user to pull, lift, or tug - with some force towards themselves rather than push. There is a reason for this. As late as the 1970s, some vehicles used exposed push buttons to operate the door latch, such as certain Opel models. The unfortunate side effect of this design was that external objects which touched a vehicle during a spinout could trigger the latch; the door would pop open and eject the vehicle occupants. A death which occurred exactly that way led to the landmark legal case of Daly v. General Motors Corp., 20 Cal. 3d 725 (1978), in which the Supreme Court of California merged strict product liability with comparative fault, and thereby affirmed the right of General Motors to introduce evidence that decedent Kirk Daly flew out of his Opel not only because the door popped open, but because he was intoxicated and not wearing a seat belt. Door switch Door switches are simple on/off mechanisms connected to the interior light (dome light), and may also be connected to a warning light, speaker or other device, to inform the driver when the door is not closed. The door light is standard equipment on all cars. In American cars from the 1950s-1990s, they had buzzers or \\"door dingers\\" that sounded, along with the check light, whenever any door is open. Windows Most vehicle doors have windows, and most of these may be opened to various extents. Most car door windows retract downwards into the body of the doors, and are opened either with a manual crank, or switchable electrical motor (electric car windows other than the driver's window can usually be controlled at both the door itself and centrally by an additional control at the driver's position). In the past, certain retracting windows were operated by direct (up or down) pressure, and were held in the up position by friction instead of by an internal lift mechanism. Other cars, particularly older US-manufactured vans, have hinged windows with a folded lever mechanism to push and hold the window out from its closed position. Door brakes or stays Vehicle doors often include brakes, or 'stays', that slow the door down just before it closes, and also prevent the door opening further than its design specification. The current trend is to have a three-stage door brake. Door brakes exist because the doors on the first vehicles were heavy, so they had to be pushed hard to make them close. Soon after, automotive manufacturers managed to construct lighter doors, but users were used to closing doors with force so doors quickly became damaged. Door brakes were then introduced to slow down the door just before the door closed to prevent damage; these soon became standard. Door categorization Hatchback and estate or station wagon bodies are sold as 'three-door' or 'five-door' models. In these cases, the rear hatch is classified as a door; this is because it enters the passenger compartment. With other vehicles such as saloons or sedans and coup√©s, the boot/trunk lid is not counted as a door by definition because it is for a separate storage compartment - these cars are sold as 'two-door' or 'four- door'. This system is mainly used in Europe, and is less common in North America. In Europe, the American-style labelling is occasionally used. Usually in North America, cars are only sold as \\"two-door\\" or \\"four-door\\" models. This American-style labelling only includes the passengers' and driver's doors, and not hatches on hatchbacks and station wagons. This has led to many not understanding that hatches are counted as doors in Europe, whilst the lids to sealed trunks aren't. Being doored Some cyclists refer to colliding with an open car door as \\"being door checked\\". This usually happens when the cyclist is riding alongside a row of parallel-parked cars, and a driver suddenly opens his or her door immediately in front of the cyclist without first looking to see if it is safe to do so. Major advancements have been made to allow visual recognition of a partially opened vehicle door to provide a degree of warning to cyclists and motor vehicle drivers particularly at night. See US Patent No. 9,469,246. Types There are many different types of vehicle doors, including the following: Conventional A conventional door, also known as a regular door is hinged at the front-facing edge of the door, and so allows the door to swing outward from the body of the car. These doors are relatively safe, in that if they are opened during forward motion of the vehicle, the wind resistance will work against the opening door, and will effectively force its closure. The operation of a vehicle door entering, exiting, or standing out side an opened vehicle door is extremely dangerous particularly at night even when looking both ways. The issue is the vehicle door in most cases provides not visual warning to other vehicle drivers to allow accident avoidance of another vehicle driver to have the time to take avoidance measures. New advancements have been made to allow the viewing of the opened vehicle door at night with the addition of highly reflective tape applied to the lower interior edge of the vehicle door ( see US Patent No. 9,308,859 ). These new advancements allow the opened vehicle door to be seen even with a person blocking the prior art systems such as a reflector or a light by providing reflex reflectivity exceeding fifty percent of the vehicle door behind a person legs blocking the opened vehicle door at night. Suicide A suicide door is hinged on its trailing edge. The term \\"suicide door\\" was coined due to the potential for the door to fly open when the latch was released while car was in motion. Scissor Scissor doors rotate vertically upward and are hinged at or near the end of the windshield. They are used in Lamborghinis, Alfa Romeos, and other brands. Butterfly Butterfly doors are similar to scissor doors, but while scissor doors move up, butterfly doors also move outwards, which makes for easier entry/exit, and saves space. Gull-wing Gull-wing doors are hinged on their uppermost edge, at the roof rather than the side. They are so named because, when opened, the doors evoke the image of a seagull opening its wings. Sliding Sliding doors open by sliding horizontally or vertically, whereby the door is either mounted on, or suspended from a track. They are commonly used on the sides of minivans, leisure activity vehicles, light commercial vehicles, minibuses and some buses as this allows a large opening for equipment to be loaded and unloaded without obstructing access. Canopy A canopy door sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way, to provide access for passengers. It is similar to an aircraft canopy. There are no set standards to canopies, so they can be hinged at the front, side or back - although hinging at the front is most common. Canopy doors are rarely used on production cars, but are frequently used on the 'closed' variants of Le Mans Prototype endurance race cars. They are also sometimes used on concept cars. Disappearing A disappearing door slides down and under the vehicle. This type makes the whole side of the passenger compartment open, and only leaves a threshold to step over to get in and out. Also called the Jatech rotary drop door, or disappearing car door. One example of a car with disappearing doors is the Lincoln Mark VIII concept car. Vehicle regulations Various countries have their own regulations for vehicle doors. Global Technical Regulation No. 1, Door locks, is one of the few global regulations. Various countries are member of this regulations, for instance, Australia, Canada, European Union, Japan, Russia and the United States. China and India are not member of this one.https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2020/ECE- TRANS-WP.29-343-Rev.28-Add.1.pdf Another international doors regulation is regulation #11: door latches and door retention components.

It was first broadcast on 3 April 1998. Synopsis Ted, Dougal, Jack, and Mrs. Doyle depart Craggy Island for the mainland for various reasons; Ted plans to collect ¬£200 he won in a bet, and then visit the \\"Very Dark Caves\\" with Dougal, Mrs. Doyle plans to meet with her friend Mrs. Dineen to have tea, and Jack needs to go to the optician to get a new pair of glasses, after his last pair was stolen by a crow. After dropping Mrs. Doyle and Jack off, Ted and Dougal go to the caves. Ted is surprised to see Richard Wilson, from the sitcom One Foot in the Grave, waiting outside, and goes up to greet him with his catchphrase \\"I don't believe it!\\". Wilson, who is sick of hearing the phrase himself, turns on Ted and starts beating him up before others physically drag him away. Ted and Dougal proceed into the caves with a tour group. When Ted utters \\"I don't believe it!\\" in awe of a rock formation, he encounters Wilson again, and he and Dougal flee deeper into the caves, getting lost. The cave guide apologises to Wilson, who says that it's all right, as long as he does not have to hear the catchphrase again. The cave guide then has to stop himself from saying it. Ted and Dougal end up finding Father Noel Furlong and the St. Luke's Youth Group deeper within, having been lost there for two days. After Noel decides to have a screeching competition and is buried under a pile of falling rocks (while the Youth Group members leave and board flights to Paraguay), Ted and Dougal continue on their own. Ted eventually discovers that Dougal's jumper has come unravelled, and realises that the thread will provide a way out, but after inadvertently winding it all up in the excitement, he again exclaims \\"I don't believe it!\\", his words echoing to Wilson, who starts to lose his sanity. On their way out, they tell a passing binman about Noel's plight, unaware he is not a cave guide. At the optician, Jack gets a new pair of glasses, only to immediately lose them to a crow again as he leaves. Wandering, he comes across a sign for an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, mistaking it for a bar (due to only reading the word \\"drink\\"). The attendees fail to understand the nature of Jack's relationship with alcohol, and interpret his wild shouts of \\"Drink!\\" as a plea for help. At the tea room, Mrs. Doyle and Mrs. Dineen have a great time reminiscing, but when the bill arrives, neither will let the other pay for their meal. They begin fighting, leading to both being arrested. Jack, meanwhile, enters a pub, and while ordering a drink, one of the attendees from the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting sees him and tries to stop him. Jack punches him out, leading to him being taken away in an ambulance and Jack also being arrested. Ted and Dougal arrive at the police station, where they are told either to pay their fees of ¬£200, or the two would have to stay in jail overnight. Ted is initially ready to let them stay, but when Dougal tries to get his attention loses his temper and pays the money he won in the bet. He then lays into Dougal for making him pay the money and embarrassing him, only for Dougal to respond that he forgot about the money and was trying to tell Ted the zipper on his trousers were down. They return to Craggy Island, with Ted vowing never to go to the mainland again. Sometime later, Wilson is bike-riding across Craggy Island, and gets lost. He goes to the parochial house to get directions. Ted answers the door, and Wilson, shocked to see Ted yet again, utters \\"I don't believe it!\\" Casting * Richard Wilson makes a special guest appearance as himself, with Ted and Dougal recognising him as \\"yer man from One Foot in the Grave\\". In the episode, every time Ted says, \\"I don't believe it\\", Wilson becomes very angry (to the point where he violently attacks Ted). This is a reference to the fact that Wilson really does hate people going up to him and saying his catchphrase from One Foot in the Grave and only performs the line for charity events. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how \\"tasteless and wrong\\" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do. * Graham Norton returns for his third and final appearance as Father Noel Furlong. He sings the Queen songs \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and, at the very end of the episode, \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\". * Art director Bill Crutcher appears in a cameo as the smoking bin man.

Development The solid-fuel 3 inch (76 mm) rocket used by the Z Batteries was known as the UP-3 and had been developed in the late 1930s by the Projectile Development Establishment at Fort Halstead in Kent under the direction of Alwyn Crow and was related to the Royal Navy's 7 inch (178 mm) Unrotated Projectile. The naval weapon had been enthusiastically backed by Winston Churchill when he was First Lord of the Admiralty at the outbreak of war. By June 1940, Churchill was Prime Minister and he requested \\"large supplies of [rocket] projectors\\" for the anti-aircraft defence of the mainland. The development of all British rockets was under the control of Professor F A Lindemann and he enthusiastically backed Churchill's suggestion. The naval weapon was intended to bring down low flying aircraft with a trailing wire to the end of which was attached an explosive mine; however, the land based system was intended to have a high explosive warhead, detonated by a specially designed photoelectric proximity fuse. The rocket itself was propelled by special solvent-free cordite, which was initially manufactured at Bishopton in Scotland; in December 1940, a new propellant factory was commissioned at Ranskill, which was in production by the start of 1942.Edgerton, David (2012), Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War Penguin Books, (pp.108-110) The metal working firm G. A. Harvey and Co of Greenwich was given the contract to manufacture the rocket bodies and over 1,000 had been made by September 1940. In October 1940, an experimental Z Battery became operational at Cardiff in South Wales under the command of Major Duncan Sandys, Churchill's son-in-law. Trials against a radio controlled Queen Bee target aircraft were successful, although the Director of Artillery at the Ministry of Supply suspected that the results were \\"fixed\\". Despite this Churchill and Lindemann drove the project forward, and by 1942, 2.4 million rockets were being produced annually.Edgerton p. 11 Service A Z Battery manned by the Home Guard on Merseyside in July 1942. The first Z Batteries were equipped with a single-rocket launcher, the Projector, 3-inch, Mark 1. It was soon found that the rockets did not perform as accurately as the trials had suggested and that the proximity fuses were rarely effective.Edgerton p. 10 Therefore, the technique of firing the rockets in large salvos was introduced, and projectors capable of firing an ever- larger number of rockets were developed. The Projector, 3-inch, No 2, Mk 1 was a twin launcher and the No 4 Mk 1 and Mk 2 fired 36 rockets at a time in a \\"ripple\\" firing sequence. During the Battle of Britain in an attack on RAF Kenley by Dornier 17 bombers, AC2 David Roberts, RAF Regiment, downed one of the two attacking aircraft destroyed using the RAF's newest anti-aircraft weapon, a line of twenty-five rockets that deployed a barrage of 500 foot cables suspended by parachutes. This weapon - the naval version of the Z Barrage - was symptomatic of the hodge-podge of weapons issued to the RAF Regiment in the early war years, The other Dornier 17 was shot down by Corporal John Miller of the Scots Guards, using a Lewis gun. For this action both men received the Military Medal. From early 1942, the manning of Z Batteries began to be transferred to the Home Guard, as the equipment was comparatively simple to operate and the rounds were lighter. (The age limit for Home Guardsmen to work on Z Batteries was 60, whereas it was 40 for those posted to conventional anti-aircraft guns and coast defence batteries, because of the heavier ammunition.) (Chapter 6) Use as a ground attack weapon Both the No 2 and No 4 projectors were used in the North African Campaign, mounted on converted 3-inch AA gun trailers. The emergency use of a No 4 projector against an enemy infantry attack in that theatre provided the inspiration for the No 8 Projector, better known as the \\"Land Mattress\\", a surface-to-surface rocket system, used in action by the Canadian Army in 1945. The UP-3 rocket was also developed into the RP-3 air-to-ground anti-tank rocket.Bishop p. 177 Bethnal Green disaster On 3 March 1943, civilians queueing to enter Bethnal Green Underground station in East London, which was being used at night as an air raid shelter, were panicked by the noise of a newly installed Z Battery firing in nearby Victoria Park.

Filmed all around the world, its central theme focuses on hunting and the interaction between man and animal. Like many mondo films, the filmmakers claim to document real, bizarre and violent behavior and customs, although some scenes were actually staged.Kerekes pp. 127‚Äì130 It is narrated by the Italian actor and popular dubber Giuseppe Rinaldi and the text was written by Italian novelist Alberto Moravia. This was the first film of Climati's and Morra's Savage Trilogy, which also includes Savana violenta (This Violent World) and Dolce e selvaggio (Sweet and Savage). Arguably the most infamous film of the trilogy, Ultime grida dalla savana became influential in exploitation cinema by use of cinematographic techniques that were repeated in numerous subsequent Mondo films.Goodall pp. 113‚Äì114 Two scenes in particular, a lion attack on a tourist in Namibia and the murder of an indigenous man by a group of mercenaries in South America, have gained notoriety as genuine footage of human death. The film also sparked a rivalry between the team of Climati and Morra and the brothers Alfredo and Angelo Castiglioni. These two teams became the forerunners of the second generation of mondo cinema.Kerekes p. 134  Synopsis  The film is a depiction of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented one after the other with little regard for narrative continuity.Goodall p. 112 The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti- hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead. Other hunting traditions then follow, again rooted in religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act in which they copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and ultimately kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan hound in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions. Another anti-hunting demonstration becomes the film's focus, this time on the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the \\"Ceremony of Life\\", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna used to measure the winds of El Ni√±o for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey. An examination of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, this time with cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted to be sold to zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.  Production = Direction  As their former cinematographer, Climati drew influence from the Mondo films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi. The cin√©ma v√©rit√© styled camera work used in Ultime grida dalla savana was previously used in Africa addio in a scene in which the film crew is nearly killed during an uprising in newly independent Ethiopia. The inclusion of lingering Technicolor shots and violence towards animals is also a feature of Jacopetti's Mondo cane series. Some scenes were also directly lifted from Africa addio and reused in Ultime grida dalla savana. David Kerekes and David Slater, authors of Killing for Culture: An Illustrated History of Death Film from Mondo to Snuff, also note that, \\"Savage Man Savage Beast is a slight return to the more encyclopaedic world view of mondo cinema which was prevalent in the 60s,\\" demonstrating Climati's early roots in Mondo cinema.  Music  The songs and musical score used in the film were composed and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio.  Reaction  The film was released in Italy on 24 October 1975, and internationally in 1976. The film fared well in Asia; in 1976, Ultime grida dalla savana was outgrossed in Hong Kong only by Jaws.Goodall p. 111 Despite this, reception to the film from mainstream movie critics is almost completely negative, although it is well accepted by critics in exploitation film circles: Mark Goodall calls the film a \\"remarkable, pseudo- philosophical mondo examination of hunting fixated on the cyclical, the (inter)relationship of the hunter and the hunted\\", and Kerekes & Slater also comment that it was, \\"The success of Savage Man... Savage Beast [that] inaugurated the 'savage' trilogy.\\"Kerekes p. 256  Criticism  The content of the film, particularly the graphic violence and human death, has been criticized as too explicit and exploitative. Robert Firsching of Allmovie states: Time Out Film Guide made similar criticisms of the film's content, calling it \\"[a] bloody, blatantly exploitative mess of a movie\\", and says it is \\"just another opportunity to gawp at raw scenes of sex and (more especially) violence\\". Due to its graphic content, the film was also used by James Ferman at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts as an example of the need for film censorship.Kerekes p. 130 The inclusion of several staged or scripted scenes has made the film a target for critical condemnation. Numerous scenes have been proven fake, including the anti-fox hunting campaign involving the fictional \\"Wild Fox Association\\" and the murder of the indigenous men by mercenaries. During another wildlife rally, the fabrication of the scene is apparent with the presence of Italian porn star Ilona Staller. The lion attack on Pit Dernitz is also suspected of being a fabrication by film historians.Goodall pp. 108, 112Kerekes p. 128 Although staged footage has been included since the early history of Mondo cinema, these scenes are nonetheless targets for critical abashment. Kerekes and Slater call the anti- fox hunt sequence \\"self-parody\\",Kerekes p. 127 and Goodall labels the same scene as \\"ludicrous\\". The staged scenes of human death have also been criticized for being more exploitative than educational. Aside from his criticism of the film's staged footage, Goodall also points out the reuse of sequences of African tribal hunting and poaching from Africa addio as a flaw of the film.  Controversy  The death of Pitt Dernitz is one of the most frequently censored scenes from the film. Due to its graphic content, Ultime grida dalla savana has encountered censorship issues with certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut version of the film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. The cuts include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, the death of a fox by a pack of hounds, and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene. The film faced similar censorship problems for its theatrical release in the United Kingdom, where it was released as Zumbalah. In 1976, nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X-rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Various scenes of animal cruelty, a race between cheetahs and ostriches, the lion attack, and the mercenaries' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release. The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) to be cut from the film, specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma. Also in 1976, the Valtion elokuvatarkastamo, the Finnish film classification board, banned the film in Finland in its entirety for the inclusion of scenes of genuine human death.  Influence  The release of Ultime grida dalla savana initiated a rivalry between Climati and Morra and two other Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre in the late seventies and early eighties.Kerekes p. 134 The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence.Goodall pp. 115, 119 The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content. The scenes of human death, which were shot in a manner that resembled an observational documentary, became influential in exploitation cinema, as several subsequent films would use similar filming techniques to lend certain scenes a sense of increased realism. The Mondo film Addio ultimo uomo, directed by the brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni, includes a scene of \\"amateur footage\\" that mimics the scene in which mercenaries hunt natives in Ultime grida dalla savana. This scene, in which an African bushman is captured, tortured, and castrated by a rival tribe, has also been proven staged.Kerekes p. 136 Again in 1978, the death film Faces of Death included fabricated \\"amateur footage\\" that is a reenactment of the death of Pit Dernitz, replacing lions with a bear.Brottman p. 148 Firsching and Goodall also note that Ultime grida dalla savana was a transitional film within the genre, as it, \\"provided a vital link between the 'classic' shockumentaries of the early-mid 1960s and the much crueller mondos of the mid 1970s and beyond.\\" Director Ruggero Deodato also used this camera style prolifically in his film Cannibal Holocaust, in which a group of filmmakers goes missing after they head into the South American rain forest to make a documentary on local cannibal tribes. In the film, only the team's footage is recovered, which is all shot in the cin√©ma v√©rit√© style that resembles the \\"amateur footage\\" in Ultime grida dalla savana.Goodall p. 113 The footage from Cannibal Holocaust proved so realistic that Deodato was arrested for making a snuff film. Charges were ultimately dropped when he produced the supposedly slain actors for the courts.  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography *Brottman, Mikita. Offensive Films.

He was introduced by the show's creator Phil Redmond as part of the Morgan family, and made his first on-screen appearance in March 1999. The character was involved in a male rape storyline, which was branded \\"groundbreaking\\" and met with controversy. Lucy opted to leave the role in 2001 after two years, although he returned for two episodes in August 2002. The character's reintroduction was announced on 21 May 2017 and he returned on 24 July. Lucy took a break from the series in 2018 to appear in a play. The character made a few brief appearances throughout 2019 before he returned permanently in August.  Development = Characterisation  The Mirror described him as \\"sullen face but loveable\\". Luke has been described as a \\"heart-throb\\" and a \\"hunk\\" by the Daily Record.  Male rape  Luke was bullied by Mark Gibbs and his friends for a while due to a football team rivalry. When Luke finally stood up to him Mark was incensed and he and his friends beat Luke up badly. When Luke tried to fight back Mark lost control and raped Luke to belittle and devastate him. Hollyoaks creator Phil Redmond defended criticism and said the storyline \\"aimed to tackle one of the last great social taboos responsibly\\". In the lead up to the attack producers worked closely with rape-related support groups to help make the storyline as realistic as possible. On the storyline Lucy said \\"When they first told me about the storyline I was dubious as to whether or not I should take it. Firstly because I was so young and secondly it hadn't been touched before so no-one knew how the public and press would take it. After thinking about it and doing research behind it I thought it was definitely a subject worth approaching. So we did it and reaped the rewards. I feel very lucky.\\" On why she wanted to tackle the subject series producer Jo Hallows said \\"The message is about banishing taboos ‚Äì telling people it's OK to talk and there are people who can help. If this episode helps one person it will have been a worthwhile exercise.\\" Keith Greenaway, coordinator of Central Birmingham Victim Support welcomed the decision saying \\"we can show victims it is not something to be ashamed of and it wasn't their fault\\". Following the end of the storyline, Luke began to struggle with depression, which led to the character attempting suicide.  Reintroduction and break  On 21 May 2017, it was reported by Ed Gleave of The Daily Star that Lucy had agreed to reprise the role after an absence of fifteen years and had signed an eighteen-month contract. The longer contract allowed producers to create \\"some really meaty storylines\\" for the character, which would place him at \\"the centre of the action.\\" Lucy began filming in May 2017. A show spokesperson confirmed the news to Digital Spy but refused to comment any further. Sarah James (Digital Spy) praised the news and said she was looking forward to his return. Sarah Jayne Dunn was announced to be returning to the serial as Mandy Richardson on 2 June 2017, with speculation that the two returns could be connected. Further details surrounding Luke's reintroduction were also announced, with his return scenes scheduled for July 2017. Lucy expressed his joy at reprising the role, commenting that it \\"feels like being home\\". He added that he is enjoying his storylines and filming with Ashley Taylor Dawson, who appeared alongside Morgan in his original stint as Darren Osborne. On the character, Lucy said, \\"There are a lot of things he's struggling with. All is not as it seems. He's holding it together but as time goes on, he will start to struggle.\\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood suggested some storylines to Lucy, which persuaded him to accept the return. The actor also cited Kirkwood's enthusiasm and the ability to film with Dunn, Dawson and Nick Pickard (who portrays Tony Hutchinson) as other reasons for his return. In July 2017, Lucy told Daniel Kilkelly of entertainment website Digital Spy that he would be performing in The Full Monty from September 2018. He stated that he was unaware how show bosses would fit his break into the character's storyline. It was announced on 15 March 2018 that Lucy would take a nine-month break from Hollyoaks to star in the tour. Luke will leave at the conclusion of his storyline in mid-2018. Luke departs in September 2018 after Mandy and Darren's affair is exposed and Luke was imprisoned for committing GBH. Kirkwood confirmed that Lucy would appear \\"intermittently\\" following his exit. He told Digital Spy that Luke would appear again as part of Mandy and Darren's affair storyline as well as part of his son Oliver Morgan's (Aedan Duckworth) storylines. Initially Kirkwood could not confirm whether Lucy would return permanently, however, in March 2019, it was confirmed that Lucy would be returning to the role full- time.  Storylines =1999‚Äì2002 Luke arrives with his family: parents Andy Morgan (Ross Davidson) and Sue Morgan (Eve White); brother Adam Morgan (David Brown); and sisters Beth Morgan (Elizabeth O'Grady, Kate Baines) and Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). He begins a friendship with Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) and a relationship with Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). During a game of football, Luke tackles Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry) which ends Mark's chances of becoming a professional footballer and leads to Mark resenting Luke and bullying him. When Luke stands up to Mark, he becomes annoyed and beats him up, before raping him. Luke remains silent about the rape, afraid of the consequences and his relationship with Mandy deteriorates as a result. They separate and she begins a relationship with Darren, aware it will upset Luke. When he tries to tell Mandy about the rape, she ignores him and tries to punish him for their separation. A promotional image of Luke as he appeared in his first stint. Luke becomes depressed and attempts suicide so Adam encourages him to talk to someone and Luke tells his family that he was raped. Sue, Adam and Mandy are supportive, whereas Andy struggles to believe his son. Darren is spiteful towards Luke and believes Luke is gay and lying about the rape. Annoyed at Darren's behaviour, Mandy ends their relationship and supports Luke. Sue begins to struggle with the pressure of the rape and begins taking medication.

Luke breaks down and reveals the agony of his life because of the rape, and asks Mark just to acknowledge what he did and apologise.

Reception  For his portrayal of Luke, Lucy was awarded \\"Best Newcomer\\" at the 2000 British Soap Awards. This award is the first award won by the soap at the British Soap Awards. The trial was nominated for \\"Most Dramatic Storyline\\" at the 2001 Inside Soap Awards. A BBC columnist included Luke's rape storyline in their article about controversial issues portrayed through soap opera. Daily Record praised the storyline saying Lucy's was \\"great at portraying Luke's harrowing ordeal\\". The story even attracted the attention of Coronation Street actress Julie Goodyear, best known for portraying Bet Lynch, who opined that it \\"was portrayed with the right amount of sensitivity\\". A writer from MSN described his rape storyline as \\"groundbreaking\\" material. But the storyline received criticism from Watchdog and some churches. A reporter from Virgin Media branded it \\"devastating and frightening\\" and placed it on their \\"soap's scariest storylines\\" list. Gareth McLean of the Radio Times listed the male rape plot amongst \\"the top five soap scandals ‚Äì ever\\" and added that \\"with fewer than one in ten male rapes reported, the storyline was praised for raising awareness, but also criticised for doing so in a soap aimed at teenagers\\". In addition a BBC reporter noted that Lucy's portrayal garnered praise from a performance which \\"showed him retreating from the situation and eventually attempting suicide\\" and adjusting to life after the trial. Elizabeth Joyce of the Shropshire Star said that Luke was a \\"genuinely memorable\\" and \\"decent character\\", who still holds \\"a place in the heart of many a late- twentysomething\\". An Inside Soap columnist included Luke's rape in a feature, highlighting memorable moments in 2000. They noted the story accumulated criticism from viewers who found the scenes \\"too upsetting\\".

Shenhua Group was founded in October 1995 under the auspices of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. It was the largest coal- producing company in China. In 2014 Shenhua Group produced 437 million tonnes of coal and sold 588 million tonnes of coal. In 2014, Shenhua Group's revenue was 328.6 billion yuan (~US$53 billion), and the company ranked 196th in the Global Fortune 500. The same year the Shenhua Group's profit was 64 billion yuan (~US$10 billion). On August 28, 2017, SASAC announced that China Guodian Corporation and Shenhua Group will be jointly restructured, with Shenhua Group becoming China Energy Investment Corporation and absorbing China Guodian Corporation. History The predecessor of the company was a subsidiary of China Huaneng Group, called (sometimes translated as Huaneng Coal Corporation). China Huaneng Group was found in 1989 as a holding company for a series of companies that were found in 1980s for a \\"coal for petroleum\\" project, replacing the use of petroleum to coal in power plant. In 1993, China Huaneng Group was under the dual directorship of the and the , both departments of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. Previously China Huaneng Group was under the sole directorship of the State Planning Committee. In 1995, Shenhua Group was founded as a separate corporation that under the provisional directorship of the State Planning Committee. After the formation of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), Shenhua Group was under the direct supervision of SASAC until the 2017 merger, which the new China Energy Investment was under direct SASAC supervision instead. Shenhua Group had a major subsidiary and listed company China Shenhua Energy. However, some of the assets were remained unlisted. Operations An electric locomotive operated by the Shenhua Group. Shenhua Group is vertically integrated and, in addition to coal mining, the company also produces electricity from coal and renewable energy, operates railroads, ports, and seaborne shipments, produces polyethylene and polypropylene, and undertakes research, development, and demonstrations activities. Coal mining Shenhua Group was the largest coal producer in China, operating both underground and open cut mines. In 2014, the company sold about 588 million tonnes of coal, the vast majority of which was mined by Shenhua subsidiaries. In 2014, Shenhua invested a total of US$37 million in conservation of soil and water and environmental remediation. Afforestation areas were expanded by over in 2014. Shenhua had implemented smart mining technologies. In 2013, the company was awarded the World Coal Association Award for Leadership on Mining Safety. In 2014, the company transported coal on its railways at a rate of 224 billion tonnes¬∑km. Shenhua owned three ports and worked with third party ports that were used to transport about 235.8 million tonnes of coal by sea in 2014. Electricity generation Shenhua's total power output dispatch was 324.6 TWh in 2014, most of this electricity was generated using coal. The company completed the desulfurization (de-SOx) retrofits to all of its coal-fired power generators. Shenhua Guohua, one of Shenhua Group's largest electricity-generating subsidiaries, implemented a program to achieve near-zero emissions at its coal fired power plants. In essence, the company has committed to emissions of PM, SOx, and NOx that are at or below the standards set for natural gas power plants. The company held more than 5,000 MW of renewable energy capacity and was the sixth largest producer of electricity from wind in China. Shenhua also planned to build wind farms in Australia. Fuels and chemicals production Shenhua owned and operated facilities that convert coal to products through indirect coal liquefaction and direct coal liquefaction. Shenhua's direct liquefaction plant was the largest such facility in the world. In 2014, the facility produced 900,000 tonnes of liquid fuels and products, including diesel, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas. Shenhua owned and operated three coal to olefins projects. The production capacity of these facilities was about 1.6 million tonnes per year. Innovation Shenhua's had several research projects related to the water-energy nexus. The company developed and demonstrated the concept of recycling and purifying mine water so that underground mines with distributed reservoirs can become net water producers and provide water to the surround community and industries and has been demonstrated at Shenhua's Daliuta coal mine in the Shendong mining area. Shenhua researched and developed reducing the water consumption of coal conversion processes. Subsidiaries The company has more than 30 subsidiaries, including: * Shenhua Shendong Coal Group Co., Ltd * Shenhua Railway Development Co., Ltd. * Shaanxi Guohua Jinjie Energy Co., Ltd. * Shenhua Trading Group Ltd. * Guangdong Guohua Yudean Taishan Power Co., Ltd. * Zhejiang Guohua Zheneng Power Generation Co., Ltd. * Shenhua Zhunge‚Äôer Energy Co., Ltd. * Shenhua Railway Transportation Co., Ltd. * Hebei Guohua Cangdong Power Co., Ltd. * Hebei Guohua Dingzhou Power Generation Co., Ltd.

Carrington had a population of almost 2,000 in 2016. Origins Carrington was known by Aboriginal people as the place of the mud crab \\"wuna-r tee\\". Early land use by Aboriginals was for fishing and gathering oysters and mud crabs. During the settlement of 1804, it was referred to as Chapman's Island and considered as a site for a gaol.Newcastle City Council's, discover our suburbs Carrington is a testament to the white settlers' need to reshape the environment. Originally, the island was underwater at high tide and was slowly built up by ships dumping ballast and other reclamation work, which eventually saw the island grow out of the mud. Carrington emerged as a residential suburb in the 1860s when many people moved to the island to escape the dirt and noise of the city or were forced off Honeysuckle Point as a result of land reclamation for port purposes. Early access to the island was by rowboat or punt across Throsby creek or on the Onebygamba express, a two-horse coach. There was also a footbridge from Honeysuckle at one point. Carrington was rich and progressive despite its relatively small size and was one of the few areas of Crown land close to Newcastle, the rest of the land in the area was owned by large companies or private individuals. Carrington was systematically sold off as it became more valuable. In 1887 Carrington was constituted as a Municipality and the first council meeting was held on 1 June 1888. By 1900, the population was 2200, and Carrington had developed as a working class suburb and had a fearsome reputation. In the 1920s, steelworkers moved into the area, taking advantage of the proximity to the fledgling BHP works. The Carrington Pump House, pictured, supplied power to a series of cranes which operated along 'The Dyke' loading ships with coal and other freight.Letter of Ken McCarthy, published in Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May 1978, pp. 103‚Äì110 This is probably the most significant surviving building from Newcastle's nineteenth century industrial past. These cranes were of the latest technology, built by Armstrong Whitworth in Newcastle upon Tyne. The Great Depression hit Carrington with a vengeance. In 1933 Carrington had up to 58% of wage earners either unemployed or in part-time employ. A shanty town called \\"Texas\\" sprung up during the depression and provided shelter for many homeless and unemployed. It got the name Texas due to the fact that land used to be used for stables. Today Carrington is a mixed residential, commercial and industrial development that is physically separated from other suburbs. It is close to the harbour and central business district, services the Port and as such has expensive housing. It is accessible by Cowper Street bridge over Throsby Creek. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 1,929 people in Carrington. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.2% of the population. * 85.2% of people were born in Australia and 90.4% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 43.1%, Catholic 18.4% and Anglican 16.3%.

The show was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for the independent production company Pola Jones and screened on BBC Two. All twelve episodes from the two series were written by Steven Moffat and directed by Bob Spiers. The pilot was transmitted as part of its Comic Asides series of pilot shows on 12 July 1991. The first episode of the series was transmitted on 7 January 1993, and the final transmitted on 7 February 1995. The show is about the rise and fall of a relationship, juxtaposing a couple, Mark (Robert Bathurst) and Becky (Fiona Gillies), who meet and fall in love before getting separated and finally divorced. The show is semi-autobiographical; it was inspired by the then-recent separation of Moffat and his first wife. Some of the first series followed a non-linear dual structure, contrasting the rise of the relationship with the separation. Other episodes were ensemble farces, predominantly including the couple's friends Robert (Paul Raffield) and Tracy (Tracie Bennett). Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor, Becky's lover. Scheduling problems led to low viewing figures. However, it scored highly on the Appreciation Index and accrued a loyal fanbase. One fan acquired the home video rights from the BBC and released both series on his own DVD label.

Craig Robins The same script used for the pilot, with minor changes, was reshot by Bob Spiers for the first episode of the series proper. Some footage, such as Mark and Becky's first meeting at the funeral, leading to episode one's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby. Series 1 (1993) The first series has been broadcast twice on BBC Two, first in early 1993. It was repeated in late spring 1994 to lead directly into the transmission of the second series, which was scheduled to be broadcast from June 1994. Series 2 (1995) The format was changed for this series, with the dual timelines and much of the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point going back to the start.

Vesko Baroviƒá, Dragan Brkoviƒá and others from the Montenegrin nouveau riche class that emerged during the 1990s following the break-up of SFR Yugoslavia. All of Aco ƒêukanoviƒá's wealth and influence were achieved during his older brother Milo ƒêukanoviƒá's rule in Montenegro as Prime Minister and President of the Republic (1991‚Äì2006) and currently as the ruling political party's (DPS) president and prime minister again (2006‚Äìpresent). Life=Early activities Aco ƒêukanoviƒá's early business activity during the 1990s was folk concert booking, promotion and organizing through his first company Maraton. 2000s Aco ƒêukanoviƒá was in the news when along with Vladislav \\"Pajo\\" Jabuƒçanin he physically attacked and beat up LSCG activist Zoran \\"Feki\\" Kljajiƒá. The attack occurred on Sunday, June 4, 2000 at around 11:30pm in the lobby of Hotel Crna Gora in Podgorica. Kljajiƒá ended up with severe injuries - skull fracture on the forehead for which he underwent emergency surgery. Jabuƒçanin and ƒêukanoviƒá were detained by police. The case against ƒêukanoviƒá dragged in the courts for years before being acquitted in December 2004 while Jabuƒçanin got sentenced to 4 months in prison. On appeal, the re-trial was ordered, but in 2007 on the very first session of the re- trial the court concluded that the suit against ƒêukanoviƒá is too old. His current company Monte Nova is prominent as a Montenegrin business - according to an annual report by Montenegrin Central Bank, Monte Nova is the fourth most profitable company in Montenegro (most profitable among the companies with domestic ownership) with a profit of ‚Ç¨8.1 million in year 2006. In November 2006, Monte Nova acquired Nik≈°iƒáka banka. Monte Nova reportedly also holds substantial influence in Elektroprivreda CG (Montenegrin hydro company) as it is trying to take over Pljevlja coal mine (accounting for 100% of Montenegro's coal production) and thermal power station (accounting for 45% of power supply within the republic). ƒêukanoviƒá also held stake in Crnogorska komercijalna banka, which he sold to Hungarian OTP Bank, reportedly for ‚Ç¨10 million. In January 2007, he bought 75% stake in Montenegrin urbanism authority for ‚Ç¨2.7 million. Around the same time he bought the documentation for the third mobile operator licence in Montenegro but ended up not placing an official bid, and the licence went to Telekom Srbija.

The virus particles are 30 nm in diameter and are made up of approximately 30% of RNA and 70% protein. The virus capsid is composed of three major polypeptides and two minor polypeptides. Drosophila C virus was first discovered in the early 1970s in a French strain of Drosophila melanogaster, but can also infect other Drosophila species in laboratory settings. The virus is transmitted by feeding and affects survival. However, experimental evidence has shown that when injected into adult flies the virus is pathogenic as it causes the adult flies to die within 3‚Äì4 days. Antiviral RNAi has been shown to be an important host defence against DCV, and DCV encodes a viral suppressor of RNAi that sequesters double-stranded RNA to prevent antiviral RNAi targeting the virus. Drosophila that are infected with Drosophila C virus develop more quickly, the females have a greater number of ovarioles than uninfected flies. Whilst based on this evidence it has been suggested DCV is a beneficial virus, this ignores the fact that the virus kills flies in only a few days (so total fitness in infected flies is still reduced), and any changes in development time or ovariole number likely represent a host life history shift (parasite-induced fecundity compensation). Further support for host fecundity compensation following DCV infection comes from work showing that this response varies with fly genetic background, with some fly lines showing increased fecundity following infection, while others show a fecundity reduction. Infection with Drosophila C virus can also increase the mortality rate within a Drosophila population.

The library's rare book, manuscript, and map collections encompass a variety of topics related to the history of European exploration and colonization of the New World until circa 1825. History The JCB's copy of the Bay Psalm Book, owned by Richard Mather, and acquired by John Carter Brown in 1881. Illustration from the JCB's copy of the Tovar Codex, depicting a rite from the Aztec festival of Tlacaxipehualiztli Interior of the MacMillan Reading Room at the John Carter Brown Library The Library originated in the mid-nineteenth century when it began as the private collection of John Carter Brown (1797‚Äì1874) who conceived of it being a collection of books written about the discovery of the New World, rather than a gentleman's financial investment or a rich man's adornment. Brown began collecting in 1846. After John Carter Brown's death, his wife Sophia Augusta Brown continued collecting with the advisement of John Russell Bartlett (who served as an informal librarian) and Rush Hawkins. This collecting passion was transmitted to his son, John Nicholas Brown (1861‚Äì1900). Until John Nicholas Brown's untimely death, the John Carter Brown Library was kept in a special fireproof room in the Brown family house in the 1792 Nightingale-Brown House. The will of John Nicholas Brown directed that within four years of his death, his trustees were to establish the collection, together with a building to house it, at a permanent site of their choice. They selected Brown University (named in honor of John Carter Brown's father, Nicholas Brown, Jr.). Scope and holdings The collection of the John Carter Brown Library consists of more than 50,000 books written about both North and South America until roughly the end of the colonial era in the Americas, as well as around 16,000 specialized reference books providing supplementary information about the Library's holdings. The Library also holds a major collection of prints, manuscripts, and maps of the New World. The collection of the John Carter Brown Library begins chronologically with fifteenth-century editions of Columbus's celebrated ‚Äúletter‚Äù to the Spanish court announcing the discovery of lands to the west. The Library houses one of the largest collections of books printed in British North America before 1800, the world's most complete collection of Mexican works printed before 1600, the largest collection of printed works relating to Brazil before 1820, a collection of printed sources for the study of early Canada and the Caribbean, nearly three-quarters of all known imprints in the Native languages of North and South America from the colonial period, and the largest collection of political pamphlets produced at the time of the American revolution. Collection highlights include the best preserved of eleven extant copies of Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in British North America,Shurtleff, Nath. B., and Bradford F. Swan. \\"Some Thoughts on the Bay Psalm Book of 1640: With a Census of Copies.\\" The Yale University Library Gazette 22, no. 3 (1948): 51-76. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40857360. a Shakespeare First Folio, leaves from the Gutenberg Bible, a copy of the first Bible printed in British North America, one of four surviving copies of Benjamin Franklin's A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain, one of two copies of the hand-illustrated Tovar Codex, an important 16th-century source on Aztec culture, and a copy of Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana, the first dictionary published in the New World. The Library also holds many important maps and prints relating to the New World. These maps include one of the first printed attempts to depict America in cartographic form (the so-called Stevens-Brown map, a prototype of the 1513 Ptolemy Orbis Typus); the first printed map of Hern√°n Cort√©s‚Äôs Mexico City, built on the ruins of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitl√°n; the earliest known printed plan of a European settlement in what is now the United States (a plan of Fort Caroline built by Huguenot settlers in 1565 near present-day Jacksonville, Florida); and one of the earliest maps to show the French exploration of the Mississippi River, attributed to Louis Joliet. In 2012, a group of Brown undergraduates and scholars deciphered an encoded essay in the hand of Roger Williams, scrawled in the marginalia of a book within the Library's holdings. This essay, thought to be Williams's last, concerns a theological debate on the nature of baptism and Indian conversion. The building The Library is housed in a Beaux-Arts style building, designed by the architects Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge, and completed in 1904. The building was expanded in 1990, with funds from a donation by New Jersey financier, philanthropist, and Brown alumnus Finn M. W. Caspersen (B.A. 1963).

Prehistoric sites in Kargaly form a large and unique complex, especially when compared to neighboring metal production centers or the more distant ancient centers that emerged on the vast territory of the northern half of the Eurasian continent or supercontinent during the 5th to 2nd millennia BCE[1-8].  Location  ‚ÄúKargaly‚Äù is derived from the name of a small river known as Kargalka in the Ural \\"big\\" river basin [fig. 2]. The Kargaly district is situated in the southern Ural Mountains, within the borders of the Orenburg Administrative Region of the Russian Federation. Kargaly is located in the northern zone of the Great Eurasian steppe (the Eurasian Steppe Belt)[9, 10]. The Kargaly deposits are surrounded by typical steppe land cover, consisting of grasslands containing only an occasional small forest consisting of willow, alder, birch, and aspen trees near springs and deep ravines. More substantial forests occur 200‚Äì250 km northeast of Kargaly, where they form part of the mountainous-taiga zone of the southern Urals. The Kargaly ore deposits cover a large, oval territory about 50 by 10 km in area. This group of deposits is oriented northwest to southeast. The two main outlying groups of mines in Kargaly both occur in the southeast corner of the ore field, at N 52' 16,186 / E 54' 36, 980 and N 52' 11, 114 / E 55' 14,848 .  General information  Kargaly embraces an extremely vast territory (nearly 500 km sq) characterized by copper mineralization. In terms of geology, the center belongs to the category of extensive ore fields. The discovery and subsequent frequent extractions of ores at Kargaly occurred either near the end of the fourth millennium –í–°–ï or at the turn of the third millennium –í–°–ï (Early Bronze Age). By the second millennium –í–°–ï (Late Bronze Age) this production center had reached its peak in productivity. There are an extremely large number of working mines at Kargaly, with a wide chronological range including from ancient times all the way up to the 18th to 19th centuries. The grounds contain up to 35,000 superficial manifestations, such as shafts, drifts, open casts, etc. [fig. 3] The total length of underground headings was likely to have been several hundreds of kilometers [fig. 4, 5]. During the Bronze Age, the sinkings and headings of mines were a maximum of 40‚Äì42 m deep. By the New Age (18‚Äì19 cent.) they had reached as much as 80‚Äì90 m deep. The total amount of sandstone, crag and marl, and other wastes extracted from the surface measured nearly 100‚Äì120 million cubic meters, equivalent to a weight up to 250 million tons. Kargaly is exceptionally rich in archaeological remains from ancient mines and metal production. So far, more than twenty settlements dated to the second millennium –í–°–ï and three grave cemeteries with Early and Late Bronze Age burials have been discovered. In addition, traces of the beginnings of the copper production industry in 18th-century Russia are widespread in Kargaly. The volume of extracted copper ores (malachite and azurite) from the Bronze Age is amazingly large and can be quantified by a wide approximation ranging from two to five million tons. Within Kargaly alone, a large amount of copper ore was smelted during the Bronze Age, its total weight estimated at between 55,000 and 120,000 tons. Copper of Kargaly origin was distributed during Bronze Age over a vast territory within the steppe and forest-steppe of Eastern Europe. The maximum territory of its distribution was nearly one million km2. During the New Age, the Kargaly complex had a significant impact on the industrial development of Russia. Approximately one quarter of all Russian Empire copper was smelted in the middle of the 18th century from Kargaly ores. Before the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) Kargaly copper was also exported as far west as England and France.  Mineral Ore Characteristics  Kargaly belongs to the class of deposits situated in sandstone and slate. These large deposits and insignificant ore locations form a long and wide north-south strip of approximately two thousand km. in width, stretching alongside the western outlying regions of the Ural Mountains. Kargaly is located in the southern part of this vast territory. The ore-bearing strata, consisting mainly of crag and sandstone, very often contain the remains of trees of the Perm geological period. Kargaly's giant pocket is the richest load of copper minerals in the vast Ural zone adjacent to copper-bearing sandstone. The ores occur at different depths, beginning with outcroppings of surface deposits, easily noticeable on the sides of ravines, and ending with those situated 80‚Äì90 m deep. The ore-bearing streams are scattered among the sandstone and clue rocks, sometimes appearing as short and broken veins. The size of the ore pockets and pods differs, from several centimeters to ten or more meters in length. Disordered and random distribution of these ore seats must have caused chaotic searches for these deposits by miners in the ancient Bronze Age, as it did for much later miners in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Main Types of Mining  The first type of mining utilizes shafts or sinkings, spaces that stretch, either vertically or sloping (from 90 to 60 degree of declivity), into the sandstone and crag rock, which is covered by a layer of argillaceous soil [fig. 6]. These shafts lead directly to the ore and ventilate the underground shafts and facilitate the delivery of minerals and rocks to the surface. At present the majority of them are filled with collapsed clue rock and detritus, others have been destroyed by the dump from later excavations. The second type occurs as galleries, or drifts (headings). This form of mining utilizes horizontal or nearly horizontal (slightly declined) shafts for ore extraction from sandstone or crag. Drifts and galleries are the most widespread type of mining form in Kargaly. The form and size of the galleries is not fixed, but flexible depending on the composition of the ore layers and the different characteristics of the deposit. These criteria are assessed by the miners during underground and surface gophering for copper minerals. This variability explains the changes in form and size of galleries, which often have no regular geometric profile and no strict direction. The predominance of the so-called nest, or lens accumulations of copper minerals in Kargaly led to the appearance of huge underground halls derived from galleries. Their ceilings are twenty meters high and are connected to other galleries and drifts. In some cases they were blind underground headings (strecks). Prospecting or trial pits are laid into the loam surface layer for the clearing of subsoil and are created in order to search for traces of copper minerals. The copper deposits are usually surrounded by residue of argillaceous soil and sandy loam.  Other Traces Accompanying Mine-workings  Collapses are landslides of rocky or loamy roof which occur either under shallow (5‚Äì15 m) mountainous workings of the horizontal or declined galleries type, or beneath large underground workings in the form of huge halls. Collapses should be treated as traces of previous underground work and may serve as markers of mining on the surface. The size of collapses differs greatly, from 2 to 70 m in diameter, and from 1 to 30 m deep. For this type of trace there is an absence of residue, though gaps in the latest residues can be seen. Because of this, verification of true collapses is rather difficult. Rock disposals or dumps are the most common and characteristic traces of mining. They are usually situated near the mouth of galleries or mines, but can also be found further away, stretching onto the sides of ravines for hundreds of meters, sometimes even a kilometer or more. During the general assessment of traces, dumps are not treated independently because they are usually parts of the shafts, galleries, quarries, or other mining works. Having occurred in different periods, these dumps were often superimposed not only on top of each other, but also upon the openings of ancient vertical and horizontal shafts. As a result, a chaotic distribution of residue is left on the surface of the earth. Certain characteristics of the form and content of the dumps can provide evidence for a chronological dating from as early as the Bronze Age and to as late as the 18th to 19th centuries. The most ancient dump consisted of crushed ore-bearing rock mixed with crushed rich malachite and azurite rock. These Bronze Age rock disposals, so-called dry ore concentrations, are similar to those of ancient times. In the 18th century Russian industrialists used ancient dumps, rich in copper minerals, as a source of malachite and azurite. The later rock disposals, large mounds of wasted sandstone slabs and blocks, are noticeably different from their predecessors. In comparison to the ancient dumps, they are poor in copper minerals and are located near the deeper excavations from the modern era. During the later exploitations of Kargaly, the miners often combined empty headings and sinkings of ancient or previously created shafts and drifts, sometimes filling them completely.  Stages in Exploitation and Discovery  Kargaly was discovered as history-archaeological complex in 1989-1990. The late discovery of the complex by archaeologists is odd, considering early knowledge of its existence. Ancient mines in Kargaly were the first of their kind mentioned in scientific literature in Russia. In 1762, just after the beginning of its exploitation by Russian industrialists, the Russian scholar of local history, P. I. Rychkov from Orenburg, published the book ‚Äú Topography of Orenburg Province‚Äù, which included a chapter on the ancient mines of Kargaly. During the more than two hundred years since the book's publication, no archaeologists have visited or even conducted a cursory investigation of this unique complex. What is even more amazing about this neglect is that this complex is situated in the southern Urals near a large administrative center. The first theory on the beginnings of mining at Kargaly during the Early Bronze Age was developed more than thirty-five years ago. The ideas presented were based on the results from a series of spectral analyses of metal objects from burials of the Pit-grave and Poltavka (Yamno-Poltavka) community of the southern Urals and Volga regions. In terms of chemical composition, analysis of pure copper belonging to group of copper-bearing sandstone, indicates Kargaly as a possible source. It was only after the systematic field research of the Kargaly archaeological expedition from 1990 to 1999 that the latest developments in the history of the exploitations of Kargaly were revealed. Three rather disparate chronological periods are evident. The earliest evidence for mining metallurgical production at Kargaly was connected with representatives of s.c. Yamno-Poltavka archaeological community and dates back to the second half of the IVth mill.BCE. Production of their manufacturing focuses corresponded completely to the morphological and technological standards of the Circumpontic metallurgical province. In Kargaly‚Äôs operation was the long interruption in six centuries (2500-1900). The second and much more active period begins and extended up to 15/14 cent. BCE. This period was close connected with the standards of the Eurasian metallurgical province. Next very long interruption prolonged during the three thousand years ‚Äì up to the New Age. In the 1740s, Russian merchants and manufacturers bought vast territories from the local Bashkir population, including that of Kargaly, at an incredibly low price. Bashkirs, the nominal owners of these territories, were not aware of the value of this land, upon which they tended their herds.  The Early Bronze Age Discoveries at Kargaly  Judging from the materials available, Kargaly mines were discovered by the Yamno-Poltavka community, a nomadic population of the stockbreeders. Numerous tribes of this community occupied vast territories in Eastern Europe, from the southern Urals to the Carpathian foothills, adjacent to the middle Danube steppe in Pannonia. The nomadic lifestyle of many cultures in the northern zone of this extensive territory, formerly of the Circumpontic Metallurgical Province, is evidenced in the thousands of burial kurgans and complete absence of settlement remains. Excavations of the big open cast on one of the lots of the Kargaly complex (the hill of the ancient settlement Gorny) exhibited connections to the early groups of pastoral tribes who inhabited the southern Urals region of Kargaly. Radiocarbon calibrated dates showed that the miners could have begun their quest for this place no later than the fourth to third millennium –í–°–ï. Much was yielded from excavation of the burial of a youth [fig. 7] in the very center of the Kargaly mining field, a site occupied by the kurgan cemetery of Pershin. Included in the finds were a casting mould of an early type shaft- hole axe and a copper flat axe dated to the Early Bronze Age. Radiocarbon calibrated dates place the burial between 2900-2700 –í–°–ï Finally, the wide distribution of copper products made from Kargaly ores of the Early and Middle Bronze Ages found in the area between the Volga and the Urals shows the significant impact of Kargaly on the development of cultures inhabiting this region. Copper ores from Kargaly were also found among the artifact inventories of rich contemporaneous kurgan burials of the tribal chiefs in Volga basin.  Archaeological Evidence from the Late Bronze Age  Although extraction of copper ores began at Kargaly in the Early Bronze Age, it was not until the Late Bronze Age or the second phase of Late Bronze Age that metallurgical activity reached its peak. The main deposits of the upper horizon in the Kargaly ore field had already been discovered in the first half and middle of the second millennium –í–°–ï (Late Bronze Age), which is supported by 18th-century archival materials. The most significant archaeological remains uncovered by our expedition were in the Late Bronze Age Gorny settlement of the pastoral Srubnaya archaeological community. Gorny is a settlement of ancient miners and metallurgists, situated on the top of the promontory hill and surrounded by thousands of traces of mine production [fig. 8]. Simultaneously, the life of the local population and different stages in the mining-metallurgical cycle seem to have been compressed in time and space. What is more, everyday life, including mining, ore concentrating, casting, molding, and forging of tools, was combined with sacred rituals. Exceptionally uncomfortable living and working conditions prompt questions, as the dwellings were situated on top of a hill, a place characterized by intense cold in winter and heat in summer, as well as by an absence of water. This irrational phenomenon must be considered in light of the sacred beliefs of the population. Isolated groups of miners and metallurgists whose professional skills were highly developed, lived and worked in Gorny for a long period of time. Their occupation alone dictated a kind of social and professional isolation unknown to other groups within the Srubnaya community. Remaining evidence leaves no doubt that alongside ore extraction, the large amount of copper was melted here for the casting of tools [fig. 9]. These processes were profoundly influenced by the ecological situation in Kargaly. Pyrometallurgical operations were limited by poor wood resources, which explains the fact that most of the copper in Kargaly was used for the production of heavy mining tools. In addition, extracted ores became important in wide commercial and exchange operations. All ore exchanges, and sometimes copper trade, were directed predominantly towards the west. Evidence for copper casting from ores mined at Kargaly was found in many settlements of the Srubnaya community, reaching as far as the Volga basin. Staggering giant zooarchaeological materials from Gorny [fig. 10] substantiates material for independent research. Extermination of the stock herd there was so profound that some zooarchaeologists reject the possibility that local ancient miners owned and regularly bred them. Considering this evidence, it can be concluded that the livestock was used as an exchange product for the ore and metal produced in Kargaly. It should not be assumed that all stock herds were used for consumption. Ethnographic materials provide evidence for the unbelievable mass slaughtering of animals during rituals accompanying mining and metallurgical processes. It appears that the majority of animals were slaughtered according to the beliefs of Kargaly masters. Many complexes were found in Gorny which contained multiple large sacrificial pits. These pits were filled with specially chosen and arranged bones, particularly those of the lower jaws and ribs of animals. All aspects of the everyday life and work of the Kargaly professionals were saturated in ritual. Gorny, in particular, exhibits various and consistent manifestations of these rituals. Numerous oracle bones were discovered, most likely those of the miners, representative of their difficult and dangerous work. Exceptionally peculiar magical rituals accompanied the activity of Kargaly metallurgists. As evident from ethnographic parallels, archaic masters related the process of molding and casting metal to the act of giving birth. The existence of this new object was possible only through the process of copulation between feminine and masculine essences. For this reason, masculine and feminine symbols were created before the construction of foundation ditches for casting yards as well as for the pits of the large central hearths.  Kargaly in the New Age  Kargaly have been again opened in the third time in 1740th years, thanks to uncountable traces of workings out of the Bronze Age. All copper ore mining was conducted up to the end of 19th centuries in the area of ancient ore developments. The extracted minerals went on the north, to mountain areas of Southern Urals Mountains rich with the different forests. The nearest metallurgical works where Kargaly copper ore melted, have defended from this mining complex approximately on 180‚Äì200 km; the most remote ‚Äì to 500 km. During third period tens of million tons of extracted Kargaly‚Äôs ore delivered to these distant metallurgical plants by the horse cartage. According to archival documents, for all time of operation Kargaly for a late (third) phase it has been melted not less than 126,000 tons of high-quality copper. By the turn of the 20th century, mining of ores in Kargaly complex has definitively finished.  References  # –ö–∞—Ä–≥–∞–ª—ã. –¢–æ–º I. Geological and geographical characteristics.

Erroneously known as Maria Barberi at the time, she was the second woman sentenced to die in the electric chair. She was convicted of killing her lover in 1895; however, the ruling was overturned in 1896 and she was freed. Her trial became a cause c√©l√®bre in the late 19th century. Life Maria Barbella was born in Ferrandina, Basilicata, Italy. Her family immigrated to Mulberry Bend, New York, in 1892. After living in the United States for nearly a year, Maria Barbella met Domenico Cataldo, who was from the same region of Italy. She worked in a factory and every day she would pass by Cataldo‚Äôs shoeshine booth. They spent much time together but these meetings were kept a secret from Michele Barbella, Maria's overprotective father. Michele found out about Domenico, and he forbade Maria from ever seeing or speaking to him again. Domenico continued to pursue Maria until she finally gave in and agreed to meet with him again. One day Cataldo took her to a boarding house, where he allegedly drugged her with the drink he bought her, and raped her. Maria demanded that he marry her. Cataldo showed her a savings book with a $400 deposit and promised he would. Maria continued to live with him at the boarding house. However, Cataldo continued to put the marriage off for several months. In fact he was already married to a woman in Italy, with whom he had children. Barbella was devastated when Cataldo told her that he was returning to Italy and was ending the relationship. Barbella then told her mother about the situation. Her mother confronted Cataldo and insisted he marry Barbella but he said the only way he would do that was if they paid him $200. In New York City on April 26, 1895, at approximately 9:30am, Domenico Cataldo was playing cards in a saloon on East 13th Street, and had planned to board a ship leaving for Italy that afternoon. Barbella entered the bar and there was a brief exchange. \\"Only a pig can marry you!\\" were his last words. Barbella produced a straight razor and slashed his neck so swiftly Cataldo had no chance to scream. He staggered out the door, clutching his throat with both hands, knocking Barbella over, spraying blood everywhere. Finally, as he reached Avenue A, he lurched off the curb and fell twitching into the gutter, where he died. Trial Barbella was arrested and put in The New York Halls of Justice and House of Detention (otherwise known as \\"The Tombs\\")A Tale of The Tombs, www.correctionhistory.org. Retrieved May 14, 2019. for 2.5 months. Her appointed attorneys were Amos Evans and Henry Sedgwick. The trial began on July 11. This case stirred up controversy because Italians felt that the verdict was unjust since there were no Italians in the jury. At the time of the trial, Barbella was unable to speak or understand English. She admitted everything: how she slit his throat and how he ran after her, but couldn‚Äôt reach her and had dropped dead. The jury was shown to have felt sympathy for her case; however, according to Recorder Goff, \\"The verdict was in accordance with the facts, and no other verdict could, in view of the evidence, have been considered.\\" The jury declared Barbella guilty and she was sent to Sing Sing prison where she was sentenced to death by electric chair occurring on August 19, 1895. She was the second woman sentenced to be executed by electric chair (after serial killer Lizzie Halliday's commuted 1894 conviction).James D.

He was a member of both Gymnastiki Etaireia Patron and Panachaikos Gymnastikos syllogos, that merged in 1923 to become Panachaiki Gymnastiki Enosi. Arguably the greatest weightlifter of the early 20th century, he won the gold medal in the 1906 Intercalated Games, setting a world record that lasted until 1914.Polites, N. (1997) Dimitrios Tofalos Arena is named after him. Early years Tofalos' herculean strength was obvious from his childhood. Everybody talked about his physical abilities and for some time he was considered a child prodigy, since he survived a very serious accident. He was playing around a railway station, when a wagon came down on him and almost smashed his arm. He was taken to hospital where the doctors declared that his arm should be amputated. Tofalos' father opposed to it and finally proved to be right. His son recovered, but as a result of the accident one of his arms was shorter than the other. His physical defect did not stop him from becoming one of the greatest Greek athletes of all time. 1906 Intercalated Games Unable to take part in the 1904 Summer Olympics due to a disease, he competed at the 1906 Intercalated Games, where he took part in the two-days weightlifting competition with both hands. On the first day the gold winner was not decided yet, so the next day two weightlifters fought each other for the gold medal; Tofalos and Austrian giant Josef Steinbach. Both of them lifted 136.5 kg very easily. They then had to lift 142.5 kg, but both Tofalos and Steinbach failed on their 1st attempt. The Greek champion broke his own world record by lifting the weight on his third attempt, whereas the Austrian athlete with a rushed and rather anxious move failed without even managing to bring the bar close to his knees. Tofalos won the gold medal, while fans were cheering him frantically. His record lasted until 1914. In the USA and comeback Dimitris Tofalos' grave in the first cemetery of Patras In 1910, Tofalos travelled to the United States for financial reasons. He worked as a professional wrestler and became famous for his persistence rather than his strength. There were many reports about Tofalos for a long time, when he refused to give up a game after a crushing arm-lock by the American World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion Frank Gotch, who always forced his competitor to give up. His persistence cost Tofalos three months in the hospital, but that incident contributed to his legend. After retiring, he spent many years of his life being the manager of Jim Londos, a professional wrestler who was one of the most popular stars wrestling offered during the Great Depression. He eventually went back to his native Patras in 1952, where he spent the last three years of his life. The municipality of Patras honored him by naming a newly built arena after him in 1995.Dimitris Tofalos arena Gallery File:Dimitrios Tofalos (no. 872) & Josef Steinbach (no. 700) at the 1906 Summer Olympics weightlifting competition.jpg Dimitrios Tofalos (no. 700) behind Steinbach (no. 872) at the 1906 Intercalated Games.

The Marine Firemen's Union is an affiliate union of the Seafarers International Union of North America AFL-CIO. The union was formed in San Francisco, California in October, 1883, by \\"firemen on coal-burning steamers.\\" Strikes In June 1886, the union led a strike against the Oceanic Steamship Company. In 1901, the union participated in a San Francisco strike of over 20,000 men to oppose an open shop initiative by employers. On May 1, 1906, the union participated in a successful strike for better wages and working conditions. The strike lasted until November 1906. In 1921, faced with threats including a 15 percent reduction in wages, loss of overtime pay, a reduction from three to two watches, the union joined a national strike. The strike was unsuccessful, and by the end of the year unlicensed American mariners were being replaced by subsistence-wage foreign crews. On May 16, 1934, the union joined the West Coast longshoremen's strike of 1934. Lasting 83 days, it led to the unionization of all of the West Coast ports of the United States. The San Francisco general strike, along with the 1934 Toledo Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party and the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, were important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the 1930s. West Coast sailors walked off their ships in support of the International Longshoremen's Association longshoremen, leaving more than 50 ships idle in the San Francisco harbor. In clashes with the police between July 3 and July 5, 1934, three picketers were killed and \\"scores were injured.\\" During negotiations to end the strike, the sailors received concessions such a three- watch system, pay increases, and better living conditions. In 1936, all the Pacific Maritime Federation unions banded together to strike for wages, working conditions, and a union-controlled hiring hall. The strike was successful. The union participated in a 1948 West Coast strike that included the longshoremen. The strike lasted for four months with neither side clearly victorious. On March 16, 1962, the union called a strike and on April 11, 1962, under the Taft-Hartley Act, a federal injunction was issued to stop the strike. After lengthy court battles, an agreement was reached, with the union gaining numerous concessions, including \\"overtime in port, pension benefits, wages, vacation, and welfare benefits.\\"  Building in San Francisco  Bas- relief by Olof Carl Malmquist on the Marine Firemen's Union building.

To do so, the organization trains college student volunteers to teach a skills-based health curriculum in public high schools in low-income communities that lack comprehensive health education. It is made up of college students in Boston, New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and the Bay Area who volunteer in public high schools to teach health education classes. The vision of Peer Health Exchange is that one day, all teens will have the knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions. Background Due to staffing shortages and budget cuts in public high schools, sexual and health education has suffered. To prevent growing trends in adolescents engaging in risky or harmful behavior in sexual and personal spheres of their lives, Peer Health Exchange (PHE) works to provide this education. The Peer Health Exchange website lists these statistics: one in six teenagers are overweight or obese, one in five sexually active teen girls becomes pregnant every year, half of all adolescents who continue smoking will die eventually from a smoking-related illness, one in five teenagers experiences violence in a relationship, each year one in four sexually-active young people contract an STI , and one in three teenagers is a binge-drinker. Plan In 1999, six graduates from Yale University began going into underfunded and understaffed public high schools in New Haven, Connecticut to teach health workshops. The founding members of this New Haven group, (which now reaches ten New Haven public schools with over 100 volunteers) established Peer Health Exchange, Inc in 2003. They brought their program to New York City first, training over 150 volunteers from Barnard College, Columbia University, and New York University and reaching 1300 low-income high school students that would otherwise have not received any health education in school. In 2006, PHE launched a program in Boston, training college students from Boston University and Harvard College. In the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, PHE trained over 270 volunteers in Boston and New York City and reached 1,600 high school students. The program has also been extended into Chicago, Illinois, training college students from DePaul University, University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and University of Illinois Chicago Campus. And to further its impact, in July 2007 PHE initiated a five-year growth plan to deepen impact in current cities and spread throughout the country to new sites, including Mills College, University of Southern California, California State University Northridge, St. Mary's College of California, and University of California, Berkeley. In 2018, the biggest site is New York City reaching high schools in all five boroughs and long standing college chapters include CUNY schools such as Hunter College, City College, Brooklyn College, Queens College, LaGuardia Community College, York College, and College of Staten Island. The mission of Peer Health Exchange is to give teenagers the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. They do this by training college students to teach a comprehensive health curriculum in public high schools that lack health education. In order to provide teenagers with knowledge of sexual and health education, PHE works with public high schools where much of the student body is living at or below the poverty threshold and is at a higher risk for health issues like teenage pregnancy or obesity. The volunteers are recruited and chosen from surrounding colleges and then trained in the PHE curriculum which includes 12 standardized health workshops highlighting issues like: substance abuse, nutrition, and sexual health. They are often students including public service in many areas of their life and 90% of past volunteers express that PHE affected their career goals after college. Using the slightly older students as peers, PHE offers the benefits of peer education while using traditional methods of instruction. The volunteers speak to the students in ways relevant to their everyday lives and can serve as role models demonstrating healthy behavior. The high school students are encouraged to articulate their values and goals while learning basic, accurate health information. They are encouraged to explore the way the media and their peers perceive and act towards issues of health. Part of the PHE curriculum is to help the students practice their communication skills as well as risk evaluation, prevention, decision-making through role-playing resembling true to life situations. Peer Health Exchange hopes that their volunteers will help teenagers protect their bodies and lives while providing them with the knowledge and skills. Their hope is that they can apply the skills learned in PHE workshops outside of the classroom by making informed decisions. Their ultimate goal is to keep the students in‚Äîand excelling in‚Äîschool, in the workforce, staying away from risky behavior, and building on a healthy future. Schools Undergraduate volunteers at Barnard College and Columbia University teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in six New York City, New York high schools: Facing History School; Heritage School; Martin Luther King Jr. High School for Law, Advocacy, and Community Justice; Martin Luther King Jr. High School for Arts and Technology; Frederick Douglass High School; and the Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction. The New York University undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in five New York City, NY high schools: East Side Community High School, Manhattan Village Academy, Marta Valle Model School, and University Neighborhood High School, and the Urban Assembly School of Government and Law. Boston University undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in four Boston, Massachusetts high schools: Another Course to College, Boston Community Leadership Academy, Fenway High School, and New Mission High School. The Harvard University undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in two Boston, MA high schools: Charlestown High School and Excel High School. The University of Chicago undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE curriculum to teenagers in five Chicago, IL high schools: Dyett High School, Hubbard High School, Kenwood Academy, Perspectives Charter School, and Woodlawn Charter School. The DePaul University undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in two Chicago, IL high schools: Roosevelt High School and Kelvyn Park High School. The Northwestern University undergraduate volunteers teach the PHE health curriculum to teenagers in eight Chicago, IL high schools, including: Frederick Von Steubenn Metropolitan Science Center, Muchin College Prep, Nicholas Senn High School, Roger C. Sullivan High School, Rickover Naval Academy, Roosevelt High School, Chicago Math and Science Academy, and Carl Schurz High School. The program has been extended to California where the University of San Francisco, St. Mary's College, Mills College, and University of California Berkeley are putting on pilot programs for the academic year of 2008-2009. As of the 2010-2011 school year, PHE volunteers teach the curriculum at Arise High School, East Oakland School of the Arts, Leadership Preparatory High School, LPS College Park, City Arts & Technology High School, College Preparatory and Architecture Academy, Mandela High School, Fremont: Media College, Preparatory High School, Leadership High School, Lighthouse Community Charter School, Metropolitan Arts & Technology High School, MetWest High School, Millsmont Academy, Secondary Oakland Aviation High School, Oakland Military Institute, Oakland Unity High School, Skyline High School, and the Youth Empowerment School. Success The PHE model was encouraged by studies demonstrating teenagers are more likely to absorb health information from peer educators as than from adults. From their own study, 74% of PHE high school students reported that having college students teach them helped them learn the important health topics. Evaluations completed in the 2012-13 academic year by PHE teenagers showed gains in knowledge and increased healthy decision-making after the completion of the program. 92% said they will use something that they learned from their Peer Health Exchange workshops to make healthy choices in the future. 68% said they had already used something they learned from PHE workshops to make a healthy decision during the six months they were in the program. In terms of knowledge, the PHE students made statistically significant improvements in their health knowledge, with a 38% growth from pre-test to post-test. 97% of the high school principals participating in the program in the 2012-13 academic year said they would recommend the program to other high schools, and 93% of PHE college volunteers said they would recommend participating in Peer Health Exchange to other college students.

They were married within seven months, and their first child, a girl, was born in 1995. Charges and trial Their second child, a boy, died unexpectedly at the age of two months, in December 1997. Eighteen months later, another boy died aged just 15 days. Autopsies yielded no explanations for the deaths, but a daughter who died at the age of 22 days in June 2001 was found to have four broken ribs. A police investigation was started, which led to Patel's arrest in May 2002. She was charged with the murder of the three children. The case, which was heard at Reading crown court, was one of a number of famous court cases in Britain in which mothers who reported more than one cot death were accused of murder. It was one of a number of cases in which evidence was given by Roy Meadow, a controversial pediatrician whose testimony helped to convict Sally Clark, Angela Cannings, and Donna Anthony of murdering their babies. Meadow's claim that the likelihood of two babies dying from natural causes in the same family was one in 73 million prompted the Royal Statistical Society to write a letter of complaint to the Lord Chancellor, stating that the figure had \\"no statistical basis\\";Profile: Sir Roy Meadow, BBC News, December 10, 2003. other experts said that when genetic and environmental factors were taken into account, the figure was closer to one in 200.Sir Roy Meadow struck off by GMC, BBC News, July 15, 2005. Meadow, giving evidence for the prosecution, listed four indications of Patel's guilt. One was the injuries suffered by the third child to die. Patel's explanation was that the rib fractures had resulted from attempts at resuscitation. The second and third points were that the children had undergone several medical examinations, and all had been well until shortly before their deaths. The fourth point was that three consecutive children had died, and that, according to Meadow, \\"in general, sudden and unexpected death does not run in families.\\" One of the defence witnesses was genetics specialist Professor Michael Patton, who testified that several cot deaths in the same family could be caused by an undiscovered genetic defect, and that the chances of experiencing more than one cot death could be as high as one in twenty.The lessons of the Trupti Patel case BBC News June 12, 2003. The court heard evidence that Patel's maternal grandmother lost five children in infancy, but that her remaining seven children were \\"alive and well\\".Patel grandmother 'lost five babies', BBC News, May 28, 2003. By the time the case came to court, Meadow's claims about the likelihood of a second cot death in the same family had been largely discredited. Clark's conviction for the murder of her sons had been overturned some months earlier, and Cannings's guilt was disputed by many. After the trial started, two key prosecution witnesses, both of whom examined Mia's body and disputed Patel's claim that the fractured ribs were caused by attempts at resuscitation, said that they were no longer sure. Professor Rupert Risdon, a paediatric pathologist, wrote to the judge saying that he had found evidence of rib fractures caused by resuscitation in three children that he had examined in the previous month alone, and Nathaniel Carey, a Home Office pathologist, said he could \\"no longer state categorically that the rib fractures were not due to resuscitation.\\" Acquittal On 11 June 2003, Patel was acquitted.Mother cleared of killing babies, BBC News, June 11, 2003.

He is the author of Aguddat Ezob (A Bunch of Hyssop), a collection of poems and rhetorical compositions, in three parts, praised very highly by Isaac Cansino and David Abu al-Khair. Abraham Cansino was once arrested by the Spanish authorities for having in his possession copies of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. His son was also taken, and both were sent to Murcia, Spain, where they were treated like prisoners for a time, and fined; the copies of the Talmud were confiscated. His friends and relatives wrote poems of consolation to him; to these he replied from Murcia. There is also an Abraham Cansino, an authority mentioned in the Machzor Oran as writing, in the name of the Jewish community of Oran, to the communities of Algiers in 1661, of Jerusalem in 1663, and of Hebron in 1668. In 1679 he lived in Livorno, Italy, where he received a letter from Tunis. This Abraham Cansino may be identified with Abraham Cansino, rabbi and preacher, brother of Isaac Cansino of whom Wolf speaks (Bibl. Hebr. iii., Nos. 143b, 1101, and 1265c). Meyer Kayserling mentions an Abraham Cansino who was rabbi at Livorno in 1685, and evidently refers to the same person. Luzzatto thinks that this Abraham Cansino is not to be identified with the poet of the same name. Another Abraham Cansino was an authority mentioned in the Machzor Oran as living at Livorno in 1709. As he is not addressed by the titles usually given to rabbis, Luzzatto thinks that he was not a rabbi, and therefore not to be identified with either of the above. The epitaph of an Abraham Cansino written by Jacob Sasportas is given in the Machzor Oran, but furnishes no indication of the place or date of its writing. Mention is also made of an Abraham Cansino, author of the epitaph on David Francis, who died about 1696.

He served as Bishop of Camden from 1938 until his death in 1956. Early life and priesthood Bartholomew Eustace was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to Bartholomew Ambrose and Elizabeth (n√©e Nolan) Eustace, who were Irish immigrants. After graduating St. Francis Xavier College in 1910, he attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers and completed his theological studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. While in Rome, Eustace was ordained to the priesthood on November 1, 1914. He earned his doctorate in theology the following year from the College of the Propaganda. Upon his return to New York in 1915, he served as a curate at Blessed Sacrament Church in New Rochelle until 1916, when he became a professor of philosophy and liturgy at St. Joseph's Seminary. He later returned to Blessed Sacrament as its pastor in 1921. Episcopacy On December 16, 1937, Eustace was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Camden, New Jersey, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 25, 1938 from Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, with Bishops Edward Kelly and Stephen Joseph Donahue serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The new diocese was located in South Jersey and included Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Salem, and Gloucester Counties. There were then 49 parishes, 31 mission churches, 86 priests, 35 parochial schools, and 100,000 Catholics. Eustace was installed by Archbishop Thomas Walsh at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on May 4, 1938. During his installation, he dedicated the diocese to the Virgin Mary. Eustace established a private residency in Collingswood. During his 18 years as bishop, Eustace established St. Mary Catholic Home at Cherry Hill in 1941, and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center (the only Catholic hospital in the diocese) at Camden in 1950. Also confronted with a shortage of priests, he recruited clergy and seminarians from New York and Ireland. He encouraged a greater involvement of the laity and supported the Holy Name Society. Eustace also promoted special ministries to African Americans and Hispanics. In 1940 he incorporated Catholic Charities into the diocese. Between 1938 and 1956 he founded thirty-one parishes; opened twenty-five missions (sixteen of which later became parishes); established three high schools and expanded six others; established twenty-two elementary schools and expanded fourteen others; and erected fifty churches, thirty rectories, and twenty convents. He increased the number of priests by 109, and the number of Catholics by 100,000. Death Eustace was diagnosed with diabetes in January 1941, and suffered three heart attacks between 1950 and 1955. He was confined to his bed at his residence in Haddonfield by November 1956, and died shortly afterwards at age 69. His Requiem Mass was celebrated by Cardinal James Francis McIntyre on December 15, 1956. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cherry Hill. Legacy Bishop Eustace Preparatory School, a coeducational private high school in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey, is named in his honor.

Plot As the opening credits roll, the scene is from the point of a man on a motorcycle at night. The man gets off the bike, walks into a coffee shop, shoots one of the patrons with a pistol and then gets back on the motorcycle. The scene then cuts to various bystanders being interviewed about what the man looked like. The descriptions vary wildly, except for one thing ‚Äì the man walked with a limp. The police are then on the lookout for anyone with a limp. They arrest one man walking down the street carrying a briefcase. In the struggle to apprehend the man, his briefcase comes open, spilling the contents ‚Äì some sex toys ‚Äì onto the sidewalk. Because such items are illegal in Thailand, the man is arrested. At a nearby newsstand, another man witnesses the arrest. He turns and walks away ‚Äì with a limp. He is the gunman, and his name is Sergeant Sommai. After losing a leg fighting for the Thai Special Forces during the Secret War in Laos, Sommai now works as a barber in a small shop in a canal community of suburban Bangkok. One day Sommai is cutting hair, when his young son is attacked on a nearby footbridge by some neighborhood boys. They are taunting the boy for having a one-legged father and no mother. Sommai must leave the shop, making a customer angry, to attend to the boy. After the neighborhood bullies are chased away, Sommai's son collapses and starts having some sort of seizure. A local doctor is ill- equipped to treat the boy and recommends he be looked after at home. Sommai has a problem, being a single father, and needing to work, he must find someone else to look after the boy. He asks his vain, selfish ex-wife, who left Sommai after he lost his leg. She refuses. But Nid, the younger sister of his ex-wife, readily agrees. The two, with the boy, then bond as family unit. Meanwhile, the Bangkok press is abuzz with a police hero, Special Branch Inspector Thanu, known as the Black Hand, for the trademark black leather glove he wears on his gun hand. He cultivated a fearsome reputation, even though the kills he claims credit for were often the work of his subordinates. Thanu also has difficulties at home, with a dissatisfied wife. One of Thanu's subordinates, Officer Chalam, independently investigates the shooting by the one-legged gunman, and through methodical casework, he determines that the gunman is likely an ex-military man, which narrows the suspects down considerably. Chalam immediately suspects Sommai, however Thanu tries to divert attention to other cases. It turns out that Thanu was Sommai's lieutenant in the Secret War, and it was through Thanu's cowardly actions that Sommai was left on the field with a leg blown off, to be captured by the Pathet Lao while Thanu and the rest of platoon escape to safety on a helicopter. At all costs, Thanu would rather not confront his old sergeant again. Thanu goes as far as visiting Sommai at his barbershop, telling Sommai to go into hiding. Sommai's son's illness is growing worse. Another doctor says the cause is a tumor at the base of the boy's brain, and that a specialist doctor in an overseas hospital can possibly save the boy. The pressure is now on Sommai to take more assassination jobs. His wheelman is a mute motorcyclist named Khan, and the two plan more jobs. Chalam has disobeyed orders by Thanu to stay away from Sommai, and has informants following Sommai's every move. After one shooting is narrowly averted, leaving the intended target only injured, Thanu can no longer ignore Sommai. Thanu is then given the job of watching over an important government minister. Sommai has taken on the job of killing the minister, and succeeds. His mute motorcyclist friend Khan betrays him, but Sommai is able to free himself from Khan and kill him. He then visits his handler, just as his handler and another man are plotting Sommai's demise, obtains the payment, and then kills the two men. Sommai then goes to the hospital to retrieve his son. Thanu's team is waiting for him, but Sommai takes Thanu hostage. Holding an automatic pistol to Thanu's head, he and is able to obtain a promise from the prime minister that Nid and the boy will be allowed to leave the country. After Nid arrives at the airport and assures Sommai via two-way radio that she will be okay, Sommai surrenders, and hands his pistol to Thanu, who takes it and aims at Sommai's back, but then puts the gun down. However, Chalam raises his pistol, and against the orders of Thanu, who shouts \\"No!\\", fires, most likely killing Sommai. Cast * Sorapong Chatree as Sergeant Sommai Moungthup former Royal Thai Army Special Forces a Vietnam War and Laotian Civil War Veteran * Ron Rittichai as Inspector Thanu Adharn former Royal Thai Army Special Forces a Vietnam War and Laotian Civil War Veteran Production The opening shot was filmed by Chatrichalerm Yukol himself, who used a hand-held camera while riding on the back of a motorcycle. The shot was done in three takes, with the third take being used. \\"After the third one I wouldn't do it again. It was pretty risky. You're practically blind, when you get off the bike you have to walk into the coffee shop shoot the man and walk back, back on the motorbike with your eyes on the viewfinder, you have to do all the focus-pulling yourself, it was pretty painful. But that was still an easy shot\\", he told interviewer Thomas Richardson in 1993. Another scene involving the helicopter sequence in the Secret War flashback scene has mistakenly thought to be copied from Oliver Stone's Platoon, which in fact was made in 1986, three years after the release of Gunman. The shot focused on Sommai on the ground as the helicopter rose into the air. \\"Pretty painful shot, I think. We have a lot of painful shots in that film\\", Chatrichalerm said in the 1993 interview. \\"It's difficult because you have to center him the whole time, zoom out at the right time, pull the focus\\". Gunman series Gunman was followed in 1994 by Salween, which was also entitled Gunman 2 (, or Mue puen 2). However, aside from the presence of Sorapong Chatree, who stars in Salween as a tough, veteran police sergeant, as well as Ron Rittichai, who portrays a SLORC colonel, the stories and characters of the two films have no relation, so Salween is a sequel to Gunman in name only.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Dubrovnik.Biskupija Dubrovaƒçka History The cathedral was built on the site of several former cathedrals, including 7th, 10th and 11th century buildings, and their 12th century successor in the Romanesque style. The money to build the basilica was partially contributed by the English king Richard the Lion Heart, as a votive for having survived a shipwreck near the island of Lokrum in 1192 on his return from the Third Crusade. This building was largely destroyed in the earthquake of 1667.Sacred Destinations Travel Guide (based on information in Frommer's) The Senate of Dubrovnik appealed to the Italian architect Andrea Bufalini of Urbino, who sent a model for the new church in Baroque style with a nave, two aisles and a cupola. Several other Italian architects including Francesco Cortese (present from 1669 until his death in 1670), Paolo Andreotti of Genoa (present 1671-1674), Pier Antonio Bazzi of Genoa (present 1677-78), and friar Tommaso Napoli of Palermo (present 1689 - 1700), all working with local and imported stonemasons, completed the Cathedral over the next three decades. Napoli made several crucial changes to the original plans including the use of a cross vault and the opening of large thermal windows at the upper level. This gives the whole interior a lighter and brighter feel. The style of the cathedral is in keeping with the esthetics of Roman Baroque architecture as practiced by Bernini, Carlo Fontana and their 17th century contemporaries. The construction began in 1673. The building was finished in 1713 by the Dubrovnik architect Ilija Katiƒçiƒá. The building was damaged by the 1979 Montenegro earthquake, requiring several years of repairs. The cathedral was damaged by at least one shell during the Siege of Dubrovnik in 1991.Destruction of cultural property report S/1994/674/Add.2 (Vol. V) 28 December 1994, United Nations Security Council The damage has since been repaired.Architecture Week, 2001, Roofs of Dubrovnik Description The portal of the facade is flanked by four Corinthian columns. On top of the central part is a large Baroque window with a triangular gable and a balustrade with statues of saints. The deep niches in the facade contains statues of Saint Blaise (patron saint of Dubrovnik) and Joseph with Child. The lateral sides of the cathedral are rather plain, articulated by pillars and semicircular windows. The side entrances are smaller than the frontal portal. The building features a high nave, separated by massive columns from the two aisles, three apses and a grand Baroque dome at the intersection of the nave and the transepts. The main altar holds a polyptych by Titian, portraying a version of the Assumption of the Virgin.Dubrovnik Tourist Board This painting probably dates from 1552; the side altars hold paintings of Italian and Dalmatian masters of later centuries. Triptych of \\"Ascension of Mary\\" by Titian (circa 1550) Treasury The Cathedral treasury (Riznica Katedrale) shows clearly the numerous connections Dubrovnik had with the main seaports in the Mediterranean Sea. The treasury holds 182 reliquaries holding relics from the 11th to 18th centuries; from local masters, Byzantium, Venice and the Orient. Its most important object is the gold-plated arm, leg and skull of Saint Blaise (patron saint of Dubrovnik). The head is in the shape of a crown of Byzantine emperors, adorned with precious stones and enameled medals. The treasury holds also a relic of the True Cross.

Trader and exporter Matthoo belonged to Alangad, near North Kuthiathode, in the present Paravur Taluk of Ernakulam District. He was born into a prosperous Syro-Malabar Christian family in 1741 as the son of Thachil Thariath and Kelparambu Itti Anna. He did business successfully,with the help of his father's friends,Ranga Shenoy and Narayana Shenoy, prospered, and the friends that he made during that period later took him to great heights. His powerful friends included Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, the Dutch commander who became head of the Travancore Army and Raja Kesava Das. Through such friends, he got introduced to the Kings of Travancore and Cochin.It was on 943 M.E. that Mathoo Tharakan began his royal service. Matthoo Tharakan thus became a leading trader and influential Christian leader, from among the Indian Syriac-Rite Christians of Kerala. He awarded a 'Thankakompan' that earned the king's appreciation and the king then awarded him the title' Mathoo Tharakan Muthalali Avarkal' .The title Tharakan was granted by the King Dharma Raja of Travancore to indicate 'a noble trader'. Matthoo Tharakan was a merchant of timber, spices, salt, and tobacco, and was reportedly the first timber exporter from Southern India. Matthoo Tharakan and Dewan Raja Kesavadas built up the Alappuzha port. He controlled the exports from Alappuzha and Cochin ports. Minister of Travancore Matthoo Tharakan was Commerce Minister to Maharaja Balarama Varma of Travancore. His best years were during the reign of Dharma Raja. He loaned a large sum of money to the Kingdom to help fight its wars against Tipu Sultan. However, during the following period of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri's Dewanship, there was an uprising and revolt engineered by Velu Thampi. This led to Velu Thampi becoming the Dalawa (Prime Minister) in 1801. Velu Thampi persecuted Mathu Tharakan (his ear was cut and later he was imprisoned). He ordered confiscation of Matthoo Tharakan's landholdings and assets alleging that he had to pay huge revenue arrears to the Government of Travancore. This order was later cancelled by the British Resident Macaulay. Balarama Varma repented the indiscriminate actions of Velu Thampi and symbolically gave Tharakan a golden ear. Velu Thampi's subsequent revolt against the British (without the sanction of the Maharaja) led to his suicide in 1809 in Mannadi Temple, Adoor. Social and religious leader Thachil Matthoo Tharakan made attempts at reunion of the Christian communities separated by the Coonan Cross Oath. But his efforts were apparently thwarted by the Portuguese. His efforts had the support of Mar Joseph Kariattil of the Indian Syriac-Rite Catholics, and of Mar Dionysius I of the Indian Syriac-Rite Orthodox faction, known as the Jacobites. But Bishop Kariattil's death in Goa and Rome's silence, ultimately led to the Indian Jacobites remaining separate and the Indian Syriac Catholic accepting the jurisdiction of the Latin Bishops in India. He was actively involved in organising the historic journey of Mar Joseph Kariattil and Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar to Rome in 1782 for representing before the Pope the grievances of the Syriac Catholics.Thachil Matthoo Tharakan  ReferencesFurther reading * M.

History Featuring former Smile member Tim Staffell on vocals and guitar, Bob Sapsed of Springfield Park on bass, Maurice Bacon on drums and (the band's namesake) Morgan Fisher on keyboards, Morgan formed in 1971. The group was born from the joint Morgan Fisher‚ÄìMaurice Bacon band Love Affair, a highly successful soul-pop band (#1 UK hit, \\"Everlasting Love\\" in 1968) that transmogrified into the band L.A., a fusion group who combined pop sensibilities with an underground progressive rock approach. Morgan formed shortly after L.A. lapsed, with the band deciding to discard all pop leanings and launch headlong into composing keyboard-driven progressive rock epics. They sequestered themselves in the newly constructed RCA Studios in Rome, home to the then-cutting edge of recording technology (16-track studios were still considered an extravagant rarity). The profusion of unusual musical instruments in the studio heavily influenced Morgan's on-record soundscape; a 1930 Neo-Bechstein electric piano, harpsichord, marimba, celeste, timpani, tubular bells, and first-generation synthesizers (such as the British VCS3) all united to aid in the crafting of a unique and ground-breaking musical direction. The band were fans of Yes, Pink Floyd, The Nice and King Crimson, with their progressive approach much influenced by those artists. The group's modus operandi had Fisher composing all the music whilst Staffell focused on the lyrics; their joint efforts steered the band towards science-fiction imagery and concept albums. Their first album, entitled Nova Solis, contained four songs, and concluded with the side-length eponymous title track, the chronicle of a galactic journeyman lamenting the destruction of the Earth. The album's sales were largely disappointing. Morgan had signed a two-album deal with RCA, and in 1973 embarked on the recording of their second (and ultimately final) album, originally titled \\"Brown Out.\\" The name of the album was later changed when it became apparent that the band intended to include an insert of the themselves mooning the casual record buyer. Thus \\"Brown Out\\" became The Sleeper Wakes. Due their feeling that the music was too complex and left-field, RCA opted not to release The Sleeper Wakes. It was eventually released in the U.S. in 1976 by Passport Records, who maintained the original title. In the wake of these problems the group disbanded, and the members went their separate ways. Staffell went on to craft models for the Thomas the Tank Engine children's TV series and, more recently, founded the funk band aMIGO; whilst Fisher continued performing, first (briefly) with Third Ear Band then Mott the Hoople and later recording as a solo artist. Maurice Bacon went on to play drums with John Otway and later to manage him and other artists. Bob Sapsed was killed in a road accident in 1986. Staffell's previous band Smile replaced him with Freddie Mercury and went on to massive global success as Queen, who supported Mott the Hoople on their early UK/US tours in 1974. Fisher later played keyboards with Queen on their 1982 Hot Space tour. \\"The Sleeper Wakes\\" was first released (using that title) in the UK in 1978 by the new independent label Cherry Red Records - it was their very first album release. Morgan Fisher went on to craft several other groundbreaking albums for that label, including \\"Hybrid Kids,\\" \\"Slow Music,\\" and the 1980 cult classic \\"Miniatures\\" (a collection of 51 one-minute tracks by a variety of cutting-edge artists). Both Morgan albums were released on CD in 1999/2000 by Angel Air Records and also in Japan on local record labels. \\"Nova Solis\\" was re-issued again on CD in 2009 by Esoteric Recordings, testifying to the staying power of this adventurous music.

Although Conner initially established himself as a fur trader on the Michigan and Indiana frontiers, his business interests later expanded to include ownership of Indiana farms, mills, distilleries, and mercantile shops. He was also a land speculator. Conner served the American forces in several capacities during the War of 1812, and as an interpreter and witness at several treaty negotiations with Native American tribes that resulted their removal from Indiana and established the state's geographical boundaries. Conner founded Hamilton County, Indiana, and Noblesville, its seat of government. In addition, he established the nearby towns of Alexandria in Madison County and Strawtown in Hamilton County. Conner also served three non- consecutive terms as a state representative in the Indiana General Assembly between 1829 and 1837, and was a charter member of the Indiana Historical Society, established in 1830. Conner's brick home in Hamilton County has been restored and preserved as part of the Conner Prairie Interactive History Park, a living history museum in Fishers, Indiana, that is named for him and located on his former property. Early life William Conner, the third son of Richard and Margaret (Boyer) Conner, was born on December 10, 1777. Richard Conner (1718‚Äì1807), born in Maryland, was a trader and tavern operator; Margaret Conner was a former white captive of the Shawnee, whom Richard ransomed for $200 and a promise to give their first-born son to the tribe so that they could marry. Richard and Margaret Conner spent the early years of their marriage living among the Shawnee in Ohio, where their first son, James, was born in 1771 and delivered to the Shawnee as agreed. Ongoing conflicts along the frontier forced the Conner family to leave the area. They traveled with Moravian missionaries and their Delaware (Lenape) and Shawnee converts to christianity. While still living in Ohio, James was ransomed from the Shawnee and returned to his parents. The Conner's second and third sons, John (1775‚Äì1826) and William, were also born in Ohio. (Sources disagree on whether William's birthplace was the Moravian settlement in Lichtenau in Coshocton County or at Schoenbrunn in what is now Tuscarawas County, Ohio.)David G. Vanderstel, \\"William Conner\\" in See also: See also: Also: During the American Revolutionary War, the Conners joined a group of Moravians and their Native American followers in their British-forced removal to what became the state of Michigan.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 21, and Vanderstel, \\"William Conner,\\" p. 471. The Moravian missionaries and their followers returned to Ohio, but the Conner family remained at what was later named Macomb County, Michigan. Before his death in 1807 at the age of eighty-nine, Richard established a successful trading post in Michigan and acquired more than of land in the area. Although the Conner brothers received land from their father, by 1795 William was also trading with Native Americans around Saginaw Bay.Madison and Sandweiss, p. 49. See also: Timothy Crumrin, \\"William Conner\\" in Career From his arrival in what became central Indiana in 1800 to the end of his life in 1855, William Conner was actively involved in the area's settlement and development, including founding Hamilton County, Indiana, platting the town of Noblesville in 1823, and donating land in the new town to establish it as the county's seat of government. Conner was also a trader, interpreter, and liaison on treaty negotiations with the Native Americans. Beginning in the 1820s, Conner used the wealth he had amassed from his ties to trading and the land cession treaties with Native Americans to become a landowner and successful business entrepreneur during Indiana's pioneer era. Trader and interpreter After the American Revolutionary War, Conner joined his older brother, John, in what later became the state of Indiana. Arriving in 1800, they worked as agents for Angus Mackintosh, a Canadian fur trader, and become officially licensed traders in 1801. The Conner brothers settled among the Delaware along the west fork of the White River in present- day central Indiana, and married the Delaware women.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 21, and Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 301‚Äì2, 306. In 1802 William married Mekinges (born in 1789), the daughter of the Delaware chief Kikthawenund, also known as William Anderson. Chief Anderson was the namesake of present-day Anderson, Indiana. William and Mekinges Conner had six children and settled on of prairie land along the White River, where Conner built a log cabin that doubled as their home and a trading post. He also engaged in farming. The property remained Conner's home for thirty-five years. His brother, John, who settled near Cedar Grove, a white settlement in Indiana's Whitewater Valley area in 1803, acted as an intermediary to facilitate the sale of fur pelts and skins that William sent him. John also supplied trade goods and liquor for his brother's trading post customers.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 21; Larson and Vanderstel, p. 308David G. Vanderstel, \\"William Conner\\" in In addition to operating a trading post, Conner and his business partner, William Marshall, profited from the land-cession treaties with the Native Americans and their removal from central Indiana.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 22. In 1811, during the War of 1812, Conner began serving in several capacities as a \\"soldier, scout, interpreter, and spy.\\"Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 21. He also helped make sure that the Delaware remained loyal to the Americans. In addition, Conner accompanied William Henry Harrison, the governor of the Indiana Territory, to the Battle of the Mississinewa in 1812 and was present at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. Conner was among those who helped identify the mutilated body of Tecumseh, who was killed in the battle. Conner continued to serve as an interpreter for the federal government during treaty negotiations after the war. The treaties ceded Native American lands to the federal government and removed the Native Americans living to reservation lands west of the Mississippi River.Crumrin, \\"William Conner,\\" p. 72, and Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 309‚Äì10. Conner was involved in eight treaty negotiations, including service as an interpreter and liaison during the Treaty of St. Mary's negotiations in 1818. Under the terms of the treaty, the Delaware ceded their lands in central Indiana to the federal government in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River, reimbursement for improvements made to their Indiana property, and annuity payments. The treaty was signed on October 3, 1818, and set the terms for the removal of the White River Delaware from Indiana, including Conner's wife, Mekinges, and their six children.Larson and Vanderstel, p. 311, and Madison and Sandweiss, p. 50. Conner helped the treaty negotiators determine what the Native Americans would accept in exchange for their lands and urged the Native American leaders to agree to the treaty terms. In addition, Conner profited from the Native Americans' removal by providing them with supplies for their journey west. It is not known if Conner intended to move west with his Delaware family after the Treaty of Saint Mary's was signed. \\"As early as 1818\\" Conner had filed a petition \\"to secure legal right to his land.\\" In February 1820, six months before the Delaware removal from Indiana to reservation land west of the Mississippi River, Conner filed a petition that requested permission to remain on his land in Indiana and indicated that he would raise his Delaware family there, but the petition was tabled. As his family prepared to move west, Conner divided assets with Marshall, his business partner who decided to move west with the Delaware, and supplied his own family with horses and goods for the journey. (Conner provided Mekinges with sixty horses as her share of the trading business.)Larson and Vanderstel, p. 312. See also: Allison, p. 134. Conner accompanied Mekinges and their six children on the first day of their journey before leaving them to continue their trek west with the Delaware. He left no record to explain his decision to remain in Indiana.Madison and Sandweiss, p. 50. Landowner and community leader Conner used the wealth he amassed from his trading post and payments he received from his government service to re-establish himself in the white community of Hamilton County, Indiana. Three months after his Delaware family's departure, Conner married seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Chapman, the step-daughter of John Finch, a recent settler.Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 303 and 313; Madison and Sandweiss, p. 51. Chapman was \\"possibly the only young, eligible white woman in the area.\\"Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23. William and Elizabeth Conner had ten children over the next twenty-five years. One of his sons was Alexander H. Conner who was a lawyer and politician. Beginning in the 1820s, Conner was a leader of community-building efforts in central Indiana and helped to facilitate its settlement. In 1822 Conner, his Delaware wife, Mekinges, and their heirs, were granted title in common to their Indiana homestead, although his Delaware wife and children no longer lived there. In 1823 Conner began the construction of a brick residence near the site of the family's log cabin on an estimated of land. The new home, where he resided with his second wife, Elizabeth, and their children, overlooked the White River and became a gathering place for various activities of the growing community. The Conner home became a stopover for travelers, a mail stop, and a meeting place for the newly established Hamilton County government.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23; Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 303, 312, and 318. With cash reserves from his earlier work as a trader and involvement in Native American treaty negotiations, Conner acquired multiple landholdings in central Indiana. He also became a land speculator, sometimes joining with others to acquire land that was subsequently sold at a high profit to new settlers. Conner and Josiah Polk platted Noblesville in 1823. The men also donated land in their new town for county government buildings that helped to secure its selection as the Hamilton County seat of government. Conner was also the founder of Strawtown, also in Hamilton County, and Alexandria in Madison County. In addition to his farming and livestock interests, Conner owned or invested in several stores, mills, and a distillery.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23; Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 316‚Äì17 and 322‚Äì23; and Vanderstel, \\"William Conner,\\" p. 471. Politician Conner was involved in local and state politics. He supported the Whig Party's policies and his political friends such as Jonathan Jennings, James Noble, and James B. Ray, among others. Conner served as Hamilton County's first treasurer. He also served three non-consecutive terms in the Indiana General Assembly in 1829-1830, 1831‚Äì1832, and 1836-1837. His interest in politics were motivated by business interests. Conner lobbied in support of internal improvements, such as new roads or the authorization of other public works that would benefit his business ventures.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23; Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 320‚Äì21. Other interests Around 1834 Conner became an agent for the Lawrenceburg and Indianapolis Railroad.Larson and Vanderstel, p. 324. His other civic interests included service as an interpreter for treaty negotiations with the Miami people in 1826 and the Potawatomi in 1832, as well as a guide for the Indiana militia as it prepared to participate in the Black Hawk War. (The war ended before the troops joined the fight.) Conner also became a charter member of the Indiana Historical Society, established in 1830. Later years In 1837, at 60 years old, Conner moved his family to Noblesville, where he continued to oversee his varied business and agricultural interests. By the time of the move, Conner owned about of land in Hamilton County.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23, and Larson and Vanderstel, p. 324. In his later years Conner continued to acquire land, invest in new business ventures, and increase his personal wealth. He also became a local authority on the area's history, especially its frontier and pioneer eras, and was known for his knowledge of Native American life.Larson and Vanderstel, p. 328, and Madison and Sandweiss, pp. 51‚Äì52. Death and legacy Conner died on August 28, 1855, at the age of seventy- seven. He left a large estate, but no last will and testament. As a result, his heirs had to settle the issue of ownership of his land in the local courts, which disallowed Conner's Delaware heirs their claims to a share of his wealth. Conner was buried in Crownland Cemetery in Noblesville, Indiana. His widow, Elizabeth, moved to Indianapolis in 1864; she resided at 472 North East Street until her death in 1892.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23; Larson and Vanderstel, p. 328; Madison and Sandweiss, p. 52. Little information has been reported about Conner's first wife, Mekinges, after she left Indiana in 1820. Conner's legacy is linked to the important trading relations that he and his brother, John, established with the Native Americans along the west fork of the White River in the early 1800s. After living among the Delaware for nearly twenty years and serving as an agent, liaison, and interpreter, Conner made a personal fortune from this relationship that he expanded into further success as a landowner, merchant, and business entrepreneur.Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 303, 320‚Äì21; and 325‚Äì27. See also: Conner's wealth and influence led to his role as a central Indiana community- builder and founder of Hamilton County, Indiana. Conner and Josiah F. Polk platted the town of Noblesville in 1823 and helped established it as the seat of Hamilton County government. Conner also founded Strawtown in Hamilton County and Alexandria in Madison County.Larson and Vanderstel, pp. 325‚Äì27. In addition to his influence on the development of central Indiana, Conner's best-known legacy is his restored former homestead in Hamilton County, Indiana. William Conner's house In 1823, Conner built a two-story Federal style brick house on the terrace edge of the west fork of the White River, about south of Noblesville, in Hamilton County, Indiana. It is believed to be one of the first brick buildings built in central Indiana. Seven of William and Elizabeth Conner's ten children were born in the home.Crumrin, \\"Between Two Worlds,\\" p. 23, and Vanderstel, \\"William Conner,\\" p. 471. See also: In addition, the Conner house was used as the meeting place for the Hamilton County commissioners and other county officials, as well as a circuit court and a postal office during the county's early days.Larson and Vanderstel, p. 318, and Vanderstel, \\"William Conner,\\" p. 471. Conner lived in the house until 1837, but William and Elizabeth Conner's children and their families or their tenants continued to reside in the house until ownership pass outside the family in 1871. (In the 1860s, Conner's Delaware children were unsuccessful in gaining title to their family's Indiana land.) Note: This includes and accompanying photographs. Indianapolis pharmaceutical executive Eli Lilly Jr. purchased the Conner home and farm in 1934 and immediately began work to stabilize and restore the severely deteriorated house. Local architect Robert Frost Daggett and contractor Charles Latham supervised the stabilization and restoration work, as well as the addition of a new, six-columned porch overlooking the White River. (The porch was removed in a later renovation.) Lilly donated the house and farm to Earlham College in 1963 and the property became part of the Conner Prairie Interactive History Park. The Conner home, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, has undergone subsequent restoration to enhance its representation of an 1820s-era house and is open to Conner Prairie visitors.

Puppies, for instance, need toys they can chew on when they are teething because their gums and jaws become very sore and chewing on things provides them relief. Also, playing with different toys encourages exercise, which benefits the pet's overall health. Toys also stimulate dogs' minds, discourage problem behavior resulting from boredom and excess energy, and promote dental health. There are a wide variety of dog toys on the market that are designed for different purposes and depending on the dog's characteristics such as size, activity level, chewing habits, and play style.  Multifunctional  Labrador pup with plush squeaky toy, ball, and knotted rope that can be thrown, tugged or chewed Some toys can serve multiple functions for dogs to interact with, combining common play behaviors into a single toy. Some can adapt to other toys and objects, and be combined by the dog owner to create new toys for dogs to play with. Whereas a hard ball is not well-suited for chewing, and a plush toy is difficult to throw, wrapping the ball in a plush exterior creates a toy that can be thrown and chewed on. Such toys may provide more entertainment value for dogs and their owners. Distraction toys Kong dog toy can be thrown, stuffed with treats, or chewed These toys can be useful for extremely active dogs who need mental stimulation as well as physical exercise. Some examples are food delivery toys, Kongs stuffed with dog food, frozen peanut butter and/or treats, chew challenge toys, and puzzle toys. Bones The term \\"bones\\" can include animal bones as well as manufactured bones such as Nylabones and dental bones. Animal bones offer a lot of chewing potential but the true nutritional benefits are derived from the soft tissues attached to the bone such as meat, cartilage, fat and connective tissue ... not from the bones themselves.http://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/evr_dg_raw_bones_or_cooked_bones?page=2 There are dangers associated with animal bones, including broken teeth and possible ingestion of large fragments of bone which can cause serious injury or death. It is important to supervise dogs when they are chewing bones and make sure to remove the bone when it is reduced to a size that could possibly be swallowed. Make sure dogs have plenty of fresh water.  Latex and rubber  Latex and rubber dog toys are great for dog entertainment. With these kind of toys, dogs that are aggressive chewers have a safe way to satisfy their biting instincts. These toys also help keep dogs' gums and teeth clean and healthy. In general, hard rubber bones and other latex dog toys help improve dogs' overall oral hygiene. File:Blue dog bone toy.JPGBlue bone-shaped toy manufactured in China File:Maggie the Golden-Lab mix with a dog toy.jpgLabrador retriever with rubber squeaky toy resembling a baby's pacifier  Sticks  Dogs often enjoy gnawing on small tree branches and pinecones. Sticks can also be thrown for the dog to retrieve but this is not recommended due to potential health problems that can develop, including punctures in the mouth. Check with your vet.  Balls  Pup with pink tennis ball Balls of all shapes and sizes help keep dogs active and fit. They are a great way to play, and exercise a dog at the same time.  Safety  rawhide toys Dog toys are not safe if small pieces can be chewed or pulled off as these could be swallowed by the dog. The toy should also be adequate for the dog, taking into consideration their size and activity levels. When choosing a dog toy, it is important that pet owners choose those made with non-toxic materials. Dog owners should avoid giving their dogs objects with small parts that could be chewed off and ingested (such as cooked chicken bones).

Levin is an American author and singer-songwriter who has recorded with such artists as Bradley Joseph. He started his career as keyboardist for the band Patriot and later released four albums as a solo artist. His first release, Heaven, features Paul Peterson on bass. His third album, Stepping on My Hat, drew favorable comparisons to artists such as Sting and a number of pop and rock influences from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Levin has co- authored three books including QBQ! The Question Behind the Question, which has sold over a million copies. He authored the book Don't Just Talk, Be Heard! and is a professional speaker on business communication, leadership, and personal development. Early life, career David Levin began playing music and working with computers at a young age. He joined his first rock band in 1975 while still in high school, a band named Pegasus. In 1976 he took several classes at University of Montana while still in high school, where he studied computers, math and music. He later joined Patriot, formerly named John Thoennes and the All American Band and toured with them through 1985. He then founded The David Levin Band, which disbanded in 1987. Several years later he joined The Screaming Yahoos as guitar player and lead singer. From 1987 to 1994 he waited tables in Minneapolis, and also had his own audio production company from 1992 to 1999. He used a recording studio in his basement to do work for both musicians and professional speakers. He became founder and CEO of Day Eleven, Inc in 1992. Writing and speaking career In 1995 Levin began working with John G. Miller as a speaking coach and writing partner. He began speaking with the company QBQ! in 1998. In 1999 he helped John Miller co-write the book Personal Accountability, and he later helped Miller co-write QBQ! The Question Behind the Question, which has sold over a million copies, as well as Outstanding! 47 Ways to Make Your Organization Exceptional and Flipping the Switch. Levin has also authored Don't Just Talk, Be Heard! and regularly speaks at corporate functions and to business-people about communication and effective leadership. Music career In 1983, while still in Patriot, David made a demo recording of original music with producer and Canadian Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Domenic Troiano. The Screaming Yahoos released a self-titled EP in 1995, produced by Nashville artist John Beland and Australian producer Brian Cadd. Levin's first solo album was released in 1997 on his Day Eleven label. Heaven features David Barry (guitar), Paul Peterson (bass), and Rick Barron (co-writer and background vocals), and has a rock and pop style. Also in 1997, he contributed vocals to the album Rapture by Bradley Joseph. Levin's second album, Zuni, was released in 2002 on Day Eleven. The acoustic album \\"reflected his time on the Zuni Indian Reservation\\" in New Mexico, where he lived from 1999 to 2002. His song \\"Second Wind\\" was covered by Australian artist Dave Ritter. Stepping on My Hat (2004) His third album, Stepping on My Hat, was released on October 27, 2004, and received positive reviews. Two songs from the album; \\"Demolition Boy\\" and \\"Blood and Feathers\\" ‚Äî were honored in the 2004 Great American Song Contest. ;Reception Caffeine Magazine gave the album 4/5 stars and called it a \\"tasteful record with interesting lyrics.\\" MusicCritic.ca gave it 3.5/5 stars, calling it \\"an experiment in late 1970s/early 1980s inspired pop rock. The songs here make for minimalist pop rock, yet with their densely layered instrumentation the songs are melodically accessible and complex enough to warrant multiple listens.\\" According to one review, \\"Levin's lyrics are equal parts wit and gravity which he underscores with an appropriate soundtrack of wild abandon or somber reflection.\\" His music drew comparisons to early Police, Peter Gabriel, and the Gin Blossoms. Another review stated \\"The guitar work is utterly amazing, with licks that every soft-rocker aims to create,\\" and again drew comparisons to Sting, Fastball, XTC, and Train. The Copper Press stated that \\"David Levin's work runs in a stream with the best of Peter Gabriel as well as the late Kevin Gilbert and Gilbert's partner in the ill-fated but brilliant Toy Matinee, Patrick Leonard...it's refreshing to hear a writer capable of weaving substantive lyrics and music together and balancing depth and levity with honesty and grace.\\" Also, \\"The music has the jaunty bounce of some of the best early-80s pop, when ska beats were first meeting punks‚Äô three-chords. Levin‚Äôs voice adds warmth to the inherent good humor conveyed by many of the songs words.\\" and he \\"channels the early years of The Police, burnishing the first seven tracks with astute songwriting and deft musicality.\\" Criminal (2008) He released his fourth album, Criminal, in 2008. Levin performed essentially all parts on the album, including vocals, songwriting, guitar, manipulating a synthesizer and other tasks, with some musician-friends adding \\"touches of percussion and keyboards.\\" According to the Minnesota Post, \\"After the release of 2005's Stepping on My Hat, critics were nearly unanimous about the resemblance between Levin's music and that of the Police.\\" Levin stated \\"I just don't like being so transparently unoriginal. I'd like to think they're an influence, but not [that I was doing] an impersonation. I did take a harder look at my material...I started to realize that as hard as I had worked [on the first three CDs], I could've worked harder in raising the bar. Not letting any passage in a song go by and thinking, 'Oh, maybe I could have done that a little better.' \\" The Minnesota Post states \\"The CD is instead a glimpse at Levin through some other voices. His \\"Jet Boy,\\" a song about his 3-year-old son, is buoyant guitar rock conjuring up echoes of Robert Palmer, while Elton John reverberates in the title track, and the synth-bop of \\"Evil Genius\\" (a song about a young Karl Rove svengali-type) might well take you all the way back to new wave and the 1980s.\\" Personal life He met his wife, Margaret, waiting tables in Minneapolis in the late 1980s, and together they have two children, Peter and Frances. Since 2010 they have lived in Viroqua, Wisconsin. He also has an older son, Aaron, from a previous relationship. His hobbies include running, skiing, and flying.

The program was like many other talk shows at the time, featuring guests who had problems with other guests, and wanted to bring them on the show to tell them. Usually, Rolanda would try to help them out with their problems. Other topics featured paternity tests, out-of-control teens, and other everyday problems. Towards the end of her show's run, many topics (and mainly the guests) began to go to the extreme as many fights were breaking out, and Watts struggled to maintain order on the set. Watts was faced with the claim that this was turning out to be \\"another Jerry Springer Show\\"; because of this, among other problems that she was facing, Watts and her producers soon ended the series on September 17, 1997. The opening sequence video used in 1994 both early and late used a sphere-like period symbol drawing out the name 'Rolonda' following her smiling for the introduction. In the 1995-1997 seasons, the city of New York was used in vignette scenes of Rolonda connecting with fellow guests in numerous of ways. In the early 1994 intro music composed by David Foster was a slow tempo saxophone theme; the late 1994 version was a remix with harmonizing voices percussion with guitar. The 1995-1997 theme also composed by David Foster was an uptempo piano bass and string synthesizer. A solemn version was used for episodes of a serious overtone.

In the theory of triangulated categories it is a kind of combined kernel and cokernel: if the chain complexes take their terms in an abelian category, so that we can talk about cohomology, then the cone of a map f being acyclic means that the map is a quasi-isomorphism; if we pass to the derived category of complexes, this means that f is an isomorphism there, which recalls the familiar property of maps of groups, modules over a ring, or elements of an arbitrary abelian category that if the kernel and cokernel both vanish, then the map is an isomorphism. If we are working in a t-category, then in fact the cone furnishes both the kernel and cokernel of maps between objects of its core. Definition The cone may be defined in the category of cochain complexes over any additive category (i.e., a category whose morphisms form abelian groups and in which we may construct a direct sum of any two objects). Let A, B be two complexes, with differentials d_A, d_B; i.e., :A = \\\\dots \\\\to A^{n - 1} \\\\xrightarrow{d_A^{n - 1}} A^n \\\\xrightarrow{d_A^n} A^{n + 1} \\\\to \\\\cdots and likewise for B. For a map of complexes f : A \\\\to B, we define the cone, often denoted by \\\\operatorname{Cone}(f) or C(f), to be the following complex: :C(f) = A[1] \\\\oplus B = \\\\dots \\\\to A^n \\\\oplus B^{n - 1} \\\\to A^{n + 1} \\\\oplus B^n \\\\to A^{n + 2} \\\\oplus B^{n + 1} \\\\to \\\\cdots on terms, with differential :d_{C(f)} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} d_{A[1]} & 0 \\\\ f[1] & d_B \\\\end{pmatrix} (acting as though on column vectors). Here A[1] is the complex with A[1]^n=A^{n + 1} and d^n_{A[1]}=-d^{n + 1}_{A}. Note that the differential on C(f) is different from the natural differential on A[1] \\\\oplus B, and that some authors use a different sign convention. Thus, if for example our complexes are of abelian groups, the differential would act as :\\\\begin{array}{ccl} d^n_{C(f)}(a^{n + 1}, b^n) &=& \\\\begin{pmatrix} d^n_{A[1]} & 0 \\\\ f[1]^n & d^n_B \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} a^{n + 1} \\\\ b^n \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &=& \\\\begin{pmatrix} - d^{n + 1}_A & 0 \\\\ f^{n + 1} & d^n_B \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} a^{n + 1} \\\\ b^n \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &=& \\\\begin{pmatrix} - d^{n + 1}_A (a^{n + 1}) \\\\ f^{n + 1}(a^{n + 1}) + d^n_B(b^n) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &=& \\\\left(- d^{n + 1}_A (a^{n + 1}), f^{n + 1}(a^{n + 1}) + d^n_B(b^n)\\\\right). \\\\end{array} Properties Suppose now that we are working over an abelian category, so that the homology of a complex is defined. The main use of the cone is to identify quasi- isomorphisms: if the cone is acyclic, then the map is a quasi-isomorphism. To see this, we use the existence of a triangle :A \\\\xrightarrow{f} B \\\\to C(f) \\\\to A[1] where the maps B \\\\to C(f), C(f) \\\\to A[1] are given by the direct summands (see Homotopy category of chain complexes). Since this is a triangle, it gives rise to a long exact sequence on homology groups: :\\\\dots \\\\to H_{i - 1}(C(f)) \\\\to H_i(A) \\\\xrightarrow{f^*} H_i(B) \\\\to H_i(C(f)) \\\\to \\\\cdots and if C(f) is acyclic then by definition, the outer terms above are zero. Since the sequence is exact, this means that f^* induces an isomorphism on all homology groups, and hence (again by definition) is a quasi-isomorphism. This fact recalls the usual alternative characterization of isomorphisms in an abelian category as those maps whose kernel and cokernel both vanish. This appearance of a cone as a combined kernel and cokernel is not accidental; in fact, under certain circumstances the cone literally embodies both. Say for example that we are working over an abelian category and A, B have only one nonzero term in degree 0: :A = \\\\dots \\\\to 0 \\\\to A_0 \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots, :B = \\\\dots \\\\to 0 \\\\to B_0 \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots, and therefore f \\\\colon A \\\\to B is just f_0 \\\\colon A_0 \\\\to B_0 (as a map of objects of the underlying abelian category). Then the cone is just :C(f) = \\\\dots \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\underset{[-1]}{A_0} \\\\xrightarrow{f_0} \\\\underset{[0]}{B_0} \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots. (Underset text indicates the degree of each term.) The homology of this complex is then :H_{-1}(C(f)) = \\\\operatorname{ker}(f_0), :H_0(C(f)) = \\\\operatorname{coker}(f_0), :H_i(C(f)) = 0 \\\\text{ for } i eq -1, 0.\\\\ This is not an accident and in fact occurs in every t-category. Mapping cylinder A related notion is the mapping cylinder: let f\\\\colon A \\\\to B be a morphism of chain complexes, let further g \\\\colon \\\\operatorname{Cone}(f)[-1] \\\\to A be the natural map. The mapping cylinder of f is by definition the mapping cone of g. Topological inspiration This complex is called the cone in analogy to the mapping cone (topology) of a continuous map of topological spaces \\\\phi : X \\\\rightarrow Y: the complex of singular chains of the topological cone cone(\\\\phi) is homotopy equivalent to the cone (in the chain-complex-sense) of the induced map of singular chains of X to Y. The mapping cylinder of a map of complexes is similarly related to the mapping cylinder of continuous maps. References  Joeseph J.

He is the protagonist in The Warlord of the Air, The Land Leviathan, The Steel Tsar, and appears in other stories too.  Origin in Nesbit's Oswald Bastable  E. Nesbit created Oswald Bastable and his five siblings in the 1890s and featured them in numerous children's adventure stories narrated by Oswald (not to be confused with Nesbit's other children's fantasy adventures, Five Children and It and its sequels). Many Bastable stories were first published in magazines, not plainly as serial novels, but they are now known from the three episodic novels The Story of the Treasure Seekers (1899), The Wouldbegoods (1901), New Treasure Seekers (1904). Four more Bastable stories are in the collection Oswald Bastable and Others (1905). Moorcock stated on the forums of his websitehttp://www.multiverse.org/fora/showthread.php?s=5e48d2072b442bd034444acebbe2e1c2&t;=7713 that his use of the name \\"Oswald Bastable\\" was not supposed to directly link his character with Nesbit's (i.e. to make his novels into sequels). Rather, he said that he was trying to connect with a particular \\"Fabian 'liberal' imperialism, still fundamentally paternalistic but well-meaning\\" which he felt belonged to Nesbit's era. Edith Nesbit, who originally created the Bastable character, and her husband Hubert Bland, had been among the founders and leading members of the Fabian Society ‚Äì whose proclaimed aim was to eventually get to Socialism, but in a gradual non-revolutionary way. It can be said that in practice this made its members into proponents of a continued, reformed British Empire. Moorcock's Bastable books explore various variants on the theme of Imperialism and Colonialism: the British and other colonial empires persisting into the later 20th Centuries, or conversely collapsing already in the early 1900s, and so on. The Warlord of the Air Oswald Bastable was Captain of the 53rd Lancers in British India, and one of four brothers. Sent in 1902, on a mission to Kumbalari, an independent state in the North-east of the sub-continent, ruled by Sharan Kang. While there Bastable and his men are drugged by the Kumbalaris and when attempting to make their escape through the maze-like tunnels beneath the Temple of the Future Buddha are caught in an earthquake. Upon awakening Bastable discovers he is alone and the whole city of Teku Benga is in ruins. He is eventually rescued by an airship of the Royal Indian Air Service and discovers that seventy years have passed since he journeyed to meet Sharan Kang. Realising how it might be received if he insists on telling the truth about what has happened to him, he feigns amnesia and is eventually returned to London. When in London, after being given a clean bill of health (apart from his 'amnesia'), he trains with the Special Air Police and is eventually given a position on the Loch Etive, a luxury airship used for round-the-world cruises. While serving on the Loch Etive he is involved in an altercation with a passenger and is eventually forced to resign from the SAP. On his return to London he accepts a position as second officer on The Rover, a merchant airship owned and operated by Captain Korzeniowski. While en route to the Far East, Bastable discovers that the ship is carrying terrorists, but before he can alert the authorities the ship is taken over by O. T. Shaw. The Chinese warlord takes his captured airship to the Valley of the Morning in China, where Bastable is surprised to discover a thriving community of exiled scientists from many nations, living harmoniously in a highly advanced city. Formerly a firm supporter of the civilizing influence of Empire, Bastable is shown many things in 'Dawn City' which finally convince him of the error of his outlook and agrees to pilot an airship carrying an experimental bomb to the great airship works in Hiroshima - which are being used by the combined fleets of the great nations attacking the Valley of the Morning to refuel, re-arm and repair. Upon reaching the airfield, the bomb, which is a nuclear device, is set off and the resulting explosion sends Bastable back to 1903. The Land Leviathan Rescued from the sea by a Japanese fishing boat, Bastable eventually arrives at Rowe Island, where he tells his story to Michael C. Moorcock. After recounting his tale to Moorcock Snr., he stowed away on a ship leaving Rowe Island and eventually made his way back to Teku Benga. Re-entering the maze under the Temple of the Future Buddha, hoping to return to his own world, he is again transported between the planes. Eventually reaching a British Army outpost, he learns that a world-wide war, known as the War Between the Nations, has been raging and that this world, in which it is 1904, bears even less relation to his own 'real' time than the one he had left. Making his way to Calcutta he falls in with some of the forces of the Arabian Alliance. Mistakenly thinking Britain is still allied with them, they give him passage on a steamer across the Indian Ocean. After entering the Red Sea the ship is sunk by the Mannanan, and the survivors left to drown. Bastable is eventually rescued by the Lola Montez, commanded by Captain Korzeniowski. Korzeniowski agreed to drop Bastable off in southern England - though he tries to deter him, offering a place as a crew member. Bastable makes his way inland after being dropped off and ended up rescuing Una Persson from East Grinstead. Una, who had been searching for blueprints to an O'Bean machine, gave him a lift as far as Morecambe Bay and from there he makes his way north, eventually reaching Skye and joining Korzeniowski's crew. After some time as a privateer with Korzeniowski, they decide that it has become too dangerous to ply their trade and join the navy of Bantustan - an alternate, fully independent, enlightened and racially integrated South Africa - where they are welcome as citizens. They are taken into President Mohandas Gandhi's confidence and are held in high regard by him. Bastable is sent with the diplomatic mission to the New Ashanti Empire at the request of General Cicero Hood and is taken to the capital, New Kumasi. Bastable had decided to assassinate General Hood, but finds himself impressed by the man, who is not at all like the stories which are told about him. Hood learns that the Australasian-Japanese Federation are planning to attack and decides to invade the United States before they can do so on their terms. This results in the Battle of the Atlantic, which Bastable saw as an observer, and the breaking of the power of the Australasian-Japanese Federation, although the New Ashanti Empire also lost a lot of ships. Bastable was also along when the invasion of the USA started, witnessing the conquering of New York City. Escaping from the Black Horde as it conquered Philadelphia, he made his way to Wilmington where he made contact with the American forces and was taken to Washington, D.C.. Here, he attempted to warn them of the dangers awaiting them but was unheeded and eventually ignored. Seeing many things to convince him that the people he had tried to warn deserved what was coming to them, he helped free a chain gang and sabotage some of the Whites' preparations just as the Black Horde starts its attack. After the Battle of Washington, Bastable remained in Hood's service for a year before leaving for Bantustan, having given his manuscript into the care of Una Persson for delivery to Michael Moorcock, Snr. The Steel Tsar After visiting Teku Benga again, Bastable finds himself in a world where the Great Powers still held their empires and in some cases they are even bigger. Many familiar inventions are in evidence, including airships. The world's peace is broken in 1941 when a mysterious explosion destroys Hiroshima, causing Japan to declare war on Britain. While in Singapore Bastable barely manages to escape the Japanese invasion, eventually ending up in an open motor-boat which drifts to Rowe Island. After recovering there, he is captured by the Japanese and taken to a civilian camp on Rishiri Island, from which he is rescued, along with the other prisoners, by Britain's allies the Russians; due to the October Revolution not occurring in this timeline, Alexander Kerensky has led Russia to become one of the most civilized and democratic peoples of the world. Bastable joins the Russian Volunteer Airforce and undertakes training in Samara, where he first hears of the \\"Steel Tsar,\\" Iosif Vissarionovich Djugashvili, the head of a theocratic revolutionist society. He is assigned to the Vassarion Belinsky, under Captain Leonov, which is sent to join Air Admiral Krassnov in an attack on the Free Cossack forces attacking \\"Yekaterinaslav\\" (possibly Yekaterinburg). The fleet is later attacked by a force of airships commanded by Nestor Makhno, with the result that the Vassarion Belinsky is boarded and captured and taken to Djugashvili's camp. Seeing that Una Persson was in league with the Steel Tsar, Bastable switches allegiance, trusting Una's judgement. He witnesses the failure of Harry Birchington's mechanical Steel Tsar and is on board the Vassarion Belinsky when it is sent on its mission to bomb Makhno's camp. While attempting to disarm the bombs, thereby discrediting Djugashvili, Cornelius Dempsey stops them and lets them leave using gliding equipment, embarking on a kamikaze mission destroying the Steel Tsar's forces. Shortly after landing, Bastable and Persson witness the flash from the explosion of the bombs over the steppe. They are later met by horsemen from Makhno, who had managed to gain concessions from the Central Government allowing him to run his anarchist experiment. Other books and stories *In \\"The English Assassin\\" he is described as a renegade Englishman and chief of General O T Shaw's air force when he attended the Peace Conference Ball. *He was also the Captain of the airship carrying Captain Nye to meet the leader of an anarchist army camped in Glen Coe. *He encountered Jherek Carnelian and Mrs Amelia Underwood in the Silurian (or possibly Lower Devonian) and took them to the Time Centre maintained in that period, and was seen by Jherek as a rival for the affections of Mrs Underwood. * He is also an opium user - with opium playing somewhat the same role for him that Stormbringer does for Elric - in Moorcock's \\"Elric Sequence\\" novels. Edith Nesbit's character, Oswald Bastable, was born 15 August, as stated on page 201, in The Wouldbegoods, published by Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York and London (1901).

Geography Alpine pastures in the Rieding high valley The Zederhaus Valley is located in the northwestern part of the Salzburg Lungau region, on the southern slopes of the Lower Tauern mountain range, reaching up to Mt Wei√üeck at . The crest of the Radstadt Tauern in the north separates it from the Pongau region. From the Rieding high valley, today a protected area, the Zederhaus creek flows southeastwards, reaching the upper Mur River at neighbouring Sankt Michael. The smaller village stream passes several historic watermills. The sparsely settled municipal area, the largest in the Tamsweg District, comprises the cadastral communities of Lamm, Rothenwand, Wald, and Zederhaus proper. The valley today is characterised by the construction of the Tauern Autobahn in the 1970s, a major north-south road connection which is part of the European route E55. The south portal of the Tauern Road Tunnel, one of the longest in Austria, is located near the Zederhaus centre. A junction leads on the motorway in the Salzburg direction. Several attempts have been made to reduce emissions by the construction of extended noise protection walls; currently an overhead noise barrier is built along a section near the Zederhaus village centre. History Prangstangen procession Zederhaus shares the history of the rustic Lungau region, once part of the Roman Noricum province. The remote area possibly was not settled until the 14th century. For centuries, the estates belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg until its secularisation in 1803. A local chapel was first mentioned in a 1445 deed, then a filial of St Rupert Church in nearby Wei√üpriach. Since 1813 Saint John's at Zederhaus is a parish in its own right. The local peasants relied on seasonal mountain pasture farming, while today many inhabitants are commuter employees. A local custom at least since the 17th century is the annual procession with Prangstangen, up to high wooden poles which are decorated with flowers and carried by local bachelors on St John's Day, June 24 into the church.

The Toronto ravine system is one of the most distinctive features of the geography of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a network of deep ravines that form a large urban forest that runs throughout much of the city. For the most part designated as parkland, the ravines are largely undeveloped. Toronto's slogan: \\"The city within a park\\" partially stems from the extensive ravine green space. Origin The ravine system was formed by millennia of rivers and creeks eroding loose soil, deposited throughout the region during the end of the last glacial period. The terrain that the city of Toronto sits on was formed after the end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago. The glaciers flattened the terrain, and deposited a thick layer of loose sand and soil over the region. Over the millennia, small rivers and creeks eroded this soil cutting deep ravines through what is today the Toronto region. To the north of Toronto is the Oak Ridges Moraine. The largest ravines are home to the rivers running south from the Moraine to Lake Ontario: the Humber River, the Don River, and the Rouge River.Cundiff, Brad. The Hike Ontario guide to walks around Toronto. Erin, Ont: Boston Mills Press, 1994. Smaller creeks and streams rise within Toronto from rain and melt water. The Don River is categorized as an underfit river, as it is too small for its relatively steep and broad valley. Despite the dense population of metropolitan Toronto, many of the ravines have been left close to their natural state. The most important reason for this is the danger of flooding. The rivers and streams that flow through the ravines are highly variable. During the late summer, many of the smaller ones will slow to a trickle or even disappear completely. During the spring and after major storms, the creeks often overflow their banks.Seymour, p. 13 Every few decades, a massive flooding event will occur where the ravines are almost totally flooded. The most recent such event was in 1954 when Hurricane Hazel arrived. That storm dropped over of rain on the city in a day onto soil that was already waterlogged by a week of rain. In the post-war boom years, several developments had begun to encroach on the ravine lands, and these neighbourhoods were badly damaged by the storm. Whole blocks were washed away and 81 people killed. The damage was most severe along the Humber River, where a part of a street was destroyed completely. This disaster led to an almost complete ban on development in the ravines, and a new Region Conservation Authority was created to maintain them as open spaces. Human use Early settlers quickly discovered that the sandy and gravelly soil of the ravines made them unsuitable for agriculture. They were extensively logged during the nineteenth century, and there are very few trees in the ravines that date to before the end of logging around 1850.Seymour, p. 139 The rivers and creeks were also an important source of power for early European settlers, and many mills operated on the rivers in the nineteenth century, with the last closing in 1914. The Don Valley with Prince Edward Viaduct overhead the Don Valley Parkway. As the city grew, the area surrounding the Don River saw the largest transformation amongst the city's ravine systems. Amongst the ravines that run along the city's waterway system, the ravines surrounding the Don Valley, is one of the most transformed. The southern portion of the Don was completely encased in a concrete channel to prevent flooding and allow industry to locate in the area. Along the length of the valley, first the rail lines and then the six-lane Don Valley Parkway were constructed. Today, the industries along the lower Don are gone, and significant efforts are underway to restore the lower Don to a more natural condition. Several smaller ravines have almost completely disappeared due to development and industrial use. Smaller creeks running through the downtown, such as Garrison Creek and Taddle Creek, were almost completely bricked over and today run deep under the modern city centre. These were used as sewers by the early residents of Toronto. Even today, many of Toronto's storm drains empty directly into the ravines. In case of overflow, some parts of the sewer system are also designed to empty into them.Seymour, p. 60 Recent decades have seen concerted efforts to protect the ravines, and to restore them to a more natural state. In 2002, the city issued a new bylaw protecting ravine lands. Most of the ravines were long closed off from the city. The road network either bypassed the ravines, or crossed bridges running above them. Many people travelling through the city by private motor vehicle can thus be entirely unaware of the sharp variations in topography. It is only in recent years that a concerted effort has been made to integrate the ravines into a system of paths useful for pedestrians and cyclists. The Humber River Trail is one of several trails in the city that go through the ravine system. A number of the ravines now have paved paths, well maintained bridges, and stairs. Many others do not have such amenities, and the city intends to leave most of these areas unspoilt. The ravines are today popular with hikers and bicyclists, to the extent that erosion and wildlife disruption are becoming a problem in certain areas.Seymour, p. 142 While suitable for hiking and cycling, the rivers and creeks running through the ravines are still quite polluted and swimming and wading is inadvisable. There are many dangers for those exploring the ravines. Many areas are very rugged with poor paths and steep cliffs. There are few guardrails or stairs. Waterways are often fast moving and very cold, and can be deadly if one falls in. Poison ivy and nettles are also abundant.Seymour, p. 9 While located in the heart of one of North America's largest cities, most of the ravines are deserted most of the time. This does lead to concerns about crime, and women especially are often discouraged from walking through them alone. While crimes do occur, they are not commonplace. A persistent problem is that of illegal dumping of garbage in the ravines.\\"One year later, we still have trouble with trash\\" Jack Lakey. Toronto Star. Jun 15, 2005. pg. B.01 Certain parts of the ravines are also known as gay cruising areas.\\"Toronto greenbelts, in black and white\\" By Christopher Hume. Toronto Star. Jun 22, 1995. pg. G.6 The ravines are also home to a considerable number of homeless people, some of them living in fairly elaborate temporary structures. In 2001, The Globe and Mail ran a three part series titled \\"The Outsiders\\" tracing the life of the homeless residents of the ravines over the course of nearly a year. It won a National Newspaper Award for best feature writing. Locations Map of Toronto and its waterway system. Most of the ravine system is situated around these waterways. There are four major groups of ravines, and many smaller groups scattered throughout the city. In the west, the Humber River forms the eastern border of the former city of Etobicoke. It has several creeks feeding it, most prominently Black Creek, which have carved ravines in the northwestern part of the city. The most prominent of the ravine systems is that connected to the Don River, which empties into Lake Ontario just to the east of downtown. While the lower Don was almost wholly industrialized, much of the rest of the ravine system was not heavily affected. Branching west off the lower Don are a series of ravines that surround the neighbourhood of Rosedale, and extend further west past Bathurst Street, especially Castle Frank Brook, which extends as far as Lawrence Avenue and Dufferin Street. Located near to downtown, these are some of Toronto's most visible ravines. At an area known as the Forks of the Don, four large ravines converge as three tributaries, each with its own ravine system, merge into the main river: the West Don, the East Don, and Taylor-Massey Creek. The West Don moves from the northwest through a number of large parks, and spreads through North York creating a number of ravines that run through that area and the suburbs north of the city. The East Don contains the Don Valley Parkway for its lower stretch, but further north becomes more verdant as it moves north through the suburbs. Taylor Creek flows almost directly from the east to the Forks, with its ravine heading into Scarborough before turning north near Warden Avenue and running to St. Clair Avenue East. View of Rouge National Urban Park, a national park that includes the ravines of Toronto's Rouge Valley. Scarborough is home to two large ravine systems. Highland Creek flows into Lake Ontario at the eastern edge of the Scarborough Bluffs. It has a large watershed and a number of tributaries almost entirely confined to the Scarborough area. At the far east of the city of Toronto is the Rouge River system. Furthest away from the centre of the city, the area around it has been preserved from development by the creation of a provincial park that covers much of the river's watershed and a large network of ravines. In June 2017, the ravines along the east-end of the city was made into Rouge National Urban Park, Canada's first national urban park. In addition to the ravines that surround these four major rivers, there are a number of smaller ravines scattered throughout the city. Etobicoke Creek and Mimico Creek in the west of the city both have long valleys. In the Beaches area, Glen Stewart Ravine no longer has a visible creek, having been transformed into a popular park. The point where the Humber, Don, and Rouge River watersheds meet, in other words, the triple point of the respective watersheds, is near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Jefferson Sideroad at the Vaughan-Richmond Hill boundary. In culture Toronto's ravines have been presented as central to Toronto's character. Architect Larry Richards describes Toronto as topographically being \\"San Francisco turned upside down\\" in reference to San Francisco's hilly terrain.Fulford, Robert. \\"The Invention of Toronto: A city defined by its artists.\\" William Kilbourn Lecture, Toronto Historical Board, June 12, 1996 They appear prominently in the works of most of Toronto's major writers such as Margaret Atwood, Anne Michaels, Robert Fulford, Morley Callaghan and Ann-Marie MacDonald. Ravines play an important background role in Atom Egoyan's film Chloe where the main characters live in a house atop the Cedarvale ravine. The unique topography of Toronto was one of the primary reasons Egoyan chose to set the film in Toronto. Fulford has stated that the \\"ravines are the chief characteristic of the local terrain, its topographical signature. They are both a tangible (though often hidden) part of our surroundings and a persistent force in our civic imagination. They are the shared subconscious of the municipality, the places where much of the city's literature is born.\\"Fulford, Robert. \\"Toronto & Margaret Atwood.\\" The National Post, August 24, 2000 See also * Fauna of Toronto * Hamilton ravine system * List of Toronto parks * Native trees in Toronto * Toronto and Region Conservation Authority * Toronto waterway system References ;Citations ;Bibliography * * External links *City of Toronto - Ravines *Lost River Walks Urban Ecology Category:Landforms of Toronto Category:Ravines of Canada ","title":"Toronto ravine system"},{"id":"10125582","text":"Nuclear peace is a theory of international relations that argues that under some circumstances, nuclear weapons can induce stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation. In particular, nuclear weapons are said to have induced stability during the Cold War, when both the US and the USSR possessed mutual second-strike retaliation capability, which eliminated the possibility of nuclear victory for either side. Proponents of nuclear peace argue that controlled nuclear proliferation may be beneficial for inducing stability. Critics of nuclear peace argue that nuclear proliferation increases the chance not only of nuclear war but also of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state actors that are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation. The major debate on the issue has been between Kenneth Waltz, the founder of neorealist theory in international relations, and Scott Sagan, a leading proponent of organizational theories in international politics. Waltz generally argues that \\"more may be better\\" and contends that new nuclear states will use their acquired nuclear capabilities as nuclear deterrence and thus preserve peace. Sagan argues that \\"more will be worse\\" since new nuclear states often lack adequate organizational controls over their new weapons, which makes for a high risk of either deliberate or accidental nuclear war or of theft of nuclear material by terrorists to perpetrate nuclear terrorism.  Argument  A nuclear peace results if the costs of war are unacceptably high for both sides. In a two-sided conflict in which both sides have a second- strike capability, defense becomes impossible and so it is the very prospect of fighting the war, rather than the possibility of losing it, that induces restraint. In a condition of mutually assured destruction, there are civilian \\"hostages\\" on both sides, which facilitates cooperation by acting as an informal mechanism of contract enforcement between states. There are economic equivalents of such informal mechanisms used to effect credible commitment; for example, corporations use \\"hostages\\" in the form of initial setup costs that act as collateral to deter subsidiaries and franchisees from cheating. Nuclear weapons may also lessen a state's reliance on allies for security, thus preventing allies from dragging each other into wars; known as chain ganging, it is frequently said to be one of the major causes of World War I. Since the death of civilians is an essential part of mutually assured destruction, a normative consequence of nuclear weapons is that war loses its historical function as a symbol of glory and measure of national strength. As a method of preventing a destabilizing arms race, the concept of minimal deterrence represents one way of solving the security dilemma and avoiding an arms race. A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis and found support for the existence of the stability-instability paradox. The study determined that nuclear weapons promote strategic stability and prevent largescale wars but simultaneously allow for more low intensity conflicts. If a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and one state has nuclear weapons and its opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, if there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/53/2/258.short Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis A Quantitative Approach.  Criticisms  Critics argue that war can occur even under conditions of mutually assured destruction. Actors are not always rational, as bureaucratic procedure and internal intrigue may cause subrational outcomes. Related to and reinforcing that point is that there is always an element of uncertainty. One cannot always control emotions, subordinates, and equipment, especially when one has limited information and is faced with high stakes and fast timetables. There are unintended consequences, unwanted escalation, irrationality, misperception, and the security dilemma. Another reason is that deterrence has an inherent instability. As Kenneth Boulding said: \\"If deterrence were really stable... it would cease to deter.\\" If decision-makers were perfectly rational, they would never order the largescale use of nuclear weapons, and the credibility of the nuclear threat would be low. However, that apparent perfect rationality criticism is countered and so is consistent with current deterrence policy. In Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence, the authors detail an explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding \\"what is permitted\\" for other nations and its endorsement of \\"irrationality\\" or, more precisely, the perception thereof as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy. The document claims that the capacity of the United States, in exercising deterrence, would be hurt by portraying US leaders as fully rational and cool- headed: Some commentators critical of the concept of nuclear peace further make the argument that nonstate actors and rogue states could supply nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations and so undermine conventional deterrence and therefore nuclear peace, especially with the existence of international terrorist networks seeking access to nuclear sources. However Robert Gallucci, the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe, \\"the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent.\\" Graham Allison makes a similar case and argues that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material: \\"After a nuclear bomb detonates, nuclear forensic cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin.\\" The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints: \\"The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials.\\"  See also  * Balance of terror * Deterrence theory * Long Peace * Minimum deterrence * Minimum Credible Deterrence * Mutual assured destruction * Nuclear weapons debate * Peace through strength * Pax Atomica  References  Category:International relations theory Category:Nuclear strategy Category:Nuclear warfare Category:International security Category:Peace Category:Economic growth ","title":"Nuclear peace"},{"id":"10125589","text":"Events from the year 1784 in Ireland.

He played college football at Boston College. Early years Stone attended West Roxbury High School and did not play football until his junior year. He was a team captain and blocked 3 punts as a senior. He also played basketball as a senior. He accepted a football scholarship from Boston College, to play under head coach Jack Bicknell. He was suspended because of academic reasons and didn't see the field until 1990, appearing in 8 games at defensive tackle with 19 tackles, despite missing that last 3 contests due to a fractured right ring finger. In 1991, Tom Coughlin took over the team's coaching duties. Stone started 11 games at right defensive tackle, registering 49 tackles (5 for loss), one sack, 2 passes defensed and 2 blocked kicks. As a senior, he was asked to convert into a right tackle to improve the offensive line depth. The line was nicknamed the \\"All State Insurance\\". He helped the offense rank 12th in the nation, averaging 233.5 rushing yards per game, rank l0th in total offense with an average of 438.4 yards per game and surrender only 12 sacks Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Stone was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (96th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft and was switched to play at offensive guard. He was activated for only 4 games as a rookie. The next year, he saw most of his playing time on the field goal and extra point lines. During his time with the team he was a backup at guard and tackle. In 1994, during a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, injuries forced him to play two different positions along the offensive line. Although he was a talented player and the top offensive line backup, he couldn't start ahead of the team's other offensive guards that included: Nate Newton, Larry Allen, Kevin Gogan, John Gesek and Derek Kennard. He was a part of 2 Super Bowl winning teams. New York Giants On March 1, 1996, the New York Giants signed him as an unrestricted free agent, when the Cowboys couldn¬¥t match an offer that would pay him, more than any of the Cowboy starter in the offensive line except for offensive tackle Erik Williams. The contract at the time was criticized, because it was seen as overpaying for a player that was not proven and had no starter experience. Stone spent 6 seasons with the Giants as the starter at right guard, where he was named to 2 Pro Bowls and 2 All-Pro teams. San Francisco 49ers On April 12, 2002, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an unrestricted free agent. He was the starter at right guard and made the Pro Bowl in his first year, despite playing the entire season with a right arm brace. In a salary-cap move, he was released on March 2, 2004. Oakland Raiders On March 8, 2004, he signed with the Oakland Raiders, reuniting with former offensive coordinator Norv Turner, who was now the head coach of the team. He only started 5 games because of a left knee injury and was placed on the injured reserve list on December 31. On March 4, 2005, he was waived and later re-signed on March 10. After starting all 16 games in the previous season, he was released on March 2, 2006. Personal life Stone is currently the offensive line coach for Valley Christian High School.

The east‚Äìwest highway runs through Vancouver as an expressway and its eastern suburbs as a country road, connecting Interstate 5 (I-5) to I-205 in eastern Vancouver and SR 14 in Camas. SR 500 runs concurrent to SR 503 within Orchards and also uses a section of the county-built Padden Parkway. The highway originally followed Fourth Plain Boulevard, a local road built in the 1820s by fur traders and later extended east to Camas in the 1920s. It was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 8A (SSH 8A) and widened by the state government in the late 1960s. SSH 8A was replaced by SR 500 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, concurrent with state plans to build a parallel freeway to relieve traffic congestion on Fourth Plain Boulevard. The state government constructed an expressway for SR 500 in the 1970s and 1980s, including an interchange with I-205 near the new Vancouver Mall. The expressway included several at-grade intersections with traffic signals that led to a high rate of rear-end collisions. The state government began converting these intersections into grade-separated interchanges in the 1990s, with the final right-in/right-out junctions opened in 2018. The eastern section of SR 500 in Orchards on Fourth Plain Boulevard was replaced with the Padden Parkway in 2005. Route description SR 500 near the St. Johns Boulevard interchange facing east SR 500 begins northeast of downtown Vancouver as part of an interchange with I-5 and East 39th Street. The westbound lanes of SR 500 connect with an onramp to southbound I-5, while the eastbound lanes of SR 500 are fed by an offramp from northbound I-5; other movements to I-5 are accessed by a half-diamond interchange with Northeast 15th Avenue and East 39th Street. SR 500 travels southeast on a four-lane freeway along Burnt Bridge Creek to an interchange with St. Johns Boulevard and turns east to parallel Fourth Plain Boulevard through Vancouver's suburban neighborhoods. The freeway travels through two junctions at Falk Road (42nd Avenue) and Stapleton Road (54th Avenue) that are configured with right- in/right-out access, the former including a pedestrian overpass. SR 500 continues northeast and travels through a pair of single-point urban interchanges with Andresen Road and Thurston Way, the latter serving the Vancouver Mall complex on the north side of the highway. The freeway crosses under Fourth Plain Boulevard and reaches a cloverleaf interchange with I-205, the main freeway bypass of the Portland metropolitan area. After an interchange with Gher Road, the freeway ends and SR 500 turns north onto 117th Avenue, becoming concurrent with SR 503\\\\. The two highways enter Orchards and remain concurrent for , splitting at an intersection with Padden Parkway. SR 503 continues north towards Battle Ground, while SR 500 turns east onto Padden Parkway, a limited-access expressway with infrequent intersections and a posted speed limit of . The parkway travels east across several suburban subdivisions and ends after merging with Ward Road, from which SR 500 turns south onto 162nd Avenue. The highway remains on 162nd Avenue until an intersection with Fourth Plain Boulevard, which SR 500 follows east into rural and unincorporated Clark County. At Lacamas Creek in Proebstel, the highway dips south and continues along Northeast 58th Street until reaching Matney Creek, where it makes a series of stairstep turns onto local roads while traveling along the east side of Green Mountain. SR 500 then turns east onto Brunner Road and south onto 267th Avenue, passing Grove Field airport in Fern Prairie and briefly turning west before continuing south into Camas on Everett Street. The highway passes the south end of Lacamas Lake and travels into downtown Camas, where it runs east on 14th Avenue, south on Garfield Street, west on 3rd Avenue, and south on Dallas Street. Near the city's paper mill, SR 500 leaves downtown and crosses over the Washougal River, following a section of the BNSF Railway to Parker's Landing. The highway turns south onto Union Street and intersects SR 14 at a dogbone interchange, where SR 500 terminates. SR 500 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. The busiest section of the highway, near the Vancouver Mall and I-205, carried a daily average of 72,000 vehicles in 2016; the least busiest section of the highway, at its eastern terminus in Camas, carried only 2,700 vehicles. The freeway section of SR 500 in Vancouver and the street shared with SR 503 in Orchards are designated as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway section of SR 500 has a posted speed limit of , which matches the rural section northwest of Camas; in suburban areas, the speed limit drops to . History The SR 500 corridor was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 8A (SSH 8), a spur of Primary State Highway 8 (PSH 8) that ran from Vancouver to Camas via Orchards. The highway traveled along Fourth Plain Boulevard in eastern Vancouver, which was built by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1820s and named for the Fourth Plain region. A series of country roads connecting the eastern outskirts of Fourth Plain with Camas were built by the 1920s to serve farmers, miners, and the military on the way to Camp Bonneville. The SR 500 designation replaced SSH 8A in the 1964 state highway renumbering and initially traveled through Vancouver on Fourth Plain Boulevard. The entire highway within Vancouver city limits, a distance of , was widened to four lanes in 1965 at a cost of $258,000 due to increased traffic from eastern Vancouver. The expressway section of SR 500 was constructed in the 1970s and 1980s to relieve the congested Fourth Plain Boulevard, but full interchanges were deferred due to budget issues. The interchange with I-205 was built in 1977, but was not connected to the SR 500 freeway or nearby roads until the following decade. A section from St. Johns Road to Andersen Road was opened in November 1983 and was followed by an extension west to I-5 in 1984. Due to a traffic volumes that contributed to a high rate of rear-end collisions and other vehicle accidents, averaging three injuries per week, SR 500 was named the state's second most dangerous highway in 2002. WSDOT began converting the expressway into a full-fledged freeway in the 1990s, primarily by replacing intersections with grade-separated interchanges. The first new interchange to be built by the program, at Andresen Road near the Vancouver Mall, opened in 1995 and was the first single-point urban interchange to be built in Washington state. A direct onramp from westbound Fourth Plain Boulevard to eastbound SR 500 near I-205 was constructed in the late 1990s. Replacements for all four of the remaining intersections on SR 500 west of Orchards were proposed unsuccessfully in several state budgets at the turn of the century. A single point urban interchange at Thurston Way near the Vancouver Mall was prioritized and used to test a design‚Äìbuild contract system, which was expected to save a year of planning and bidding time but cost $3 million more, and was completed in October 2002. On the east side of the mall and the I-205 interchange, the six- lane expressway's sole intersection at Gher Road and 112th Avenue was replaced with an interchange in October 2004, costing $26.5 million and funded by the Nickel Program gas tax. The state government also expanded a section of SR 500 between Andresen Road and SR 503 to six lanes as part of the project. The expressway formerly ended east of the Gher Road junction at an intersection with SR 503 on 117th Avenue, with SR 500 turning east onto Fourth Plain Boulevard towards Camas. The Clark County government opened a parallel east‚Äìwest expressway, the Padden Parkway, in stages between 1993 and 2003. SR 500 was re-aligned onto a section of Padden Parkway and Northeast 162nd Avenue in February 2005 by an action of the Washington State Transportation Commission, allowing Fourth Plain Boulevard to be transferred to county and city control. Design work on the remaining interchange projects was halted in 2002, but resumed with new funding approved by the state legislature in 2006. A diamond interchange at St. Johns Boulevard was completed in September 2012, costing $48 million and eliminating one of the most collision-prone areas of SR 500. A set of direct ramps to northbound I-5 from SR 500 were planned to be built as part of the Columbia River Crossing project until it was dropped from the project in 2010. The final pair of intersections on the expressway portion of SR 500, at Falk Road and Stapleton Road, were the site of nearly 400 traffic incidents from 2012 to 2017‚Äîmostly rear-end collisions. The two intersections were reconfigured into right-in/right-out junctions with a continuous median barrier, costing $1 million and completed in October 2018. The Falk Road pedestrian overpass was retained, while a new crossing at Stapleton Road is expected to be built by 2025. The eastern terminus of SR 500 at SR 14 in Camas was converted into a dogbone interchange with roundabouts in 2012 as part of a freeway extension through the area. Long-range plans proposed by WSDOT and the county government call for the remainder of SR 500 between Orchards and Camas to be upgraded to freeway standards. These plans have not been funded by the state government.

It is named after Sir Hans Sloane, 1st Baronet, PRS (16 April 1660 ‚Äì 11 January 1753), physician and collector, notable for his bequest, which became the foundation of the British Museum. Architecture Hans Place dates from the 1770s, when the architect Henry Holland leased from Earl Cadogan and funded the building of his house by laying out a square which he sub-let in building plots. The octagonal shape of the square is thought to have been modelled on the Place Vend√¥me in Paris. Horwood‚Äôs Maps of 1799 and 1813 confirm that, with the exception of Nos. 55‚Äì56, all of the lots had been developed by the first edition, and that the final two houses were complete by the second. The houses were let on 99-year leases, and apart from modernisation from time to time, appear to have remained unchanged during this period. The 1862 Ordnance Survey, for example, shows that none of the houses had been extended over the gardens, and annual directories record good tenancies with no obvious gaps during which major works might have been undertaken. Most of the 18th-century houses in Hans Place were substantially rebuilt by Cadogan Estates when new leases were arranged in the late 19th century, adopting a style that became so closely associated with the district that Osbert Lancaster dubbed it \\"Pont Street Dutch\\". During World War II, Hans Place received bomb damage and substantial repairs were required to many buildings, and where buildings were not repairable new development took place, particularly on the Pavilion Road side. Numbers 14, 16, 17‚Äì22 and 23‚Äì27 Hans Place are all Grade II listed for their architectural merit. Notable residents and events Jane Austen resided at 23 Hans Place. Letitia Elizabeth Landon, the poet L.E.L., lived and worked on the top floor of 22 Hans Place between 1826 and 1837. She was born at No. 25 in 1802. 22 Hans Place formed the headquarters of the 1921 Irish Treaty delegation. The delegates were Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton, and Michael Collins; Secretary to the delegation was Robert Erskine Childers, who was also Robert Barton's cousin and father of the fourth President of Ireland Erskine Hamilton Childers. At 11.15 PM on 5 December 1921, the delegates made the historic decision to recommend the treaty to the D√°il √âireann; the negotiations finally closed with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty at 2.20am on 6 December 1921. Hans Place was the scene of a murder in 1983, when actor Peter Arne was battered to death in his flat, apparently by an Italian vagrant who committed suicide shortly afterwards. In the south-east corner at 17 Hans Place is the 'Main School' (boys and girls aged 10-13) and headmaster's office of the notable Hill House School, where Prince Charles was a pupil. This address had been the home of George Gribble and Norah Royds, where at least one of their notable children was born, namely Phillip Gribble, according to his 1964 autobiography Off The Cuff. (Other siblings include Phyllis, later Phyllis Fordham of Ashwell Bury; Vivien Gribble, the engraver and illustrator; Lesley, mother of Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm; and Julian Royds Gribble, who won a VC at the end of World War I and died of influenza in a German prison of war camp.) Current Hans Place now represents one of the most sought after residential addresses in Chelsea. International business executives, and the super-rich, are particularly attracted to Hans Place because it is the garden square with the closest proximity to Harrods, and the best shopping in Sloane Street, Chelsea, and Belgravia. Hans Place enjoys some of the highest levels of street security in London, being situated close to two police facilities serving nearby embassies, luxury hotels, and shopping in Knightsbridge and Chelsea and all of the private security arrangements maintained by, and for, Harrods and its customers. The communal garden is in size and contains mature plane, chestnut, and lime trees, and various shrubs. The garden is listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It is not open to the public.

The name of the rifle is derived from Hanyang Arsenal, the main factory that produced this rifle. The rifle was due to be replaced as the standard Chinese rifle by the Chiang Kai-shek rifle. However, manufacture of the new rifle never managed to match demand, and the Type 88 continued to be manufactured and to equip the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. History This firearm was a rifle directly patterned on the German Gewehr 88 and was initially fielded by the New Armies of the Qing Dynasty. From the start of production in 1895, the Type 88 was modified twice to improve performance in 1904 and in 1930.http://hoplite.cn/Templates/hpjh0050.htm It served as one of the standard battle rifles used by the National Revolutionary Army from its founding in 1925 until the late 1940s, after the end of World War II. Japanese forces in China captured large amounts of Hanyang 88s and issued them to second-line units and collaborationist Chinese troops. It was also used by the Chinese Communists, who not only used it during the same time period, but also during the Korean War. Some were reportedly supplied to the Viet Minh. Production of the rifle ceased in 1944, having 1.1 million rifles produced. Initially manufactured at Hanyang Arsenal, production was moved to the 21st Arsenal at Chongqing since the place was captured by Japanese forces in 1938. Further production halted when the Chiang Kai-Shek rifle was instead being produced in 1944. When the rifles were used by the People's Liberation Army, they were either used by militia forces or were used by training/drill rifles.http://surplused.com/rifle-chinese-hanyang-type-88/ Design The Hanyang 88 was essentially a copy of the Gewehr 88, with a few minor differences, including the absence of the barrel shroud, and an extension of the bayonet. It was a bolt-action rifle that cocked on opening, and its Mannlicher-style magazine could hold 5 7.92√ó57mm Mauser rounds.https://loadoutroom.com/thearmsguide/do-you-know-about-the-chinese- hanyang-88/ The magazine was loaded by using a 5-round en-bloc clip. When the last round was chambered, the clip would fall out of the magazine via a hole in the bottom.https://www.wideopenspaces.com/history-hanyang-88/ It can also be equipped with a bayonet. The main advantage of this kind of loading mechanism was that it allowed the user to reload very quickly. The disadvantages, however, were that the hole in the magazine could allow dirt to get in, thus possibly causing reliability issues. In 1904, the rifle's design was changed to remove the barrel shroud and more wood placed on it to protect the person's hands from being burned. Other changes included the rear sight based on the Kar98. Although the 5-round en-bloc clips of Hanyang 88 can accept the new round, mass conversion of Hanyang 88 to accept the spitzer bullet, despite having been planned, did not take place. The Hanyang 88 also had a carbine variant, which was shorter and lighter, albeit with inferior accuracy and range, similarly to the Gewehr 1891 carbine and a short rifle variant. Performance Monument of Hanyang 88 The Hanyang 88 was originally chambered for the German round-nose 7.92√ó57mm I round. By World War I, this round had already become obsolete. Nevertheless, it was the most numerous rifle used by the Chinese National Revolutionary Army in their engagements with the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

As part of the Air Reserve Component of the United States Air Force, the wing is operationally gained by the Air Combat Command. Mission The 144th Fighter Wing's primary federal mission under Title 10 USC is to provide air defense protection for California and the United States from the Mexican border to Oregon utilizing the F-15 Eagle jet fighter aircraft. In its state mission under Title 32 USC, the 144th also supports the nation's Counter Drug Program and responds to state emergencies when requested by the Governor of California. The wing previously flew the F-16C and F-16D Fighting Falcon, having transferred the last F-16C aircraft to the Arizona Air National Guard in November 2013. The wing's current inventory of aircraft includes 21 F-15Cs and F-15Ds and consists of 18 Primary Aircraft Authorized (PAA) and 3 Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) that were previously assigned to the Montana Air National Guard, Missouri Air National Guard and Nellis Air Force Base. The wing also operates one C-26A transport. Units The 144th Fighter Wing is composed of the following units: * 144th Operations Group : 194th Fighter Squadron * 144th Maintenance Group * 144th Mission Support Group * 144th Medical Group. History=World War II Activated in October 1943 as the 372d Fighter Group at Hamilton Field, California. During World War II, the squadron was an Operational Training Unit (OTU), equipped with second-line P-39 Airacobras and P-40 Warhawks. Its mission was to train newly graduated pilots from Training Command in combat tactics and maneuvers before being assigned to their permanent combat unit. Initially assigned to IV Fighter Command, then transferred to III Fighter Command in 1944, being re-equipped with P-51D Mustangs. It took part in air-ground maneuvers and demonstrations, participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers in the summer of 1944 and in similar activities in the US until after V-J Day. Inactivated in November 1945. California Air National Guard F-51D-30-NA Mustang, AF Ser. No. 44-74825, flying over Northern California, 1948 The wartime 372d Fighter Group was re- activated and re-designated as the 144th Fighter Group, and was allotted to the California Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, and was extended federal recognition on 2 June 1948 by the National Guard Bureau. The 144th Fighter Group was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 372d Fighter Group and all predecessor units. The Group was assigned to the California ANG's 61st Fighter Wing. Upon activation, operational squadrons of the 144th Fighter Group were: * 191st Fighter Squadron, Utah Air National Guard, Salt Lake City Municipal Airport, Salt Lake City, Utah * 192d Fighter Squadron, Nevada Air National Guard, Hubbard Field, Las Vegas, Nevada * 194th Fighter Squadron, California Air National Guard, Naval Air Station Alameda, California, The three squadrons were all re-designations of the 372d Fighter Group's operational squadrons during World War II. All were initially equipped with F-51D Mustangs, with a mission of air defense of their respective states. Hayward Air National Guard Base, California, 1953, F-51H Mustangs. =144th Fighter Wing= In 1949, the 144th and its assigned 194th Fighter Squadron moved from NAS Alameda to the former Hayward Army Airfield, designated as Hayward Air National Guard Base. At the end of October 1950, the Air National Guard converted to the wing-base (Hobson Plan) organization. As a result, the 61st Fighter Wing was withdrawn from the California ANG and inactivated on 31 October 1950. The 144th Fighter Wing was established by the National Guard Bureau, allocated to the state of California, recognized and activated 1 November 1950, assuming the personnel, equipment and mission of the inactivated 61st Fighter Wing. The 144th Fighter Group was assigned to the new wing as its operational group with the three fighter squadrons. =Air Defense Mission= 194th FIS F-86L Sabre Interceptors, 1960 With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the tactical air forces lack of readiness due to postwar force reductions and greater emphasis on the Strategic Air Command nuclear mission in the active Air Force, most of the Air National Guard was federalized and placed on active duty. The squadrons of the 144th Fighter Group were retained by the Air National Guard and not deployed, however numerous pilots from all three of the group's squadrons volunteered for combat duty. The F-51Ds were exchanged for F-51H Mustangs in 1951, as the \\"D\\" model of the Mustang was needed for close air support missions in Korea. The F-51H was a Very Long Range version of the Mustang, which was developed to escort B-29 Superfortress bombers to Japan, but not considered rugged enough to be used in Korea. The increased range, however, was well-suited for air defense interceptor alert flights. During its years with the P-51H, the unit earned prominence as one of the Air Force's most respected aerial gunnery competitors. In June 1953, while still flying the Mustang, the unit qualified for the first all-jet, worldwide gunnery meet. Using borrowed F-86A Sabre jets, the 144th, which 194th FIS F-106 Delta Dart, AF Ser. No. 59-0136 194th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron McDonnell F-4D-26-MC Phantom II, AF Ser. No. 65-0588, now on static display at Fresno Air National Guard Base. With the increased availability of jet aircraft after the Korean War, the squadron's aircraft were upgraded from the piston-engine, propeller driven F-51H to its first jet aircraft, the F-86A Sabre Day Interceptor in 1954. At the same time, the 194th relocated to Fresno Air Terminal, followed by the wing in 1957. On 7 July 1955, the 144th was re-designated as the 194th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, a designation kept by the squadron for the next 37 years. With the F-86A, the 144th began standing dusk-to-dawn alerts, joining its active duty Air Defense Command (ADC) counterparts, with ADC operationally gaining the 144th within the active U.S. Air Force under Title 10 USC. The 194th continued to fly the F-86A until 31 March 1958. On 1 April 1958, the transition was made to the F-86L Sabre Interceptor, which was designed from the onset as an interceptor, had all-weather capability and was able to be used in all weather. In addition, the F-86L could be controlled and directed by the SAGE computer-controlled Ground Control Interceptor (Radar) sites which would vector the aircraft to the unidentified target for interception. In 1958, the Nevada and Utah Air National Guard were authorized to expand to a Group level. The 152d Fighter-Interceptor Group, Nevada ANG, was federally recognized on 19 April 1958; the 151st Fighter-Interceptor Group, Utah ANG, on 1 July 1958. With Nevada and Utah forming their own command and control structure, command and control of the 191st and 192d FIS were transferred to their state organizations. On 1 July 1964, the 194th began flying the F-102A Delta Dagger, a Mach 1.25 supersonic interceptor. In January 1968, Air Defense Command was renamed Aerospace Defense Command, and continued to maintain operational responsibility. On 25 July 1974, the 194th retired the F-102 and brought the improved F-106 Delta Dart into service, continuing to fly this aircraft until 31 December 1983. On 1 October 1978 Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated, its units being reassigned to Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), a sub-element of Tactical Air Command (TAC), with ADTAC being established as compatible to a Numbered Air Force under TAC. TAC later replaced the aging F-106s on 1 January 1984 with F-4D Phantom IIs for use in the air defense interceptor mission. On 6 December 1985, ADTAC was disestablished and its role and responsibilities assumed by the reestablished First Air Force, a TAC organization which assumed operational oversight for all Air National Guard fighter units assigned to the air defense role. =Modern era= The 144th Fighter-Interceptor Wing received their first F-16A Fighting Falcons in October 1989. These were of the block 15 type, replacing the F-4D in the air defense and attack roles. The block 15 aircraft were not ideally suited to the squadron's dedicated air defense mission. This was remedied when the aircraft received the Air Defense Fighter (ADF) upgrade in 1990. Effective 16 March 1992, the 144th Fighter-Interceptor Wing was re- designated as the 144th Fighter Wing (144 FW), with all related Fighter Interceptor Groups and Squadrons becoming Fighter Groups and Fighter Squadrons. On 1 June 1992, following the disestablishment of Tactical Air Command (TAC), the 144 FW was reassigned to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC) under First Air Force. 194th Fighter Squadron General Dynamics F-16C Block 25E Fighting Falcon, AF Ser. No. 84-1376, flying over the Sierra Nevada with four AIM-120 missiles on an Operation Noble Eagle mission in 2002 During this time the 194th Fighter Squadron also had an alert detachment at George AFB in Victorville, California. George AFB was closed in 1992 due to BRAC action as part of the overall downsizing of the US military after the Cold War and the alert detachment moved to March Air Force Base, since renamed as March Air Reserve Base due to a later BRAC action. In 1995, the squadron transitioned to the more capable F-16C Fighting Falcon Block 25 aircraft. The 144th Fighter Wing was the busiest dedicated air defense wing in the country during 1999, with deployments to eight countries and more than a half-dozen states. Combat training had many highlights throughout the year. Fifty wing members deployed five F-16s to Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, to participate in the Navy's annual joint combat training exercise. Members of the unit also traveled to Tyndall AFB, Florida for Combat Archer which provided an opportunity for live fire weapons training. To top off the year, six dozen members and six aircraft deployed to Nellis AFB, Nevada between 24 October and 7 November for Red Flag. During the opening minutes of the exercise, a 144th Fighter Wing four-ship flight executed a simulated kill against four actual MiG-29s. These were the first-ever MiG-29 kills in a Red Flag exercise. Also in 1999, the 144th Civil Engineering Squadron's Fire Department deployed to Sheppard AFB, Texas for training, and 44 members of the 144th Services Flight trained at Tyndall AFB, Florida. Fifty-five members of the 144th Medical Squadron received medical readiness training at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Michigan. As the F-16 Block 25 aircraft came to the end of their operational lifespan, the 194th Fighter Squadron began to receive F-16C Block 32 aircraft in December 2006. All aircraft were replaced with Block 32 variants by the end of 2007. The 144th Fighter Wing started the conversion process to F-15C Eagles from the 120th Fighter Wing of the Montana Air National Guard with the arrival of the first of 21 F-15s on 18 June 2013.http://www.fresnobee.com/2013/06/18/3348931/that-new-sound-over-fresno- is.html The last F-16 departed the 144th Fighter Wing on 7 November 2013, destined for 162nd Fighter Wing.
