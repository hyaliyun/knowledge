Life History Kenneth Ross was born in Oklahoma, but spent most of his childhood living with his uncle in Colorado. He lied about his age to join the US Army. His first posting was in Williams, Arizona. As part of his Army service, he fought against Pancho Villa. During his time in the Army, Ross was fortunate enough to work with the Marconi radios utilized by the Signal Corps. Shortly after the completion of his military service, Ross moved to Chicago where he founded the Ross Manufacturing Company. Its primary product was the production and installation of radio components and systems. Customers included such notables as the P.K. Wrigley family. While installing a custom made radio system in their Chicago home, he met his future wife Gudrun Saetveit, a concert pianist providing instruction to the Wrigley children. Kenneth Ross was an aviation enthusiast, who counted Charles Lindbergh as one of his friends. Ross owned several airplanes throughout his life. He was killed on July 12, 1959 in Durango, Colorado after the airplane he was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff. Business The Ross Manufacturing Company employed approximately 500 people. In order to satisfy the communications demands of Allied Forces during World War II, Ross converted one of his plants in Chicago to a facility for making FT-243 crystal units. Ross developed a process to automatically and accurately tune the FT-243 quartz crystals in a shorter time while using far less labor. Prior to the development of his process, all crystals had to be polished by hand in order to ensure proper tuning. As a result, his factory was able to produce more high quality radio crystals faster than most other companies in the US. Ross never patented the process. It was shared freely with other radio crystal manufacturers as he deemed it his patriotic duty.Bottom, V: \\"A History of the Quartz Crystal Industry in the USA\\" , Proceedings of the 35th Annual Frequency Control Symposium, pp.3-12, 1981 Ross produced a short technical film detailing each step in the process, making it possible for others to easily copy it. His production method had a direct impact on the improved reliability of radio communications in both European and Asian theaters of war.

The term was first coined by the National Association of Sessional GPs (NASGP), who at the time were called the National Association of Non-Principals (NANP). After consultation with their membership, it was perceived that the term 'non-principal' (which referred to any GP who wasn't a GP principal or partner) was a term that defined these GPs using a negative definition rather than a positive one. A sessional GP therefore is any GP working as a locum GP or as a salaried GP, and also includes GPs on the returner scheme, and GP retainees. A locum, is a fully qualified general practitioner who does not have a standard employment contract with the primary care health centre where they work. They are paid by the session, as a difference to the other two types of contractual relationship in a GP practice, salaried GPs and GP partners. Locum GPs are often self-employed professionals, therefore not entitled to sick leave, holiday pay or redundancy compensation. They obtain work by contracting their services directly with health centres or through temporary staff recruitment agencies. Recent changes in the regulations in United Kingdom allow them to form Limited Liability Companies, although by doing so forfeit the right to contribute income through that company to the NHS superannuation scheme. Locum GPs typically cover permanent doctors when on sick leave, maternity leave or holiday and fill the gaps between the moment a doctor leaves a practice and another permanent doctor is recruited. They also may be hired to increase the workforce during periods of high demand. Although locum GPs are usually contracted to cover temporary needs, it is not uncommon to find locum GPs working in health centres for long periods of time, sometimes even years. A typical session in United Kingdom is equivalent to 4 hours and 10 minutes of work, and frequently involves 2 to 2.5 hours of face to face contact with patients in 10 minutes appointments, followed by time for administration (reviewing correspondence from the hospital, reviewing blood test results, writing referral letters, triaging patients' calls‚Ä¶) and doing home visits. Nowadays, some locum GPs are employed to undertake face to face consultations on 2 to 3 hours surgeries. In order to practice as a sessional GP, the doctor must be a fully qualified GP and must prove that they maintain and updates their skills and knowledge to the same standard as any other GP. Some GPs choose to practice as sessional doctors to allow them to meet other personal commitments, for example, mothers with small children, while for others it is a lifestyle choice. There are an estimated 22,500 doctors in the UK working as sessional GPs. In 2011 a report suggested the demand for such physicians is expected to increase as National Health Service reforms come into effect. In 2002, the NASGP developed the locum chambers concept, also referred to as a 'virtual practice', within which locum GPs work together as a collaborative team to support each other, rather than as conventional locum GPs who effectively compete with each other. Resources are all pooled, enabling the chambers to employ staff to support appraisal activities, educational events and organising work. The first chambers to become established was Pallant Medical Chambers in 2004, followed by Yorkshire Medical Chambers in 2008.

In March 2011, the RMBF convened a high level meeting in London with representatives from the British Medical Association, Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), Departments of Health from all four UK countries, and other GP representative organisations. As the outcome of that meeting, the RCGP agreed to take on the baton from the RMBF to reduce sessional GP isolation.

The diocese was created by Pope John Paul II on December 7, 2002 by virtue of his Apostolic Constitution Animarum Utilitati, and was canonically erected on January 16, 2003 from the Archdiocese of Manila. The diocese previously existed as the Ecclesiastical District of Quezon City-North, which was renamed the District of Novaliches in 2002. As of September 2018, the diocese is composed of 70 full-fledged parishes (five of which are diocesan shrines) and one mission area, clustered into twelve vicariates. Its titular seat or patron is Jesus, the Good Shepherd, after the cathedral or seat of the diocese, the Archdiocesan Shrine and Cathedral-Parish of the Good Shepherd.  Territorial Jurisdiction  The diocese comprises the northern part of Caloocan City and the northern part of Quezon City, starting from Tandang Sora Avenue leading northward and comprising District 2 (all barangays), District 5 (all barangays), Barangay Matandang Balara (from District 3), and some barangays in District 6, namely: Pasong Tamo, Sauyo, and Talipapa, including portions of Tandang Sora and Culiat found north across Tandang Sora Avenue. Emeritus Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani, resigned Bishop Antonio R. Tobias History The history of the Diocese of Novaliches can be traced to the creation of the town of Novaliches in the 1800s during the Spanish colonization period in the Philippines. General Manuel Pav√≠a was named Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. He arrived in Manila in 1854 with the task of establishing a penal colony where prisoners would be granted lands they would develop in exchange for their release. The colony was given the name Hacienda Tala since the once heavily- forested area became identical to one where a star (‚Äútala‚Äù) had fallen after clearing. This hacienda grew into a larger community that eventually merged with the haciendas of Malinta and Piedad in forming the independent town of Novaliches on January 26, 1856. Novaliches (which present-day area is now shared by Quezon City and Caloocan City) became part of the Province of Bulacan until 1858, when it was annexed to the Province of Manila. The name Novaliches came from the name of a small village 60 kilometers away from the city of Valencia, Spain that was awarded to General Pav√≠a, who was given the title Marqu√©s of Novaliches by Queen Isabella II in 1840 for having defended her from the claims of her uncle Prince Carlos during the First Carlist War (1833-1839). Soon after the establishment of the new town, Manila Archbishop Jos√© Juli√°n de Aranguren, O.A.R. decreed the creation of its parish on September 24, 1856. The chapel of the Corpus Christi was elevated to the status of a parroquia (parish church) and Fray Andres Martin, O.S.A., an Augustinian priest from Spain, was appointed as the first parish priest. The parish church was dedicated in honor of Nuestra Senora de la Merced (Our Lady of Mercy). However, the church was burned during the Philippine Revolution of 1896, and the assigned Augustinian priests returned to Spain. The parcel of land where the parroquia once stood was donated to the Archdiocese of Manila. In 1899, Novaliches ceded its township to the Municipality of Caloocan. It was in 1928 when the parish was restored with the appointment of a diocesan parish priest, Father Victor Raymundo. In 1962, following the canonical erection of the Dioceses of Imus and Malolos from the Archdiocese of Manila, the Our Lady of Mercy Parish stood as the only existing parish in the area now belonging to the Diocese of Novaliches. Before Cardinal Santos' death in 1973, a new parish was erected: the Our Lady of Fatima Parish in Urduja Village, Caloocan City. The growth of the Catholic faith in the area would be evidenced by the establishment of parishes in Fairview (1975), Lagro (1977), and Bagbag (1978) - which took place during the early years of leadership of Manila Archbishop Jaime L. Cardinal Sin. Cardinal Sin divided Quezon City into four vicariates on December 3, 1974. These are the Vicariates of Santa Rita, Holy Family, Saint Joseph, and Santo Nino. Our Lady of Mercy Parish was placed under the Vicariate of Santo Nino, along with parishes of Santo Ni√±o (Bagobantay), Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Project 6), Our Lady of Perpetual Help (Project 8), and Our Lady of Hope (Pag-Asa), which presently belong to the Diocese of Cubao. On August 10, 1987, the Ecclesiastical District of Quezon City was divided into two: Quezon City-North and Quezon City-South. The new Ecclesiastical District of Quezon City-North comprised the Vicariates of Good Shepherd, Our Lady of Mercy, Ascension of Our Lord, and Saint Joseph, although some parishes belonging to the present-day Diocese of Novaliches were still belonging to the Vicariate of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in the southern district at that time. Following the appointment of Quezon City-North District Bishop Francisco Claver, S.J. as Apostolic Vicar of Bontoc-Lagawe, Manila Auxiliary Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani was designated by Cardinal Sin to head the two districts of KALMANA (Kalookan-Malabon-Navotas) and Quezon City-North. Bishop Bacani designated Fr. Alfonso Bugaoan, Jr., parish priest of Saint Joseph Parish in Project 3, as his Episcopal Vicar for Quezon City-North. The Ecclesiastical District of Quezon City-North was renamed District of Novaliches on March 15, 2002, in preparation for the creation of new dioceses in Metro Manila as response to the growing number of Catholic faithful. Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Novaliches on December 7, 2002 by virtue of the Apostolic Constitution Animarum Utilitati and appointed Bacani as its first residential bishop. This news was announced by Cardinal Sin during a conference of the clergy and lay leaders held at Villa San Miguel in Mandaluyong City. The decree also declared that the episcopal seat of the new Diocese would be the Archdiocesan Shrine and Parish of the Good Shepherd along Regalado Avenue, Fairview, Quezon City. The episcopal seat serves as the residence of the Bishop and the center of all activities in the Diocese. In solemn rites held at the Good Shepherd Parish-Shrine on January 16, 2003, the new Diocese of Novaliches was canonically erected, with the Most Reverend Teodoro C. Bacani, D.D. being installed as its first bishop, coinciding his 63rd birthday. He named Father Gerardo Giovanni Tapiador as the diocese's first Vicar-General, Fr. Fr. Jaime Lara as Chancellor, and Fr. James Gaa as Oeconomus or treasurer. Bishop Bacani led the beginnings of the pastoral commissions or ministries in the diocese through the involvement of active lay members of the Council of the Laity of Novaliches (CLaN), which he created on March 21, 2003. These lay leaders represented the different sectors of the Church active since the time of the Ecclesiastical District of Quezon City- North. On May 8, 2003, Bishop Bacani left a legacy of establishing the first parish under the new diocese - Santa Krus Parish in Bagumbong, Caloocan City. However, Bishop Bacani resigned in June 2003. San Fernando, La Union Bishop Antonio Tobias, who served as Apostolic Administrator in Bacani's absence from June to November of that year, was named second bishop of Novaliches. He was installed at the Good Shepherd Cathedral on January 26, 2004 in the presence of Cardinal Sin, Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Antonio Franco, and Manila Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales. Bishop Tobias convened the first Diocesan Pastoral Assembly on March 11‚Äì12, 2005, during which the Diocesan Pastoral Thrust, Direction, and Vision-Mission Statement were designed along with the Diocesan Hymn and Parish Pastoral Council (PPC) Guidelines. From having 50 pioneer parishes in 2003 (with Santa Krus Parish in Bagumbong being the first to be established under the new diocese - by decree of Bishop Teodoro Bacani), the diocese has now 70 full-fledged parishes and 1 mission area.

It was the organ of the Breton National Party and was strongly associated with collaborationist politics during World War II. Origins In July 1940, after the Fall of France, the pro-German Breton nationalists Fran√ßois Debeauvais and Olier Mordrel called the Congress of Pontivy, at which they created the Breton National Committee to coordinate Breton nationalist projects. The committee decided to found the weekly newspaper L'Heure Bretonne. The first issue was symbolically dated 14 July (Bastille Day) 1940. The paper was in practice a continuation of the nationalists' earlier journal Breiz Atao.Piette, Gwenno (2000) Breton Literature During the German Occupation (1940-1944) Reflections of Collaboration?, presented at University of Ulster, Coleraine, at a conference on the theme of ‚ÄòCeltic Literature in the 20th Century‚Äô Publication The newspaper was published in Rennes in the headquarters of the Breton National Committee. 201 issues were published between July 1940 and June 1944. Morvan Lebesque was its first editor, for two months in 1940. He later said he left when it became obvious that the Committee wanted the paper to pursue a pro- Nazi line. He was followed as editor by Jean Merrien, a close associate of Olier Mordrel, who left when Mordrel was ousted from the leadership of the Breton National Party. By 1942 L'Heure Bretonne had a circulation of about 25,000 and employed fifty members of staff at its offices in Rennes. In August 1940, some nationalists selling L'Heure Bretonne were detained at Quimper by the Germans, but after this incident, the paper was published and circulated without problems until June 4, 1944. Its editorial line was consistent with German propaganda. It attacked Jews, leftist \\"Jacobins\\" and the English. However, it also attacked the French in general, on behalf of the \\"Breton race \\", and new \\"Aryan\\" Europe in which the Bretons would take an active role. Content The content of the newspaper reflects its intransigent separatist politics and repeated challenge to the Vichy government. The newspaper took particular care to avoid offending the German occupying forces. However it did not adopt explicitly Nazi ideological rhetoric, despite its solidarity with Germany's war effort, with weekly articles recounting the exploits of the Wehrmacht in Russia. The attitude of the paper was expressed by former communist Abeozen in November 1940: > I would rather clasp vigorously the hand of the passers-by, singing their > conquest song, and stare right into their eyes without the least hatred. > Because I have sound reasons for believing that the conquerors of the West > will not hinder us in the slightest in the success of our task : to build a > New Brittany on the ruins of the old World. The main themes addressed by the newspaper are the history of Brittany, the misdeeds of Vichy France and a repeated and extreme Anglophobia. It also covered daily life in Brittany, with articles on the peasantry, crafts, modern Breton design, and so on. Antisemitism Following the mass arrest of Jews in Paris known as the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup on 16 and 17 July 1942, L'Heure Bretonne published a front page article entitled √Ä la porte les juifs et les enjuiv√©s (\\"Show Jews and the Judaized the Door\\") under the signature \\"DR\\" (No. 105, July 18, 1942). In the same vein, Job Jaffr√©, under his pseudonym \\"Tug\\", published a denunciation of the bombings committed by the forces of \\"youtre- Atlantique\\", a wordplay on \\"outre-Atlantique\\" (\\"over the Atlantic\\") and \\"youtre\\", a derogatory term for \\"Jew\\" (April 1943, No. 142). Later in the same year, he wrote that he expected a \\"reversal of alliance... when the Jewish problem has been eliminated\\" (October 1943, No. 171, under the initials St. K.)

Manuel del Rosario was installed by Archbishop Salvatore Siino, the papal nuncio, as the first bishop of the Diocese. He was succeeded by Cirilo R. Almario in 1977 and died on October 14, 2016. While Rolando Tirona, who is now the Archbishop of Caceres, became the third bishop in 1996.

Bulacan Province which lies in the Central Plains of Luzon, or Region III. Bulacan is bounded by Nueva Ecija on the north, Aurora (Dingalan) on the northeast, Quezon (General Nakar) on the east, Rizal (Rodriguez) on the southeast, Metro Manila (Valenzuela City, Malabon City, Navotas City, Caloocan City and Quezon City) on the south, Manila Bay on the southwest, and Pampanga on the west. The province of Bulacan is rich in rice, in fruits and in poultry and fishpond production. Other products are sugar and corn. Historically, Bulacan, together with other Central Luzon provinces, was among the first to take up arms against Spanish authorities. It played an important role in the Philippine Revolution of 1896. When the capital of the new Republic was moved from Bacoor in Cavite to Malolos in Bulacan, the First Revolutionary Congress met at the Barasoain Church, a landmark in Philippine history, to draft the first constitution of the First Philippine Republic. And on January 21, 1899 Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the First Philippine Republic, promulgated what is now known as the Malolos Constitution. It was the first important Filipino document to come out of people's representation. Prior to the creation of the Diocese of Malolos, it is part of Archdiocese of Manila as Vicaria de La Inmaculada Concepcion or Vicaria dela Provincia de Bulacan with Malolos Church as the headquarters of Vicariate of Bulacan comprising the whole Province of Bulacan but later the province was divided into two vicariates, other one is for Franciscan riconandas of Meycauayan including Polo (now Valenzuela City) The Diocese of Malolos was created upon the Papal Bull \\"Christi Fidelium\\" November 25, 1961 and it was officially opened on March 11, 1962, the Malolos Church became Cathedral and the site of the canonical installation of the first resident bishop of Malolos, Most Reverend Manuel del Rosario, D.D. For Malolos, it was a new chapter in its already fabled history. It was the late Pope John XXIII who created the Diocese of Malolos as a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Manila. In the celebration, Bishop del Rosario was installed by Archbishop Salvatore Siino, then papal nuncio to the Philippines. In Guiguinto, Bulacan town, the Immaculate Conception Minor Seminary The seminary, considered the nucleus potential of the diocese, has become the alma mater of two hundred and fifty priests who have now assumed responsible positions in the diocese and its 100 plus parishes. The seminary has grown to include new buildings for a college seminary, a formation institute, and theology school. A few years later two auxiliary bishops were assigned to Malolos: Most Reverend Leopoldo Arcaira who arrived in 1966, then Most Reverend Ricardo Vidal. When Monsignor Vidal was elevated to the position of archbishop and was assigned to Lipa, Pope Paul VI gave Malolos a young and energetic prelate, Most Reverend Cirilo R. Almario, Jr. He became the bishop of Malolos from December 15, 1977 up to January 20, 1996. The third bishop is the former auxiliary bishop of Manila, Most Rev. Rolando Tria Tirona, OCD, a Carmelite Discalced. He started his episcopacy on the December, 1996.

In June and July 1987, Bishop Cirilo Almario convened the First Diocesan Synod of Malolos. It had for its theme: \\"To Prepare for the Lord a Perfect People.\\" Together with the priests and the Christian faithful of the province the Synod formulated its own vision-mission statement. To fulfill its mission, a restructuring of the diocesan organization was called for in line with the spirit of Vatican II. The Second Synod of the Diocese was convened by Most Rev. Jose F. Oliveros, DD. It was held from April 8 to April 13, 2016.

Bulacan: One of the bastion of early christian missions in Luzon 1572‚Äì1581 The present territory of the Diocese of Malolos historically traces to the early catholic missions as of 1572 of the Spanish Missionaries promulgated primarily by the Order of Saint Augustine (OSA) and secondarily in 1578 upon the arrival of the Order of Franciscan Minor (OFM) in the present day Province of Bulacan which was one of the earliest catholic missions in the Philippines 440 years ago. CALUMPIT (1572) : Although it was established by Don Miguel de Legaspi and Martin de Goiti as Encomienda under Conquistador Sargento Mayor Juan Moron on November 14, 1571, it was christiniazed by Fray Diego Ordo√±ez de Vivar only in April 1572 where the Augustinians first arrived at Meyto and made it ministerios of Tondo but classified as semi-convent para cathequezar the east-west Pampanga and north- western Bulacan on May 3, 1572. They built a parish and convent under the patronage of San Nicolas de Tolentino with Fray Diego de Hererra as Prior but later replaced by Fray Martin de Rada, the prior provincial itself.

On January 24, 1983, during his Angelus message, Pope John Paul II announced the creation of the Diocese of Antipolo, which would encompass the whole province of Rizal, the entire Marikina City, and part of Pasig City (Barangays Dela Paz, Santolan, Manggahan, Rosario, and Santa Lucia, which altogether formed the Vicariate of Santo Tomas de Villanueva, now belonging to the Diocese of Pasig). It is an area that was previously known in the Archdiocese of Manila as the Ecclesiastical District of Eastern Rizal. The diocese was canonically established on the June 25, 1983 and is a suffragan of the said archdiocese. The first bishop of Antipolo was the late Most Rev. Protacio G. Gungon. On December 3, 2001, he was succeeded by Most Rev. Crisostomo Yalung as the second bishop, followed by Most Rev. Gabriel V. Reyes, former Bishop of Kalibo in Aklan, as the third bishop. Bishop Reyes was assisted by the then-auxiliary and later coadjutor bishop, Most Rev. Francisco M. De Leon, who was named his successor and fourth bishop effective September 10, 2016. The diocese had its First Diocesan Synod in 1993 held at Saint Michael's Retreat House in Antipolo City. The diocese has experienced some jurisdictional changes since the time the Diocese of Pasig was created, whereby six parishes within the civil boundaries of Pasig City were given to the new local church, together with seven diocesan priests serving in them. At present, the Diocese of Antipolo is considered to be one of the largest local churches in the Philippines in terms of its Catholic population. Among the 86 ecclesiastical jurisdictions present in the Philippines today, the diocese is the third largest local church in terms of its Catholic population after the Archdiocese of Cebu, and the Diocese of Malolos (Bulacan and Valenzuela City). The population of the whole area covering the diocese is 3,650,000, of which 3,280,000 (or 90%) are Catholics. The seat or center of the diocese is the Antipolo Cathedral, one of the most popular Marian shrines in the country where the historic Canonically crowned image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz y Buen Viaje) (the Virgin of Antipolo) is enshrined.

It serves as a transatlantic equivalent to the earlier British sitcom of the same name. Synopsis Set in Indianapolis, Indiana the show starred Rob Schneider, Ron Eldard and Justine Bateman. Kevin (Eldard) and Jamie (Schneider) were college buddies sharing an apartment and living out a second childhood, much to the chagrin of Kevin's girlfriend Sarah (Bateman). Brenda (Dina Spybey) was an upstairs neighbor that Jamie flirted with. Eldard and Bateman left after the first season, amid rumors that they clashed with Schneider and the show's producers. They were replaced by Ken Marino and Jenica Bergere, and Spybey was promoted from recurring to series regular.

The first season ran for 22 episodes. Altogether 13 episodes were completed for the second season, albeit with Schneider as the sole original member in the main cast. Only six of those completed episodes ever aired during the initial run because of dropping ratings and steep competition from CBS's Top 10 hit Touched by an Angel, Fox's Top 20 hit The Simpsons, and ABC's Top 40 hit The Wonderful World of Disney‚Äîall of which were more family-friendly programs.

Starring Bertille No√´l-Bruneau, Isabelle Carr√© and Thomas Lalibert√©. The English version of the film is narrated by Kate Winslet. Plot A young girl who's about 10 years old lives in a farmhouse in the Jura mountains in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a fox hunting. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. During the following months, the girl spends most of her free time in the forest trying to find the fox, but she doesn't meet it again until winter arrives. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks. She is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for foxholes and waits for the fox, who she eventually names Lily. The fox has young babies and moves from one foxhole to another because of the girl's inquisitiveness; so the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. The girl finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox comes to her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through the brittle plate glass window, shattering the glass. The fox is hurt badly but survives. The girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and are not possessions. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) replace this scene with an illustration.

In addition to public information available to all investors, securities analysts also have access to non-public information which the vast majority of investors do not possess. Trading based on such non-public information can be considered illegal if the information is also material, as defined by insider trading law. However, by gathering various non-material information, often from sources at or close to the issuing corporation, an analyst can draw useful conclusions about the current and future health of the company, allowing them to profit from transacting in shares of its stock and related derivative contracts. However, extrapolating conclusions from a \\"mosiac\\" of such bits of non-public information can be vague, sometimes leading analysts to false conclusions about the corporation. Security analysts then have to sort through the data collected and make recommendations to their clients or keep the information to themselves to use later for personal profit based on determining the underlying value of a company's securities. Seal of the United States Securities and Exchange CommissionSince the Commission's Fair Disclosure rule (Reg FD) was enacted, the viability of the mosaic theory has been retained within the United States under the Securities and Exchange Commission[2]. Broadly speaking, the SEC requires public corporations to register their stock sales and protects investors in the municipal securities markets. Though it was not created by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it has placed a judicially imposed limitation on the information gathered by insider trading. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deems that there is illegal insider trading, they can freeze assets tied to the company's shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission explains that this nonpublic information, known as research to the security analysts, isn't banned from ‚Äúdisclosing a non- material piece of information to an analyst, even if, unbeknownst to the issuer, that piece helps the analyst complete a \\"mosaic\\" of information that, taken together, is material‚Äù[3]. The SEC constantly are evaluating trends and when unknown traders purchase equity call options that are millions of dollars. The SEC can also freeze accounts on suspicion of illegal insider trading when the accuracy and validity of information may be incorrect within the marketplace. This had led to the legality of insider trading laws to be under intense scrutiny. Though it is legal under the United States Federal insider laws to utilize the mosaic information that is obtained by a securities analyst, it must be within the guidelines of the confidentiality that the company or corporation created. For most companies within the United States and do business with the United States, these guidelines of confidentiality are required. Some of the controls that have mitigated the potential of illegal trading within the mosaic theory include the interactions between a company and consultants, notification in connection with approved consultants, remaining alert to potential issues, compliance oversight, information barriers, and being within the SEC guidelines. These guidelines have made companies more transparent with their financial stability to the general public. Under insider trading laws, analysts may not use material non- public information to help select their trades. But traders might be able to piece together non-material non-public information and material public information into a mosaic, which may increase in value when properly compiled and documented. The theory is also referred to more colloquially as the scuttlebutt method by Philip Fisher in Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. Mosaic theory involves collecting information from different sources, public and private, to calculate the value of security. Applying the mosaic theory is as much art as it is science. An analyst gleans as many pieces of information as possible, determines if they tell a story that makes sense, and decides whether to recommend a trade. It is also a legal theory used to uphold the classification of information, holding that a collection of unclassified information might add up into a classified whole.[7][8] The theory has also been applied to legal reasoning in the context of the Fourth Amendment where the continuous use of GPS surveillance was found to violate the subject's \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\".  Legality of the Mosaic Theory  Though the Supreme Court recognized the legality of the Mosaic Theory in Dirks v. SEC, the concerns have arisen with the potential of illegal insider trading happening within analysts. Analysts can take advantage of vague insider trading laws and this brings of the legality of it. Securities analysts can obtain non disclosed information from company insiders that an average investor cannot. Under insider trading law, this advantage is an unlawful method. To combat this issue, confidentiality agreements as well as operating under internal policy guidelines are in place. Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 falls under the category when unknown traders purchase equity call options that are millions of dollars. The mosaic theory relies heavily on the U.S. economy's fluctuation and stock market. Without public corporations being transparent, the mosaic theory would be ineffective and the stock market would be vulnerable to sudden shifts as hidden information comes out. Thus, it is illegal for Unites States public companies to not be transparent with their corporate profitability.  Court Cases  In May 2011, US District Judge Richard J. Howell sentenced Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, to eleven years in prison who was found guilty of fourteen counts of insider trading. During the high-profile trial of investor Raj Rajaratnam, defense attorneys used the mosaic theory to argue against allegations of insider trading. These arguments were ultimately unsuccessful. Though it was ten years shorter than the requested amount of time, it constitutes as the longest prison sentence given to an insider trading case. Under the Securities Exchange Acts15 USC ¬ß78j(b) and 17 CFR ¬ß240.10b-5, Rajaratnam and other Galleon traders were convicted with fraud and conspiracy. They profited tens of millions of dollars of insider trading and based their arguments off of the mosaic theory. So far, this is the only court case that has used the mosaic theory in court to validate insider trading in the court of law.

It is famous as the birthplace of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown in the early eighteenth century. Landmarks Kirkharle Hall was a country house at Kirkharle, the former seat of the Loraine family, now much reduced and in use as a farmhouse. The estate church is dedicated to St Wilfrid (634-709AD) and is Grade 1 listed, with most of the building dating from 1336. A mile to the north of Kirkharle is Little Harle Tower, an 18th and 19th century mansion which incorporates a 15th or 16th century pele tower.Little Harle Tower at British Listed Buildings Online Kirkharle Courtyard now operates as a Visitor Centre focusing on Capability Brown.  Religious sites  Before the village gained the kirk (church) element it was called Herle (recorded 1177)The Place-names of Northumberland and Durham, Cambridge University Press, pp. 128 . Herle comes from the Old English \\"Herela-lea\\" which means \\"Herela's Grove\\" or \\"herg-leah\\" which means \\"temple-grove\\", a place of worship for the pre-Christian Angles.Beckensall, Stan. 'Northumbrian Place-Names: A Guide To The Meaning of Town And Village Names'. Butler Publishing 2004. . Page 37 Other early forms included Kyrkeherle (c.1250), Kyrkherll (1346) and Kirkehirle (1428). The current church, dedicated to St Wilfrid, was built in the fourteenth century. Among the quaint epitaphs in the church upon departed Loraines is the following: > Here lyes the Body of Richard Loraine, Esq., who was a proper handsome man > of good sense and behaviour : he dy'd a Batcheler of an Appoplexy walking in > a green field near London, October 26th, 1738, in the 38 Year of his Age. The Loraine Baronets acquired it by marriage the manor from the De Harles who owned it in the 14th century, and derived their name (literally \\"of Harle\\") from the village.The surnames of Scotland: their origin, meaning, and history, George Fraser Black, New York Public Library, 1946, P.344 In 1836 the Loraine family sold Kirkharle and the main house was pulled down.  Lancelot 'Capability' Brown  Kirkharle's most famous son is Capability Brown the notable landscape gardener. Lancelot ‚ÄòCapability‚Äô Brown (bapt.1716 -1783) was born in Kirkharle and baptised in St Wilfrid's Church, Kirkharle, on 30 August 1716. His actual birthdate is not known. He was the fifth of the six children of William Brown, a yeoman farmer and Ursula, n√©e Hall, who had also worked in the big house on the Kirkharle estate. Lancelot attended the village school in nearby Cambo until the age of 16. In 1732, the young Brown began work at the Kirkharle estate, learning many skills in gardening, planting & land reclamation, leaving to further his career in 1739. Sir William Loraine, 4th Baronet, inherited the estate in 1755 aged 6 & when he came of age, Brown produced a design plan for him to replace the early C18th formal gardens with a more naturalistic landscape, probably around 1770. Brown's scheme included single trees, tree belts, a serpentine lake & a new approach, but was only partially implemented. The lake was not created, only part of semi-circular approach was laid out & the walled garden may not have been built. Brown's original plan was rediscovered by Kirkharle's current owners, John and Kitty Anderson, in 1980. They made plans to restore the Grade II-listed park and to recreate Brown's vision for the landscape, including creating his proposed lake. It was not possible to create the lake as one piece of water because A696 road, built in 1883, now cuts across the bottom of the park so in 2009, two serpentine lakes were created instead. Hundreds of new trees were planted. A cascade, a feature often used by Brown to make two lakes appear as single sheet of water was added in 2016 as part of the Capability Brown Festival, celebrating the tercentenary of Brown's birth. The water began to trickle through the cascade on 30 August 2016, the 300th anniversary of Brown's baptism at St Wilfrid's Church. The lake, grounds and St Wilfrid's church are open to the public as part of the Kirkharle Courtyard Visitor Center.  Other notable people  The artist and fox hunter Charles Loraine Smith was born to a Loraine and adopted the name of Smith whilst a boy.

The Interior Design program is one of the Top Performing Interior Design programs offered by a school, in the Philippine Interior Design Licensure Examinations. Brief history The College is descended from the original College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA) founded in 1946, which in turn is descended from the original College of Architecture founded in 1930. In 1785, the Dominicans made the first attempt to invest art and painting with academic value and formal presence and not merely an accessory to missionary work. That year when Fr. Juan Amador was Rector-Chancellor of the University of Santo Tomas, the Academia de Bellas Artes was opened. The school, however, was not firmly established and its influence was not far-reaching for it was founded as an experiment of sort. Its training on painting functioned only for a short time because there were few enrollees to that course. The Academia later became one of the Estudios de Adorno that existed in the University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo de Manila, and Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Thus in 1935, the Dominicans of the University of Santo Tomas merely reestablished their fine art school with the primary goal of meeting the ever-present and increasing demand for good Catholic artists. It is to be an institution designed to conform to the latest and most advanced artistic theories and practices. More importantly, however, it must inculcate Christian ideals that Dominicans deemed necessary and indispensable for the efficient and ethical practice of the arts profession.Carado, Hannibal F.

Interior Design was offered in order to meet the demands for professional interior designers due to construction and remodeling activities that were greater than ever. Public School Art on the other hand was, according to Director Victorio Edades (the first School Director), an answer to the immediate need of preparing future teachers of arts for private and public schools.Carado, Hannibal F.

Materials include M50 tool steel (AMS6491), carbon chrome steel (AMS6444), the corrosion resistant AMS5930, 440C stainless steel, silicon nitride (ceramic) and titanium carbide-coated 440C. Typically, special attention is given to the material specification, non-destructive testing, and to the traceability of the bearing (a system of documents that enables an engineer to trace a bearing, typically back to its manufacturing batch and material supply). Design When designing aerospace bearings, it is important to take a few things into account, including: *material standard *design *lubrication type *surface coatings and treatments *non-destructive testing *traceability In order to assure bearing performance, it is necessary for the bearing steel to be of high quality. Jet engine bearings are typically manufactured from metals manufactured using a vacuum arc remelt to enable material requirements to be met. Jet engine shaft bearings and accessory drive shaft bearings typically use single piece or two piece machined retainers. The pressed steel or moulded retainers found on mass-produced bearings are not used. Temperature and moisture resistant oils, greases and lubricants are normally specified. If the lubricant is not correct the performance of the bearing will be compromised. Application In jet engines bearings can operate at over 200 degrees Celsius (400 ¬∞F) and at speeds over 10,000 rpm for the turbine shafts to over 30,000 rpm in the accessory drives. In wing control surface applications temperatures as low as may be encountered. Monitoring Bearings are a vital factor in many products and assemblies and their performance is often monitored continuously. In jet engines the oil supply is monitored to detect the presence of metallic debris that could identify a failure either of the bearings or of other components whose failure may contaminate the bearings.

The route between Sk√≥gar and Th√≥rsm√∂rk goes through this pass and is one of the most popular walking routes in Iceland, despite being long and involving of climbing. At Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls, there is a comfortable, modern mountain hut owned by √ötivist, one of the Icelandic hiking associations. Also nearby is an older, less well-equipped hut called Baldvinssk√°li. The route from Sk√≥gar is particularly beautiful, as numerous waterfalls are passed along the way. The route is only accessible between mid-June and late-August. On the night of 16 May 1970, three travellers died in the mountain pass in a snowstorm. Hiking the Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls mountain pass takes 1‚Äì2 days. It is also possible to combine the Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls route with the Laugavegur Trek between Landmannalaugar and Th√≥rsm√∂rk to make a trip of 4‚Äì6 days in length. 2010 eruption Eruption at Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls at dusk. A fissure on Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls, April 2, 2010. The lava flows down, turning snow into steam On 20 March 2010, an eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano began in Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls following months of small earthquakes under the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull glacier. The eruption began around 23:00 and opened a long fissure vent on the northern part of the pass. Just over a week later, the Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls eruption produced a -long fissure and new craters were seen erupting on a northward path toward the area of Th√≥rsm√∂rk, a popular tourist nature preserve, prompting tours to stop briefly as volcanologists assessed the situation further. The two new craters at Fimmv√∂rduh√°ls were named Magni and M√≥√∞i, after the sons of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. It is an apt name because Th√≥rsm√∂rk is close to the craters. The new lava field was named Go√∞ahraun, because the lava streamed in the area Go√∞aland. These official names were accepted by the Minister of Education and Culture 15 June 2010. In April 2010, this was followed by a larger eruption on Eyjafjallaj√∂kull itself.

He is the nephew of Burton Levin, an American diplomat serving as the United States Ambassador to Burma in the late 1980s and early 90s. Early life Liu is the youngest son of a well-to-do family and a favorite of his mother. He had initially planned to follow the path of his siblings, a brother and two sisters, to further his education overseas after college. However, this was shelved after he won the singing contest which led to a contract with the Taiwan TV station, Tai Shi at the age of 17. Liu first started performing with his band \\"Zhengwu\\" in Xu Hui Zhong Xue, a Catholic school he attended. According to Liu, his interest in music was encouraged by a priest who was a fan of pop music there. Career Liu's first album Nuoyan (The Promise), released in 1975, launched his singing career when it became an instant hit. Liu's path to super-stardom was smooth, due to his distinctive vocal styles and good looks. Early in his career, he often wore a white scarf when performing and this evolved into his signature look. He won the prestigious Golden Bell Award for Best Male Singer three times, in the year 1980, 82 and 83. At the height of his career, Liu commanded an appearance fee of NT$240,000 per night. He released close to 40 albums and acted in over a dozen movies, in which he co-starred with some of the most popular female actresses like Brigitte Lin, Shirley Lu and Sylvia Chang. In 1983, the then 30-year-old Liu announced unexpectedly that he would give up the limelight and focus on developing his career backstage. In numerous interviews, Liu explained that he could see no further breakthroughs and wished to retire at the peak of his career. He wanted to expand his horizons and not limit a lifetime to entertainment business. He subsequently set up a production company \\"Fei Ying\\" to groom young talents but the company was wound up in 1991 when he immigrated to the United States. In 1991, he consented to a rare phone interview with a Singapore radio station during which the usually private Liu talked briefly about his personal life. He described his childhood as happy and himself as an easy going and optimistic child who was quite oblivious to his future career as a singer as he had no interest in music till he was in college. As to why he remained unmarried, Liu attributed it to his independent character and a reluctance to settle down. He felt that a long-term relationship required a level of commitment and responsibility that were difficult to maintain in the entertainment industry. Despite his then 30 odd years, he felt that he has yet to achieve a level of maturity necessary to play the role of a husband and father. Asked if it was due to the fact that he loved himself so well that he did not require love from another, he laughingly replied, \\"It appears to be a little problem there\\" Though Liu is known for his glamorous image, he revealed that the glittering outfits and flashy stage performances were part of the deliverables as a celebrity. Now retired from show biz, he confessed to a preference for comfortable and simple clothes. His taste for food is also undemanding and is happy with a bowl of Zha Jiang Mien and dumplings. His first love is travel, especially to big, modern cities that offer arts and culture like New York and Tokyo. He once said that he doesn't like staying in hotels when he travels and his dream is to have a \\"small apartment in every city I love\\". Despite his superstar status, Liu maintains an impeccable reputation in the entertainment industry. Insiders describe him as gentlemanly, quiet and reserved off stage. Liu now resides in New York City. He is said to be a savvy property investor with assets spanning many countries. He has no plans to return to show business.

History  The area now known as the Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist used to be part of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria. The Anglican church in the North was administered by the Diocesan Administrator and Bishops in Pretoria. The ordination of deacons and priests was done at St Albans Cathedral in Pretoria. The Bishop and Suffragan Bishop of the Diocese of Pretoria would visit the area to take confirmation services and to preside at other special occasions. Suffragan Bishop John Ruston was sent to Polokwane (then, Pietersburg) to oversee the northern region of the Diocese of Pretoria. Under his leadership a new diocese was established in the North by the name of St Mark the Evangelist. The Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist was inaugurated on 16 May 1987. Philip Le Feuvre was elected a bishop in August 1987 and consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese on 30 January 1988. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Metropolitan and Bishop of Anglican Diocese of Cape Town, conducted the service held at Christ Church, Polokwane. Bishop Philip's vision was for a diocese that would be involved in evangelism and church planting across the Limpopo Province, the least evangelised area of South Africa. His forthright devotion to mission fundamentals typified the work of St Mark the Evangelist's first bishop. Martin Breytenbach was installed as the second bishop of the diocese on 12 February 2000. The service was conducted by the recently retired Bishop Duncan Buchanan, from the Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg on behalf of the Metropolitan. The service was held at the Mokopane College of Education in the Parish of Mahwelereng.  Administration  The diocese shadows the geographical area of the Limpopo Province. Given the size, the diocese has been divided into sub-regions, known as Archdeaconries, to facilitate better administrative and leadership processes. The diocese initially had only four Archdeaconries, which corresponded with the four main roads in the Limpopo Province. They were the Archdeaconries of the North, Centre, South and Mopani. Due to the multiplication of parishes in 2008, another Archdeaconry was added in 2009 and some of the parishes re- allocated. The archdeaconries and parishes that fall under them are as follows: Archdeaconry of the North * Zoutpansberg parish * Musina mission * Sibasa parish Archdeaconry of the Centre * Christ Church Polokwane parish * Extension 44 * Seshego parish * Moletsi parish * Matlala parish Capricorn Archdeaconry * Sekhukhuneland parish * St Mark's College * Lebowakgomo Southern Archdeaconry * Mashashane parish * Baken-Matji mission * Mokopane parish * Mapela parish * St Andrew parish Mopani Archdeaconry * Letaba parish * St Luke's parish * St Paul's United * Baobab parish  Synods  A Synod is the highest decision-making body of the diocese. A Bishop may assemble a Synod as often as he thinks fit and shall not do so less than once every three years. Clergy and lay people are summoned to the Synod at least four months before the appointed sitting of Synod. The summons is by citation under the Bishop's hand and seal. Diocesan organisations such as the Anglican Women's Fellowship, Mothers' Union and Anglican Students' Federation elect a person to represent them on Synod. A session of Synod is convened and run with very formal procedures. Motions, proposals and reports must be submitted to a duly constituted Synod Committee before Synod commences. Synod business is arranged and compiled into an Agenda book, which is circulated several weeks before the start of Synod. Synod is opened with a celebration of the Holy Communion. After the Nicene Creed the Registrar, confirms that a quorum is present and informs the Bishop. The Bishop then declares the Synod open. Synod business typically deals with a report from the Finance Board, reports from Diocesan Boards and Institutions, actions from resolutions passed at previous Synods, motions and proposals, and elections to Diocesan and Provincial offices/boards. One of the most important aspects of a Synod is the Bishop's Charge to Synod, which outlines his vision, priorities and challenges to the diocese. * 2003 ‚Äì Bishop's Charge: * 2006 ‚Äì Bishop's Charge: \\"Make Disciples ‚Äì Transform the World\\" * 2009 ‚Äì Bishop's Charge: \\"God's Covenant People\\"  List of bishops  * Philip Le Feuvre 1987‚Äì2000 ** John Ruston, Suffragan Bishop of Pretoria (formerly for the area which became St Mark's diocese) was initially vicar-general of the new diocese * Martin Breytenbach 200028 February 2019 * Luke Pretorius 2019-  Coat of arms  The diocese registered a coat of arms at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1998 : Argent, in chief a Lion of St. Mark with a scroll issuant from the mouth and flexed between the legs, and in base a baobab tree, sans leaves, Purpure; the shield ensigned of an Episcopal mitre proper.  Jane Furse Memorial Hospital  Michael Bolton Furse and American wife, Frances, moved to South Africa from England in 1903. Their only child, a daughter, Jane was born on 19 August 1904. In 1909 Michael Furse was consecrated the Bishop of Pretoria . When Bishop Michael trekked around the vast Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, Jane would sometimes accompany him. She became sorrowfully aware of the poverty and disease rife among the African people. She made up her mind to be a doctor in order to serve them. But Jane contracted scarlet fever and died on 3 August 1918. She was buried at a cemetery in Irene in Pretoria. In 1921 work began on a hospital to be built in her memory in a part of the diocese known as Sekhukhuneland. The hospital was named the Jane Furse Memorial Hospital. It grew in reputation in South Africa and internationally as a centre of excellence. The greater part of the medical staff came from the United Kingdom, supplemented by doctors from Canada, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Germany and South Africa. Medical students came from the USA, Germany and Israel to gain valuable experience. As the mission hospital grew, so did the town, businesses and services around Jane Furse, which eventually become known by the name of the hospital. On 1 May 1976 the hospital was taken over by the Lebowa Government at the insistence of the South African government. As part of the process of land restitution in the Limpopo Province, the extensive hospital complex and agricultural grounds were returned to the Anglican Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist in 2004.Jane Furse Land Restitution, CPSA News, Fri 6 February, 17:37:41 SAST 2004 The government remained in control of the hospital while a new complex was being built on the outskirts of the town of Jane Furse. When the hospital was decommissioned in 2008 and moved into the new Jane Furse Hospital, everything of value, including items of historical interest, were stripped and sold off, leaving the buildings derelict. The Anglican Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist is seeking compensation from the relevant government departments for the damage to the property. A slow process of rehabilitating the Jane Furse Memorial Hospital and grounds for use of a range of non-medical activities is being undertaken, in the hope that it can once again be a place of service to the surrounding community. It currently houses the Jane Furse fire brigade, a post-natal clinic, a cr√®che and a centre for disabled children. An NGO is using part of the agricultural land to train people in appropriate small-scale farming techniques. A drop-in centre for children is also housed next door to the old hospital complex and St Mark's College.

Echoing post-punk guitars complete with sprawling effects arch through the groups debut, taking the listener on a journey that seems only accomplish-able when under the influence... [Ultimately], while the album isn't really an experience in the vein of bands like My Bloody Valentine are in the realm of psychedelic rock, Darker My Love are on the right track to assuming a cult status in the weed-soaked culture of psychedelic rock as So-Cal fans' 'little awesome band.'\\"AbsolutePunk.net - Album Review - Darker My Love: Darker My Love Punknews.org - \\"Psych-rock has not seen a debut this solid since Jesus and Mary Chain‚Äôs Psychocandy. Originally a side project featuring members of the Distillers and Nerve Agents, California‚Äôs Darker My Love break out with a sound no one was to expect from punk rockers. The sound is fuzzy, trippy, drowned in reverb, and guitar driven...

If you enhance the experience by turning on the lava lamp, dim the room lights and fire up that black light; you're effectively creating the Cartman favorite \`quadruplestuff,' making it the ultimate DML experience.

Both public and private online communities offer opportunities for research, but many brands are wary of sharing company information openly. Invitation-only, private online communities centred on a single brand or customer segment may be the solution. These private communities can also engage customer groups or target consumers who might be difficult to reach using traditional off-line methodologies. Consumers enjoy this new, more participative research approach and the interaction with other users re-introduces the social context often missing from other research approaches that conceive of the consumer as an isolated individual. Brands also benefit from online communities by having them on-hand to answer questions, test hypotheses, and observe. Online technology can adapt to almost any research need, be it showing creative stimulus material, gathering ideas for innovation and co-creation or simply an instant 'go/no go' needed. The continuity built through online networks brings new possibilities for supporting ideation processes. With a group of people on board, research can keep pace with internal development processes, providing a consumer feedback loop to check new ideas, such as product development, from inception to launch. In an online research community members (rather than respondents) talk to each other ‚Äì they exchange ideas and discuss issues with each other. Unlike a panel this lets researchers observe how people interact, the language they use, and lets them raise the questions they want to ask, which results in richer responses.

Based in Cardiff, the orchestra has an impressive history which has merited attention both within Wales and beyond.  Organisation  The orchestra (abbreviation NYOW) numbers around 115 young players aged between 13 ‚Äì 22 years who are auditioned and drawn from all over Wales, and who represent some of Wales' most talented young musicians. The NYOW performs in some of the most prestigious concert halls in Europe including St David's Hall (Cardiff), the Bridgewater Hall (Manchester), the National Concert Hall (Dublin), Waterfront Hall (Belfast), Town Hall (Birmingham), Sage Gateshead, Beethovensaal (Stuttgart), the Salle Erasme (Strasbourg) the Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt (Berlin) and La Mortella on the island of Ischia. Successive generations of players have benefited from the guidance and tuition of internationally recognised professional musicians, many of them former members of the orchestra, and many well-known Welsh composers have been commissioned to write new works for the orchestra, such as Grace Williams, David Wynne, Daniel Jones, Arwel Hughes, former member Karl Jenkins, and founder member of the orchestra Alun Hoddinott. (Two dozen pairs of clogs were needed for the Orchestra's premiere of Karl Jenkins' Scenes From Wales in 2000.)http://www.nyaw.co.uk/e_about.html  National Youth Arts Wales  Conductors  Unlike many youth orchestras which perform under the baton of an annual guest conductor the NYOW has traditionally appointed a resident Principal Conductor and Musical Director. These have included Clarence Raybould (1945‚Äì1966), Arthur Davison (1967‚Äì1990), Elgar Howarth (1991‚Äì1995), Christopher Adey (1996‚Äì2002), and Owain Arwel Hughes OBE (2003‚Äì2010). 2011's concert series was conducted by Takuo Yuasa. Carlo Rizzi (2012), Grant Llewellyn (2013), Jac Van Steen (2014) and Paul Daniel (2015). Carlo Rizzi returned for the 2016-2018 season. American conductor, Andrew Litton, conducted the 2019 concert series.  Courses  A residential course is normally held in the summer, followed by a short tour comprising four or five concerts. Known to its members as the \\"NASH\\" the annual residency offers a valuable opportunity for talented musicians to work together with top professionals in an intensive environment, culminating in a series of concerts. Since 2013 a young composers course has run alongside the orchestra's summer residency, giving composers the opportunity to have their music played by members of the orchestra. Works are composed during each residency which are then given their first performances at venues including The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Aberystwyth University and in 2015 in the performing foyer spaces at the Sage, Gateshead and St David's Hall Cardiff. Since 2001 the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales have worked together on projects culminating in joint concerts or recordings, giving young players the opportunity to play alongside some of the best orchestral players in Britain.  Auditions  Candidates are accepted for audition on the approval of their county Head of Music Service and are expected to support music activity at school/college and county level. The minimum standard for all instruments (except harp) is Grade VIII. Harpists may play at Grade VI. Auditions take place throughout the autumn around Wales and at selected centres in England for those studying away from home.

History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 497 dunams of land from the Palestinian village of Al-Auja in order to construct Niran.Al 'Auja Town Profile p. 19, ARIJ Niran was established on 18 June 1971 as a Nahal settlement by the Nahal Command in collaboration with the Agricultural Settlement Department of the Jewish Agency on land prepared by the Jewish National Fund. Niran began its existence as \\"a tented outpost of a few dozen persons.\\" The barren conditions required that soil be carried up from surrounding valleys to make agriculture viable. During its time as a military outpost, it was used to prevent armed infiltration from Jordan and as a disciplinary assignment for delinquent Israeli soldiers. It was demilitarized and converted to a civilian kibbutz in 1977. It is named after the biblical city of Naaran. Culture The kibbutz organizes workshops on Zionism, Judaism and Israeli society. Some members of the kibbutz work in the date groves or at the local plastics factory, P.V.Ran, which manufactures packaging and wrappings for food products in compliance with international standards. Archaeological findings The ruins of a 6th-century synagogue were discovered in Naaran, a short distance from the kibbutz. The site contains an ancient mosaic and archeological treasures and attracts both worshippers and pilgrims. In May 2012, the ancient synagogue was vandalized with graffiti that included swastikas and Palestinian flags.

His claim to fame is that while serving with the French Navy he was instrumental in saving the French fleet following the battle of Barfleur in 1692. He is the subject of a heroic poem by Robert Browning, but little else is known of him or his life. The incident Following the battle of Barfleur, on 29 May(NS) 1692, the French fleet under Tourville was retreating westward in order to regain a safe harbour, pursued by the Dutch and English fleets under Russell. On 31 May the fleet was scattered over a wide area around the tip of the Cotentin peninsula. Twenty-one ships, under Pannetier, were anchored west of Cap de la Hague, while the remainder, under Tourville, were to the east. Pannetier's squadron was between the cape and Alderney, at the head of the notorious Alderney Race (Fr. Raz Blanchard) and was shadowed by the Dutch White squadron, under Almonde, and the English Blue, under Ashby. Tourville was opposed by the Red, under Russell. As the tide started to flood and the wind rose, Tourville's squadron was swept east, pursued by Russell. Pannetier, wishing to escape, thought to sail through the Race, but his navigators demurred, fearing the passage of this turbulent channel, with its dangerous lee shore and rocky bottom offering little purchase if they needed to anchor. At this point Herv√© Riel, who as a local fisherman was familiar with the passage, offered to guide the fleet through. Pannetier agreed, and with Riel's guidance piloted the flagship (Grand, 80 guns) through the Race, followed by the rest of the squadron. Neither Almonde nor Ashby were willing to follow; Almonde took his squadron westward around Alderney, but by the change of the tide Pannetier had too great a lead, and the chase was abandoned. The fleet reached St Malo safely. When asked what reward he wished, Riel asked merely to visit his home nearby, to see his wife, ‚Äúthe belle Aurore‚Äù. The poem records, with some cynicism, ‚Äúthat he got, and nothing more‚Äù The poem Browning‚Äôs poem makes some errors of fact (for example, it gives the French admiral as d‚ÄôAmfreville, who was with Tourville at la Hogue, and the French flagship as the Formidable, which was not present at this battle); otherwise it presents a clear and fast- moving narrative. Browning wrote the poem in 1871, and intended the proceeds be used to support the people of France suffering during the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871). It was first published in the Cornhill magazine in March 1871, but now forms part of his collection Pacchiarotto, published in 1876.

He was a three-time 250cc motocross world champion. Motorcycle racing career Moisseev was born in the Gatchina district of the Leningrad Oblast. He decided to take up the sport of motocross after witnessing the 1964 Motocross World Championship round held in Leningrad. In the same year, he was admitted to the motocross section of the Leningrad Pioneers Palace. He competed in his first world championship event in 1967 and won the Russian 250cc Motocross National Championship in 1970. He was the 1974 F.I.M. world champion in the 250cc class on a KTM motorcycle. He reached the title in the last race, in the struggle with the other title contender Jaroslav Falta. In 1976, he narrowly lost the 250 world championship by one point to Heikki Mikkola despite a late season charge. He won two more 250 world championships in 1977 and 1978, again while riding KTM motorcycles. In 1978 he was a member of the winning Russian team in the Motocross des Nations. Moisseev won a race for the last time in 1979 when friction developed between the USSR Motorcycling Federation and the KTM factory. As a result, KTM withdrew their support of the Russian team. Without competitive motorcycles, the Soviet team could no longer compete against the Western European and Japanese factory racing teams. Later life Moisseev, like many Soviet sports stars of his era, was enlisted in the Soviet Army, rising to the ranks of Major during his racing career. His extreme fitness combined with team tactics made him a fearsome competitor. After retiring from competition, Moisseev became a motocross coach. In 1977, Moisseev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and, in 1978 he was given the honorary title of \\"Honored Master of Sports.\\" In December 2000, he was elected president of the Russian Motorcycle Federation.

It involves an accountant named George Spelvin, who is mistaken for an actor's understudy and forced to perform in a play for which he doesn't know any of the lines. Inspiration The play was inspired by dreams actors and performers often have in which they are about to go onstage and cannot remember their lines/rehearsal instructions. Durang himself had an actor's nightmare after performing in this play in which he could not remember any lines, could not find his script, and when he did find the script it was gibberish to him. Later the play was the subject of the case See v. Durang (1983) where John William See claimed that Durang had infringed his copyright in the play Fear of Acting. The district court summarily dismissed the case on the basis that no reasonable person could find any substantial similarity between the two plays, and the appeals court confirmed this decision. Plot A man finds himself inexplicably backstage one day. When he is confronted by the stage manager, Meg, it becomes apparent that he is the understudy for an actor named Edwin (Edwin Booth) and as \\"Eddie\\" apparently broke both his legs, the man must perform in his stead. The man is referred to as \\"George\\" throughout the play, despite him feeling that it is not his real name (another actress refers to him as Stanley at one point as well) and cannot remember attending any rehearsals or being an actor at all (he instead believes that he is an accountant). To make matters worse, he is unable to get a straight answer as to what the play is. An actress named Sarah tells him that it is a No√´l Coward play (Private Lives) and the other actress Ellen tells him that it is a Samuel Beckett play called Checkmate (which seems to have elements of the plays Endgame, Happy Days, and Waiting for Godot). Literally forced on stage, George attempts to improvise his lines; however, the play inconsistently shifts between scenes from Private Lives, Hamlet, Checkmate, and A Man for All Seasons. When forced to improvise a soliloquy in the Hamlet scene, George tells the audience that he was raised in a Catholic school and was interested in joining a monastery but they told him to wait until he was older. When he was older, however, he lost faith (as he put it \\"I don't know many Catholic adults\\"). In the final part of the play (A Man for All Seasons), George is alarmed to learn that he is to play the part of Sir Thomas More - and the execution seems a bit too real for his liking. While attempting to convince himself that he is merely in a dream, George ends up theorizing that one can't dream of his own death and therefore he will wake up just before he is beheaded. He accepts the execution, but appears to really be dead during curtain call, much to the cast's confusion. Characters *George - A man who finds himself backstage under mysterious circumstances. He appears to be an accountant and seems to be the understudy of a man named Edwin, although he can't actually remember attending any rehearsals or being a part of the production. In Private Lives he plays Elyot. In Hamlet he plays Prince Hamlet. In Checkmate he plays Willie (who seems to be based on Nagg in Endgame). In A Man for All Seasons he plays Sir Thomas More. *Meg - The stage manager. A capable worker. When it becomes apparent that George does not know many of his lines, she pretends to be a maid in the production and whispers some to him. In the scene from A Man for all Seasons, she plays the part of Sir Thomas More's daughter and during the execution she bids him goodbye as \\"George\\". *Sarah - A grand actress. In Private Lives, she plays Amanda. In Hamlet, she plays Queen Gertrude. In A Man for all Seasons, she plays Sir Thomas More's wife (she also quotes Hamlet in that scene, when trying to convince George to accept the execution and bids him goodbye as \\"Hamlet\\"). Name taken from Sarah Siddons. *Ellen - Another actress, but not as grand as Sarah. For some reason, she calls George \\"Stanley\\" before the production. In Private Lives she plays Sybil. In Checkmate, her character is unnamed, but she appears to be a cross between Winnie (from Happy Days) and Nell (from Endgame). She remains in this character throughout the A Man for all Seasons scene and bids George goodbye as \\"Willie\\". Name taken from Dame Ellen Terry. *Henry - A grand actor. In Hamlet, he plays the part of Horatio. According to the script, Henry is also able to play the part of the executioner. If this is the case, he bids George goodbye as \\"Sir Thomas\\". Name taken from Henry Irving. *The Executioner - He makes an appearance only in A Man for All Seasons. If it is desired, the part can be played by the same actor as Henry. He bids George goodbye as \\"Sir Thomas\\". *The Announcer - A voice over the loudspeaker who announces the cast for the performances and instructs the audience not to use flash photography (a warning which is ignored). When Ellen's character hears the announcer in the Checkmate scene, she comments \\"Oh listen, Willie, a voice! Maybe there is a God!\\" References Category:Plays by Christopher Durang Category:1981 plays ","title":"The Actor's Nightmare"},{"id":"18728746","title":"HLA-B45"},{"id":"18728752","text":"Edward Coffin (alias Hatton) (1570 - 17 April 1626) was an English Jesuit. Life He was born at Exeter in 1571, and arrived at the English college at Rheims on 19 July 1585. He left that city for Ingoldstadt on 7 November 1586, in company with Dr. Robert Turner, who defrayed the cost of his education. On 26 July 1588, he entered the English college at Rome. Having been ordained priest on 13 March 1592-3 he was sent to England on 10 May 1594, and he entered the Society of Jesus in this country on 13 Jan. 1597-8. In the Lent of 1598, on his way to the novitiate in Flanders, travelling with Thomas Lister, he was seized by the Dutch, near Antwerp, and taken to England, where he was imprisoned for five years., and was sent back to England, where he spent his novitiate and the first five years of his religious life in prison, chiefly in the Tower of London (the Beauchamp tower). On the accession of James I, 'as a favour,' he was sent with a large number of other ecclesiastics into perpetual banishment. Repairing to Rome, he acted for nearly twenty years as confessor to the English college. He then resolved to return to his native country, and left Rome for Flanders, but at St. Omer he was taken ill and died in Saint- Omer's College on 17 April 1626.

Education and Academic Career Barrie Rickards grew up in Leeds and Goole in Yorkshire. He held the following degrees: BSc, MA, PhD, ScD, and a DSc from the University of Hull. Research Barrie Rickards' work concentrated on the systematics and biodiversity of graptolites in the Palaeozoic. This led to a better understanding of their paleobiogeography and evolution, the manner of their recovery from mass extinctions, and a more precise understanding of Lazarus taxa, refugia and relict faunas. Fishing Barrie Rickards was one of the best-known and most successful pike anglers in Britain. He was a Founding Fellow of the Pike Anglers' Club, and was past President of the Pike Society, the Lure Anglers' Society and the Specialist Anglers' Alliance. Selected publications Barrie Rickards had written over 250 academic papers, 700 articles on fishing and some 30 books related to both fishing and palaeontology. * Leggett, J.K., McKerrow, W.S., Cocks, L.R.M. & Rickards, R.B. 1981, \\"Periodicity in the early Palaeozoic marine realm ( British Isles).\\", Journal, Geological Society, vol. 138, no. 2, pp. 167‚Äì176. * Cuerda, A.J., Rickards, R.B. & Cingolani, C. 1988, \\"A new Ordovician-Silurian boundary section in San Juan Province, Argentina, and its definitive graptolite fauna\\", Journal - Geological Society of London, vol. 145, no. 5, pp. 749‚Äì757. * Rickards, R.B. 1995, \\"Utility and precision of Silurian graptolite biozones\\", Lethaia, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 129‚Äì137. * Rickards, R.B., Packham, G.H., Wright, A.J. & Williamson, P.L. 1995, \\"Wenlock and Ludlow graptolite faunas and biostratigraphy of the Quarry Creek district, New South Wales\\", Memoir - Association of Australasian Palaeontologists, vol. 17. * Dean, W.T., Monod, O., Rickards, R.B., Demir, O. & Bultynck, P. 2000, \\"Lower Palaeozoic stratigraphy and palaeontology, Karadere-Zirze area, Pontus mountains, northern Turkey\\", Geological Magazine, vol. 137, no. 5, pp. 555‚Äì582. * Rickards, R.B. 2002, \\"The graptolitic age of the type Ashgill Series (Ordovician), Cumbria, UK\\", Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society, vol. 54, no. 1, pp. 1‚Äì16. * Rickards, B. 2007, Richard Walker: Biography of an Angling Legend.

Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries. Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age. The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne. As a seaside resort, Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism, with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences, public events and cultural sightseeing. The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail, healthcare, education, construction, manufacturing, professional scientific and the technical sector. Eastbourne's population is growing; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412. The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students, families and those commuting to London and Brighton. In June 2019, the population of Eastbourne was estimated to be 103,745.  History = Pre-Roman  Flint mines and Stone Age artefacts have been found in the surrounding countryside of the Eastbourne Downs. A Bronze Age site of national importance was discovered in Hydneye lake at Shinewater in 1995. Celtic people are believed to have settled on the Eastbourne Downland in 500BC.  Roman era  There are Roman remains buried beneath the town, such as a Roman bath and section of pavement between Eastbourne Pier and the Redoubt Fortress. There is also a Roman villa near the entrance to the Pier and the present Queens Hotel. In 2014, skeletal remains of a woman who lived around 425AD were discovered in the vicinity of Beachy Head on the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The remains were found to be of a 30-year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African skeletal structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, at a time when the Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.  Anglo-Saxon era  An Anglo-Saxon charter, circa 963 AD, describes a landing stage and stream at Burne. The original name came from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All that can be seen of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon 'moot', or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name. In 2014 local metal-detectorist Darrin Simpson found a coin minted during the reign of √Üthelberht II of East Anglia (died 794), in a field near the town. It is believed that the coin may have led to √Üthelberht's beheading by Offa of Mercia, as it had been struck as a sign of independence. Describing the coin, expert Christopher Webb, said, \\"This new discovery is an important and unexpected addition to the numismatic history of 8th century England.\\"  Norman era  Following the Norman conquest, the Hundred of what is now Eastbourne, was held by Robert, Count of Mortain, William the Conqueror's half brother. The Domesday Book lists 28 ploughlands, a church, a watermill, fisheries and salt pans. The Book referred to the area as 'Borne'. 'East' was added to 'Borne' in the 13th century, renaming the town. St Mary's Church, Old Town, Eastbourne  Medieval era  A charter for a weekly market was granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1315‚Äì16; this increased his status as Lord of the Manor and improved local industry. During the Middle Ages the town was visited by King Henry I and in 1324 by Edward II. Evidence of Eastbourne's medieval past can seen in the 12th century Church of St Mary, and the manor house called Bourne Place. In the mid-16th century Bourne Place was home to the Burton family, who acquired much of the land on which the present town stands. This manor house is currently owned by the Duke of Devonshire and was extensively remodelled in the early Georgian era when it was renamed Compton Place. It is one of the two Grade I listed buildings in the town. Eastbourne has Cornish connections, most notably visible in the Cornish high cross in the churchyard of St Mary's Church which was brought from an unspecified location in Cornwall.Plaque at foot of cross  Georgian era  In 1752, a dissertation by Doctor Richard Russell extolled the medicinal benefits of the seaside. His views were of considerable benefit to the south coast and, in due course, Eastbourne became known as \\"the Empress of Watering Places\\". Eastbourne's earliest claim as a seaside resort came about following a summer holiday visit by four of King George III's children in 1780 (Princes Edward and Octavius and Princesses Elizabeth and Sophia). In 1793, following a survey of coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower 73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an important feature of the town's seafront and was the subject of a painting by James Sant RA, and part of Tower 68 forms the basement of a house on St. Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10 cannons. A connection with India comes in the shape of the 18th- century Lushington monument, also at St Mary's, which commemorates a survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta atrocity which led to the British conquest of Bengal. Bourne Stream running through Motcombe Gardens Eastbourne remained an area of small rural settlements until the 19th century. Four villages or hamlets occupied the site of the modern town: Bourne (or, to distinguish it from others of the same name, East Bourne), is now known as Old Town, and this surrounded the bourne (stream) which rises in the present Motcombe Park; Meads, where the Downs meet the coast; South Bourne (near the town hall); and the fishing settlement known simply as Sea Houses, which was situated to the east of the present pier.  Victorian era  By the mid-19th century most of the area had fallen into the hands of two landowners: John Davies Gilbert (the Davies-Gilbert family still own much of the land in Eastbourne and East Dean) and William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington. The Gilbert family's holdings date to the late 17th and early 18th centuries when barrister Nicholas Gilbert married an Eversfield and Gildredge heiress.\\"Gildredge, an ancient house and estate\\", says Sussex historian Mark Antony Lower, \\"gave name to a family of considerable antiquity, who subsequently had their chief residence at Eastbourne, and gave their name to the manor of Eastbourne-Gildredge.\\" (The Gildredges owned much of Eastbourne by 1554. The Gilberts eventually made the Gildredge Manor House their own. Today the Gildredge name lives on in the eponymous park.) Trevithick, the inventor of the steam locomotive (a claim disputed on the grave of one Vyvyan in the churchyard at Camborne), is reported to have spent some time here.Arthur Mee, editor, King's England: Sussex 1930s edition An early plan, for a town named Burlington, was abandoned, but on 14 May 1849 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway arrived to scenes of great jubilation. With the arrival of the railway, the town's growth accelerated. Cavendish, now the 7th Duke of Devonshire, recruited Henry Currey in 1859 to lay out a plan for what was essentially an entire new town ‚Äì a resort built \\"for gentlemen by gentlemen\\". The town grew rapidly from a population of less than 4,000 in 1851 to nearly 35,000 by 1891. In 1883, it was incorporated as a municipal borough; a purpose-built town hall was opened in 1886. This period of growth and elegant development continued for several decades. A royal visit by George V and Queen Mary in March 1935 is commemorated by a plaque on chalet number 2 at Holywell.  20th century  During the First World War, Summerdown Camp, a convalescent facility, opened in 1915 near the South Downs to treat soldiers who were injured during trench warfare or seriously ill. It was the largest of this type in the UK during this war, treating 150,000; 80% were able to return to fight. The facility was dismantled in 1920. An exhibition about the history of the camp was held in Eastbourne for several months in 2015. In 1926, the Eastbourne Corporation Act enabled the creation of the Eastbourne Downland Estate. Wish Tower Martello Tower in Eastbourne The Second World War saw a change in fortunes. Initially, children were evacuated to Eastbourne on the assumption that they would be safe from German bombs, but soon they had to be evacuated again because after the fall of France in June 1940 it was anticipated that the town would lie in an invasion zone. Part of Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion plan, envisaged landings at Eastbourne. Many people sought safety away from the coast and shut up their houses. Restrictions on visitors forced the closure of most hotels, and private boarding schools moved away. Many of these empty buildings were later taken over by the services. The Royal Navy set up an underwater weapons school, and the Royal Air Force operated radar stations at Beachy Head and on the marshes near Pevensey. Thousands of Canadian soldiers were billeted in and around Eastbourne from July 1941 to the run-up to D-Day. The town suffered badly during the war, with many Victorian and Edwardian buildings damaged or destroyed by air raids. Indeed, by the end of the conflict it was designated by the Home Office to have been 'the most raided town in the South East region'. The situation was especially bad between May 1942 and June 1943 with hit‚Äìand‚Äìrun raids from fighter‚Äìbombers based in northern France. Ultimately 187 civilian lives were lost in the borough through enemy action. In the summer of 1956, the town came to national and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested for the murder of an elderly widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency of his being named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers,Hallworth, Rodney and Mark Williams, Where there's a will... The sensational life of Dr John Bodkin Adams, Capstan Press, Jersey, 1983. but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck offOfficially removed from the list of doctors authorised to practise medicine (treat patients) by the General Medical Council for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area. G. Cavendish's Seat in the Park, John Nixon, 1787 After the war, development continued, including the growth of Old Town up the hillside (Green Street Farm Estate) and the housing estates of Hampden Park, Willingdon Trees and Langney. During the latter half of the 20th century, there were controversies over the demolition of Pococks, a 15th- century manor house on what is now the Rodmill Housing Estate, and the granting of planning permission for a 19-storey block at the western end of the seafront. The latter project (South Cliff Tower) was realised in 1965 despite a storm of protest led by the newly formed Eastbourne and District Preservation Committee, which later became Eastbourne Civic Society, and was renamed the Eastbourne Society in 1999. Local conservationists also failed to prevent the construction of the glass-plated TGWU conference and holiday centre, but were successful in purchasing Polegate Windmill, thus saving it from demolition and redevelopment. Most of the expansion took place on the northern and eastern margins of the town, gradually swallowing surrounding villages. However, the richer western part was constrained by the Downs and has remained largely unchanged. In 1981, a large section of the town centre was replaced by the indoor shops of the Arndale Centre. In the 1990s, both growth and controversy accelerated rapidly as a new plan was launched to develop the area known as the Crumbles, a shingle bank on the coast to the east of the town centre. This area, now known as Sovereign Harbour, containing a marina, shops and several thousand houses, along with luxury flats, was formerly home to many rare plants. There has been continued growth in other parts of the town, and the central marshland has become farmland and nature reserves.  21st century  In 2009, the new Towner Gallery was opened, abutting the listed Congress Theatre built in 1963. In 2016‚Äì19 extensive remodelling work was undertaken to the prominent Arndale Centre, which takes up most of the town centre, and was originally built by Legal & General Assurance in the 1980s. This was then renamed The Beacon. The remodelling including the addition of a brand new cinema run by Cineworld. On 22 November 2019, a fire broke out in the basement of the Claremont Hotel. The nearby Pier Hotel was also evacuated.  Local History Society  Eastbourne Local History Society was founded in 1970. It is a charitable, not-for-profit organisation in the United Kingdom whose objective is the pursuit and encouragement of an active interest in the study of the history of Eastbourne and its immediate environs and the dissemination of the outcome of such studies. As the major landowner, the Cavendish family has had strong connections with Eastbourne since the 18th century. The current President of the Society is William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington. Containing over 1,500 articles about the history of Eastbourne, the Society's indexed journal, The Eastbourne Local Historian, is the major historical resource for the town and has been published quarterly since its inception in 1970. Over the years, the Society has published various books and booklets about the history of Eastbourne, twelve of which are currently in print.  Geography  The South Downs dominate Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be seen from most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down under the sea during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. The chalk can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline to the west of the town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. The chalk contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate. A part of the South Downs, Willingdon Down is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. This is of archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp and burial grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of chalk grassland rich in species. Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is Seaford to Beachy Head. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley. Several nature trails lead across the Downs to areas such as the nearby villages of East Dean and Birling Gap, and landmarks like the Seven Sisters, Belle Tout Lighthouse and Beachy Head.  Districts  Grove Road, part of the Little Chelsea area of Eastbourne Eastbourne's greater area comprises the town of Polegate, and the civil parishes of Willingdon and Jevington, Stone Cross, Pevensey, Westham and Pevensey Bay village. All are part of the Wealden District. Within Eastbourne's limits are: * Langney: Langney Rise, Shinewater, Kingsmere, Langney Village, the Marina, Langney Point * Hampden Park: Hampden Park Village, Willingdon Trees, Winkney Farm, Ratton * Inner areas: Rodmill, Ocklynge, Seaside, Bridgemere, Roselands, Downside * Town centre: Town centre, Little Chelsea, Meads, Holywell, Old Town, Upperton * Sovereign Harbour: North Harbour, South Harbour There was a community known as Norway, Eastbourne in the triangle now bounded by Wartling Road, Seaside and Lottbridge Drove. The name being a corruption of North Way, as this was the route to the north. The area is now a housing estate and the only evidence there was a Norway are a Norway Road and the local church whose sign reads \\"St Andrew's Church, Norway\\". The former fishing hamlet of Holywell (local pronunciation 'holly well') was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 yards to the southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and St Bede's School which leads to the chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as 'Gibraltar' or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.  Climate  As with the rest of the British Isles and South Coast, Eastbourne experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The local climate is notable for its high sunshine levels, at least relative to much of the rest of England ‚Äì Eastbourne holds the record for the highest recorded amount of sunshine in a month, 383.9 hours in July 1911. Temperature extremes recorded at Eastbourne since 1960 range from during July 1976, down to In January 1987. Eastbourne's coastal location also means it tends to be milder than most areas, particularly during night. A whole six months of the year have never fallen below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F), and in July the temperature has never fallen below . All temperature figures relate to the period 1960 onwards. The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Cfb\\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).  Governance  The local council operates from a Victorian town hall.  Eastbourne Borough Council  Eastbourne Borough Council is responsible for much local governance, with representation provided by 27 councillors from 9 wards, with elections to the council being held every four years. The 2015 election resulted in a council made up of 18 Liberal Democrat and 9 Conservative councillors. The council operates out of a Victorian town hall designed by W. Tadman Foulkes, and built between 1884 and 1886 under supervision of Henry Currey, the Duke of Devonshire's architect.  East Sussex County Council  East Sussex County Council has responsibility for local education, libraries, social services, civil registration, trading standards and transport. Out of the 49 seats, 9 are returned by Eastbourne voters. The 2009 East Sussex County Council election resulted in 29 Conservatives, 13 Liberal Democrats, 4 Labour and 3 Independent, of which Eastbourne provided 6 Liberal Democrats and 3 Conservatives.  House of Commons  The Parliament Constituency of Eastbourne has always covered a greater area than the borough's nine wards, but due to population growth in the town, it has lost territory over time. At present the constituency includes all of the borough as well as the suburb of Willingdon. Eastbourne is a marginal seat currently represented by the Conservatives but with recent representation by the Liberal Democrats.  European Parliament  At European level, Eastbourne is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. The 2009 election returned 4 Conservatives, 2 Liberal Democrats, 2 UK Independence, 1 Labour and 1 Green.  Demography  The overall population of Eastbourne is growing (between 2001‚Äì2008 the population grew from 89,800 to 94,800),. Eastbourne is the second largest district or borough in East Sussex with an official resident population of 101,133 in 2014. The average age of residents has dropped in recent years as younger people move into the town and young family households have started to balance retirement communities. In 2014, 54% of residents were between 20 and 64, while 24% were over 65 years old, and there was an average age of 43. In 2013, the Office for National Statistics named an area in Meads as the first place in the UK to have an average resident age exceeding 70, with an average age of 71.1, compared with a national average age of 39.7. 29% of households do not have cars or vans. Ethnically, the town was said to be 93.7% white in 2007. Eastbourne has residents from a diverse range of international backgrounds, including notable groups of people from recent Polish, Portuguese, Chinese, Turkish, Italian and Greek origin. The 2001 UK Census indicated that the largest non-white ethnic group at the time was Chinese. Studies conducted by the local council in 2008 reflected growth in new residents from Eastern Europe, particularly Poland. Unemployment in Eastbourne was below the national average in 2013 figures, at 4.1% compared to 4.4% for England and Wales. The percentage of economically active people increased between 2001‚Äì2011. There has also been an upward trend in recent years, in the number of people with higher education qualifications.  Economy  With a population of more than 100,000 people, Eastbourne has been a fast-growing town in the past few years, relative to the rest of the UK. Development around Eastbourne's Sovereign Harbour, Britain's largest composite marina, has created more than 3,000 new homes and an innovation centre for small businesses. Eastbourne is home to companies in a wide range of industries. Eastbourne's Chamber of Commerce has more than 500 members and holds many networking events to facilitate local business links. In 2008, Eastbourne was judged to have low productivity, in a national assessment by the National Audit Office.Annual Business Inquiry, UK National Audit Office (2008) Productivity, measured by gross value added per employee, was recorded as ¬£31,390 per year. This compared unfavourably with the South East overall, where GVA was ¬£40,460 per employee per year. A possible explanation for this is that a high proportion of workers are in sectors which have relatively low productivity and wages.East Sussex Local Transport Plan 2011‚Äì2026, East Sussex County Council (2011) In recent years, five areas within Eastbourne have regularly featured in the most economically deprived 10% in all of England. Measured as Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), two areas within Devonshire ward, two areas within Hampden Park, and one area within Langney, are all among the most deprived LSOAs in the country. Three quarters of LSOAs in the town (45 LSOAs or 76%) had a worse ranking for deprivation in 2010 than in 2007.Indices of Multiple Deprivation (East Sussex in Figures), UK Department for Communities & Local Government, 2010  Technology and creative sectors  In 2016, UK innovation charity NESTA named Eastbourne as a \\"creative cluster\\", with 969 creative firms representing 9.1% of total businesses in the town and providing employment for 2,703 people.  Tourism sector  Eastbourne beach and parade with Beachy Head in the background Eastbourne Pier in June 2018 The seafront at Eastbourne consists almost entirely of Victorian hotels. Along with its pier and bandstand, this serves to preserve the front in a somewhat timeless manner. The Duke of Devonshire retains the rights to the seafront buildings and does not allow them to be developed into shops. A stretch of of shingle beach stretches from Sovereign Harbour in the east to Beachy Head in the west. In a 1998 survey, 56% of visitors said that the beach and seafront was one of Eastbourne's best features, although 10% listed the pebbled beach as a dislike. Other recreation facilities include two swimming pools, three fitness centres and other smaller sports clubs including scuba diving. A children's adventure park is sited at the eastern end of the seafront. There are various other establishments scattered around the town such as crazy golf, go‚Äìkarting and Laser Quest. The pier is an obvious place to visit and is sometimes used to hold events, such as the international birdman competition held annually, although this was cancelled in 2005 due to a lack of competitors. An annual raft competition used to take place where competitors, usually local businesses, circumnavigate the pier in a raft made by themselves, while being attacked by a water-cannon. A major event in the tourist programme of Eastbourne Borough Council is Eastbourne Airbourne, a large air show, held annually in August. Reports claim a ¬£365m revenue from visitors in 2010, with an estimated 7,160 jobs supported by tourism.  Large employers  The town is home to the UK's largest book wholesalers, who have a 350,000 sq ft warehouse facility there. Gardners Books are one of the town's largest employers, with a majority of staff involved in packing and shipping books. A majority of Eastbourne's total employment is offered by small private businesses, though Eastbourne District General Hospital is a significant public sector employer. In 2010, it was assessed that Eastbourne had a public sector employment rate of 25.4% of overall jobs. This was noted as below average, compared with the UK as a whole.  Electricity supply  Eastbourne Electric Light Co. started up on 4 September 1882 illuminating The Parades with 22 Brush arc lamps. Several large shops were lit with incandescent lamps powered from generators located at the Bedfordwell waterworks. An alternating current system was introduced in 1883, from a generating plant at The Old Brewery in Junction Road. By 1888 there were 1,700 lamps on the system; a new generating plant was added in 1899 including 30 kW, 75 kW, 100 kW, 50 kW, 150 kW and 200 kW generators. There were five circuits distributing electricity around the town through rubber insulated cables. After a few years the rubber deteriorated and faults were frequent. The Eastbourne Corporation purchased the undertaking on 1 January 1900 and the original Electricity Works was closed down in July 1902. Eastbourne County Borough Corporation began construction of Eastbourne power station in the first decade of the twentieth century. It supplied electricity, firstly for street lighting then other uses. The station had a single brick chimney and three wooden cooling towers. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of the station passed to the British Electricity Authority and then to the Central Electricity Generating Board. In 1954 the station generated 2,652 MWh of electricity and burned 3,500 tons of coal. In 1966 the power station had a generating capacity of 9.0 MW and delivered 3,165 MWh of electricity.CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1966, CEGB, London The CEGB later closed the station and it was subsequently demolished.  Culture  Devonshire Park Theatre, completed in 1884.  Towner Art Gallery  The Towner Art Gallery is Eastbourne's principal arts gallery and arts education hub. After being located for many years in Eastbourne Manor House, within Gildredge Park, it relocated next to the Congress Theatre in 2009. The gallery holds one of the most important collections of public art in southern England.  Theatres  Eastbourne has three council-owned theatres: the Grade II* listed Congress Theatre, the Grade II listed Devonshire Park Theatre and the Grade II listed Winter Garden. The Grade II listed Royal Hippodrome Theatre used to be council-owned, but is now run by an independent charitable trust. The Devonshire Park Theatre is a fine example of a Victorian theatre with ornate interior decorations, and plays host to touring dramas and comedies and an annual local pantomime. The Royal Hippodrome has the longest running summer show in Britain. The London Philharmonic Orchestra makes regular appearances and has an annual season at the Congress Theatre. Other theatre venues in the town include the volunteer- run Underground Theatre, in the basement of the town's Central Library, and the Lamb Theatre, based at the Lamb Inn in Old Town, which was launched in August 2009 but reinstated an older tradition at the pub.  Cinemas  Eastbourne had two cinemas: the Curzon Cinema and Cineworld. The Curzon Cinema was a small, family-run, independent cinema in Langney Road, in the town centre, which closed in January 2020. Cineworld is a large Multiplex cinema with eight screens, in the Beacon shopping centre. In 2013, the owners of the Curzon Cinema declared themselves \\"shocked\\" at the threats to their venue from a newly announced eight-screen multiplex, to be built in a renovated Arndale Centre nearby (the Centre has been renamed as The Beacon).  Music venues  Eastbourne Bandstand lies on the seafront, between the Wish Tower and the pier. It stages 1812 Firework Concerts, Rock N Roll nights, Big Band concerts, Promenade concerts and tribute bands. There was once a second similar bandstand (also built in 1935) in the 'music gardens' near the Redoubt Fortress. The bandstand was removed to make way for the Pavilion Tearooms but the colonnades built around it are still there (behind the tea rooms). Before 1935 each of these sites had a smaller \\"birdcage\\" bandstand; the one in the music gardens having been moved from a rather precarious position opposite the Albion Hotel. The kiosk in the music gardens was originally one of the toll kiosks at the entrance to the pier. Grove Road is the location of two independent record shops and a venue called Printer's Playhouse (which hosts performances of live music and new plays).  Media  Former local radio station Sovereign FM is now More Radio Eastbourne, broadcasting to Eastbourne from studios in Worthing. Regional radio stations, Heart Sussex, (previously Southern FM) has, since mid 2019, been networked from London and no longer has a Sussex base, which was previously in Portslade and BBC Sussex which broadcasts from Brighton. BBC South East Today and ITV Meridian are the two regional news channels.  Depictions in popular culture  The seafront and the iconic cliff at Beachy Head has been used for many scenes in feature films, and the local council set up a film liaison unit to encourage and facilitate the shooting of film sequences in and around the town. The 2006 Academy Award-nominated film Notes on a Scandal includes scenes filmed at Beachy Head, Cavendish Hotel and 117 Royal Parade. Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters were used as backdrops for scenes from the Quidditch World Cup in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Scenes from Half a Sixpence (1969) were filmed on the pier and near to the bandstand. The seafront area was also used for the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging directed by Gurinder Chadha. The Langham Hotel was a filming location for Made in Dagenham, which also featured the seafront and pier. A sequence of a rainy day at the seaside for the Doel family has as its backdrop the Wish Tower, the bandstand, the Cavendish Hotel and the pier in the 1987 British/American drama film 84 Charing Cross Road directed by David Jones.84 Charing Cross Road, Columbia Pictures, EAN 5035822111134 Television too has used Eastbourne as a backdrop. The series Little Britain had the character Emily Howard strolling along the promenade. Other brief appearances were made in the television series Agatha Christie's Marple, The Two Ronnies, French and Saunders and Foyle's War. A sequence of sketches that appear in each episode of Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, was shot in the old Jo Pip's / Cunninghams theatre venue on Seaside Road, which has since been developed into flats. The 1993 BBC drama series Westbeach was filmed on location in Eastbourne and surrounding areas. The elderly female residents of Eastbourne were the inspiration for the song \\"Eastbourne Ladies\\" by English singer Kevin Coyne, which appeared on his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade.  Parks and gardens  Manor Gardens, a small park adjoining Gildredge Park, and containing Manor House (1776) Eastbourne has numerous parks and gardens, although there are several smaller open spaces including Upperton Gardens, the Carpet Gardens and the Western Lawns. The first public park in Eastbourne was Hampden Park, originally owned by Lord Willingdon and opened on 12 August 1902. Facilities include: football pitches, rugby club, indoor bowls, a large lake (formerly a Decoy pond), lakeside cafe, children's recreation area, tennis courts, BMX and skate facility, disc golf course (target) and woodland. The largest and newest park is Shinewater Park, located on the west side of Langney and opened in 2002. There is a large fishing lake, basketball, football pitches, a BMX and skate park and children's playground. Gildredge Park is a large open park located between the town centre and Old Town; it is very popular with families and has a children's playground, cafe, tennis courts, disc golf course (target) and bowls lawns. The smaller, adjoining, Manor Gardens combines both lawns and shady areas as well as a rose garden. Until 2005, Manor Gardens was the home of the Towner Gallery. This gallery incorporated a permanent exhibition of local art and historical items, plus temporary art exhibitions of regional and national significance. It was relocated to a new, ¬£8.6 million purpose-built facility adjacent to the Congress Theatre, Devonshire Park which opened on 4 April 2009. Princes Park obtained its name during a visit by the Duke of Windsor as Prince of Wales in 1931. Located at the eastern end of the seafront, it has a children's playground with paddling pool, cafe, bowls and a large lake, noted for its swans. The lake is used by a nearby water-sports centre, which offers kayak and windsurfing training. Princes Park lake is also home to Eastbourne Model Powerboat Club and Eastbourne Model Yacht Club. Close by are tennis and basketball courts and a football pitch. At the north of the park is the Oval, home of Eastbourne United F.C.. On 21 July 2018, the park hosted the town's second LGBTQ+ Pride event which was attended by over 4,000 people. Devonshire Park, home to the pre-Wimbledon ladies tennis championships, is located just off the seafront in the towns cultural district. Other parks include: Helen Gardens and the Italian Gardens at the western end of the seafront, Sovereign Park between the main seafront and the marina and Motcombe Gardens in Old Town. Eastbourne's floral displays have been promoted, including the Carpet Gardens along the coastal road near the pier. The displays, and the town, have won the award the 'Coastal Resort B' category in the 2003 Britain in Bloom competition.  Sport  Devonshire Park Lawn Tennis Club ‚Äì opened 1874 Eastbourne's Devonshire Park is the venue for the Eastbourne International, a tennis tournament held in the town since 1974 and serving as a warm-up to Wimbledon. Previously a women only tournament, in 2009 the Lawn Tennis Association merged it with the men only event the Nottingham Open. Eastbourne has four senior football clubs: Eastbourne Borough F.C. play in the Conference South. Eastbourne Town F.C., Eastbourne United Association F.C. and Langney Wanderers F.C. play in the Southern Combination League Premier. Langney Wanderers F.C. won promotion to the Southern Combination League Division One. in 2018 Eastbourne Eagles are a speedway club located at Arlington Stadium, just outside the town. Between 1997‚Äì2014 they competed in the Elite League, the highest level of speedway in the UK. They were champions in 2000. They now compete in the National League. Arlington stadium also sees stock-car racing on Wednesday evenings in the summer months. Eastbourne hosted a triathlon in 2016 and 2017, which attracted professional triathletes such as Ben Allen, Jacqui Slack, Lawrence Fanous and 2012 Biathle world champion Richard Stannard in addition to the hundreds of amateurs taking part. The event takes in the town's major landmarks, including the promenade and local South Downs National Park. Other local sports clubs include cricket, hockey, rugby, lacrosse and golf. Among Eastbourne's golf courses are the Royal Eastbourne, Eastbourne Downs, Willingdon and the Eastbourne Golfing Park. There is an annual extreme sports festival held at the eastern end of the seafront. Eastbourne Sovereign Sailing Club, on the seafront towards the eastern end, organises dinghy sailing for its members and visitors from Easter to Boxing Day and usually holds a National Championship Series for a popular UK class in the summer months.  Landmarks  Beachy Head and lighthouse, one of Eastbourne's landmarks  Beachy Head and the Downs  The Eastbourne Downland provides a spectacular backdrop to the town. The 4,000 acres of farmland and downland are owned by the town of Eastbourne, following the 1926 Eastbourne Corporation Act, which aimed to protect their unspoilt beauty \\"in perpetuity\\". The Eastbourne Downs include Beachy Head cliff, to the west of the town, a famous beauty spot and an infamous suicide spot. Statistics are not officially published to reduce suicidal mimicry, but unofficial statistics show it to be the third most common suicide spot. The lighthouse at the foot of the cliff came into operation in October 1902. Although originally manned by two keepers, it has been remotely monitored by Trinity House via a landline since June 1983. Prior to its construction, shipping had been warned by the Belle Tout Lighthouse on the cliff top some to the west. Belle Tout Lighthouse was operational from 1834 to 1902, and closed because its light was not visible in mist and low cloud. It became a private residence, but was severely damaged in the Second World War by Canadian artillery. In 1956, it was rebuilt as a house and remains a dwelling to this day. In March 1999, the structure was moved back from the cliff edge to save it from plunging into the sea. The structure may need to be moved again to safeguard it from cliff erosion.  Eastbourne Pier  Eastbourne Pier was built between 1866 and 1872 at the junction of Grand and Marine Parades. The pier interrupts what would otherwise have been a ribbon development of buildings ‚Äì to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east. The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of ¬£15,000 and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by Lord Edward Cavendish on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed until two years later. On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt at a higher level, creating a drop towards the end of the pier. The pier is effectively built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300 metres (1000 ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of ¬£250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1,000-seater theatre, bar, camera obscura and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier. Access to the camera obscura was destroyed by an arson attack in 1970, but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built. = Eastbourne Pier fire = On 30 July 2014, a fire broke out in the middle building of the pier. BBC News reported that 80 firefighters attended the scene. One third of the pier was badly damaged. On 19 August 2014, a worker from Cumbria died after falling through the decking of the damaged pier. Central government paid Eastbourne Borough Council ¬£2m in one-off funding, to compensate for lost income to the town from the temporary loss of the attraction. The Council spent this on a variety of projects and events in the hope of boosting the local economy.  Eastbourne Redoubt  Eastbourne Redoubt on Royal Parade is one of three examples of a type of fortress built to withstand potential invasion from Napoleon's forces in the early 19th century. It houses collections from the Royal Sussex Regiment, the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars and the Sussex Combined Services Collection; including four Victoria Crosses and General Hans-J√ºrgen von Arnim's Steyr Automobile 1500A Afrika Korps Staff Car.  Education  Eastbourne's reputation for health, enhanced by bracing air and sea breezes contributed to the establishment of many independent schools in the 19th century and in 1871, the year which saw the arrival of Queenwood Ladies College, the town was just beginning a period of growth and prosperity. By 1896, Gowland's Eastbourne Directory listed 76 private schools for boys and girls. However, economic difficulties during the inter-war years saw a gradual decline in the number of independent schools. In 1930, the headmistress of Clovelly-Kepplestone, a well-established boarding school for girls, referred to \\"heavy financial losses experienced by schools in the past few years\\". In 1930, this school was forced to merge its junior and senior departments; in 1931, one of its buildings was sold off, and in 1934 the school closed altogether. Finally, indicative of the changes that would later befall many of the larger buildings in the town, the school was demolished to make way for a block of flats, which was completed in 1939. The Eastbourne (Blue Book) Directory for 1938 lists 39 independent schools in the town. With the fall of France in June 1940, and the risk of invasion, most left ‚Äì the majority never to return. By 2007, the number had reduced to just four: St. Andrew's Prep School, Eastbourne College, St. Bede's Preparatory School and Roedean Moira House, a school for girls aged up to 18. Eastbourne has 6 state secondary schools, 17 state primary schools, 1 primary special school and 2 secondary special schools. Parts of the University of Brighton are based in the Meads area of the town. There are several language colleges and schools, with students coming mainly from Europe. East Sussex College is a large further education college with a campus in Eastbourne. This state-funded college provides a range of GCSE, GCE A Level, BTEC and vocational programmes for students aged 16‚Äì19 years of age, plus a full range of adult FE programmes. It originated from a 2001 merger between Lewes Tertiary College and Eastbourne College of Arts and Technology (ECAT) to form Sussex Downs College, which then took over Park College (the old Eastbourne Sixth Form college) in 2003. In 2018, a further merger with Sussex Coast College in Hastings formed the current East Sussex College.  Health and emergency services  The town is served by Eastbourne District General Hospital, part of East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. As of 2014, the maternity unit of the hospital has been permanently transferred to the Conquest Hospital, Hastings after years of campaigning to save the unit. An earlier hospital, St Mary's, opened on Vicarage Road in 1877 as the infirmary to the local workhouse; it was demolished in 1990. Eastbourne Fire Station is in Whitley Road, and the town's police station is in Grove Road. Eastbourne has an RNLI lifeboat station. A new boat named Diamond Jubilee was launched in 2012 by the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Eastbourne Blind Society was founded in 1923 to support eight war-blinded veterans. In 1963 a centre in Longstone Road was opened and in 2018 the society had almost 800 members.  Religious life  As well as the medieval parish church of St Mary in Old Town, another remarkable church building in Eastbourne is the redbrick St Saviour's and St Peter's. Originally consecrated under the former name in 1872, it was designed by George Edmund Street but merged with St Peter's in 1971 when the latter was made redundant and demolished. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a generously proportioned building with a tall Gothic interior.Joan Kennedy, Our Lady of Ransom, in Gratitude and Hope, Our Lady of Ransom Catholic Church, Eastbourne, 2001. One of the windows commemorates the exiled Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, Prince Lev Sapieha, who lived in the town,The Coat of Arms magazine, N.S. Volume XI, No. 172, Winter 1995, p. 174 and there is much other artwork in the building. The recently formed Personal Ordinariate of Anglicans reconciled to the Catholic Church meets at St Agnes, another Victorian Gothic building. The tall flint tower of St Michael's at Ocklynge is one of Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built on the site of the mission hall where the nonsense writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. TThe Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings,N. Pevsner, Buildings of England series: Sussex including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne. There is a tradition of Judaism in Eastbourne, and a Jewish rest home. The Islamic community uses a small mosque that was formerly the Seeboard social club.  Transport  Eastbourne railway station Eastbourne is connected by road to London by the A22, and to Brighton and Hove and Hastings by the nearby A27. The car is the most used form of transport in the town, with only 6% of journeys taken by bus; the local council transport plan aims to reduce the amount of car usage. Bus services within Eastbourne have been provided by Stagecoach Group under the name Stagecoach in Eastbourne since November 2008, when the company acquired Eastbourne Buses, a service run by the local council, and subsequently the independent company Cavendish Motor Services. Eastbourne Buses had been formed in 1903 by the County Borough of Eastbourne, who were the first local authority in the world authorised to run motor buses. As well as local journeys within the town, Stagecoach also runs routes to Polegate, Hailsham, Tunbridge Wells, Uckfield and East Grinstead at various frequencies, while the two routes to Hastings via Bexhill are run by Stagecoach South East from Hastings. The other main operator into Eastbourne is Brighton & Hove, owned by the Go-Ahead Group, which runs frequent services seven days a week from Brighton via Seaford and Newhaven. Limited numbers of additional buses are run by the Cuckmere Buses, and a regular National Express coach service operates daily from London's Victoria Coach Station. The main railway station is situated in the town centre and is served by Southern. The present station (the town's third), designed by F. D. Bannister, dates from 1886. It was originally on what was termed the Eastbourne BranchHandbook of Stations ... on the Railways of Great Britain and Ireland British Transport Commission (Railway Clearing House) 1956 from Polegate. There was a rarely used triangular junction between Polegate and the now-closed Stone Cross which allowed trains to bypass the Branch; the track has now been lifted. Also on the erstwhile Branch is Hampden Park railway station to the north of the town. Regular services along the coast have invariably served Eastbourne. All trains, because of the layout, have to pass through Hampden Park once in each direction. This has the effect of making the Hampden Park level crossing very busy. Indeed, it is thought to be the busiest in the country. Regular services are to London Victoria, Gatwick Airport, Hastings and Ashford International and a commuter service to Brighton. Trains leave from London Victoria to Eastbourne with a journey time of 1hr 36mins. A miniature tramway once ran a mile across \\"the Crumbles\\" (then undeveloped) from near Princes Park/Wartling Road towards Langney Point. It opened in 1954 but ceased operation in 1970, relocating to Seaton in Devon after the owners had fallen out with the council; it is now the Seaton Tramway.

In recent years, the settlements has absorbed around 30 new families, mostly the children of the founding members.Hareuveni, Immanuel; Eretz Yisrael Lexicon; Ministry of Education p.796 Economy Most of the settlement's residents earn their living from agriculture. The younger members work in both agriculture and other jobs. In the 2013 the settlement had 3,960 dunams of cultivated land, of which 2,700 dunams was used for date palms, 800 for vineyards, 400 for vegetables (mostly peppers) and 60 for flowers. Most of the agricultural output is designated for export. Community and civic services The settlement operates two kindergartens, several clubs for the members, a synagogue, pool, grocery store and recreation sites. Some of the electricity is created by solar panels in the settlements and some residents also use solar panels for their personal use.

The libretto is William Shakespeare's The Tempest, as abridged by the composer. The title is derived from Caliban's line, \\"This isle is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs, which give delight and hurt not.\\" It premiered in June 1991 in H√©rouville-Saint-Clair, Calvados, France, with the L'Ensemble de Basse-Normandie conducted by Dominique Debart. Three members of Saporta's dance company provided the singing. The opera is scored for one soprano, one contralto, and one tenor, two saxophones, and orchestra. The three singers are not assigned roles on character lines. They are voices, \\"carriers of text\\", and two or three singers often sing the role of a single character at points in the opera, and no character is sung consistently by any one voice. As originally performed, the dancers portrayed the characters. Nyman's liner notes of the recording give no indication of how the opera could be staged dramatically without the dancers, even though which title is used is dependent upon whether dancers are utilized. The opera-only version, which premiered in 1993, also includes more of Shakespeare's text. Nyman and Saporta collaborated on Prospero's Books, Peter Greenaway's film version of The Tempest, and were interested in working further with the play. Nyman did not base his score on that he wrote for Prospero's Books, but began a new score from scratch, occasionally interpolating music from the previous score as is his wont. He chose not to set Ariel's songs or the Masque, which he had already set, but he allows for them to be interpolated into the opera. Some of the music, such as in \\"The fringed curtains of thine eye advance\\" and \\"Ye elves\\" are known to be derived from La Travers√©e de Paris. The instrumental piece that became \\"Ye elves\\" is retitled \\"Miranda Previsted\\" on The Very Best of Michael Nyman: Film Music 1980-2001. Libretto The libretto, an abridgement of Shakespeare's play (with some slight wording changes) is divided into seventeen sections: #If by your Art, my dearest father (Act I, Scene 2) #Alas, poor Milan! (Act I, Scene 2) #Be't to fly (Act I, Scene 2) #This damned witch Sycorax (Act I, Scene 2) #The fringed curtains of thine eye advance (Act I, Scene 2) #There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple (Act I, Scene 2) #How lush and lusty the grass looks! (Act II, Scene 1) #Riches, poverty, and use of service, none (Act II, Scene 1) #Sometime like apes/The master, the gunner,Shakespeare's text has \\"swabber\\" here, with \\"gunner\\" on the next line. Nyman's version has \\"gunner\\" in both places. He has never explained this, but Summers sang it as Nyman included it in the libretto on the recording. the boatswain, and I (Act II, Scene 2) #Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard (Act III, Scene 1) #'Tis a custom in the afternoon to sleep (Act III, Scenes 2 and 3) #I have made you mad (Act III, Scene 3, Act IV, Scene 1) #You do look, my son, in a moved sort (Act IV, Scene 1, Act V, Scene 1) #Ye elves (Act V, Scene 1) #Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. (Act V, Scene 1) #Sir, she is mortal (Act V, Scene 1) #My tricksy spirit! (Act V, Scene 1) Nyman allows for \\"The Masque\\", written for Prospero's Books, to be inserted between Sections 12 and 13. If the Ariel songs were included (which Nyman says nothing about doing in the liner notes, and the music as recorded does not necessarily pause), \\"Come Unto These Yellow Sands\\" and \\"Full Fathom Five\\" would come between sections 4 and 5, \\"While You Here Do Snoring Lie\\" between sections 8 and 9, \\"Come and Go\\" immediately before \\"The Masque,\\" and \\"Where the Bee Sucks\\" just before \\"Behold, sir King\\" as divided on the album, based on the order of the text in the play. Album The album, Nyman's 25th release, was released by Argo Records on May 16, 1995. It has a running time of 72:35. It was again performed by L'Ensemble de Basse-Normandie conducted by Dominque Debart. The saxophones are played by David Roach and Andrew Findon. It is the fourth release of Nyman's music that Nyman himself supervised, on which he provides liner notes and produced, but neither performs nor conducts. The album is the first of Nyman's many collaborations with Hilary Summers.

Whether he had just three fingers on one of his hands is not confirmed. Dunlop was born in Texas and spent most of his mid to late teens as a cowboy. Where he became an outlaw is unknown, but he was arrested after several bank robberies in 1893. Released from prison in 1895, Dunlop joined the \\"Black Jack\\" Christian Gang, but by 1898 he was riding with Burt Alvord's Gang, along with George and Louis Owens, Billy Stiles, Bravo Juan Yoas, and Bob Brown. The gang began robbing trains in Arizona, and \\"Three Fingered Jack\\" Dunlop quickly became the best known. At midnight on September 9, 1899, the gang robbed a Southern Pacific Express of just over $10,000. The gang had detached the car containing the money, then opened the safe with dynamite. They escaped into the Chiricahua Mountains, where they eluded a posse led by Sheriff Scott White and including George Scarborough. A few months later, they struck again. On February 15, 1900, the gang robbed a train at the Fairbank, which served Tombstone, Arizona. However, well known lawman Jeff Davis Milton was working as a guard on the train. A gunfight began, resulting in Milton shooting buckshot into Dunlop, and wounding gang member Juan Yoas. Milton was badly wounded in the right arm, but the gang fled anyway. Dunlop's wound was serious, as he had been hit by eleven pellets from the shotgun, mostly in the stomach area, whereas Yoas had been shot in the butt. The five outlaws soon split up, planning to meet outside of Contention City, Arizona. Dunlop fell from his horse only a few miles from the robbery, and he lay there for fourteen hours before a posse found him. He was taken to Tombstone, where he gave an interview to Tombstone newspaper The Prospector before dying on February 24, 1900. Dunlop is buried near the graves of Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and Billy Clanton, in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery.

Records manufactured with this technology are often marked by a \\"DMM\\" logo on the outer record sleeve. Many current production high quality pressings, as well as standard production LPs from the 1990s, only indicate its use by inscribing \\"DMM\\" in the lead-out groove area of the disc. Neumann was responsible for manufacturing the actual DMM cutting equipment as part of its VMS80 series lathes. Unlike conventional disc mastering, where the mechanical audio modulation is cut onto a lacquer-coated aluminum disc, DMM cuts straight into metal (copper), utilizing a high frequency carrier system and specialized diamond styli, vibrating at more than 40 kHz (i.e. 60 kHz) US patent 4484320 to facilitate the cutting.  Overview  The advantages of DMM (hard surface material) over acetate lacquer cutting (soft surface material) are both sonic and practical: because of the rigidity of the master disc medium, no groove wall bounce-back effects take place after the cutting has been completed. This preserves the original modulation details in the groove walls much better, especially those involved with sudden fast attacks (transients). The improved transient response, as well as the more linear phase response of DMM improve the overall stability and depth-of-field in the stereo image. In addition, disturbing adjacent groove print-through sounds (groove echoes) are reduced in DMM. Also, there is no need to rush the finalized master disc directly into a refrigerator for groove preservation, as in conventional lacquer disc cutting, before processing the master disc to produce matrices for the pressing of the records. The cutting lathe for DMM engraves the audio signal directly onto a copper-plated master disc, instead of engraving the groove into a lacquer-coated aluminum disc. Examination of early DMM discs revealed what appeared to be a high frequency modulation in the groove, thought to be caused by the use of an ultrasonic carrier tone. In fact, there was no carrier tone and the modulation was simply caused by the vibration (squeal) of the cutter head as it was dragged through the copper disc. The DMM copper master disc can be plated to produce the required number of stampers using the one-step plating process. Rather than having to electroform a master (or \\"father\\"), mother and then stampers (the traditional \\"three-step process\\"), the DMM copper disc serves as the 'mother\\". Bypassing the silvering process and two electroforming stages reduces the risk of introducing noise that can be generated in the electroforming (galvanic) process. In cases where hundreds of stampers may be required, the DMM disc is often used as a mandrel to electroform a master and mother, from which many stampers are then made. Chemical passivation of the metal surface of each part precludes \\"plating,\\" so the parts can be mechanically separated from each other upon removal from the tank. Along with mechanical audio recording, DMM is now more or less a thing of the past (certainly not in the mainstream of the sound recording industry any longer). Since the sale of Neumann to German microphone manufacturer Sennheiser, Neumann no longer produces lathes or supplies parts. The lathes in use today are kept operational by independent service consultants, as well as cutting room personnel themselves, often by buying incomplete lathes and stripping them for parts. The DMM specification also includes a profile for the pressing of 12-inch records. To the naked eye, this profile has no obvious contour on the face of the record giving the appearance of a totally flat-faced record. For the purpose of compression moulding, which is the process by which records are pressed, the face of the record does indeed have a contour and a cross-sectional view of a 12-inch record will reveal that it is wedge shaped from the centre to the edge. The lack of obvious contour in the groove area on the face of the record closely replicates the original disc surface and reduces playback errors. Pressing records with this profile was mandatory for a record to bear the \\"DMM\\" logo. DMM licensees that did not use this profile were unable to use the DMM logo on its products, but were of course free to use terms such as \\"Mastered on Copper\\" as did EMI Australia when not using the DMM-profiled moulds or when cutting a DMM master for another record manufacturer. The best example of a DMM pressing can usually be found on the Teldec (Germany) or EMI (UK) labels from the early 1980s. The decline of vinyl records in favour of the compact disc, saw many Neumann VMS82 DMM lathes converted for cutting lacquer discs as few plants were able to process DMM masters and so many disc cutting facilities conformed to the industry standard - cutting on lacquer. As of 2009, there are six or seven DMM cutting facilities left in the world‚Äîall located in Europe. The USA lost its last DMM cutting facility in 2005 with the demise of New York City-based record manufacturer Europadisk LLC. Europadisk's DMM lathe was sold at auction on 20-SEP-05 to the Church of Scientology for US $72,500. The DMM concept was a spin-off of RCA's SelectaVision development of CED videodisc recording equipment both in Indianapolis as well as the David Sarnoff Research Facility in Princeton NJ who traded it to Teldec for other research it used in other capacities. After further development, Teldec attempted to sell its DMM technology back to RCA, however RCA was not interested. Therefore, as a result, all DMM titles from RCA and subsidiary labels were all mastered elsewhere. Although Neumann produced, demonstrated and promoted a successful prototype CD Mastering unit for DMM, it never went into commercial production. Most of the remaining original spare parts were purchased from Neumann by the UK disc cutting consultant Sean Davies, who carried on repair maintenance of existing systems since Neumann stopped production.Resolution Magazine (UK) feature story about disc cutting and interview of Sean Davies The photo at right shows a DMM copper disc sitting on a very early Neumann AM series lathe from the late-1930s. The cutterhead shown is the Neumann SX74 for cutting lacquer discs (not copper discs) and was introduced in 1974.  Advantages and disadvantages  The direct metal mastering technology addresses the lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, caused by the cutting stylus unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as post-echo, 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume. Another improvement is noise reduction. The lacquer mastering method bears a higher risk of adding unwanted random noise to the recording, caused by the enclosure of small dust particles when spraying the silvering on the lacquer master, which is the necessary first step of the electroplating process for reproduction of the master disc. As the DMM master disc is already made of metal (copper), this step is not required, and its faults are avoided. With the groove being cut straight into a metal foil, this removed a number of plating stages in the manufacturing process. This gave rise to more upper frequency levels and less surface noise. Additionally, groove pre-echo problems are significantly diminished. Bass is typically tight and well defined, even described as more accurate than the fat, mushy sound of lacquered vinyl pressings. Because of the modulation arising from this cutting method, criticisms have arisen of the sound of such 'DMM' records. They are often labelled as bright or edgy. DMM LP pressings are sometimes described as having a harshness or forwardness in the high frequencies. The fact the groove is cut to copper, a hard metal, and not to soft lacquer, nitrocellulose, supposedly endows DMM vinyl LP with a very different tonality to traditionally manufactured vinyl LP pressings. Direct metal mastering requires a radically different cutting angle than traditional (lacquer) cutting, almost 0 degrees.US patent 4484320 However the playback cartridges will always have the standard playback angle of 15‚Äì22.5¬∞. Thus, the DMM process includes electronic audio processing US patent 4538256 so the records can be played with a standard cartridge despite having been cut at a substantially different angle. This electronic processing might account for the supposedly different high frequency \\"signature sound\\" of DMM records.  Digital recordings  A similar technique, developed by Teldec is used for digital records on CDs and DVDs.

He studied with Alec Wyton at Union Theological Seminary in New York, and he was also Wyton's assistant at The Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine. For three years (1965‚Äì1968), he served St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) as Director of Music. Later, Powell was Director of Music and Organist of Christ Church (Episcopal) of Greenville, South Carolina from 1968 to 2003. He has composed in nearly all genres common to church music, including anthems, service music, hymn concertatos, organ music, music for handbell choir, and large-scale oratorios. Powell's conservative, neo-Romantic style stems from his practical approach to composition. According to Powell himself, he writes for \\"choirs of twenty-five because that's what most choirs are. When you come right down to it, most choirs are not of cathedral ability or size. My pieces are all practical things and useful for specific occasions.\\" His publications appear in The Hymnal 1982 as well as in the catalogs of most of the significant American publishers of church music. According to publisher GIA, Powell is \\"a composer whose output bridges denominational boundaries and who is able to serve the larger Church.

Versions *Imaginiff (The Original) *Imaginiff Revised Edition *Imaginiff the Card Game Object The winner is the first to get their token all the way around the board to the center. Setup If there are 8 players, everyone will put their name in the spaces on the outer part of the board. If there are less than 8, the name of someone else that everybody knows should be in the blank spaces. Then the grey token is placed on any name on the outside of the board. (It can not be placed on the challenge space.) The number cards are separated from the question cards. The number cards (numbered one to six) of the same color are given to the player whose token matches that color. Then the question cards are placed in a pile or in the box provided. Rules The player that goes first rolls the die and moves the grey token that many spaces around the outside spaces, clockwise or counterclockwise. If the grey token lands on a name, that name becomes the subject of the card. The player then picks a question card and reads it out loud, inserting the subject into the blank space. A card usually says something like \\"Imaginiff _____ was ... Which would they be [or do]?\\" and lists six numbered choices. They then place the card down for everyone to see. Now, all players look through their number cards and pick the number card that corresponds to the answer they want. When all players have placed down a card, everyone flips theirs over. To move a player's token, they need to have picked the most popular answer. All players that have the most popular answer move 1 space, except the person who rolled the dice, who moves 2 if they picked the most popular answer. If two or more answers are tied, all players that picked either answer move forward. For example, if 3 players picked number 2, another 3 players picked 5, and 2 other people picked 4, everyone who picked 2 or 5 moves forward. In the event that 2 or more players get their tokens to the center at the same time, a tiebreaker round is played. All players who are not in the center remove their tokens from the board. However, they still play by choosing the card with the most popular answer. The tied players continue playing as usual by rolling the die and moving the grey token, and any tied player who fails to come up with the most popular answer must remove their token from the board, but may continue playing by putting down cards for the most popular answer. If all the tied players fail to come up with the most popular answer, or they tie for the most popular answer, no one is eliminated. When only one player is left with their token in the center, they win.

In 2001, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for the trafficking of commercial quantities of cannabis resin.Gilligan begins 28-year drugs sentence, RT√â News, 15 March 2001 On appeal, this sentence was reduced to 20 years.Gilligan sentence reduced by eight years, RT√â News, 12 November 2003 On 15 October 2013, Gilligan was released after serving 17 years in prison.  Murder of Veronica Guerin  In 2002, Gilligan was tried and acquitted of the murder of the investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, who was reportedly working on a tip-off from an Irish politician who was also prominent in equestrian circles. She was investigating Gilligan's involvement in the illegal recreational drugs trade in Ireland. After her murder, the Garda√≠ had more than 100 officers working on the case at one point, leading to 214 arrests, 39 convictions, and 100 confiscations of guns, ¬£5,000,000 worth of drugs and ¬£6,500,000 worth of property. However, Gilligan's assets remained frozen by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). On 30 January 2006, the High Court cleared the way for the CAB to proceed with an application to have the equestrian centre and other property that belonged to the Gilligan family handed over to the state. In January 2008, making a court appearance in an attempt to stop the state from selling off his assets, Gilligan accused John Traynor of having ordered the murder of Veronica Guerin. After accusing the presiding judge of an attempt to silence him, Gilligan continued to blame a botched Garda√≠ investigation and alleged that the Garda√≠ had planted evidence to secure his conviction, leading to his current term of imprisonment. On 19 December 2008, Gilligan lost an appeal for a second hearing by the High Court. Because of the decision, the CAB applied to the High Court under the Proceeds of Crime Act to dispose of Gilligan's properties. In November 2012, the courts cleared the final barriers allowing the CAB to sell off the equestrian centre and Gilligan's house at Weston Green, Lucan. In July 2014, after a lengthy challenge, a Supreme Court ruling brought the CAB one step closer to selling off the house adjoining the equestrian centre, retained by Gilligan's wife, as well as additional properties in Blanchardstown and Lucan.  Assassination attempt  On 1 March 2014 at 7.00pm, two gunmen came to the home of Gilligan's brother and went into the house while Gilligan was using the toilet. Paramedics from the Dublin Fire Brigade and Advanced Paramedics from the National Ambulance Service arrived at the scene five minutes later with at least four confirmed hits: in his face, chest, hip and leg. He was rushed to James Connolly Memorial Hospital, where he was in a critical state. He was given the last rites as he arrived at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, in Blanchardstown, but he survived the shooting. It was reported on 14 March that the ammunition that was used to shoot him matched ammunition that had been stolen from German police a decade earlier. His bodyguard, Stephen Douglas 'Dougie' Moran, was shot dead on 15 March 2014 in Lucan. After the shooting of Moran, Gilligan was discharged from hospital and then left the country. Civil forfeiture As part of attempts to repress organised crime, including Gilligan's drug trafficking activities, Ireland introduced new civil forfeiture legislation in the wake of the murder of Guerin, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. Gilligan repeatedly challenged its constitutionality in the Supreme Court of Ireland and elsewhere.  Arrest for money laundering  On 23 August 2018, Gilligan was arrested as he tried to board a flight from Belfast International Airport to Spain with more than ‚Ç¨22,000 in a suitcase. He was formally charged with attempting to remove criminal property from Northern Ireland by the North Antrim Magistrates' Court the following day. Following the hearing he was remanded in custody after his lawyer's application for bail was refused.

The advertisements feature comedians Stephen Curry and Dave Lawson and a footballer re-enacting one or more famous incidents from that player's career. Curry plays the straight man to Lawson, while the demeanour of the player varies depending upon that player's personality. The re- enactments take place on a suburban field, and humorous props and set-ups are used to allow the footballer, who is usually long retired, to emulate incidents which he is no longer athletic enough to carry out. It has been reported that the advertisements are largely unscripted; Curry and Lawson arrive with various props and gags in mind, but the players themselves are not told in advance what these props or the script will be. The series began with two advertisements, those of Wayne Harmes and James Hird, and proved to be extremely popular with television viewers. In the years that followed, new instalments were produced and released one at a time, at a rate of one or two new advertisements in each football season. The 2012 version, starring Leigh Matthews won a Bronze medal in the DDB Award for Best 60+ Second TV/Cinema Commercial at the 2012 Melbourne Advertising and Design Awards. In 2010, a new advertisement featured Wally Lewis, a popular National Rugby League identity. This was the first time the campaign sought and featured a different sports code. AFL= Wayne Harmes  Re-enacts the game-winning goal from the 1979 Grand Final, when Carlton's Wayne Harmes dived to tap the ball from the boundary line into the goal square for Ken Sheldon. Harmes recreated the dive using a Slip 'n' Slide. James Hird Re-enacts the game-winning goal from Essendon's Round 3, 2004 win against the West Coast Eagles, where Hird scored the goal, then hugged a random teenage fan in the crowd. The fan is replaced with a confused-looking groundskeeper. Peter Daicos Re-enacts Daicos' tight-angle goal in the 1990 qualifying final. Curry, Lawson and Daicos all don mullet wigs reminiscent of Daicos' hair from the era. Dermott Brereton Re-enacts Brereton's heroics in the 1989 Grand Final. Brereton was knocked unconscious by a heavy shirtfront Geelong's Mark Yeates at the opening bounce. Severely winded and concussed, he was attended to by trainers then began to vomit before jogging back into the play. Only minutes later in the game, he marked and kicked an inspirational goal. He would finish with three goals in a game that Hawthorn would win by six points. In the advertisement, Lawson plays the role of Yeates, and is implied to have hit Brereton with a large plank of wood. Brereton then regathers himself and spits out a mouthful of canned food to simulate the vomiting. They run in slow motion to simulate concussion, and Brereton kicks a goal to finish the advertisement. Malcolm Blight Primarily re-enacts Blight's 70m after-the-siren game-winning goal in Round 10, 1976 at Princes Park. Miniature posts are used to make the distance seem longer, and Lawson blows an airhorn at an unsuspecting Blight to represent the siren. Lawson also pokes fun at Blight for a separate incident where, running into an open goal, he confused the goal posts with the behind posts and kicked the wrong score. Alex Jesaulenko Re-enacts Jesaulenko's famous specky from the 1970 Grand Final. Various methods, including a trampoline, piggy-back and eventually a crane, are used to provide Jesaulenko with the elevation, while Lawson says almost nothing throughout the advertisement except for variations on commentator Mike Williamson's famous call of \\"oh, Jesaulenko, you beauty!\\" Tony Lockett Re-enacts various incidents from Lockett's career, including the pig at full forward incident which raised Lockett's ire, the after-the-siren behind in the 1996 preliminary final which put Sydney into its first Grand Final in more than fifty years (prompting Lawson to comment \\"what a huge behind!\\" to the heavily built Lockett, also displeasing him), and his 1300th goal, with a large crowd of people emerging from nowhere to recreate the pitch invasion. Francis Bourke Re-enacts Bourke's famous courageous display at Arden Street in Round 21, 1980. Bourke, after an accidental collision with a team-mate, was bleeding profusely, then moved to the forward line to score a goal to help Richmond to a narrow victory. The collision is represented as Lawson running Bourke over with a golf cart decorated in Richmond colours, the blood is replaced with tomato sauce, and the whole thing eventually degenerates into a big tomato sauce fight. Bruce Doull Re-enacts two incidents from Doull's career. Firstly, it focuses upon the time that Essendon's Cameron Clayton stole his headband and his team-mate Tony Buhagiar ended up with it and threw it into the Waverley Park crowd, and combined this with the time in a match against Hawthorn, he was tackled around the neck by Kevin Ablett. Bruce chased after Ablett, with the commentator say \\"Bruce Doull has gone berserk\\". Contrary to stories told, he did not have his headband stolen in the Hawthorn game however it was almost the only time the usually docile Doull lost his temper during a game. Lawson plays the part of Clayton, and while Doull blocks his first attempt at stealing the headband, Lawson eventually prevails. He charges around shouting \\"Bruce Doull has gone berserk!\\" while Doull stands motionless. The advertisement then focuses upon the 1982 Grand Final, when he was accosted by streaker Helen d'Amico. d'Amico is also played by Lawson (in a pixellated female nude-suit), while d'Amico herself makes a Hitchcock-esque cameo as an onlooking dog-walker. Kevin Bartlett Re-enacts Bartlett's seven-goal performance in the 1980 Grand Final, won by Richmond by a then- record margin. Curry and Lawson try to teach Bartlett how to handpass, poking fun at his tendency to always kick for goal instead of setting up team-mates, but this only results in Bartlett stealing the ball and kicking more goals. The advertisement also features Lawson shaving his head into Bartlett's familiar combover. Peter Hudson Primarily re-enacts Hudson's three-goal performance in the 1971 Grand Final, and more specifically his failure to score a fourth which would have broken Bob Pratt's record of 150 goals in a VFL season. It features Hudson being knocked out by Kevin \\"Cowboy\\" Neale (represented by Lawson on a docile pony), simulates his concussion by fitting Hudson with thick glasses and spinning him in circles, and Hudson kicking his final attempt into man-on-the-mark Barry Lawrence (represented by Lawson being hit in the groin with the ball). The advertisement also re-enacts Hudson's famous arrival by helicopter to VFL Park in his only VFL game of 1973.Kelly Ryan, Herald Sun \\"Flying Hawk hero Peter Hudson relives his glory days in Toyota ad\\", August 14, 2010, Retrieved September 4, 2010. Leigh Matthews Re-enacts the famous occasion when Matthews collided with and broke a behind post in a match at Windy Hill. After running into the post fails to break it, Lawson cuts a notch in the post with an axe; Matthews, Curry and Lawson then tie a rope to the top of the post and pull it down. Curry also tries to inspire Matthews to break the post by telling him that \\"if it bleeds, we can kill it\\", a quote from Predator that Matthews famously used as a coach to inspire the Brisbane Lions to an upset win against . Michael Long Re- enacts Long's goal in the 1993 Grand Final when he ran from the wing into the forward 50 before kicking the goal. Lawson firstly attaches rockets to Long's shoes to help him gain speed; however, this fails, so Lawson attempts to tow Long on the back of a bicycle; however, he is too heavy, and Lawson is barely able to pedal. Lawson then emerges from behind the trees in an aeroplane, which he lands on the oval. Long stands on the wing of the plane, bouncing the ball, as Lawson drives the plane down the ground. The advertisement then cuts to Long kicking a goal from thirty metres out, which Lawson, playing the role of Stephen Silvagni, touches on the line; however, Curry declares it a goal, and he celebrates with Long, while Lawson continues to protest. Leo Barry The 2016 moment, revealed during the 2016 EJ Whitten Legends Game recreates Leo Barry's pack mark in the dying seconds of the 2005 Grand Final. To recreate the mark, Barry is launched off a catapult into a collection of tackling bags with players faces attached. NRL= Wally Lewis  Re- enacts Lewis' Game 2 and Series winning try of the 1989 State of Origin series, where, with the injuries of Allan Langer, Mal Meninga and Paul Vautin, the Queensland rugby league team had only 12 men in their team. However, Wally scored a 40-meter try - a moment which has been described as Queensland's greatest performance.

Dating from around 1437, it claims, along with Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem and Ye Olde Salutation Inn, to be the oldest pub in the city. In 1982 the pub became a Grade II listed building. History=Foundation and early history Sometime before 1271 Nottingham Whitefriars established a friary on what is now Friar Lane with lands that included a guesthouse on the site of what is now the Bell Inn. The building was constructed as a refectory for the monks of the monastery on Beastmarket Hill; according to dendrochronological dating of timbers, it was built around 1420. It became a secular alehouse in 1539, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, taking its name from the Angelus bell that hung outside. The earliest known written reference to the property dates from 1638, when on the death of Robert Sherwin, a former Lord Mayor and Sheriff of Nottingham, his rights to half the rental income of the Inn were bequeathed to several churches for them to distribute to the poor of Nottingham. John White bequeathed the freehold of the Inn to his wife Mary in 1732 and two years later she sold it to a wealthy local banker, Abel Smith. The freehold subsequently passed down the Smith family line to the politician and banker Abel Smith, in 1756, and then to Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington, in 1782. The 19th century Jane Lart purchased the freehold from Lord Carrington in 1803 and the leasehold from the Church in 1806 combining the two legally. Under the terms of the lease she also undertook extensive repairs of the building and constructed a Georgian frontage that allowed for the preservation of the rare crown post structure to this day. The cricketer William Clarke gave up his bricklaying job to become landlord of the Inn in 1812 before going on to marry the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn, where he established the famous Trent Bridge cricket ground. Rioters protesting against the Reform Act gathered at the Inn on Goose Fair night 1831 and smashed the windows before going on to burn down many of the city's prominent buildings, including Nottingham Castle and Colwick Hall. Advert from 1840 Tory politician John Walters established his campaign headquarters at the Inn for the 1841 British general election and had to take refuge here when he was set upon by an angry mob in the Square. The Charity Commission sold the Inn in 1888 to A.W. Hickling for ¬£7,210 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and it subsequently became a tied house to a brewery for the first time in its history. Joseph Jackson bought the Inn on 21 October 1898 for ¬£12,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The 20th century Mary Jackson succeeded her husband as proprietor in 1913 and established the famous two-course Market Dinners of Stilton cheese, beef and vegetables, and a pint of Nottingham ale, for one shilling. Following her death a quirk in her will meant the Inn had to go for sale by public auction. The Inn was purchased for ¬£26,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) by her youngest son Robert, who in 1928 converted the stable courtyard at the rear of the premises into the caf√©-bar-style Snack Bar, which included a large cabinet radio gramophone and catered to the workers building the new Nottingham Council House nearby. Robert's widow Dorothy continued the business following his death in 1934 and was joined by their son David in 1953. Extensive renovations opened up the family's first-floor accommodation to public use as the clubroom (now The Belfry Restaurant). In 1957 the Jacksons established the Presentation of the President's Tankard ceremony, which takes place on the first Wednesday in November and sees the President of the University of Nottingham Students' Union receive an engraved silver tankard and a public banquet of two roasted pigs with stuffing, bread, and apple sauce. A plaque engraved with a list of all the Presidents since is on display in the Snack Bar. In 1982 the Inn became a Grade II listed building. Dorothy died in 1984 and David continued running the business with his two sons Paul and Richard. Another period of renovation concluded with the extension of the Snack Bar in 1991. The Jackson family celebrated 100 years of ownership in 1998 and the Inn was featured, along with its rivals Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn and Ye Olde Salutation Inn, in an episode of the Channel 4 TV series History Hunters, which used records, building architecture and timbers, and local legends to decide which was truly the oldest. The 21st century The Inn was sold to Hardys & Hansons in 2002, which was in turn sold to Greene King in 2006. Premises=Entranceway and bars Entrance to the bars is via the central passageway, which used to lead to the stables where the Snack Bar now stands and retains its original flagstones. To the right of the entranceway are the leprosy windows where customers supposedly had their fingers counted before being allowed to enter. The original bars known as The Long Room (a.k.a. The Tudor Bar) and The Elizabethan Bar (a.k.a. Lizzie's Bar) date back to 1437 and the original timber crown-posts and cross beams have been preserved. The Tudor Bar also features a piece of the original wallpaper amongst other historical artifacts on display. Lizzie's Bar is dominated by a large stained-glass window; restoration work in 2002 uncovered the original wooden floor showing evidence of where the bar was once located. The Snack Bar was an outdoor courtyard with two wells used for brewing that was converted to its current form by Robert Jackson in 1928 and extended by his son and grandson in 1991 to include a stage for live music performances. First floor restaurant and function room The original living quarters, with a bedroom and bathroom featuring two front-facing windows overlooking the Old Market Square, were opened to the public as the Clubroom by the Jackson family in 1953. The oak-panelled low-beamed room, which features an original fireplace, now houses The Belfry restaurant. The Crown Post Room is an extension to The Belfry used for private functions and features the unusual crown post roof supports. The cellars The cellars are located in natural and hand-carved caves in the sandstone beneath what is now the Snack Bar and adjacent buildings. Dating back to the Norman dynasty, they were excavated by the Carmelite friars and contain two wells (including the Monks Well), the site of the original kitchen where Mary Jackson prepared her Market Dinners and a well-preserved bonded warehouse once used by a neighbouring wine merchant. The cellars are opened to the public on regular guided tours. Television In 1998, Channel 4 television series History Hunters examined the claims of The Bell Inn, Ye Olde Salutation Inn and Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem to each be the oldest pub in Nottingham. The programme, first broadcast on 5 December 1998, concluded that of the three, Ye Olde Salutation was the oldest building but the Bell had been the earliest in use as a pub.

Currently, Morehouse is attempting to improve the sport of fencing. One project he is working on new technology. On his Facebook page, he posted a video of him and another fencer demonstrating light up sabres. The lights are on the guard as well as on the wrist of the fencer. The problem Morehouse is trying to fix is for people watching the bout. They watch the fencers, then the scoring box, and then look at the director to see who made the touch. With this technology, it will be easier to see who got the touch. It will also be easier on the director, since the director can now focus on the fencers, rather than having to look back at the box to see the lights. He has made a prototype for foil as well, in hopes of having the sport to be wire-free, without wire jackets, as well as having as much of the technology of the weapons. For the foils, each weapon would have the lights, the lockout timing, and the ability to send data on the movements of the weapon. This data will include who is starting first and the accuracy of attacks. In the video, he shows that the weapons sync up wirelessly, and the jackets they are wearing have a magnetic layer underneath. When hit, there is a sound and the foil lights up green. Morehouse has also suggested new rules to sabre, making it more like tennis. One fencer would have priority and, after a \\"set\\" of four points, the priority is shifted to another fencer. The bouts would then go to 16, instead of 15, with a 2-point margin.

The sequels The Magic Thief: Lost was published in June 2009, followed by The Magic Thief: Found in May 2010 and The Magic Thief: Home in September 2014. There is also a short e-story, A Proper Wizard, released before the fourth sequel. Beginnings Prineas wrote the first chapter of The Magic Thief for Cricket, a literary magazine for young adults, after a request for stories about wizards and serialized fiction.Iowa Alumni Magazine, June 2008 When she felt the characters had more to tell, she expanded it into a novel, and then into a trilogy. She later published a stand-alone fourth book, and an e-story. Overview Connwaer, a pickpocket on the streets of the Twilight, one day picks the pocket of a powerful wizard named Nevery and steals his locus magicalicus, a special stone that helps wizards connect to the magical power of the city. It should kill Conn, but Nevery stops the process by saying a spell using Conn's name. It turns out that Nevery has just returned (or rather, snuck in) after a 20-year exile, to try to save the town from the leaching of its magic, upon which so much, including its economy, depends. Curious about the boy, Nevery takes him on as a servant and then later an apprentice. Although it is the wizard's job to stem the tide of the disappearing magic, he seems unable to do so. Conn believes he knows the answer, but his enemies are closing in.The Magic Thief: Sarah Prineas, Antonio Javier Caparo: 9780061375903 Amazon.com Characters * Connwaer/Conn - A former thief who lived alone on the streets of Twilight. Nevery takes him on as a servant/assistant, but soon made Conn his apprentice. Conn has a mysterious past which he is reluctant to reveal to anyone. Conn could be any age from twelve to fourteen, and has unkempt black hair that usually obscures his large, bright blue eyes. He is quick-witted, curious, innovative and bold, completely unbound by the deep-rooted beliefs in magic. Several characters noted him for being quiet. Conn likes reading and thinking about magic, and is a voracious eater. He could touch others' locus stones without dying and has never been ill. Growing up as a thief, Conn learns to be slippery, but he is completely honest (so instead of lying, which he could not do, he sometimes chooses not to reveal), and is sometimes stubborn and impetuous, heading into trouble without much planning beforehand. He wholeheartedly believes the magic must be protected, and that he is chosen to do so by it, and selflessly puts its safety before his own wellbeing. All this coupled with his strange ideas, he has a knack for attracting trouble. * Nevery Flinglas - A wizard who had been exiled from Wellmet for 20 years after experimenting with pyrotechnics. He returns to solve a magical problem in Wellmet after Brumbee sent him a plea. Though at first Nevery try not to notice or become attached to Conn, he was impressed by Conn's eagerness and strong affinity to magic, and soon becomes more caring towards his apprentice. Though outwardly irascible and rash, Nevery is deeply kind and flexible; like other wizards, he once stubbornly believes in old truths, but by Conn's influence he starts to be able to accept new ideas. Nevery lives in Heartsease, a mansion on one of the wizard islands in the Wellmet River. The house has been in his family for generations, and have once been grand, but was partially destroyed in Nevery's pyrotechnic experiment and abandoned for decades. Conn discovered his family chronicles and locus stone collection there, which contain records about Nevery's parents, his relatives, and a young girl who might have been his sister or daughter, all of whom long gone, but the cause of his whole family's demise remains unknown. * Benet - Nevery's bodyguard. He is on bad terms with Conn at first, but after seeing Conn's devotion to learning magic and talent, feels more respect and affection towards him, giving him haircuts, delicious meals and hand-knitted clothes, and risking himself to save Conn several times. Apart from being an intimidating fighter, he is also a great chef and likes to knit things in his free time. Though he seems formidable and hard on the outside, Benet has a tendency to understand, as well as notice something wrong with Conn that Nevery frequently overlook, and stood up to his master for his sometimes insensible nature. * Pettivox - The evil master of Keeston, and though they are both magisters, he openly show his mistrust and disdain of Nevery Flinglas. Keeston speaks about him with fear, and Conn guessed that he beats Keeston. Pettivox has white skin and red lips, and speaks with a high voice despite his tall, burly build. It is revealed that Pettivox is working with the Underlord to drain all the magic from Wellmet and sell it. He is later appointed as liaison for the Duchess and the Underlord, and makes use of his position to spy on her and gives her misleading information. He is assumed to have died in the explosion at Dusk House by the end of the book. * Keeston - Pettivox's apprentice whom Pettivox offered as assistant to Nevery, in order for Keeston to spy on him. Tall and blond with blue eyes, Keeston is as proud of his looks as his magical abilities. Being top of the class, he is usually paired with the beginner Conn, much to his angst. He and Conn dislike each other from the start, but become good friends after Pettivox died and Keeston had changed for the better. Keeston later became Brumbee's apprentice, and according to him was heavily influenced by Conn's ideas about magic later on in the series. * Rowan Forestal - At first unknown to Conn, the tomboyish daughter of the Duchess. She has short red hair that looks like it has been hacked off, and catlike grey eyes. She enjoys sword fight and adventure, and is known to be very impatient; Brumbee sets her to teach Conn how to read runes when he first become apprentice, and Rowan herself speculates that it might have been to practice her patience. Though Conn dislikes Rowan at first sight, the pair quickly became friends when he saw her true fun-loving self beneath the haughty pose, and Rowan was impressed by Conn's incredible speed in learning. Rowan is not in the least disturbed by Conn's lowly social status, and devoutly supports Conn. * Willa Forestal - The Duchess and mother of Rowan. Rules the richer part of Wellmet: The Sunrise. Discontinuing the common practice of hiring a Ducal Magister, she dislikes magic and mistrusts wizards she deemed dangerous, such as Nevery and Connwaer. The Duchess is serious and has no sense of humour, but is also shown to be clever and cunning. * Brumbee - The Principal of Academicos and a lifelong friend of Nevery, Brumbee is very knowledgeable, but indecisive and weak. According to Conn, what Brumbee would do in the face of arguments or crisis would be wringing his hands and saying 'Oh dear'. Brumbee is usually kind and soft- spoken, though easily flustered, as opposed to Nevery's temper. After Pettivox's death, he accepts Keeston as his apprentice. * Underlord Crowe - Exerts control over the Twilight side of Wellmet. A cold, almost psychopathic individual with no regard for anyone except for himself; Conn states that Crowe \\"would kill his family to get what he wanted\\". He looks nondescript; neither short nor tall, neither handsome nor plain, has cold, empty grey eyes and oiled black hair. He works with Pettivox and was exiled after Conn foiled his schemes. * Captain Kerrn - The Captain of the Dawn Palace Guards who serve to protect the Duchess. As she is very strict and true to her duties, she mistrusts and is very hostile towards Conn.

It is a determination of whether an intervention has an effect, when the intervention is compared to a baseline. 'Interventions' can take a variety of forms, but often include economic incentives. For an example of the application of additionality in environmental crediting markets refer to carbon credits. Additionality may be evaluated ex post, as is often done in the practice of program evaluation. Or it can be done ex ante, as an initial eligibility screen for issuing credits as part of an environmental or other public goods market. For ex ante applications, additionality is evaluated for proposed activities. A proposed activity is additional if the recognized interventions are deemed to be causing the activity to take place. The occurrence of additionality is determined by assessing whether a proposed activity is distinct from its baseline. A baseline is a prediction of the quantified amount of an input to or output from an activity resulting from the expected future behavior of the actors proposing, and affected by, the proposed activity in the absence of one or more policy interventions, holding all other factors constant (ceteris paribus). Other working definitions of the term are available here. Economic definition Net positive difference that results from economic development intervention. The extent to which an activity (and associated outputs, outcomes and impacts) is larger in scale, at a higher quality, takes place more quickly, takes place at a different location, or takes place at all as a result of intervention. Additionality measures the net result, taking account of deadweight, leakage, displacement, substitution and economic multipliers. Additionality is calculated by the following formula: where A is the additionality, Iin is the impact of the intervention, and Irc is the impact of a reference case. Problems Additionality becomes problematic when the parties claim that their behavior is being changed due to recognized intervention (e.g., because of the economic incentive provided by earning carbon offset credits), when in fact the intervention is having no effect on their behavior because other factors are dominant (e.g., earning a profit from an activity even without carbon credits). The proposed project is therefore not truly additional, since it would have been implemented without the intervention (e.g., in the form of the carbon credit price signal). This without intervention scenario is often referred to as \\"business as usual\\").

Accessed December 4, 2008 Mathematical contributions Most of Stallings' mathematical contributions are in the areas of geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology (particularly the topology of 3-manifolds) and on the interplay between these two areas. An early significant result of Stallings is his 1960 proofJohn Stallings. Polyhedral homotopy spheres. Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 66 (1960), pp. 485-488. of the Poincar√© conjecture in dimensions greater than six. (Stallings' proof was obtained independently from and shortly after the different proof of Stephen Smale who established the same result in dimensions bigger than fourStephen Smale. Generalized Poincar√©'s conjecture in dimensions greater than four. Annals of Mathematics (2nd Ser.), vol. 74 (1961), no. 2, pp. 391-406). Using \\"engulfing\\" methods similar to those in his proof of the Poincar√© conjecture for n > 6, Stallings proved that ordinary Euclidean n-dimensional space has a unique piecewise linear, hence also smooth, structure, if n is not equal to 4. This took on added significance when, as a consequence of work of Michael Freedman and Simon Donaldson in 1982, it was shown that 4-space has exotic smooth structures, in fact uncountably many such. In a 1963 paper Stallings constructed an example of a finitely presented group with infinitely generated 3-dimensional integral homology group and, moreover, not of the type F_3 , that is, not admitting a classifying space with a finite 3-skeleton. This example came to be called the Stallings group and is a key example in the study of homological finiteness properties of groups. Robert Bieri later showedRobert Bieri. \\"Homological dimension of discrete groups.\\" Queen Mary College Mathematical Notes. Queen Mary College, Department of Pure Mathematics, London, 1976. that the Stallings group is exactly the kernel of the homomorphism from the direct product of three copies of the free group F_2 to the additive group \\\\Z of integers that sends to 1\\\\in \\\\Z the six elements coming from the choice of free bases for the three copies of F_2. Bieri also showed that the Stallings group fits into a sequence of examples of groups of type F_n but not of type F_{n+1} . The Stallings group is a key object in the version of discrete Morse theory for cubical complexes developed by Mladen Bestvina and Noel Brady and in the study of subgroups of direct products of limit groups.Martin R. Bridson, James Howie, Charles F. Miller, and Hamish Short. \\"The subgroups of direct products of surface groups\\". Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 92 (2002), pp. 95-103.Martin R.

Subgroups of direct products of two limit groups. Mathematical Research Letters, vol. 14 (2007), no. 4, 547-558. Stallings' most famous theorem in group theory is an algebraic characterization of groups with more than one end (that is, with more than one \\"connected component at infinity\\"), which is now known as Stallings' theorem about ends of groups. Stallings proved that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting as an amalgamated free product or as an HNN extension over a finite group (that is, in terms of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action on a tree with finite edge stabilizers). More precisely, the theorem states that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if either G admits a splitting as an amalgamated free product G=A\\\\ast_C B, where the group C is finite and C e A, C e B, or G admits a splitting as an HNN extension G=\\\\langle H, t  t^{-1}Kt=L\\\\rangle where K, L \\\\le H are finite subgroups of H. Stallings proved this result in a series of works, first dealing with the torsion-free case (that is, a group with no nontrivial elements of finite order)John R. Stallings. On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 88 (1968), pp. 312-334. and then with the general case.John Stallings. \\"Groups of cohomological dimension one.\\" Applications of Categorical Algebra (Proc. Sympos.

Stalling's theorem yielded a positive solution to the long-standing open problem about characterizing finitely generated groups of cohomological dimension one as exactly the free groups.John R. Stallings. Groups of dimension 1 are locally free. Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 74 (1968), pp. 361-364 Stallings' theorem about ends of groups is considered one of the first results in geometric group theory proper since it connects a geometric property of a group (having more than one end) with its algebraic structure (admitting a splitting over a finite subgroup). Stallings' theorem spawned many subsequent alternative proofs by other mathematicians (e.g.Martin J. Dunwoody. \\"Cutting up graphs.\\" Combinatorica 2 (1982), no. 1, pp. 15-23.Warren Dicks and Martin J. Dunwoody. Groups acting on graphs. Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, 17.

The theorem also motivated several generalizations and relative versions of Stallings' result to other contexts, such as the study of the notion of relative ends of a group with respect to a subgroup,Gadde A. Swarup. \\"Relative version of a theorem of Stallings.\\" Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 11 (1977/78), no. 1-3, pp. 75-82Martin J. Dunwoody and E. L.

Stallings. \\"Topology of finite graphs.\\" Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 71 (1983), no. 3, pp. 551-565 Traditionally, the algebraic structure of subgroups of free groups has been studied in combinatorial group theory using combinatorial methods, such as the Schreier rewriting method and Nielsen transformations.Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E. Schupp. Combinatorial Group Theory. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001. \\"Classics in Mathematics\\" series, reprint of the 1977 edition. Stallings' paper put forward a topological approach based on the methods of covering space theory that also used a simple graph-theoretic framework. The paper introduced the notion of what is now commonly referred to as Stallings subgroup graph for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the notion of what is now known as a Stallings folding. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see Ilya Kapovich and Alexei Myasnikov. \\"Stallings foldings and subgroups of free groups.\\" Journal of Algebra, vol. 248 (2002), no. 2, 608-668). In particular, Stallings subgroup graphs and Stallings foldings have been the used as a key tools in many attempts to approach the Hanna Neumann conjecture.J. Meakin, and P. Weil. Subgroups of free groups: a contribution to the Hanna Neumann conjecture. Proceedings of the Conference on Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory, Part I (Haifa, 2000).

Among Stallings' contributions to 3-manifold topology, the most well-known is the Stallings fibration theorem.John R.

Life His parents were John D. Durbin, son of Christopher Durbin, pioneer, and Patience Logsdon. In 1816 he was sent to the preparatory seminary of St. Thomas, in Nelson County, where he spent about four years of manual labour and study under missionaries including John Baptist Mary David, Benedict Joseph Flaget, Felix de Andreis, and Joseph Rosati. From there he went to the nearby Seminary of St. Joseph, at Bardstown, where, in 1821-1822, he had as an instructor Francis Patrick Kenrick. He was ordained priest in Bardstown, by coadjutor Bishop David, 21 September 1822. Early in 1824 Flaget, Bishop of Bardstown, entrusted to him the pastoral care of western and southwestern Kentucky, about 30 counties, with an area of over , nearly one-third of the state. Thus began a missionary career of over 60 years as the \\"Apostle of Western Kentucky\\". Union County, Kentucky was the center of his mission. From it he journeyed on horseback over his vast territory, erected churches, established stations, formed congregations, and visited isolated families. In the beginning, duty called him beyond his mission proper into Indiana, and once a year to Nashville, Tennessee. He traversed a sparsely settled mission incessantly. Occasionally, a cogent communication from him would appear in the press. In old age, his sturdy constitution gave way in 1884. His bishop, yielding to his entreaties, assigned him the small mission at Princeton, Kentucky. After a stroke of paralysis he was given, in 1885, the chaplaincy of an academy at Shelbyville, Kentucky, where he died. References ;Attribution * Further reading *Donald R.

Most of this bypass, more than 17 out of 21 kilometres, is being built underground. The Swedish government decided to permit the construction of the bypass on September 3, 2009, according to a proposal by the Swedish Road Administration. The bypass will become the world's second longest road tunnel in the proximity of a city, after the Yamate Tunnel in Tokyo. 140,000 vehicles per day are expected to use the bypass. The tunnel reaches at its deepest point 65 metres below sea level and the lake M√§laren. The projected cost for the project is estimated at 27.6 billion (short scale) SEK (2009 value, around 3.5 billion US dollars or 2.7 billion euros). Construction began in August 2014 but was stopped for political reasons soon after. It was restarted in early 2015 and was then expected to take ten years to complete. History The highway has been in the planning stage since 1966, when a regional planning sketch titled Greater Stockholm Physical Structure 2000 () proposed three concentric circular arcs surround Stockholm to the west.City 67, page 8 The innermost arc was Brommagrenen, whose on-ramps were put in place already when Essingeleden was under construction. The next bypass to the west was a connection between Essingeleden at Br√§nnkyrka over √Ölsten past Bromma airport and northwards, an extent that is reminiscent of Diagonal Ulvsunda. The third, outermost bypass had an extent mostly coinciding with the currently planned F√∂rbifart Stockholm and was called Kungshattsleden. In the 1992 Dennis Package(sv) it had the name V√§sterleden (Western Route). In 2001, an alternative consisting of a tunnel under Eker√∂ was included in the plans.Stockholms Handelskammare - trafik Stockholm 2001.06.07 s.2 E4/E20 during rush hour, between the Kungens Kurva and Bred√§ng traffic interchanges on February 22, 2010. The road capacity over the relatively narrow passage between Saltsj√∂n in the east and lake M√§laren in the west (where Stockholm is located) has not been expanded since Essingeleden opened in 1967. Essingeleden was designed with a capacity of 80,000 vehicles per day; today, the load is twice that on a normal weekday.Program \\"F√∂rbifart Stockholm\\", page 5 This makes Essingeleden sensitive to traffic disturbances, with consequent road congestion. The heavy vehicular load also causes severe wear and tear on the road surface, with large needs for repairs as a result. To solve the problem the Road Authority presented in its investigation North-South connections in the Stockholm area 2005 (Nord-sydliga f√∂rbindelser i Stockholmsomr√•det √•r 2005) three alternatives: F√∂rbifart Stockholm, Diagonal Ulvsunda, and a combined alternative; the Road Authority recommended the first alternative. The Centre Party, Liberal People's Party, Christian Democrats, Moderate Party, and Social Democratic Party were in 2010 supportive of the road project, while the Green Party and Left Party were opposed to it.http://www.vansterpartiet.se/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=2386:foerbifart- stockholm-en-gigantisk- miljoemiss&catid;=298:infrastruktur&Itemid;=246http://www.dn.se/sthlm/ja-till- forbifart-stockholm-1.944424 Arguments supporting the construction of the bypass are the creation of improved road access, reduction of inefficient travelling time, and reduction the load on central parts of Stockholm due to transit traffic. Arguments against construction cite increased carbon dioxide emissions, the high cost, environmental impact along the construction route, and that traffic problems are not being addressed in a long-term perspective because travellers in the Stockholm region are enticed to continue using private transportation rather than public transportation, and because a high percentage of the present-day traffic on the frequently congested Essingeleden is local traffic to or from central Stockholm, rather than transit traffic. On 19 August 2014, there was a groundbreaking ceremony, led by the minister for infrastructure. However, after the election of September 2014, a new government was elected and they decided on 23 October 2014 to halt the construction (even if contracts with construction companies were signed) for a half-year period in order to debate the project. Soon a decision was made to restart the project, but this political manoeuver delayed the project for half a year. The extension F√∂rbifart Stockholm (white area) according to a brochure from the Swedish Road Administration 2008. The current plan is presented on the website of the Swedish Transport Administration in section Railway and Road ‚Üí Road Construction Projects ‚Üí E4 The Stockholm bypass. The highway extension will consist of the following sections: The South Part The south part would start from the E4 highway at Kungens Kurva and go underground until the island of Lov√∂n. Lov√∂n The highway continues underground to the mainland east of H√§sselby Strand. Initially there were plans to let the highway to go above ground on the north part of Lov√∂n and pass over a bridge to the mainland, but this was changed. Grimsta Nature Reserve The tunnel proceeds under the Grimsta Nature Reserve. Regional Road 275 The highway would continue underground directly west of Regional Road 275, ending at Akalla. The North Part The last part of the highway from Akalla to the E4 south of H√§ggvik would be above ground. Completion In 2009 the project was approved by the Swedish government in September 2009 and construction was expected to start in 2010 and take 8 years to complete. The cost was estimated at 27 billion Swedish kronor. However the construction start was in 2014 with real tunnel excavation starting 2016 with 10 years expected completion time and 34 billion kronor cost. In 2019 delays in tunnel construction and legal violations on work safety caused cancellation of a contract for one part of the tunnel. As of end of 2019 the expected completion time is 14 years, year 2030 and the cost 37 billion kronor. Criticism=Uppdrag Granskning (Swedish Television) According to an episode of the documentary program series Uppdrag granskning, titled The most expensive Swedish expressway (\\"Sveriges dyraste motorv√§g\\"), the project will not solve the congestion problem, but instead result in a substantial increase in the use of cars and trucks as means of transportation.

She was a successful milliner, widely credited for inventing mass-produced tissue-paper dressmaking patterns. With her husband, William Jennings Demorest, she established a company to sell the patterns, which were adaptations of the latest French fashions, and a magazine to promote them (1860). Her dressmaking patterns made French styles accessible to ordinary women, thus greatly influencing US fashion.  Early life  Demorest was born November 15, 1824 in Schuylerville, New York. She was the second of eight children born to Electra Abel Curtis and Henry D. Curtis. Her father was a farmer and the owner of a men's hat factory. At eighteen, Demorest set up a millinery shop in Saratoga Springs with the help of her father. After a year, she moved her business to Troy before relocating again to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 1858, she married William Jennings Demorest, a thirty-six year old widower with two children. Demorest gave birth to a son in 1859 and a daughter in 1865. Career Early in their marriage, the Demorests ran a Philadelphia emporium. Ellen and her sister Kate were working on a system of simplified dress making when they saw the Demorest's African-American maid cutting a dress pattern out of brown paper. Ellen was inspired by the idea to create tissue paper patterns of fashionable garments for the home sewer. The family relocated to New York and began manufacturing patterns. In the fall of 1860, they launched a quarterly magazine, Mme. Demorest‚Äôs Mirror of Fashions. They also opened a women's fashion emporium at 473 Broadway. Mme. Demorest‚Äôs Mirror of Fashions and Demorest‚Äôs Illustrated Monthly Magazine soon reached a circulation of 60,000. The magazine was well- timed, coming as sewing machines became common in middle-class homes. Articles in the Mirror of Fashions gave home sewers helpful tips and encouraged readers to believe in their own ability. Readers felt \\"emancipated... from dependence on milliners and dressmakers.\\" The fashions worn by Empress Eugenie were of particular interest to the readers of Demorest‚Äôs Illustrated Monthly Magazine and Mme. Demorest‚Äôs Mirror of Fashions. Correspondents reported on every dress the Empress wore and her gowns were reproduced for a semi-annual New York show. Journalist and women's rights advocate Jane Cunningham Croly edited Demorest‚Äôs Illustrated Monthly Magazine from 1860 to 1887. Under her leadership, Demorest‚Äôs Monthly advocated for female education and employment. Croly promoted female accomplishment with a monthly \\"What Women Are Doing\\" column. The column claimed to take \\"note of every woman rancher, banker, dentist or businesswoman... who came to light in a distinctive way in any part of the country.\\" Other contributors included Louisa May Alcott, Theodore Dreiser, and Robert Louis Stevenson. In 1863, Ellen designed the wedding trousseau of circus performer Lavinia Warren. In 1876, the year of their height in popularity, the Demorests' company distributed and sold over 3 million patterns.Marsha Lynn Tech, nee Hempsted (1951- ), _Scene Magazine, Battle Creek  Marshall (Annual Women in Business edition)_ , Antiques Today, Vol. 31, No. 4, pg 24 (Feb 2006), pub. by W. W. Thayne Advertising Consultants, Inc., Battle Creek, MI. Offices in Europe, Canada and Cuba distributed Demorest patterns. An ardent abolitionist and women's rights advocate, Ellen Demorest employed both black and white women in her enterprises. Those who objected to her politics were asked to shop elsewhere.  Later life  In 1876, Demorest turned her attention to philanthropy. Along with Jane Cunningham Croly, Ellen was a founding member of Sorosis, the first professional women's club in the United States. Ironically, the Demorests failed to patent their paper pattern but another inventor, Ebenezer Butterick, did. Initially Butterick confined his patterns to men's and children's wear, but by 1867 he expanded to women's patterns as well. By 1874 his empire extended from Europe to North America with over 100 branch offices. It remains the center of the paper pattern industry today.

The party was founded in the 1945, by Mahmoud Mohamed Taha. The party came into the limelight in 1983, as Taha opposed the implementations of sharia laws by Jaafar Nimeiry. Taha was arrested and executed in 1985. The party continued to exist for a few years, being disbanded sometime after 1989.http://www.sudan.net/government/parties.html History The Republican Brotherhood was the popular name for what Mahmud Muhammad Taha called the New Islamic Mission. Taha sought to develop a new Muslim consciousness based on a modern view of Islam and Islamic law.Republican Brotherhood The New Islamic Mission was founded in 1945. The Brotherhood however refrained from participation in elections, having inherited the Republican Party's historically disdain for the political process. In spite of this the Brotherhood's influence in Sudanese politics grew up until the execution of Taha in 1985, with the party having particularly swelled in the years leading up to 1985, largely due to an influx of students, women, and Muslim intellectuals. Taha and the Republican Brotherhood disagreed with Nimeiri's government over the role of Islamic law and freedom of speech. Taha spent brief periods in jail during the 1960s and 1970s, whilst the membership of the Republican Brotherhood grew to approximately 1,000 active men and women by 1980. In spite of Brotherhood's traditional aversion to involvement in politics the Brotherhood launched a major speaking and writing campaign in 1983 against Nimeiri's September Laws, which instituted a strict form of Sharia law in Sudan. The Brotherhood's campaign resulted in the arrest of more than 70 members of the organisation, including 4 Republican Sisters and Taha himself. No charges were brought against the group until the Brotherhood issued a final pamphlet at the end of 1984 demanding that Islamic law be dropped as the only state law in force. Taha was charged with apostasy, convicted, sentenced to death, and then executed on 18 January 1985. Along with Taha's execution, the Republican Brotherhood movement was disbanded. Many of its members still live in exile in Great Britain and the United States. The Republican Brothers, who are still under the ban by the Government of Sudan, are practicing either non-publicly or publicly in diaspora, UK or United States where they found safe heaven and freedom.alfikra.org Ideology The Republican Brotherhood was based on a religious ideology advocating for a revised interpretation of the Qur'an, in line with Qu'ran's Meccan (original revelation) texts, which the Brotherhood argued had precedence over the later, Medinan, portions of the Qur'an. Mahmood Taha's book \\"The Second Message of Islam\\" puts forth the radical idea that the Medinan verses concerning legal and social issues that arose after the Hijrah are time-bound to that period. The \\"Second Message\\" is to return to the Meccan fundamental principles of justice, equality, and tolerance, which were sent by the Merciful God for all time. In this manner, the Medinan verses regarding the hudud punishments and the physical reprimand of wives, for example, are no longer valid. In other words, the Prophetic sunnah, as long as it demonstrates the Meccan verses of the Qur'an can be a model for society. But the Shari'ah is only an ideal, not a practical guide that Islamic scholars bring out through the process of fiqh. Traditional fiqh based on the sunnah and the application of the Shari'ah necessarily come into question. The Republican Brotherhood particularly focused on issues relating to the lack of human rights and equality in the treatment of women and non-Muslims in modern Islamic societies. A pragmatic rendering of the program of the Republican Brotherhood would involve the specific revision of the Shari'a law regarding marriage and divorce whereby the right to contract the marriage and the right to terminate it is vested equally with the woman as well as the man, as individuals. Polygamy would be prohibited. The Republican Brotherhood advocated for a revised constitution, based on true principles of Muslim equity and justice, which would protect religious freedom and ensure equality of treatment and standing under the law between non-Muslims and Muslims.

Medical uses It has antitussive and bronchodilator effects, and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Doxophylline is used to treat asthma, COPD and bronchospasm. In animal and human studies, it has shown similar efficacy to theophylline but with significantly fewer side effects. In February 2014, the US FDA granted an orphan drug designation to doxofylline for the treatment of bronchiectasis following the submission of an application by Alitair Pharmaceuticals, in May 2013. Chemistry Unlike other xanthines, doxofylline lacks any significant affinity for adenosine receptors and does not produce stimulant effects. This suggests that its antiasthmatic effects are mediated by another mechanism, perhaps its actions on phosphodiesterase. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, doxofylline importantly differs from theophylline also because it lacks the ability to interfere with the cytochrome enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4, thus preventing significant interaction with other drugs metabolized via these pathways in the liver.

It was begun and completed while Johnson was busy writing A Dictionary of the English Language and it was the first published work to include Johnson's name on the title page. As the subtitle suggests, it is an imitation of Satire X by the Latin poet Juvenal. Unlike Juvenal, Johnson attempts to sympathize with his poetic subjects. Also, the poem focuses on human futility and humanity's quest after greatness like Juvenal but concludes that Christian values are important to living properly. It was Johnson's second imitation of Juvenal (the first being his 1738 poem London). Unlike London, The Vanity of Human Wishes emphasizes philosophy over politics. The poem was not a financial success, but later critics, including Walter Scott and T. S. Eliot, considered it to be Johnson's greatest poem.Eliot 1957 p. 180 Howard D. Weinbrot called it \\"one of the great poems in the English language\\".Weinbrot 1997 p. 46 Background In 1738 Johnson composed London, his first imitation of Juvenal's poetry, because imitations were popularised by those like Pope during the 18th century.Bate 1977 p. 172 When Johnson replaced Edward Cave with Robert Dodsley as his publisher, he agreed with Dodsley that he would need to change the focus of his poetry.Demaria 1993 p. 130 Johnson's London is concerned primarily with political issues, especially those surrounding the Walpole administration, but The Vanity of Human Wishes focuses on overarching philosophical concepts. In a conversation with George Steevens, Johnson recounted that he wrote the first seventy lines \\"in the course of one morning, in that small house behind the church\\".Hill Vol. 2 pp. 313‚Äì314 Johnson claimed that \\"The whole number was composed before I committed a single couplet to writing\\".Demaria 1993 p. 131 To accomplish this feat, Johnson relied on a \\"nearly oral form of composition\\" which was only possible \\"because of his extraordinary memory\\". Johnson told Boswell that when he was writing poetry, he often \\"from laziness\\" only wrote down the first half of each line.Boswell p. 362 This remark is borne out by the manuscript of The Vanity of Human Wishes, in which the first half of each line is written in a different ink to the second half; \\"evidently Johnson knew that the rime words would keep the second halves in mind.\\"Johnson 1964 p. 90f. Although Johnson was busy after 1746 working on his Dictionary, he found time to further work on The Vanity of Human Wishes and complete his play, Irene. The first edition was published on 9 January 1749. It was the first publication by Johnson to feature his name on the title page.Lane p. 114Yung 1984 p. 66 It was not a financial success and only earned Johnson fifteen guineas. A revised version was published in the 1755 edition of Dodsley's anthology A collection of Poems by Several Hands. A third version was published posthumously in the 1787 edition of his Works, evidently working from a copy of the 1749 edition.Johnson 1971 p. 208 However, no independent version of the poem was published during Johnson's life beyond the initial publication. Poem Manuscript copy of lines 153‚Äì174, later revised as lines 150‚Äì171Yung p. 65 The Vanity of Human Wishes is a poem of 368 lines, written in closed heroic couplets. Johnson loosely adapts Juvenal's original satire to demonstrate \\"the complete inability of the world and of worldly life to offer genuine or permanent satisfaction.\\"Bate 1977 p. 279 The opening lines announce the universal scope of the poem, as well as its central theme that \\"the antidote to vain human wishes is non-vain spiritual wishes\\":Weinbrot 1997 p. 49 > Let Observation with extensive View, > Survey Mankind from China to Peru; > Remark each anxious Toil, each eager Strife, > And watch the busy scenes of crouded Life; > Then say how Hope and Fear, Desire and Hate, > O'erspread with Snares the clouded Maze of Fate, > Where Wav'ring Man, betray'd by vent'rous Pride, > To tread the dreary Paths without a Guide; > As treach'rous Phantoms in the Mist delude, > Shuns fancied Ills, or chases airy Good. > (Lines 1‚Äì10)Johnson, p.83 Later, Johnson describes the life of a scholar: > Should Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart, > Nor claim the triumph of a letter'd heart; > Should no Disease thy torpid veins invade, > Nor Melancholy's phantoms haunt thy Shade; > Yet hope not Life from Grief or Danger free, > Nor think the doom of Man revrs'd for thee: > Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes, > And pause awhile from Letters, to be wise; > There mark what ills the Scholar's life assail, > Toil, envy, Want, the Patron and the Jayl > (Lines 151‚Äì160) Sources Johnson draws on personal experience as well as a variety of historical sources to illustrate \\"the helpless vulnerability of the individual before the social context\\" and the \\"inevitable self-deception by which human beings are led astray\\".Bate p. 281 Both themes are explored in one of the most famous passages in the poem, Johnson's outline of the career of Charles XII of Sweden. As Howard D. Weinbrot notes, \\"The passage skillfully includes many of Johnson's familiar themes ‚Äì repulsion with slaughter that aggrandizes one man and kills and impoverishes thousands, understanding of the human need to glorify heroes, and subtle contrast with the classical parent-poem and its inadequate moral vision.\\"Weinbrot p. 47 Johnson depicts Charles as a \\"Soul of Fire\\", the \\"Unconquer'd Lord of Pleasure and of Pain\\", who refuses to accept that his pursuit of military conquest may end in disaster: > 'Think Nothing gain'd, he cries, till nought remain, > On Moscow's Walls till Gothic Standards fly, > And all be Mine beneath the Polar Sky.' > (Lines 202‚Äì204)Johnson 1971 p. 88 In a famous passage, Johnson reduces the king's glorious military career to a cautionary example in a poem: > His Fall was destin'd to a barren Strand, > A petty Fortress, and a dubious Hand; > He left the Name, at which the World grew pale, > To point a Moral, or adorn a Tale. > (Lines 219‚Äì222) In a passage dealing with the life of a writer, Johnson drew on his own personal experience. In the original manuscript of the poem, lines 159‚Äì160 read: > There mark what ill the Scholar's life assail > Toil Envy Want ~~an~~ the Garret and the Jayl Johnson 1971 p. 172 The word \\"Garret\\" was retained in the first published edition of the poem. However, after the failure in 1755 of Lord Chesterfield to provide financial support for Johnson's Dictionary, Johnson included a mordant definition of \\"patron\\" in the Dictionary (\\"Patron: Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery\\")Johnson 1971 p. 211 and revised line 160 to reflect his disillusionment: > There mark what Ills the Scholar's Life assail, > Toil, Envy, Want, the Patron, and the Jail.Johnson 1971 p. 87. Imitation Howard D. Weinbrot notes that The Vanity of Human Wishes \\"follows the outline of Juvenal's tenth satire, embraces some of what Johnson thought of as its 'sublimity,' but also uses it as a touchstone rather than an argument on authority.\\" In particular, Johnson and Juvenal differ on their treatment of their topics: both of them discuss conquering generals (Charles and Hannibal respectively), but Johnson's poem invokes pity for Charles, whereas Juvenal mocks Hannibal's death.Weinbrot 1997 p. 48f. Using Juvenal as a model did cause some problems, especially when Johnson emphasised Christianity as \\"the only true and lasting source of hope\\". Juvenal's poem contains none of the faith in Christian redemption that informed Johnson's personal philosophy. In order not to violate his prototype, Johnson had to accommodate his views to the Roman model and focus on the human world, approaching religion \\"by a negative path\\" and ignoring the \\"positive motives of faith, such as the love of Christ\\".Bate 1977 p. 282 Critical response Although Walter Scott and T. S. Eliot enjoyed Johnson's earlier poem London, they both considered The Vanity of Human Wishes to be Johnson's greatest poem.Bate 1955 p.18 Later critics followed the same trend: Howard D. Weinbrot says that \\"London is well worth reading, but The Vanity of Human Wishes is one of the great poems in the English language\\". Likewise, Robert Folkenflik says \\"London is not Johnson's greatest poem, only because The Vanity of Human Wishes is better\\".Folkenflik 1997 p.107 Robert Demaria Jr. declared the work as \\"Johnson's greatest poem\\".

Biography Lathouwers was born and raised in Rotterdam and has a sister who is two years older than he is named Maura.Robert Lathouwers biografie, robertlathouwers.com, ret: Aug 5, 2008 He started in athletics at the age of six, doing all different kinds of disciplines in the sport. He was a multi talented athlete and he won several heptathlon and decathlon meetings and was also invited to represent the Netherlands in international nation meetings. At the age of 17 he decided to fully concentrate himself at the sport and started training much more intensively. As the 400 metres was his best discipline in the decathlon he decided to focus on that and soon afterward he canceled his decathlon aspirations. After a period of quiet and effective training sessions he broke his personal record to 48.55 seconds, which was the 3rd time ever run by a B-junior in the Netherlands. In his first year as an A-junior he ran 47.14 seconds and he qualified himself for the 2001 European Junior Championships in Italy. The following year he suffered from several injuries, but still managed to break his personal record again to a time of 47.11 seconds. Due to this effort he qualified for the World Junior Championships in Jamaica where he finished in the 9th position. He represented the Netherlands also at the European Cup meeting in Sevilla where he participated in the 4 x 400 metres relay in which his team became third in a time of 3:06.23. On 15 February 2003 he won his first national senior title at the Dutch Indoor Championships. Later that year during the Golden Spike meeting in Leiden he ran 46.78 and qualified himself for the European under-23 Championships in Bydgoszcz. Together with his team mates Jordy Hindriks, Peter Wolters and Jelle Heisen he also qualified for the 4 x 400 metres relay, running 3:08.95. At the European Championships Hindriks was replaced by Youssef el Rhalfioui and together they ran to a fourth position in a new Dutch under-23 record of 3:06.61. In 2005 he won his second indoor 400 metres title and later during the year he won his first outdoor title. Alongside Dani√´l Ward, Dani√´l de Wild and Sjors Kampen he also won a bronze medal at the European Under-23 Championships in Erfurt. Lathouwers had a disappointing year in 2006 as he suffered from injuries and was almost drowned during swimming at sea. In December 2006 he was asked by Haag Atletiek to substitute one of their runners at the 800 metres. Lathouwers was sceptical about the distance however, as he never ran races longer than 400 metres. He eventually gave it a try and he was the first to cross the finish line in 1:51.57. Lathouwers made a huge change in his career and decided to focus on the 800 metres from then on and during a training session in South Africa he ran the 800 metres in 1:47.81. In January 2008 he ran another race in South Africa in 1:46.70 and February during his first ever indoor 800 metres he ran 1:48.31, which was enough to qualify for the World Indoor Championships in Sevilla. A week later he became Dutch National Indoor Champion over 800 metres and during the outdoor season he also took this Dutch national title. At the World Championships he won his serie in the first round, which qualified him straight for the semi finals. In these semi finals he finished third behind Mbulaeni Mulaudzi and Abubaker Kaki Khamis and was eliminated. However, his time of 1:48.27 was another personal best. During the FBK Games in Hengelo he won the 800 metres impressively in 1:45.80, beating many World class runners, inclusive World Champion Alfred Yego. His next goal was to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics and on 13 July in Athens his 1:45.30 was only 0.05 short to break the Olympic limit. Then, on 29 July in Monaco, he secured his Olympic debut by running an impressive 1:44.75 during the Super Grand-Prix meeting there. He was disqualified from the 800m heats in the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona.

Founded October 19, 2003, in Atlanta, Georgia on the campus of Clark Atlanta University, the Sorority's mission is to \\"develop and maintain positive visibility of lesbian women in our communities.\\" The Sorority has formulated a 5-Facet Philanthropic Programming Platform, including Diversity Education and Civil Equality. It is the only LGBT Greek-letter organization to sign the Human Rights Campaign's Million For Marriage petition. Sorority History=KAL's Beginnings During her second year of attendance at Clark Atlanta University, the founder became interested in forming a Sisterhood for lesbians. Inspired by various special- interest fraternal organizations, she set out to design an organization for LBT women. On the evening of October 19, 2003, the founder drafted the basis of Kappa Alpha Lambda Sorority. The purpose of the organization, as stated in the inaugural Constitution and Bylaws, would be to provide a place that nurtured the \\"personal and professional development of lesbian women of merit.\\" Early development of the Sorority included the adoption of its colors, mascot, and various other symbols. It was also decided, in December 2003, that Kappa would focus on the creation of partnerships with civic organizations targeting LGBT and women's health issues. Philanthropy: 2003-2011 Beginning with AIDSwalk Atlanta 2003, Sorority members committed to working with various organizations in an effort to improve the community. In Kappa Alpha Lambda's first five years, local colonies and chapters have continued to contribute funds and community service hours to AIDSwalk each year. In early 2004, members recognized the impact of untreated health conditions on the lesbian population, and chose the Susan G. Komen Foundation (now Susan G. Komen for the Cure) and the Atlanta Lesbian Cancer Initiative as Sorority partners. On October 19, 2004, Kappa Alpha Lambda launched its first Signature Program, the Winter Wonderland Project. Designed to provide gifts for children under the care of child-focused charities and advocacy groups, Winter Wonderland is the Sorority's longest running privately instituted philanthropy. By the second quarter of 2005, ŒöŒÜŒõ members had approved the development of a Sorority Programming Platform. Named the Five Facets, the initiative would become the foundation of Kappa Alpha Lambda's future civic endeavors. All Sorority colonies and chapters use the Facets as a guideline for the development of community service programming. The Five Facet Philanthropic Programming Platform *Facet I: Civil Equality for all LGBT Persons *Facet II: Diversity and Tolerance Education *Facet III: Health Awareness *Facet IV: Financial Education and Empowerment *Facet V: Leadership Training and Development The Sorority's interest in combating human rights violations on the international stage continued to grow, and The Polaris Project became a partner in April 2005. By July of the same year, the Sorority's National President released a letter requesting the help of all LGBT sororities and fraternities in the effort to stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan. To date, Kappa Alpha Lambda still offers philanthropic programs aimed at increasing awareness and providing financial support to the region. In September 2005, Kappa Alpha Lambda became the only LGBT fraternal organization to sign the Human Rights Campaign's Million for Marriage Petition. Expansion: The 1st Five Years Though the Sorority was founded in Atlanta, GA, its home chapter would not be officially chartered until May 21, 2004. During the first two years of Kappa Alpha Lambda's existence, no effort was made to extend membership beyond the local area. Sorority members agreed that emphasis should be placed on internal development before seeking to expand. In June 2005, membership inquiries began arriving from New York, Florida, and other areas. On October 31, 2005, Kappa Alpha Lambda held its first National initiation, and established New York City Professional Colony and chartered March 1, 2009. The Los Angeles Professional Colony was established the following summer and was also charted March 1, 2009. Membership Intake Since its beginnings, the Sorority has held membership intake as a private, invitation-only process. In order to be considered for an invitation, a candidate must identify as a lesbian, have reached the age of majority, and have a consistent record of service to the community. Prospective members contact the nearest local colony or chapter and express their interest in receiving an invitation. The local members then interact with the prospective member, learning her interests, personality, and commitment to the philanthropic programs of the Sorority. Women located in an area where ŒöŒÜŒõ is not represented can submit a Request for Information through the Sorority's National website. If the prospective member is deemed a good candidate for Membership, she is approved by the members and given an invitation. After this, the membership education process begins. Membership Classifications At the time of initiation, new Members are classified as Collegiate or Professional. Collegiate members are currently matriculating students at a two or four year college or university and maintain the required cumulative GPA for membership. Professional members are women who have obtained a post-secondary degree or have comparable professional experience. The distinction of honorary membership is conveyed to women who have provided extraordinary service to the LGBT community, and who have made a consistent effort to contribute positively to lesbian and mainstream life. Organization=Geographic Structure Kappa Alpha Lambda Sorority Incorporated is structured into six provinces, each of which serves a specific geographic area. As each geographic area is occupied, a staff is appointed to act as liaison between local entities and the National organization. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em; font-size: 90%;\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFB6C1;\\"  Kappa Alpha Lambda Sorority Provinces Province I: Northeastern ME, VT, NH, MA, RI, CT, NY, NJ, PA, DE, OH, IL, IN, MI, WV, VA, MD, D.C., WI.

PTR-MS is used for online monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air and was developed in 1995 by scientists at the Institut f√ºr Ionenphysik at the Leopold-Franzens University in Innsbruck, Austria.A. Hansel, A. Jordan, R. Holzinger, P. Prazeller W. Vogel, W. Lindinger, Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry: on-line trace gas analysis at ppb level, Int. J. of Mass Spectrom. and Ion Proc., 149/150, 609-619 (1995). A PTR-MS instrument consists of an ion source that is directly connected to a drift tube (in contrast to SIFT-MS no mass filter is interconnected) and an analyzing system (quadrupole mass analyzer or time-of-flight mass spectrometer). Commercially available PTR-MS instruments have a response time of about 100 ms and reach a detection limit in the single digit pptv or even ppqv region. Established fields of application are environmental research, food and flavor science, biological research, medicine, Homeland security, cleanroom monitoring, etc.  Theory  With H3O+ as the reagent ion the proton transfer process is (with being the trace component) Fig. 1: Evolution of reagent ion yields and sensitivities of PTR-MS instruments taken from peer reviewed journal articles Reaction () is only possible if energetically allowed, i.e. if the proton affinity of is higher than the proton affinity of H2O (691 kJ/molR.S. Blake, P.S. Monks, A.M. Ellis, Proton-Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry, Chem. Rev., 109, 861-896 (2009)). As most components of ambient air possess a lower proton affinity than H2O (e.g. N2, O2, Ar, CO2, etc.) the H3O+ ions only react with VOC trace components and the air itself acts as a buffer gas. Moreover, due to the low concentrations of trace components one can assume that the total number of H3O+ ions remains nearly unchanged, which leads to the equation In equation () [RH+] is the density of product ions, [H3O+]0 is the density of reagent ions in absence of reactant molecules in the buffer gas, is the reaction rate constant and is the average time the ions need to pass the reaction region. With a PTR-MS instrument the number of product and of reagent ions can be measured, the reaction rate constant can be found in literature for most substancesY. Ikezoe, S. Matsuoka and A. Viggiano, Gas Phase Ion-Molecule Reaction Rate Constants through 1986, Maruzen Company Ltd., Tokyo, (1987). and the reaction time can be derived from the set instrument parameters. Therefore, the absolute concentration of trace constituents [R] can be easily calculated without the need of calibration or gas standards. Furthermore, it gets obvious that the overall sensitivity of a PTR-MS instrument is dependent on the reagent ion yield. Fig. 1 gives an overview of several published (in peer-reviewed journals) reagent ion yields during the last decades and the corresponding sensitivities.  Technology  Hydronium ions generated from water vapor in an ionizer are reacting with analytes in a drift chamber. Ions are separated in an analyzer based on the mass-to-charge ratio, and are subsequently transferred to a detector where identification takes place. In commercial PTR-MS instruments water vapor is ionized in a hollow cathode discharge: :e^- + H2O -> H2O+ + 2e^- :e^- + H2O -> H2+ + O + 2e^- :e^- + H2O -> H+ + OH + 2e^- :e^- + H2O -> O+ + H2 + 2e^-. After the discharge a short drift tube is used to form very pure (>99.5%) H3O+ via ion-molecule reactions: :H2+ + H2O -> H2O+ + H2 :H+ + H2O -> H2O+ + H :O+ + H2O -> H2O+ + O :H2O+ + H2O -> H3O+ + OH. Due to the high purity of the reagent ions a mass filter between the ion source and the reaction drift tube is not necessary and H3O+ can be injected directly. The absence of this mass filter in turn greatly reduces losses of reagent ions and leads eventually to an outstandingly low detection limit of the whole instrument. In the reaction drift tube a vacuum pump is continuously drawing through air containing the VOCs one wants to analyze. At the end of the drift tube the protonated molecules are mass analyzed (quadrupole mass analyzer or time-of-flight mass spectrometer) and detected. As an alternative to H3O+ already in early PTR-MS related publications the use of NH4+ reagent ions has been suggested. Ammonia has a proton affinity of 853.6 kJ/mol. For compounds that have a higher proton affinity than ammonia proton transfer can take place similar to the process described above for hydronium: :NH4+ + R -> RH+ + NH3. Additionally, for compounds with higher, but also for some with lower proton affinities than ammonia a clustering reaction can be observed :NH4+ + R -> R.NH4+* where the cluster needs a third body to get collisionally stabilized. The main advantage of using NH4+ reagent ions is that fragmentation of analytes upon chemical ionization is strongly suppressed, leading to straightforward mass spectra even for complex mixtures. The reason why during the first 20 years after the invention of PTR-MS NH4+ reagent ions have only been used in a very limited number of studies is most probably because the NH4+ production required toxic and corrosive ammonia as a source gas. This led to problems with handling the instrument and its exhaust gas, as well as to increased wear of vacuum components. In 2017 a patent application was submitted where the inventors introduced a novel method of NH4+ production without the need of any form of ammonia. In this method N2 and water vapor are introduced into the hollow cathode ion source and by adjusting electric fields and pressures NH4+ can be produced at the same or even higher purity levels than H3O+. It is expected that this invention, which eliminates the problems connected to the use of NH4+ so far, will lead to a widespread use of NH4+ reagent ions in the near future.  Advantages  Advantages include low fragmentation ‚Äì only a small amount of energy is transferred during the ionization process (compared to e.g. electron ionization), therefore fragmentation is suppressed and the obtained mass spectra are easily interpretable, no sample preparation is necessary ‚Äì VOC containing air and liquids' headspaces can be analyzed directly, real-time measurements ‚Äì with a typical response time of 100 ms VOCs can be monitored on-line, real-time quantification ‚Äì absolute concentrations are obtained directly without previous calibration measurements, compact and robust setup ‚Äì due to the simple design and the low number of parts needed for a PTR-MS instrument, it can be built in into space saving and even mobile housings, easy to operate ‚Äì for the operation of a PTR-MS only electric power and a small amount of distilled water are needed. Unlike other techniques no gas cylinders are needed for buffer gas or calibration standards.  Disadvantages  One disadvantage is that not all molecules are detectable. Because only molecules with a proton affinity higher than water can be detected by PTR-MS, proton transfer from H3O+ is not suitable for all fields of application. Therefore, in 2009 first PTR-MS instruments were presented, which are capable of switching between H3O+ and O2+ (and NO+) as reagent ions. This enhances the number of detectable substances to important compounds like ethylene, acetylene, most halocarbons, etc. Furthermore, particularly with NO+ it is possible to separate and independently quantifiy some isomers. In 2012 a PTR-MS instrument was introduced which extends the selectable reagent ions to Kr+ and Xe+; this should allow for the detection of nearly all possible substances (up to the ionization energy of krypton (14 eV)). Although the ionization method for these additional reagent ions is charge-exchange rather than proton-transfer ionization the instruments can still be considered as \\"classic\\" PTR-MS instruments, i.e. no mass filter between the ion source and the drift tube and only some minor modifications on the ion source and vacuum design. The maximum measurable concentration is limited. Equation (2) is based on the assumption that the decrease of reagent ions is negligible, therefore the total concentration of VOCs in air must not exceed about 10 ppmv. Otherwise the instrument's response will not be linear anymore and the concentration calculation will be incorrect. This limitation can be overcome easily by diluting the sample with a well-defined amount of pure air.  Sensitivity enhancing measures  As it is the case for most analytical instruments, also in PTR-MS there has always been a quest for sensitivity improvement and for lowering the detection limit. However, until 2012 these improvements were limited to optimizations of the conventional setup, i.e. ion source, DC drift tube, transfer lens system, mass spectrometer (compare above). The reason for this conservative approach was that the addition of any RF ion focusing device negatively affects the well-defined PTR-MS ion chemistry, which makes quantification complicated and considerably limits comparability of measurement results obtained with different instruments. Only in 2016 a patent application providing a solution to this problem was submitted.  Ion funnel  Ion funnels are RF devices which have been used for decades to focus ion currents into narrow beams. In PTR-MS they have been introduced in 2012 by Barber et al. when they presented a PTR-MS setup with a PTR reaction region incorporating an ion funnel. Although the focusing properties of the ion funnel improved the sensitivity of the setup by a factor of >200 (compared to operating in DC only mode, i.e. with the ion funnel turned off) for some compounds, the sensitivities of other compounds were only improved by a factor of <10. That is, because of the highly compound dependent instrumental response one of the main advantages of PTR-MS, namely that concentration values can be directly calculated, is lost and a calibration measurement is needed for each analyte of interest. Furthermore, with this approach unusual fragmentation of analytes has been observed which complicates interpretation of measurement results and comparison between different types of instruments even more. A different concept has been introduced by the company IONICON Analytik GmbH. (Innsbruck, AT) where the ion funnel is not predominantly part of the reaction region but mainly for focusing the ions into the transfer region to the TOF mass spectrometer. In combination with the above-mentioned method of controlling the ion chemistry this enables a considerable increase in sensitivity and thus also an improvement of the detection limit, while keeping the ion chemistry well-defined and thus avoiding problems with quantification and interpretation of the results.  Ion guide  Quadrupole, hexapole and other multipole ion guides can be used to transfer ions between different parts of an instrument with high efficiency. In PTR-MS they are particularly suitable for being installed in the differentially pumped interface between the reaction region and the mass spectrometer. In 2014 Sulzer et al. published an article about a PTR-MS instrument which utilizes a quadrupole ion guide between the drift tube and the TOF mass spectrometer. They reported an increase in sensitivity by a factor of 25 compared to a similar instrument without an ion guide. Quadrupole ion guides are known to have high focusing power, but also rather narrow m/z transmission bands. Hexapole ion guides on the other hand have focusing capabilities over a broader m/z band. Additionally, less energy is put into the transmitted ions, i.e. fragmentation and other adverse effects are less likely to occur. Consequently, some latest high-end PTR-MS instruments are equipped with hexapole ion guides for considerably improved performance or even with a sequential arrangement of an ion funnel followed by a hexapole ion guide for even higher sensitivity and lower detection limit.  Add-Ons  As a real-time trace gas analysis method based on mass spectrometry PTR-MS has two obvious limitations: Isomers cannot be easily separated (for some it is possible by switching the reagent ions and/or by changing the reduced electric field strength in the drift tube) and the sample has to be in the gas phase. Countermeasures against these limitations have been developed in the form of add-ons, which can either be installed into the PTR-MS instrument or operated as external devices.  FastGC  Gas chromatography (GC) in combination with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is capable of separating isomeric compounds. Although GC has been successfully coupled to PTR-MS in the past, this approach annihilates the real-time capability of the PTR-MS technology, because a single GC analysis run typically takes between 30 min and 1 h. Thus, state-of- the-art GC add-ons for PTR-MS are based on fastGC technology. Materic et al. utilized an early version of a commercially available fastGC addon in order to distinguish various monoterpene isomers. Within a fastGC run of about 70 s they were able to separate and identify: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, camphene, myrcene, 3-carene and limonene in a standard mixture, Norway spruce, Scots pine and black pine samples, respectively. Particularly, if the operation mode of a PTR-MS instrument equipped with fastGC is continuously switched between fastGC and direct injection (dependent on the application, e.g. a loop sequence of one fastGC run followed by 10 min of direct injection measurement), real-time capability is preserved, while at the same time valuable information on substance identification and isomer separation is acquired.  Aerosol and particulate matter inlet  Researchers at the Leopold-Franzens University in Innsbruck invented a dedicated PTR-MS inlet system for the analysis of aerosols and particulate matter, which they called \\"CHemical Analysis of aeRosol ON-line (CHARON)\\". After further development work in collaboration with a PTR-MS manufacturer, CHARON has become readily available as an add-on for PTR-MS instruments in 2017. The add-on consists of a honeycomb activated charcoal denuder which adsorbs organic gases but transmits particles, an aerodynamic lens system that collimates sub-¬µm particles, and a thermo-desorber that evaporates non-refractory organic particulate matter at moderate temperatures of 100-160¬∞C and reduced pressures of a few mbar. So far, CHARON has predominantly being utilized within studies in the field of atmospheric chemistry, e.g. for airborne measurements of particulate organic matter and bulk organic aerosol analysis.  Inlet for liquids  A now well established setup for the controlled evaporation and subsequent analysis of liquids with PTR-MS has been published in 2013 by Fischer et al.. As the authors saw the main application of their setup in the calibration of PTR-MS instruments via aqueous standards, they named it \\"Liquid Calibration Unit (LCU)\\". The LCU sprays a liquid standard into a gas stream at well-defined flow rates via a purpose-built nebulizer (optimized for reduced probability of clogging and high tolerance to salts in the liquid). The resulting micro-droplets are injected into a heated (> 100¬∞C) evaporation chamber. This concept offers two main advantages: i) the evaporation of compounds is enhanced by the enlarged surface area of the droplets and ii) compounds which are dissociated in water, such as acids (or bases), experience a shift in pH value when the water evaporates from a droplet. This in turn reduces dissociation and supports total evaporation of the compound. The resulting continuous gas flow containing the analytes can be directly introduced into a PTR-MS instrument for analysis.  Applications  The most common applications for the PTR-MS technique are environmental researchR. Beale, P. S. Liss, J. L. Dixon, P. D.

Trace gas analysis is another common application. Some other techniques are Secondary electrospray ionization (SESI), Electrospray ionization (ESI), and Selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT).  Food science  Fig. 2: PTR-MS measurement of vanillin dissemination in human breath. Isoprene is a product of human metabolism and acts as an indicator for breath cycles. (The measurement was performed utilizing a \\"N.A.S.E.\\" inlet system coupled to a \\"HS PTR-MS\\".) Fig. 2 shows a typical PTR-MS measurement performed in food and flavor research. The test person swallows a sip of a vanillin flavored drink and breathes via his nose into a heated inlet device coupled to a PTR-MS instrument. Due to the high time resolution and sensitivity of the instrument used here, the development of vanillin in the person's breath can be monitored in real-time (please note that isoprene is shown in this figure because it is a product of human metabolism and therefore acts as an indicator for the breath cycles). The data can be used for food design, i.e. for adjusting the intensity and duration of vanillin flavor tasted by the consumer. Fig. 3: PTR mass spectrum of laboratory air obtained using a TOF based PTR instrument. Another example for the application of PTR- MS in food science was published in 2008 by C. Lindinger et al.C. Lindinger, D. Labbe, P. Pollien, A. Rytz, M. A. Juillerat, C. Yeretzian, I. Blank, 2008 When Machine Tastes Coffee: Instrumental Approach To Predict the Sensory Profile of Espresso Coffee, Anal. Chem., 80/5, 1574-1581. in Analytical Chemistry. This publication found great response even in non-scientific media. Lindinger et al. developed a method to convert \\"dry\\" data from a PTR-MS instrument that measured headspace air from different coffee samples into expressions of flavor (e.g. \\"woody\\", \\"winey\\", \\"flowery\\", etc.) and showed that the obtained flavor profiles matched nicely to the ones created by a panel of European coffee tasting experts.  Air quality analysis  In Fig. 3 a mass spectrum of air inside a laboratory (obtained with a time-of-flight (TOF) based PTR-MS instrument), is shown. The peaks on m/z 19, 37 and 55 (and their isotopes) represent the reagent ions (H3O+) and their clusters. On m/z 30 and 32 NO+ and O2+, which are both impurities originating from the ion source, appear. All other peaks correspond to compounds present in typical laboratory air (e.g. high intensity of protonated acetone on m/z 59). If one takes into account that virtually all peaks visible in Fig. 3 are in fact double, triple or multiple peaks (isobaric compounds) it becomes obvious that for PTR-MS instruments selectivity is at least as important as sensitivity, especially when complex samples / compositions are analyzed. One methods for improving the selectivity is high mass resolution. When the PTR source is coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer isobaric compounds can be distinguished and substances can be identified via their exact mass.A. Jordan, S. Haidacher, G. Hanel, E. Hartungen, L. M√§rk, H. Seehauser, R. Schottkowsky, P. Sulzer, T.D. M√§rk: A high resolution and high sensitivity time-of-flight proton-transfer- reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS), International Journal of Mass Spectrometry, 286, 122‚Äì128, (2009). Some PTR-MS instruments are despite of the lack of a mass filter between the ion source and the drift tube capable of switching the reagent ions (e.g. to NO+ or O2+). With the additional information obtained by using different reagent ions a much higher level of selectivity can be reached, e.g. some isomeric molecules can be distinguished.

Most notably, it alleges that the Bush administration ordered the forgery of the Habbush letter to implicate Iraq as having ties to al Qaeda and the hijackers in the September 11 attacks. All these claims have been strenuously denied by the White House and all parties involved.

The letter purported to be from General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, the head of Iraqi Intelligence, to Saddam Hussein, detailing training which 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta supposedly received in Iraq and mentioning receipt of a shipment from Niger. Suskind says that the CIA forged this letter before the 2003 Iraq invasion, on an order from the White House. The author also claims that the Bush administration had information from a top Iraqi Intelligence official, General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, \\"that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq‚Äîintelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion\\". Suskind further states that Vice-President Dick Cheney implemented a set of procedures and processes designed to make the President less involved and less accountable for various controversial decisions and actions.

Deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, said: \\"The notion that the White House directed anyone to forge a letter from Habbush to Saddam Hussein is absurd.\\" George Tenet, the former Director of Central Intelligence, said that \\"there was no such order from the White House to me nor, to the best of my knowledge, was anyone from CIA ever involved in any such effort\\", adding: \\"The notion that I would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous.\\"\\"Tenet statement on Suskind\\".

Suskind has also claimed that Richer came under pressure to release his statement; on an interview with National Public Radio, he stated: Regarding Maguire's statement, Suskind noted: In another interview with Democracy Now!, Suskind claims that he confirmed the claims of Richer and Maguire in several interviews: \\"The fact is, is it‚Äôs not a matter of a passing conversation. We had many conversations on this specific issue, on the Habbush matter, with all of the key sources. There was never any mystery about what it was, what the Habbush letter was, what the Habbush mission entailed, in terms of the setup with the Iraq intelligence chief. I mean, exhaustive, hour after hour. And the way I do it as an investigative reporter, is you go back again and again and again.\\" And in the NPR interview, he claims that both Richer and Maguire had indicated a willingness to testify against the Administration about these allegations: \\"both of them, frankly, are big believers in the truth process. And I've talked to both of them about, 'Hey, you're never going to feel heat quite like this.' And they said, both of them, Richer and Maguire, 'I'm ready to go in front of Senate committees and House committees. I'm ready to have my moment.' They knew everything that was in the book. You know, once they get there and the moment arrives, sometimes their knees buckle. And then you kind of say, 'All right, let's take a deep breath.' And you get them upright, and they tend to often then walk forward.\\" Responding to Tenet, Suskind admitted that he had not spoken to Tenet about the allegation. Suskind responded to the White House's claim that he \\"has chosen to dwell in the netherworld of bizarre conspiracy theories\\" by stating that they were \\"all but obligated to deny this\\".\\"Administration fights back against book claiming it knowingly lied about Iraq-Al Qaeda connection\\". Fox News. August 5, 2008. Retrieved August 10, 2008. Dan Froomkin of The Washington Post elaborated: \\"The allegation in Ron Suskind's new book that the White House ordered the CIA to forge evidence of a link between Iraq and al Qaeda is so incredibly grave that it demands a serious response from the government. If what Suskind writes is true ‚Äì or even partially true ‚Äì someone at the highest levels of the White House engaged in a criminal conspiracy to deceive the American public ... But so far, we've gotten mostly hyperbole, innuendo and narrowly constructed denials.\\" He goes on: Congressional investigation The House Judiciary Committee announced plans to investigate the allegations. Committee Chairman John Conyers has called it \\"the most critical investigation of the entire Bush administration\\". Conyers' office issued letters directing some of the principals allegedly involved in the forgery to appear before the Committee for questioning.

CBS News. WMD distortions Another controversial claim in the book is that former Iraqi Intelligence Chief Habbush had told American and British intelligence that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; this claim was controversial because the British and U.S. governments had been insisting at the time that such weapons did exist, and went to war in Iraq in part on the strength of the evidence of the existence of such weapons programs. Suskind's claim would suggest that the U.S. and UK may have known all along that there were no such weapons in Iraq. Suskind was interviewed on BBC Radio 4 on August 19, 2008. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera followed the interview by reading a statement from former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove, in which Dearlove said: After reading the statement, Corera emphasized that the sources he spoke with \\"were careful not to deny that a meeting did take place with the Iraqi intelligence chief on the eve of war in which this man Habbush denied Saddam had any weapons. But I think the key question is whether he was meeting MI6 as a spy providing secret intelligence on Saddam, in which case his information might have been taken very seriously, or whether, in fact, this was a back channel that Saddam Hussein himself had authorized, and that therefore this Iraqi intelligence chief Habbush was simply saying what other Iraqi intelligence officials were already saying.\\" Detention of a Pakistani national inside the White House Suskind alleges that, on July 27, 2006, a Pakistani national walking past the White House was detained under suspicion of being a terrorist and questioned in an \\"interrogation room\\" under the building. According to conservative journalist Ronald Kessler, the Secret Service has disputed Suskind's account, saying: \\"We have no record of the incident or the [Pakistani] individual referenced.\\" A Secret Service spokesman went on to add: \\"Bringing an individual inside the White House for questioning defies standard security and protocols and safety procedures. We would not bring a suspicious person, potential prisoner, prisoner, or any person who has not been properly vetted onto the White House grounds.\\" Kessler also quotes Suskind as saying that when he contacted the Secret Service in the course of researching his book, a spokeswoman told him that the individual in question was not on fileKessler, Ronald (August 25, 2008). \\"Secret Service Denies Ron Suskind's Account\\". Newsmax. Book reviews The Way of the World marked the fullest return of the investigative narrative form that shaped Suskind‚Äôs first book, A Hope in the Unseen. This technique was praised by many in reviewing Way of the World. In his assessment for the Literary Review, Michael Burleigh noted the linked vignettes that formed the bedrock of the narrative: \\"Using a series of interwoven stories, some hopeful, others disturbing, Suskind explores whether the United States and the Muslim world will ever be able to find mutual respect and understanding ... This is a hugely important field that has never been so well examined.\\"Michael Burleigh, Literary Review. Similar encomium was used in analyzing Suskind‚Äôs capabilities as a storyteller. The Sunday Times declared: \\"Suskind is never unsympathetic to his characters, who he appears to have debriefed intensively. He is a romantic, a writer who clearly believes that his country has betrayed its past, its values and its moral compass by failing to tell the truth about the war.\\" Perhaps the most substantial testament to Suskind‚Äôs return to a narrative style came from the New York Observer. \\"Moving ... Mr. Suskind is a prodigiously talented craftsman ... It‚Äôs all here: a cast of characters that sprawls across class and circumstance to represent the totality of a historical moment ... These hard times, Mr. Suskind‚Äôs book suggests, call for a nonfiction Dickens.\\"Liu, Jonathan (August 13, 2008). \\"Bush-Cheney as True Novel\\". The New York Observer. The New York Times Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Mark Danner wrote: Los Angeles Times The Los Angeles Times's Tim Rutten was critical of The Way of the World, calling it \\"structurally a mess\\" and as \\"a work of literary nonfiction ... an irritating example of overreaching\\". Speaking of the book's conception, Rutten muses that \\"Suskind, mindful that the Bush/Cheney administration is staggering to inglorious conclusion, intended this book to look to the future as well as back to the recent past - to suggest, in some fashion, a way forward\\". Rutten credits Suskind, too, writing that \\"Suskind's reporting continues to make him an indispensable chronicler of the Bush/Cheney debacle\\"; and he weighs in to support Suskind on the controversy surrounding the Habbush letter, saying of the transcript posted on Suskind's website: \\"It not only supports Suskind's account as written, but shows he took a conservative approach toward his material.\\"Rutten, Tim (August 9, 2008). \\"'The Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism' by Ron Suskind\\".

The largest, heaviest and most powerful 4-4-0 steam locomotive to run in Australia, it was the final development of this locomotive type in Australia. History In 1900, Victorian Railways still ran express passenger trains with the successful but ageing B class 2-4-0 which dated back to 1862. The 'New A' class 4-4-0 of 1889 had proven to be a successful design, as had its close cousin and exact contemporary the X class 0-6-0. With traffic needs continuing to grow, the VR drafting office decided to take the best features of the New A and X class, but enlarge the locomotive with a larger, higher pressure boiler and larger cylinders. Design features Innovative design features of the AA class included air sanding equipment, improved Gresham No. 9 injectors, horizontal grid spark arrestors, steam for auxiliaries supplied directly from the dome, and a sloped ashpan to provide easier cleaning.Cave et al., p. 178 With a comparatively high boiler, later increased to , it was considered impractical to use traditional slide valves. A trial installation of overhead piston valves on New A class locomotive No. 422 demonstrated considerably greater efficiency and reduced maintenance, and the AA became the first of many subsequent VR locomotive classes to be built with piston valves. With an axle load of , the AA had reached the design limits of size and power possible with a two-coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively lightweight track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited adhesive weight (due to axle load constraints and having only two powered axles) combined to produce a less- than-ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles. Production Twenty of the class were built by the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, entering service between 1900 and 1903. The first batch of ten, delivered in 1900-01, had a traditional three- axle tender. The second batch had a slightly larger firebox and grate, boiler pressure, and larger, four-axle tenders. Service life Locomotive AA 548 decorated for a Royal Train in 1901 Upon introduction in 1900, the AA went into service on mainline passenger service, hauling key express services such as the Sydney Express. They were chosen to haul the Royal Train of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in 1901. With the introduction of larger, heavier express passenger rolling stock in the form of the E type carriages of 1906, the VR introduced the considerably more powerful A2 class 4-6-0 in 1907, which superseded the AA class on premier services. However, the AA continued in service in assistant duties, as well as hauling show and race train specials. Design improvements The AA class inherited a number of design improvements from the Dd class mixed traffic locomotives which were introduced in 1902. The second batch of AA locomotives utilised a bogie tender design based on that of the Dd in place of the original six wheel design, offering a far greater water capacity. During 1923-24, Nos. 542, 544, 566 and 570 were fitted with Robinson superheaters, based on the successful trial of Schmidt pattern superheaters on Dd 882. As was common VR practice at the time for locomotives converted to superheating, the boiler pressure was reduced - in this case to - to reduce maintenance and prolong boiler life. Nominal tractive effort was reduced to a quoted at 85% boiler pressure, with total weight rising to .Cave, et al., p. 179 Another key improvement was the fitting of tablet exchangers to No. 552 and 570 for non-stop running on single-track sections of the North-eastern line, a portent of improvements on this line that would eventually lead to the non-stop Melbourne-Albury Spirit of Progress service of 1937. Accidents Three AA class locomotives were involved in the Sunshine rail disaster of 1908, when an Up Bendigo service hauled by AA 564 and 544 crashed into the rear of an Up Ballarat excursion service hauled by AA 534 and 'Old A' 202, resulting in the deaths of 44 people and the injury of over 400. Withdrawal and scrapping The AA class was gradually made redundant by the delivery of large numbers of 4-6-0 locomotives of the new Dd and A2 classes between 1902 and 1922, which eventually totalled 446 locomotives. The A2 offered considerably more power, while the Dd offered similar tractive effort to the AA but much greater route availability due to its lower axle load. Withdrawals commenced in 1919 and by 1926 only the superheated AA locomotives remained on the register. A number of the boilers of the withdrawn locomotives saw further use powering river boats, while AA 532 served at Newport Workshops after withdrawal as a mobile stationary boiler. By January 1932, the entire class had been recorded as withdrawn. They were all scrapped shortly after withdrawal, with the exception of Newport Workshops boiler locomotive AA 532, which lasted until 1940.

S.\\" Raghunathan is an Indian mathematician. He is currently Head of the National Centre for Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai. Formerly Professor of eminence at TIFR in Homi Bhabha Chair.Homi Bhabha Chair at TIFR Raghunathan received his PhD in Mathematics from (TIFR), University of Mumbai; his advisor was M. S. Narasimhan. Raghunathan is a Fellow of the Royal Society, of the Third World Academy of Sciences, and of the American Mathematical SocietyList of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 9 June 2013. and a recipient of the civilian honour of Padma Bhushan. Early life and education Madabusi Santanam Raghunathan was born on 11 August 1941 at Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, his maternal grandparents' place. The family lived in Chennai. His father Santanam continued the family's timber business and expanded it through exports to Europe and Japan. He had earlier joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, after a BSc in Physics, but had to leave his studies mid-way to take care of the family business. Raghunathan fondly recalls that his father had a feeling for science and used to talk about it, making it very interesting to the children. Raghunathan's mother came from a family with an academic tradition. Her father was an esteemed Professor of English, who had contributed articles to the Cornhill Magazine. He also wrote, and published on his own, a book on William Makepeace Thackeray, which was later found to have been reprinted in the United States, without his knowledge, indeed in violation of the copyright he held. Raghunathan had his schooling in Chennai, in P.S. High School, Mylapore and the Madras Christian College High School. He passed his SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) examination in 1955. There is a rather interesting story about it: after the Sanskrit paper he absent-mindedly left the examination hall along with his answer paper, and was intercepted on his way home by a fellow student, following commotion at the examination hall on account of the missing answer paper. He narrowly escaped having to reappear for the entire examination, thanks to the headmaster vouching for his integrity. The University of Madras had the curious restriction of not admitting anyone under the age of 14 years and six months, though after attaining that age it was possible to be admitted even in higher classes. Raghunathan therefore pursued his Intermediate at the St. Joseph's College, Bangalore during 1955‚Äì57. He then returned to Chennai and joined B.A.(Hons.) in mathematics, in Vivekananda College, which had a very good reputation. Research After initial training during 1960‚Äì62, he worked on a research problem suggested by Prof. M.S. Narasimhan, on \\"Deformations of linear connections and Riemannian metrics\\", and solved it by the summer of 1963. He wrote his PhD thesis under the guidance of Professor Narasimhan and was awarded the degree by the University of Bombay in 1966. After completing his PhD, Raghunathan spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, US. Through the years, he has held visiting position in many academic institutions in the US, Europe and Japan, for durations ranging from a few weeks to a year, and has spoken at several international conferences. Discrete subgroups of Lie groups have been the central objects of his research. He has made contributions to rigidity and arithmeticity problems. Contribution Raghunathan has also played an important role in the promotion of mathematics through various scientific bodies, in both advisory and administrative capacities. He organised the Ramanujan centenary celebrations in Chennai in 1987, with an international conference attended by the foremost number theorists. His most important and comprehensive contribution in this sphere has been his role in the National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM). Raghunathan was a member of the Board since it was formed in 1983 and became its chairman in 1987. He continues to serve in that capacity. The Board has undertaken a variety of activities through the years: apart from providing financial support to mathematics libraries around the country and grants for research projects, organising conferences, travel to both national and international events and so on, the Board has taken a pro-active role in tapping mathematical talent through various activities, such as Olympiad activity, Mathematics Training and Talent Search, Scholarships/Fellowships at the M.Sc., Ph.D. and post- doctoral levels, and the rather innovative Nurture Programme conceived by Raghunathan to support learning of mathematics by students even while pursuing other career options. He organized the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM 2010) at Hyderabad in India. This was the first ever ICM held in India. Book Written Raghunathan's book Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups, published by Springer Verlag, Germany, in 1972 is now a classic in the area. It is unique in its coverage of various results which in recent decades have been put to considerable use, and as such it is much appreciated and widely referred to. The book has been translated into the Russian and published with a foreword by Grigory Margulis.

Early life Davis' place of birth is uncertain, but he was probably born in upstate New York. Military life During the American revolution, Davis fought as an ally of the British, rising to the position of war chief. After Britain's defeat, he travelled to Upper Canada with his cousin Joseph Brant, settling on the Six Nations reserve, building a farm about five miles north of the Mohawk Village which became Brantford. During the War of 1812, Davis was active on the British side. Religious conversion Sometime before 1820, Davis was baptised an Anglican. There was little access to missionaries or priests near his home on the Grand River. Reverend Ralph Leeming made occasional trips through the area. Otherwise lay preachers conducted religious services. Davis took a leadership role in the religious community of the area. He quit drinking around 1820, and began holding prayer meetings at his farm. He called local Mohawks to prayer by blowing a horn, and read sections from the Bible and the Church of England prayerbook to those who attended. In 1823, a white settler heard the horn, and learnt of the prayer meetings. He offered to arrange for Methodist preachers to visit. His offer was accepted, and preacher Edmund Stoney and ordained minister Alvin Torry began making regular trips to the area. As converting Mohawks began to settle around Davis' farm, the area became known as Davisville. Peter Jones brought a number of Mississaugas who had converted to Methodism there in 1824, and Davis' house became insufficient for both his residence and the Methodism mission, so Davis retired to a log cabin while his house was used by the Methodists. The Mississaugas left for the Credit Mission in 1826, and Davisville was once again a purely Mohawk Methodist settlement. By the time of Davis' death, around 150 of the 2000 Mohawks along the Grand River had converted to Methodism. About the same time the Mission site of Davisville was abandoned as spring flood severity increased along the Grand River after forests were cleared to build farms.

(See volume 2, pgs 867-870) When riots between Muslims and Christians in 1277 AH/1860 CE broke out, he played a significant role in extinguishing the chaos and restoring order. He was described as being far from antagonism and tribalism due to his distance from the material world and his piety.

For this reason Shaykh al-May·∏çanƒ´ undertook the task of writing a commentary on it and elucidating its contents. He sought to relate the chosen and established legal positions.

It is in the northeast of the country, in the Styria region. General characteristics Haloze is a hilly area, running roughly east‚Äìwest bounded by the border with Croatia to the south and the Dravinja and Drava rivers to the north. In total, it comprises approximately , where around 21,000 people live in seven municipalities (Cirkulane, Gori≈°nica, Maj≈°perk, Podlehnik, Videm, Zavrƒç, and ≈Ωetale). From its western end near Makole, it runs in a relatively narrow southwest‚Äìnortheast belt as far as Zavrƒç, about in length as the crow flies. Its western part is wooded with thick beech and pine forests, while its eastern part has been a noted viticultural area since Roman times. Ptujska Gora (Mount Ptuj), , one of the hills at the western end of Haloze Geology While Haloze has a similar climate to the rest of the Drava Valley, it is rather different geologically. Its soils are generally mid-Tertiary sandstone based on dolomite rock. Lying in the southern part of the Drava Valley, the Haloze Hills rose before the drying-out of the Pannonian Sea entered its final phase in the middle of Pleistocene epoch, about 600,000 years ago. The water ruptured its way through the modern ƒêerdap Gorge on the Danube River and flowed rapidly away, causing the strong erosion of poorly consolidated sandstone and thus steep hillsides. Haloze's highest point is in Jelovice, at .http://www.planinci-cirkulane.si/index.php/od-kod-smo/haloska-planinska-pot Dialect The Haloze dialect is one of the Pannonian dialects of spoken Slovene. from Karta slovenskih nareƒçij v priroƒçni izdaji, Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, Ljubljana, 1957. See Slovene dialects. Wine Haloze is one of the seven districts of the Podravje wine region, with the others being Ljutomer‚ÄìOrmo≈æ, Radgona‚ÄìKapela, Maribor, Prekmurje, the Central Slovene Hills, and ≈†marje‚ÄìVir≈°tanj. Viticulture in Haloze was started by the Celts as early as the 4th century BC, and spread with the arrival of the Romans. Christianity also continued the tradition as wine played an important role in their ceremonies. The Slavic tribes who later settled in Haloze took on the cultivation of vines from their predecessors.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine. Third Edition pp. 632-633 Oxford University Press 2006 Vineyards here mostly line the upper hillsides, as the lower slopes are often kept in excessive shade. The traditional tilling of horizontal lines of vines included the backbreaking task of carrying soil from the lowest row to the top. As the rows were tilled from the top down, the soil tended to slide downslope, and to upkeep the vineyards properly, the soil collected at the bottom had to be returned to the top. With vertically planted vineyards on less steep slopes, this work is no longer as necessary as it once was, but on most sites grass is allowed to grow between the rows to minimize erosion. White wines dominate the area. Laski Rizling is the most frequently planted grape, which is mainly used to produce medium dry, slightly syrupy, wine. However, dry Laski Rizling is also produced. Other popular white wines include Traminec, Beli Pinot, Sauvignon, and Renski Rizling. The only red produced in significant quantities is Modri Pinot. Halo≈æan is a blend of locally produced Laski Rizling, Sauvignon, Beli Pinot, and Sipon that ages quite well. It is often mixed with sparkling water to make spritzer. Most of the wines grown in Haloze are produced, stored, and bottled in Ptuj in the neighbouring Central Slovene Hills area. Monuments Borl Castle, first mentioned in writing in 1199, is on a high rocky ledge overlooking an ancient crossing point on the Drava River. During the Second World War the castle was used by the occupying Germans as an internment camp, and after the war it was converted into a hotel, but then lay empty and abandoned. Recently the state has taken over the care of it and has undertaken its architectural restoration.

History=As 2BCR The Bankstown City Radio Co-operative was one of the first groups to receive a community radio broadcasting licence. Awarded the licence in 1983, the station began broadcasting as 2BCR from studios in a building at the former site of Georges Hall Public School in Birdwood Avenue, Georges Hall. Its programming included music and community interest programmes including weekend sports shows, youth-oriented request programmes, religious programming and for many years hosted a weekly police round-up. In the mid-1990s, the station had a media booth at Belmore Oval to enable live broadcasts of home games by the Bulldogs rugby league team. A mobile studio allowed the station to broadcast from local events. Brendan \\"Jonesy\\" Jones got his start at 2BCR, when it was at Georges hall, He famously got his fathers car bogged on the oval after his shift \\"Jazz beat\\". Jones now works on Breakfast radio as the Jonesy part of Jonesy and Amanda on WSFM. In 1999 BFM moved to new permanent studios at 104 Cahors Road, Padstow. By the early 2000s, the station's focus had shifted to community language programming almost exclusively. On 21 June 2007 the Australian Communications and Media Authority announced that it would not be renewing BFM's community radio broadcasting licence when it expired in July. The reason stated was > Most of the licensee‚Äôs members are from communities outside of the licence > area and a significant proportion of its programmes are directed at > communities that are largely resident outside the licence area. The station was then required to apply for a temporary licence to start from the day the previous licence expired. While successful in its application, BFM now shares its frequency with three other licensees. The current licence expired on January 1, 2010. As a TCBL Three operators shared the 100.9FM frequency between January 2008 and November 2011. They were BACR, a sub-group of the incumbent; CAMS RADIO FLAME FM and BSACR. FLAME FM was by far superior, and was expected to be granted the licence, but due to incorrect information being passed onto ACMA by the other licence holders (thus giving the other TCBL an advantage) CAMS FLAME FM was not granted the licence to the great disappointment of a large portion of the community. On 15 November 2011, 2BACR was awarded the licence to broadcast a community radio service to Bankstown.

His magisterial 860-page The Old Testament: An Introduction (1934, 1965), giving a detailed literary-critical assessment of the history of the formation of each part of the Old Testament on the basis of the documentary hypothesis, has been called the \\"best of its kind\\".Craig D. Bowman, Eissfeldt, Eichrodt, and von Rad‚ÄîThe German Foundation  Life  Born in Northeim in Germany, Eissfeldt studied Protestant theology and Oriental languages from 1905 to 1912 at the University of G√∂ttingen and Berlin's Humboldt University. He earned his habilitation in Berlin in 1913 with a thesis on Old Testament, and his PhD in G√∂ttingen in 1916. From 1913 to 1922 he taught in Berlin, before being appointed in 1922 to the chair of Old Testament at the University of Halle- Wittenberg, where he remained professor for the rest of his life, also serving as a visiting professor at the University of T√ºbingen. He retired in 1957, and died at Halle in 1973.  Work  Eissfeldt was one of the leading representatives of the literary-critical approach in Biblical criticism, following in the school of Julius Wellhausen and Rudolf Smend, with Hermann Gunkel and Wolf Wilhelm Friedrich von Baudissin his teachers in the area of religious history. A prolific writer, his Hexateuchsynopse (Hexateuch synopsis, 1922) and Einleitung in das Alte Testament (Introduction to the Old Testament, 1934, 1956, 1964, 1976) are outstanding examples of his literary- critical research achievements, while his numerous works on Phoenician religion (based in particular on the texts from Ugarit) were leading works in the field of near-east religious history. He also edited the bible commentary series Handbuch zum Alten Testament (Guide to the Old Testament, 1937‚Äì77), and Joseph Aistleitner's W√∂rterbuch der ugaritischen Sprache (Dictionary of the Ugaritic Language, 1963),Otto Eissfeldt, in Richard N. Soulen (ed., 2001), Handbook of Biblical Criticism, p.53. as well as the third edition of Biblia Hebraica (1929‚Äì37) with Albrecht Alt after the death of Rudolf Kittel.  Philosophy  Eissfeldt's scholarship was influenced particularly by Gabler and S√∏ren Kierkegaard to see an uncrossable chasm between history and faith, with Religionsgeschichte or the history of religions being the prerogative of the former and biblical theology being the prerogative of the later. He defined the faith displayed by the Old Testament (and New Testament) as well as necessary of the Christian or Jewish believer, to be only that which is timeless and eternal and which can neither be judged by history and reason, nor judge them. Thus it was only and always from this sort of \\"faith\\" that one could pursue or benefit from biblical theology. In this respect, he agreed with the absolutism or idealism of neo-orthodoxy. He defined history as the enterprise which sought to make known, through historical-critical method, the particulars of Old Testament (and New Testament) religious times and events without accepting any value or truth judgments concerning them. Thus it was only and always from this sort of \\"historical\\" inquiry that one could pursue or benefit from Religionsgeschichte. In that respect, he agreed with the scientific positivism of liberal scholarship. In order for Eissfeldt to maintain both positions, it was necessary that they be held perpetually separate and in tension. This was also the only way each one as so defined could achieve its purest expression. His way of resolving the paradox of this separation between history and faith was a relativism that arbitrarily chose the answers from one side over the other when it seemed most beneficial to the objective or was judged to belong to the category of one side and not the other.

The class, consisting of an FP power car and an FT trailer car, operates services on all electrified lines of the network which comprise the Kapiti, Hutt Valley, Melling and Johnsonville lines. The units are owned by Greater Wellington Rail Ltd, a subsidiary of the Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC), and are run by the company Transdev Wellington since 2016. They were previously run by Tranz Metro, formerly a division of KiwiRail. The FP/FT units were built in South Korea by a consortium of Hyundai Rotem and Mitsui, with the first unit arriving in New Zealand in July 2010 and entering full- time service in March 2011. The first batch of 48 units, the 4000 series units, allowed an increase in the capacity of the Wellington network, and allowed the retirement of the ageing DM/D class \\"English Electric\\" multiple units that were introduced between 1949 and 1954. The 4000 series also relegated the EM/ET \\"Ganz-Mavag\\" class multiple units (introduced 1982-83) to peak services only. A second batch of 35 units, the 5000 series, were introduced in 2015‚Äì16 to replace the remaining EM/ET units. History In 2005 GWRC unveiled a plan for the upgrade of the Wellington commuter rail system to increase capacity and service frequencies. The plan also included: *Extension of commuter services to Waikanae. This involved extending electrification from Paraparaumu and duplicating the line from Mackay's Crossing (north of Paekakariki) to just south of the Waikanae River. The line was renamed from the Paraparaumu Line to the Kapiti Line when services commenced from Waikanae on 20 February 2011. *New station building and associated facilities at Waikanae, and the reconstruction of those at Paraparaumu. *The lowering of Tunnels, extension of loops and renewal of track on the Johnsonville Line. *Upgrade of facilities at several stations. *Resurfacing and heightening of all the platforms on the Johnsonville Line and some on other lines. *The acquisition of new EMU (electric multiple unit) rolling stock. Tender and supply In December 2006, GWRC announced that it would begin the tendering process for 29 EMUs to replace the DM/D English Electric EMUs and to provide additional network capacity. GWRC formed a subsidiary named Greater Wellington Rail Limited to purchase the EMUs and three tenders were shortlisted; Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF), a consortium of Rotem & Mitsui and a consortium of EDi Rail & Bombardier transportation. In July 2007 GWRC announced that the preferred supplier was the consortium of Rotem and Mitsui with the units to be built at the Rotem works in Changwon, South Korea. In April 2008, GWRC announced that an additional 10 units would be purchased, following an earlier addition of another 6 units to the original order. A further addition to the order of three units was announced by GWRC on 4 November 2008, bringing the total number of units to 48 (96 cars). On 23 August 2012 the Greater Wellington Regional Council announced that the option of placing another order for a further 35 units was preferred over refurbishing the EM/ET units, as refurbishing the existing fleet of Ganz Mavag units would be costly and their life would only be extended by 15 years, and still suffer excessive breakdowns. The result of the change would be a totally uniform fleet. The first two of these units, FP/FT 5010 and 5027, landed at the Port of Auckland on 12 May 2015, off the vessel Thermopylae. Specifications GWRC advised that the Request for Tender documentation included the following requirements, although some specifications may change and no weight specifications were available.Official Information Request 2008/083 of 4 August 2008 *The car body height shall not exceed 3506 mm above rail level (ARL) with the pantograph lowered. *The external width shall not exceed 2730 mm. *The maximum height of the floor shall not exceed 1106 mm ARL. *The platform level floor height shall be nominally 680 mm ARL. *The single-car length shall not exceed 20700 mm. *Bogie centres shall be 15300 mm. The cars have AC traction gear and convert the DC power supply to AC. The inverters converting the power give the trains a distinctive high-pitched hum that can be heard when the train is stationary. The interior configuration allows for more standing room, increasing the passenger capacity compared with the EM/ET class units. This does not come at the expense of seating capacity, which remains the same but with 42 fewer front/rear-facing seats per set ‚Äì the A (western) side of the section between the doors of each FT car contains only longitudinal seats, to widen the aisle. The preliminary design was modified with the addition of an emergency exit door at each end to allow for evacuation in the numerous single-track tunnels on the Wellington network. The end doors also allows train staff to move between units while the train is moving or where no platform is available. The FP/FT class differs from the EM/ET class in that the power car is the northern car of the pair rather than the southern one. This is due to only the FT car having a floor level with the platforms for wheelchair access (and a retractable ramp if needed) and having the FT at the southern end makes it closer to the concourse at Wellington railway station. For easy identification, the doors leading to the low floor area of the FT car are painted lime green, whereas the remainder are painted navy blue. Additional differences include a change to open-on-demand doors - rather than all the doors opening when the train stops at the station (as on the DM/D and EM/ET class), the doors are unlocked and passengers must press a button to open that set of doors. At terminal stations, the doors automatically close again after 90 seconds to keep the elements out of the train interior. The FP/FT units have a door interlock system, which prevents the driver applying power while the train doors are still open and unlocked. On the EM/ET units, drivers had to double-check the \\"doors closed\\" light was on before applying power, potentially leading to human error. This configuration led to an incident in March 2013 when three EM/ET units left Wingate station with their doors open and no passenger staff on board, after the driver mistakenly thought he heard the \\"right-of-way\\" buzzer. The 5000 series units have fully automatic Scharfenberg couplers as standard instead of the first batch's semi-automatic knuckle couplers (for emergency coupling to the EMs), and LED lamps for headlights and interior lighting instead of halogen bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Both changes are being retrofitted to the 4000 series units. With the withdrawal of the EM units on 27 May 2016, the operating voltage was increased to 1700V DC to increase the power output available. In 2020, power supply upgrades on the Kapiti Line ($10.1 million) will allow even longer (8 car) trains.Wellington Timetable Changes and Infrastructure Upgrades by Bruce Taylor in' \\"The New Zealand Railway Observer\\" June‚ÄìJuly 2018; No 349 Volume 75 No 2 pages 62,63 Service A large amount of preparation works were undertaken in the Wellington region to allow the units to operate: clearances in tunnels, at platforms and under some bridges had to be increased to take the new trains. KiwiRail installed eleven new rectifier substations to increase the electrical supply for the new trains (nine on existing electrified lines, and two on the new extension to Waikanae), and hardened the signalling system against interference from their AC traction equipment. The operating voltage was increased to 1600 volts DC to maximise the power available. Despite the power upgrades the length of Matangi trains was initially limited to a maximum of six cars out of concern for the load long trains would have on the power supply. Testing performed by Tranz Metro and KiwiRail in September 2011 with eight-car sets in revenue service on the Hutt Valley and Kapiti Lines found that the network is able to cope with a limited number of long trains (one at a time on the Hutt Valley line and two on the Kapiti line) resulting in eight-car trains being permitted. The first unit, 4103, operated preview services on 23 December 2010: the 9:05am Hutt Valley service ex-Wellington and the return 10:00am service from Upper Hutt. After these services it returned to testing duties, including four-car running with 4132. It was intended for the units to be running in regular service on the Hutt Valley and Melling Lines from January 2011, followed by the Johnsonville Line by May 2011 and Kapiti Line from July 2011.Greater Wellington Regional Council in the Kapiti Observer of 8 March 2010 page 7Matangi News but this has been delayed. Regular revenue service commenced on 25 March 2011 with unit 4103 running on the Hutt Valley Line, initially running two off-peak return services to Upper Hutt and a Melling Line service each weekday However a combination of slower-than-expected testing, certification and driver-training programmes saw this timetable slip, prompting criticism from commuters. Overcrowding on existing services saw temporary measures introduced in April 2011, with morning peak Melling line trains replaced by buses to free up units for the Kapiti and Hutt Valley Lines, and the minimum fare removed on Wellington-bound Wairarapa Connection services to allow Hutt Valley Line passengers to use the train without penalty (the latter change became permanent in October 2011). Khandallah station on the Johnsonville Line. The Matangi units were the first new rolling stock to serve the Johnsonville line in 74 years. Other units were introduced to service as they arrived and completed testing and services checks and were cleared by the New Zealand Transport Agency. In June 2011, all seven units in service were temporarily withdrawn after problems was discovered in the auxiliary power units of two units. A faulty inductor coil in the APUs caused them to overheat, and the trains were fitted with extra cooling fans and settings for the APU power supply were altered so the trains could continue in service while replacement APUs were shipped out from Korea. Introduction to the Kapiti Line was achieved in August 2011 when sufficient units became available. Another significant milestone was achieved in November 2011 when the units took over about 50% of the weekday off-peak services on these lines from the Ganz-Mavag units. Services began on the Johnsonville Line on 19 March 2012, having been delayed by a combination of driver training needs, units being required on the other lines due to rolling stock shortages caused by reliability issues with some Ganz units, and the withdrawal of the EO/SE set from service ‚Äì ironically the older DM/D class units used on the Johnsonville line had fewer issues - and operational clearance not being granted by NZTA. While all units are capable of operating on this line, a small number will initially be dedicated to operating the majority of services. The lower-floor trailer unit has an area with folding seats for wheelchairs or prams, and for three bicycles during off-peak (and during peak if in the non-peak direction of travel). The entry to low floor area is marked by a lime green door, whereas all other doors are navy blue. In July 2012, a passenger with a bicycle was ordered off a peak- hour train at Petone, and after refusing to comply and holding up the train for 15 minutes, was subsequently removed by police.  Rail squeal  Not long after the units were introduced on the Johnsonville Line, residents along the line started complaining of the trains emitting a high-pitched squealing noise as they rounded some corners. Although squealing caused by wheel slip is not uncommon on rail systems worldwide, the gradient and curve radius on the Johnsonville Line exacerbated it. During the 2012-13 Christmas/New Year period, dispensers of friction modification fluid (oil) were fitted to the line to lubricate the rail and help reduce the noise. The fluid has produced mixed results, reducing the squeal in some places but making no difference on others, however has the unfortunate side-effect of reducing rail adhesion ‚Äì when combined with a wet rail, it has caused trains to overshoot platforms and to lose traction, resulting in cancellations or delays. Wheel dampers are also to be trialled on two units to help reduce the squeal. The 5000 series units, introduced from mid-2015, have sound dampeners in-built. A rubber ring is placed inside the wheel to reduce resonance as the wheel turns through a curve. Accidents During their time in service, there have been three accidents involving Matangi units. Two of the accidents involved trains overrunning Melling station. * On the morning of 15 April 2013, unit 4149 overran the station and hit the stop block. Several passengers on board suffered minor injuries, while the unit suffered minor frontal damage. The KiwiRail investigation determined that driver error was the cause. * On the morning of 27 May 2014, unit 4472 overran the station and took out the stop block and the overhead line pole behind it. Passengers reported the driver leaving the cab telling them the brakes had failed and they should brace for impact shortly before the crash. Two passengers were taken to hospital for minor injuries and shock. *On the morning of 4 July 2018, A Matangi train hit a person as they were trying to cross the tracks near Linden station in Tawa. Witnesses say the person had headphones in and did not hear the train coming. The person died at the scene.

Naming and classification The name Matangi, MƒÅori for wind,Matangi is one of several MƒÅori words for wind or breeze; the most prevalent other word is hau, as in Hauraki Gulf (north wind). came from a competition run by GWRC. Over 100 entries were received, including several Thomas the Tank Engine-inspired suggestions. It was nominated by Linden commuter Brian Bond, chosen for Wellington's windy reputation and the new trains being \\"as fast as the wind\\" and a \\"breath of fresh air to the transport system\\". The name was also chosen as it is easy to pronounce and spell, is distinctively Kiwi, and had support from local iwi (MƒÅori tribes). From their introduction until 2014, the units displayed \\"Matangi\\" on their destination signs when a destination was not selected; in 2014, this was changed to display \\"metlink.org.nz\\" (the GWRC's public transport website) instead. The class letters have been chosen as a continuation of the class letters assigned to the DM/D English Electric and EM/ET Ganz Mavag EMUs. FP stands for Matangi Power car (FM was not chosen to avoid confusion with NZR FM guards vans from the 1980s, some of which are preserved) and FT for Matangi Trailer car. The first batch of units are numbered in the 4000 series: FP 4103 to FP 4610 and FT 4103 to FT 4610, with each FP operating with their corresponding numbered FT. The second batch of units are numbered in the 5000 series. The numbering uses the TMS numbering pattern, in which the first three numbers are the train number and the last number is a check digit.

The Beh√∂rde f√ºr Wissenschaft und Forschung (State Ministry of Science and Research) has the oversight for universities and colleges. The UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning, one of the six educational institutes of UNESCO, is located in Hamburg. History Gesamtschule Eppendorf, a Hamburg comprehensive school Per student no other State of Germany spends more money on education than Hamburg. Yet at the Programme for International Student Assessment the students did very poorly and were outperformed by 14 other States of Germany. Only the State of Bremen did worse than Hamburg.\\"Schulreform: Hamburg f√§hrt ab 2009 zweigleisig\\". Focus. April 18th 2007 One in two Hamburg children comes from an immigrant family, and in 2007, 20,4 percent of all Hamburg children were on welfare. So Hamburg faces more challenges than many other States of Germany. In 2008-mid 2009, several types of secondary schools existed in Hamburg. The most common types were Hauptschulen, Realschulen, Gymnasien (prep schools) and Gesamtschulen (comprehensive schools). Kids graduated from primary schools after 4th grade and were allowed to apply for any of those schools. The choice which school to apply for was made by the parents. In October 2009, the Hamburg Parliament voted for an act to change this system with the start of the educational year 2010/11. The Grundschule--primary school of 4 years education from the age of 6 to 10--would be changed into a Prim√§rschule (lit. primary school), lasting 6 years. This would be followed by a so-called location or quarter school () with certificates, like the Abitur after 13 years of education. The Gymnasium will offer the Abitur after 12 years. Pupils could enter the Stadteilschule or the Gymnasium. Parents would no longer be allowed to choose if their child should apply for a Gymnasium. Only those children whose primary school teachers state that the child would make a successful transition into a Gymnasium would be allowed to apply. The act also states that no more than 25 pupils are allowed in classes of the primary school, 20 in so-called difficult quarters, and not more than 28 in a Gymnasium class. This decision was criticized by factions of the SPD and The Left. Many people were not pleased by this educational reform. Some were dismayed that the reform did not do away with Gymnasien they saw as a breeding ground of privilege. It has been noted that most of the children attending a Gymnasium came from upper-middle-class families and that Gymnasien often failed to enroll minority youngsters. A movement called Eine Schule f√ºr alle (One school for everyone) was formed.Eine Schule f√ºr alle The movement attempted to collect enough signatures to force a referendum, but fell short of the required number to do so. Many parents of those attending a Realschule were dismayed that this type of school was abolished. Another group of parents was dismayed that the decision of whether their kids should apply for a Gymnasium was no longer left to the parents. They also were concerned about the fact that Gymnasien would no longer be allowed to enroll students after fourth grade, but had to wait until they graduated from sixth grade. These would mean Gymnasien would get two fewer years to impart Latin and Ancient Greek. It was also feared that if Gymnasien would not be able to enroll students as young as ten years, it would become difficult for them to instill school spirit and love for learning in the students. It was also claimed that the academically most promising kids were denied an adequate education if they were not allowed to enroll in a Gymnasium after four years of schooling. A movement called Wir wollen lernen! (We want to learn!) was formed. It collected 184.500 signatures in November, three times the number needed to force a referendum.Wir wollen lernen An attempt by the city government of Hamburg to have all pupils attend the same school until 7th grade was, however, rejected http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5814250,00.html by 276,304 votes to 218,065 German television showed that the voter participation was higher in the wealthy neighbourhoods than in the poor ones. The opinion was put forward that the referendum to reject the school reforms was only successful because of this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjB8z0_-2dQ In fact, although the proposal in Hamburg was to have all children in a single school system two years longer in order to treat everyone equally for a longer time, German TV found a number of wealthy parents willing to make statements to TV camerashttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUiAu8Dozgc that they considered such equal treatment unfair: \\"you don't have to disadvantage the socially advantaged so that the disadvantaged benefit\\". In other words, putting everyone in the same school is considered unfair by many of the wealthy in Germany. General education Hansa-Gymnasium Hamburg in the Bergedorf borough built 1912 to 1914 by Fritz Schumacher. Besides regular German schools and kindergarten, an International School of Hamburg and a French school exist. Both offer an education in the respective language from kindergarten to secondary school. The International School Hamburg provides the International Baccalaureate, the French school the French baccalaur√©at and the AbiBac (French-German baccalaureate). In 2007, there were 1,039 day-care centers for children, 244 primary schools, and (in 2006) 195 secondary schools, with a total of 167,714 pupils.Residents registration office, source: Statistical Office Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein Statistisches Amt f√ºr Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein, official website As of 2009 several Hamburg schools were Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Hamburg), Christianeum Hamburg, Friedrich-Ebert-Gymnasium, Gymnasium Farmsen, and Helene-Lange-Gymnasium.

In 2002, he was named Composer-in- Residence to the New England Philharmonic. Operas On December 2, 1994, Vores presented his first opera, an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf play Freshwater, at Boston University. Vores first came across the Woolf text while browsing the shelves of the Boston University bookstore. Vores received assistance in the opera‚Äôs creation from Woolf's nephew and executor, Quentin Bell, who provided Vores with a rarely seen earlier version of the text that served as the inspiration for several passages of his libretto. On April 24, 2008, Vores presented his latest opera, a one-act chamber opera adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre‚Äôs No Exit, at the Boston Conservatory's Zack Box Theatre. Classical compositions Vores' classical compositions include Wonder Wheel, Umberhulk and Dark Mother. His first CD, Urban Affair, a classical work consisting of nine movements, was released on the Vera label in 2005.

In August 2008, Edwards admitted to an extramarital affair, which was initially reported in late-2007 by the National Enquirer but was given little attention outside the tabloid press and political blogosphere. The Enquirer cited claims from an anonymous source that Edwards had engaged in an affair with Rielle Hunter, a filmmaker hired to work for his presidential campaign, and that Hunter had given birth to a child from the relationship. ABC News reported that Andrew Young, a member of Edwards' campaign team, stated that Edwards asked him to \\"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.\\" The allegations were published in late-2007 and were initially denied by both Edwards and Hunter. Young claimed paternity of Hunter's daughter, although no father is listed on the child's birth certificate, and Young has subsequently denied it. In July 2008, several U.S. mainstream media news outlets cited the allegations in relation to Edwards' future political career, as well as in relation to his chances of being selected as a running mate in Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid. Then, on August 7, 2008, Edwards admitted to ABC News correspondent, Bob Woodruff, that he did have an extended affair with Hunter, but denied that he was the father of Hunter's baby girl. Hunter's sister claimed that Edwards was the father and publicly asked Edwards to take a paternity test to determine whether the child was his. On January 21, 2010, Edwards issued a statement admitting that he was the father of Hunter's child. After this admission, his wife Elizabeth announced a separation from her husband, with an intention to file for divorce. On January 25, 2010, the existence of an explicit sex tape, featuring Edwards and Hunter, was publicly reported. When Edwards first admitted to the affair, he stated that Elizabeth was in remission from breast cancer. However, it became clear that Edwards continued the affair even after he and his wife made a joint announcement that her cancer had returned and was found to be terminal. Elizabeth Edwards died of the disease at age 61 on December 7, 2010. Rielle Hunter and the Edwards campaign In December 2006, Newsweek reported that Hunter had been hired by the Edwards campaign to produce a series of webisodes that portrayed behind-the-scenes life on the campaign trail. Hunter had pitched the idea of creating the series to Edwards when she met him at a bar in New York, where the politician was attending a business meeting. The campaign paid Hunter's production company, Midline Groove, over USD$100,000 for the short documentaries that were uploaded to YouTube upon completion. In 2006, Business Week included one of the episodes as a feature in a web video. The first apparent mention, in print form, of a possible Edwards/Hunter affair, appeared in the New York Post on August 27, 2007. The page-six feature published a blind gossip item that asked: \\"Which political candidate enjoys visiting New York because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown? The poll tells her he'll marry her when his current wife is out of the picture.\\" The mention in the Post started a tabloid and blogosphere investigation that eventually led to accusations against Hunter and Edwards. In September 2007, Sam Stein, a political reporter for The Huffington Post, reported that the Hunter web documentaries had been removed from the internet and were no longer accessible. Representatives from the Edwards campaign stated that the material could not be used due to campaign finance law. Several days later, The Huffington Post reported that the videos had been reposted to YouTube by an anonymous user. Initial National Enquirer allegations On October 10, 2007, the National Enquirer published an article claiming that Edwards had engaged in an extramarital affair with an unnamed female campaign worker. On the same day, Stein published another article in The Huffington Post that contained additional details about Hunter, including Hunter's name and the web videos that she had produced. The following day, October 11, New York magazine published a piece linking Hunter to the Enquirer allegations. Initially, both Edwards and Hunter denied the relationship claims. Edwards said the National Enquirer story was \\"made up\\", further stating, \\"I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years,\\" referring to his wife Elizabeth, \\"and as anybody who's been around us knows, she's an extraordinary human being, warm, loving, beautiful, sexy and as good a person as I have ever known. So the story's just false.\\" Hunter's attorney issued a denial via Jerome Armstrong, a political blogger and founder of MyDD, stating, \\"The innuendos and lies that have appeared on the internet (sic) and in the National Enquirer concerning John Edwards are not true, completely unfounded and ridiculous.\\" David Perel, the Editor-in-Chief at the Enquirer, did not back down from the paper's allegations, stating, \\"The original story was 100% accurate.\\" The National Enquirer published a follow-up story that included a photograph of a visibly pregnant Hunter on December 19, 2007. The tabloid alleged that, according to its anonymous source, Hunter was claiming that Edwards was the father of her child. The article also claimed that Hunter had relocated to a gated community in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, near Andrew Young, a former official with the Edwards campaign, who had claimed paternity of Hunter's child. As with Hunter's initial denial of the affair, Young's paternity claim had been issued to Armstrong and published on MyDD. CBS News journalist, Bob Schieffer, asked about the allegations on Imus in the Morning, stating, \\"I believe that's a story that we will be avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one.\\" Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a \\"wait-and-see\\" attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses. Hotel encounter with reporters Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Edwards encountered the National Enquirer reporters According to Perel, the National Enquirer had received information stating that Edwards would be visiting Hunter and her child at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on the evening of July 21, 2008, and the paper dispatched several reporters to the hotel. The team of National Enquirer reporters encountered Edwards on the hotel premises sometime after 2 a.m. on the morning of July 22. According to Perel, Edwards, who was not a registered guest of the hotel, retreated from the reporters to a washroom, where he remained until being escorted from the premises by hotel security. The encounter between Edwards and the National Enquirer reporters was later confirmed by a hotel guard interviewed by Fox News. Edwards' spokespeople did not respond to Fox's request for comment on the incident. In articles published immediately after the hotel encounter, the National Enquirer claimed to be in possession of evidence showing that Edwards had visited Hunter and her child in the Hilton for several hours, including a videotape of Hunter entering the room, where she allegedly met Edwards, and one of Edwards leaving the same room. However, the paper declined a request from Fox News to release photos or videotape of the incident. In an interview with Radar, Perel said that the National Enquirer would release the photos when \\"the time is right.\\" The National Enquirer later stated that it had filed a \\"criminal complaint\\" against the hotel's security over its conduct during the encounter, but the Beverly Hills Police Department said that there was no criminal complaint and that only an \\"incident report\\" was under investigation. When Edwards was questioned at a New Orleans event on July 23, 2008, he stated, \\"I have no idea what you're asking about. I've responded, consistently, to these tabloid allegations by saying I don't respond to these lies and you know that ... and I stand by that.\\" On the same day, Hunter appeared on the television program, Extra, describing the National Enquirer story as \\"completely unfounded and ridiculous\\". Media coverage=Coverage of the allegations Aside from the Fox News story on July 25, mainstream news sources did not immediately report the story. Articles describing the National Enquirer allegations were eventually published by New York and Radar magazines. The claims were also mentioned in opinion columns and in-house blogs of several other papers. On July 23, Glenn Beck talked about the story on his program, Headline News, recommending that Edwards sue the National Enquirer if its story was proven false. On that same day, Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post, said, \\"We have no evidence this is true. Lots of juicy details‚Äîenough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not. That won't stop anyone from talking about it, but let's assume, until we know the facts, that this could be false.\\" On July 25, in response to a question as to whether The Washington Post was investigating the claims, political reporter, Jonathan Weisman, stated, \\"Yes, and to be quite honest, we're waiting to see the pictures the National Enquirer says it will publish this weekend. That said, Edwards is no longer an elected official and is not running for any office now. Don't expect wall-to-wall coverage.\\" Meanwhile, on that same day, Kaus, at Slate, published an e-mail sent to him the day before from Tony Pierce, an editor at the Los Angeles Times. It was sent to the Los Angeles Times' in-house bloggers, and, referring to the Edwards allegations, stated, \\"I am asking you all not to blog about this topic until further notified.\\" Kaus portrayed the email as a \\"gag\\" order. In an online interview, Pierce defended the e-mail, stating that it was the result of a decision by senior editors at the Times to allow time for the newspaper's Metro Desk to investigate the allegations. Pierce also pointed out that a Los Angeles Times blogger had already posted a story on the National Enquirer claims. On August 8, 2008, in response to a high number of e-mails to the Los Angeles Times, National Editor, Scott Kraft, stated that \\"this strikes us as a legitimate story\\". The newspaper's bloggers subsequently posted a story on the topic. Over the period of July 27-28, the claims and speculation about the possible impact on Edwards' political career, from the incident thus far, were picked up by several papers outside the U.S., including the London Times, The Independent, Der Spiegel, Irish Independent, and The Times of India. In the American political blogosphere, the story was covered by The Drudge Report, Jack Shafer, Kaus at Slate, Alex Coppelman at Salon.com, Rachel Sklar Lee Stranahan; (Stranahan also cross-posted his article to Daily Kos) at The Huffington Post, independent political pundit, James Joyner, Rod Dreher at The Dallas Morning News, Paul Mulshine at The Star-Ledger, and Guy Adams at The Independent. Some of the coverage alleged mainstream media bias due to Edwards' Democratic affiliation. Others voiced contempt for tabloid papers like the National Enquirer and compared the coverage to that of a scandal involving Republican Senator Larry Craig. Others claimed that the National Enquirer was reliable in regard to scandal reporting, noting the reporting on the Gary Hart/Donna Rice affair, the O. J. Simpson murder case, Jesse Jackson's out-of-wedlock child, and Rush Limbaugh's prescription drug addiction. Non-coverage was also discussed. Some stated that the non-coverage was motivated by sympathy for Elizabeth Edwards. Several prominent sites criticized the omission of information about the allegations, most notably Gawker.com and Roger L. Simon of Pajamas Media, whose posts were linked by Glenn Reynolds at the high-traffic weblog, Instapundit. For instance, as of August 6, cable television news network, CNN, had not mentioned the story, and MSNBC had mentioned it once. Several pundits stated that Edwards was \\"fair game\\" for reporting on the allegations because he had been recently identified as a potential candidate for vice president or attorney general for Obama, and that Edwards himself had made his marital fidelity an issue in his campaign. Blogosphere claims of a media \\"blackout\\" extended to Wikipedia, and its biographical article on Edwards. The Wikipedia biography was later changed to include a mention of the allegations' potential impact on Edwards' political career. The controversy over the Wikipedia page was covered by Wired magazine and Kansas City Star columnist Aaron Barnhart, who opined the addition of the information to the Wikipedia article influenced later media coverage of the allegations. On July 31, 2008, a late-night talk program played part of a David Letterman \\"Top 10\\" list that alluded to the charges. On the same night, The O'Reilly Factor played a clip of a Jay Leno monologue from the Tonight Show that mentioned it. Altogether, Fox News had run stories or discussed the matter six times by August 6, more than any other cable news organization. Edwards admits the affair On August 8, 2008, in a statement that coincided with the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games, Edwards admitted to the affair but denied he was the father of the child, expressing his willingness to take a paternity test. His statement included: > In 2006, I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way > that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my > mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I > asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail > with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a > version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many > falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough ... On the same day, Elizabeth Edwards released a statement that first appeared on the liberal blog, The Daily Kos. The statement said that, in 2006, \\"John had made a terrible mistake,\\" though she went on to praise her husband for \\"courage in the face of shame.\\" She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later that night on the ABC News late-night program, Nightline, in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. She did, in her statement, criticize the claims that her husband fathered a child as an \\"absurd lie in a tabloid publication.\\" Elizabeth Edwards' seemingly willing participation in the efforts to cover up the affair have also been called into question. \\"I think she's complicit,\\" said Brad Crone, a Raleigh- based Democratic consultant. \\"Obviously, she knew. While she's the victim, she clearly didn't stand in the way of the cover-up.\\" On August 12, 2008, a friend of Hunter's, Pigeon O'Brien, informed CBS News that Edwards had lied about the timeline of the affair. She claimed the affair began in February 2006, six months earlier than the time Edwards had hired Hunter to start working on his political action committee and when he had claimed that the affair had begun. O'Brien also stated that the affair was not a brief liaison, but a mutual, committed relationship based on love; or so Edwards had led Hunter to believe. On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, participated in an interview with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, in the days after the story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, \\"CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told Early Show co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for. \\"If you raise money to run for (office)\\", Sherman explained, \\"and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate, and you give it to a girlfriend of a God-knows-what ... that's a crime. The New York Daily News also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, \\"said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking.\\" Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the Star- Ledger at her home. According to reporter, John Mooney, \\"Mary 'Mimi' Hockman [told reporters], 'Don't waste your time. ... I'm contractually prohibited from talking to you. On August 18, 2008, David Carr, news media columnist for The New York Times, wrote that while the Enquirer can be inaccurate, its revelations about the Edwards affair were a service to the public: > \\"There are some stories, especially ones that occur in the bedroom, where > mainstream media outlets sometimes can't venture‚Äîor at least they can't find > it in themselves to lead the charge. But it would be hard to argue that the > body politic is not enriched by the recent revelations that Mr. Edwards is > not who we thought he was, even balanced against the many stories the > Enquirer gets wrong.\\" (Even in his confession, Mr. Edwards wrinkled his nose > and suggested that the allegations had originated with \\"supermarket > tabloids\\", as if the method of conveyance absolved him of the deeds > described.) Birth certificate On August 1, 2008, the Enquirer published an article naming Hunter's child and mainstream news organizations subsequently obtained a copy of the birth certificate, confirming that a girl had been born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital on February 27, 2008. The birth certificate listed the mother's name as \\"Rielle Jaya James Druck,\\" while the child was given the surname \\"Hunter\\"; no father's name was listed. Media reports linked the Druck and Hunter surnames on the birth certificate to conclude that the mother was Rielle Hunter; the reports also noted that the child was born approximately two months after Young's claimed paternity had been announced by Hunter and Young. When questioned about the omission of the father's name from the birth certificate, Hunter's attorney stated, \\"A lot of women do that\\", and that the issue was \\"a personal matter\\" between Hunter and Young, before declining to comment further. In late-July and early-August 2008, news outlets reported that Edwards was avoiding further questions from reporters about the Enquirer claims. WCNC-TV, a North Carolina television station, reported that Edwards' political career was \\"effectively frozen\\", pending resolution of the allegations. Payments to Hunter and Young In August 2008, Fred Baron, Edwards' campaign finance chairman, told NBC News that he had been providing financial assistance to both Hunter and Young without Edwards' knowledge; he further stated that no campaign funds had been used. Reportedly, Young had also successfully solicited funds from Rachel Lambert Mellon, also known as \\"Bunny\\" Mellon, a 99-year-old heiress to the Mellon fortune. Baron passed away two months later. Reactions In August 2008, senior figures in the Democratic Party warned that Edwards' failure to respond to the allegations could affect his role at the 2008 Democratic convention. According to Don Fowler, former Democratic National Committee chair, \\"If there is not an explanation that's satisfactory, acceptable and meets high moral standards, the answer is 'no,' [Edwards] would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention.\\" Gary Pearce, who ran Edwards' 1998 Senate race, said, \\"It's a very damaging thing. ... If it's not true, [Edwards] has got to stand up and say, 'This is not true. That is not my child and I'm going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies.' It's not enough to say, 'That's tabloid trash. Edwards' admission that he engaged in an affair came less than a day after these warnings were published. Former congressman David Bonior, Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign manager, stated: \\"Thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him, and he's let them down. They've been betrayed by his action.\\" When asked about Edwards' future in public service, Bonior further stated, \\"You can't lie in politics and expect to have people's confidence.\\" Alleged campaign staffers \\"doomsday\\" plan In May 2009, ABC News political correspondent George Stephanopoulos reported that campaign staff members became cognizant of the affair in early-2008. Staff members said that if it appeared Edwards was on his way to winning the Democratic Party nomination, they intended to sabotage it for the benefit of the party. Edwards' senior adviser, Joe Trippi, said this report was \\"complete bullshit\\". He added, \\"No one that I know had such a plan. I wasn't involved in a plan like that, it didn't exist, it's a fantasy.\\" However, in August 2006, several staffers‚Äîincluding Josh Brumberger, Kim Rubey, and David Ginsberg‚Äîhad strong suspicions about the affair and left the campaign over concerns about Hunter. Rubey and Ginsberg later discussed their obligation to the party to come forward with what they knew, after finding Young's paternity claim unconvincing. Subsequent events A federal grand jury investigated whether any of Edwards' campaign funds were misspent on covering up the affair and, on August 6, 2009, Hunter testified before a federal grand jury in Raleigh, North Carolina. On January 21, 2010, John Edwards admitted that he was, indeed, Quinn's father. In late January 2010, John and Elizabeth separated. In February 2010, The National Enquirer reported that Edwards had proposed to Hunter, but that report was categorically denied by an Edwards spokesperson. Although Young had previously stated he was the father, he recanted in a book proposal. Rielle Hunter also released a book about the relationship and announced her breakup with Edwards on the day of the book's release in 2012. Legal proceedings On June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted by a North Carolina grand jury on six felony charges. He faced a maximum sentence of thirty years in prison and a $1.5 million fine, or a USD250,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment per charge. The indictment came after the failure of intensive negotiations for a plea bargain agreement. The agreement would have meant that Edwards would have been required to plead guilty to three misdemeanor campaign finance law violations, in addition to a six-month prison sentence, but would have allowed Edwards to keep his law license. After delays, due to John Edwards' medical condition, jury selection for the trial began on April 12, 2012. Opening arguments began on April 23, 2012. A verdict (not guilty on one count and a mistrial on the remaining five) to the trial was reached on May 31, 2012. The trial was criticized by Republicans, such as Michael Steele and Joe Scarborough, who referred to the procedure as \\"an absolute waste of resources.\\" References Category:2000s in mass media Category:2006 beginnings Category:2008 in American politics Category:2008 scandals Category:2010 endings Category:2000s controversies in the United States Category:August 2008 events in the United States Category:Cover-ups Category:Democratic Party (United States) Category:Extramarital relationships Extramarital affair Category:Mass media-related controversies in the United States Category:National Enquirer Category:Political sex scandals in the United States ","title":"John Edwards extramarital affair"},{"id":"18730853","text":"{ class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0em 1em;\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" + P√°ll √° Reynat√∫gvu style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\" - !

He is most often recognized for his accomplishments for the Dutch national team at the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Baseball career=B.C. Premier Baseball League Boyd was a starting pitcher for the White Rock Tritons of the British Columbia Premier Baseball League for three seasons. College career Boyd began his college baseball career playing for the Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, Oregon during the season. He played only one season for the Chukars before transferring to Seminole State Community College in Oklahoma for the season. He would transfer again in , this time to play for the Armstrong Atlantic State University Pirates. He played two seasons for the Pirates in 2004 and where he was used exclusively as a relief pitcher. Over these two seasons, he appeared in 34 games and compiled a 3.44 ERA with 104 strikeouts in 115 innings pitched. 2006: Hoboken Pioneers Despite his Dutch family ties and a strong desire to play baseball in the Netherlands, Boyd was not pursued by any Hoofdklasse clubs, even after numerous attempts to contact them after his college career was over.BR Bullpen: Leon Boyd, baseball-reference.com, ret: Aug 5, 2008 Instead, he went on to play for the Hoboken Pioneers in Belgium where he had an extremely successful season. Not only did he accumulate an 11‚Äì1 win-loss record with a 0.84 ERA and 156 strikeouts in just 96 innings pitched, but he also hit .421 with 2 home runs in 38 at bats for the Pioneers, who finished the season as the national runner up. Following his strong season in Belgium, Boyd was picked up by the Dutch national team to play in the 2006 Intercontinental Cup in Taichung, Taiwan. Despite his 0‚Äì2 record, Boyd had a 2.63 ERA and led the Nethalnds in innings pitched. Against Cuba, he took the loss in a 3‚Äì2 defeat where he allowed four hits and one run in IP of relief after replacing Rob Cordemans. Three days later, he allowed just one run in six innings against Japan but again lost as the Dutch were shut out. His final appearance of the tournament came against Australia, where he struck out 7 and allowed one run in six innings in a no-decision as the Netherlands won 4‚Äì3. 2007: DOOR Neptunus After being scouted by and in contract talks with several hoofdklasse teams, Boyd signed with Neptunus. He made a debut during the 2007 regular season when he posted a 9‚Äì0 record with no home runs allowed in over 66 innings. His statistical totals in wins (9, tied with tied Vaughan Harris and Diego Markwell for second-most), ERA (1.22, behind only relievers Duko Jansen and Chris Ryan) and strikeouts (61, tied with former major leaguer Eddie Oropesa for sixth overall) were among the league leaders. He was a finalist for the Pitcher of the Year Award, but lost to David Bergman in part due to missing a month of the season with a back muscle strain. Despite his initial success, Boyd suffered two losses during the first round of the playoffs as Neptunus was upset by the Pioniers. In the 2007 World Port Tournament, Boyd earned the World Port Tournament Best Pitcher award, allowing only five hits in 15 IP and won twice, including a complete-game shutout of the Chinese Taipei National team facing only 28 batters. He was 2‚Äì0 with a 0.93 ERA in the 2007 European Baseball Championship, helping the Netherlands win Gold. He was with the team for the 2007 Baseball World Cup, going 1‚Äì1 with a 2.55 ERA and a team-high 14 strikeouts for the 4th-place squad. He had a solid game but received a no-decision against the Australian national team when closer Michiel van Kampen couldn't hold a 3‚Äì2 lead in the ninth. He had another appearance allowing one run in six innings in a crucial win over the South Korean national team and matched Tadashi Settsu (the eventual pitcher of the tournament) with five scoreless frames in the Bronze Medal game before allowing 2 runs in the 6th, and being shut out 5‚Äì0 by the Japanese. 2008: Beijing Olympics On June 12, 2008, Boyd threw a no-hitter against the Amsterdam Pirates. He allowed two runs, one unearned, thanks to 3 walks, 2 hit batsmen and 3 errors by his team. Shortly thereafter, Boyd had a 4.50 ERA in the 2008 European Baseball Cup in Regensburg. He was knocked out early in a win against the host Buchbinder Legion√§re and did not get a decision in the Cup. Head coach Robert Eenhoorn selected Boyd to pitch for the Netherlands at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.Dutch Olympic Baseball squad 2008 , knbsb.nl, ret: Aug 5, 2008 In their second game of the tournament against the United States, Boyd entered the game during the 8th inning with the bases loaded and one out after Dave Draijer was struck by a batted ball on the right forearm. He induced two groundouts, resulting in only a single run for the United States. He returned to pitch the top of the 9th inning, and after yielding a leadoff single to Terry Tiffee, Boyd retired the next three batters, including Matt LaPorta by strikeout. However, a two-hour rain delay forced the game to be called during the Dutch half of the 9th inning. As a result Boyd's statistics during the 9th inning are unofficial, as the score reverted to the last completed inning. Boyd made his second appearance of the tournament on August 16, 2008 when he was the starting pitcher against China. He struck out six batters in six innings, yielding only six hits and two runs in the process. The win was the only victory the Dutch earned all tournament. 2009World Baseball Classic= Boyd was selected once again to represent the Dutch national team at the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Although he has primarily been a starter throughout his career, Boyd was asked by head coach Rod Delmonico to serve as the closer for the Netherlands. During the first round of the tournament held at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Boyd entered three separate games during tense, late-inning pressure situations, including two of which he ended up as the pitcher of record. In the Netherlands' first game of the tournament on March 7, 2009 against the heavily favored Dominican Republic, Boyd pitched the 9th inning and earned the save with a game-ending strikeout of Jos√© Bautista. Two days later, he entered a game against Puerto Rico with the bases loaded and only one out in the 8th inning, only to give up a two-run double to Yadier Molina and an RBI-single to Jesus Feliciano. The very next day, Boyd rebounded to earn the win in a 2‚Äì1 extra-innings Dutch victory that eliminated the Dominicans from the tournament. Although the Dutch advanced to play in Round 2 of the tournament at Dolphin Stadium in Miami, Florida, Boyd would not make his fourth appearance of the tournament until the 6th inning of an elimination game against the United States. Despite giving up a home run to Adam Dunn, Boyd struck out both David Wright and Ryan Braun in his one inning of relief. =New Hampshire Fisher Cats= Following his strong pitching performance in the tournament, Boyd was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays to a minor-league contract.Jeff Blair of the Toronto Globe and Mail, ret: March 18, 2009 Although he was temporarily reassigned to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League for an 8-game appearance early in the year, Boyd played the bulk of the 2009 season as a member of the Jays AA-affiliate, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. He finished the year with a 1‚Äì6 win-loss record, a 4.76 ERA, 51 strikeouts and 6 saves in over 64 innings for the two clubs. 2010 The Blue Jays released Boyd in March 2010https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Leon_Boyd and subsequently re-signed with Neptunus. According to Boyd, his release was affected by his high walk count and the Jays' trading of Roy Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies in December 2009.http://canadutch.blogspot.com/2010/05/release-story-baseball- update.html#links With the release of Roy Halladay the Blue Jays brought in many potential bottom rotation, triple A caliber potential big league replacements. 2013 He joined the Dutch National team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Personal life Growing up, Boyd attended high school at Earl Marriott Secondary School in South Surrey, British Columbia. Although he was born in Canada, Leon received his Dutch passport in December, 2005, as a result of his mother being born and raised in the Netherlands. Boyd's father, Sean, played ice hockey in the Netherlands from 1971 to 1974 and met Leon's mother, Wilma, there. Boyd married American softball player Jeana Short on March 8, 2008. He has an older sister, Nadine.

Having been ordained priest, he left the college 10 June 1748, for England, where he served the mission at Arundel (1748‚Äì55), Rounday, in Yorkshire, the Isle of Man, and finally Newcastle upon Tyne (1765‚Äì91). In 1778 the presidency of the English college at Saint-Omer was offered to him, but he would not accept it. He was a scholarly, book-loving man, of some note as a preacher. In politics he remained a staunch Jacobite. Works He published many translations and one original pamphlet, \\"A Letter to the Author of a Book called 'A Candid and Impartial Sketch of the Life and Government of Pope Clement XIV'\\" (1785). The translations include *\\"The Divine Office for the Use of the Laity\\" (4 vols., Sheffield, 1763; 2d ed., 2 vols., Newcastle, 1780); *Bergier's \\"Deism Self-refuted\\" (1775); *Caraccioli's \\"Life of Pope Clement XIV\\" (1776); Letters of Pope Clement XIV (2 vols., 1777); *Fronsletin's \\"Travels of Reason\\" (1781); *Fleury's \\"Manners of the Christians\\" (1786) and \\"Manners of the Israelites\\" (1786); *\\"Larger Historical Catechism\\" (1786); and *\\"Short Historical Catechism\\" (1786).

See reference to a newer 2011 version in the history section. Note that as at June 2012 this is still a draft proposal, not an international treaty in force.) It is proposed that a UDAW be adopted by the United Nations. If endorsed by the UN (as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was) the UDAW would be a non- binding set of principles that acknowledges the importance of the sentience of animals and human responsibilities towards them. The principles were designed to encourage and enable national governments to introduce and improve animal protection legislation and initiatives. It has been argued that a UDAW is consistent with, and could help secure the achievement of, the UN Millennium Development Goals.See No.6 of Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare ‚Äì Questions and AnswersArticle by Sir David Madden on Re-public website, accessed 5 August 2008 and the subsequent Sustainable Development Goals. The declaration as of October 2014 had the support, in principle, of 46 countries and of ministries from 17 further countries. More than 2.5 million people from a wide variety of UN member states have supported the public campaign. Some have argued that the agreement does not go far enough and should guarantee animal rights instead of simply animal welfare. This should not be confused with the Declaration of Animal Rights (2011) or the Universal Charter of the Rights of Other Species (2000).

It also invited the member states and the Commission, within their respective competencies, ‚Äúto support, in principle, the UDAW initiative in the relevant international fora‚Äù.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/NewsWord/en/agricult/106877.doc There have been several drafts of the declaration, with the most recent proposed in 2014. This draft takes into account feedback from UN member states, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. It develops the earlier draft arising from the Manila conference on animal welfare (2003) and the Costa Rica draft (2005) which incorporated suggestions made by the Steering Committee. Historical background The lack of success in shaping internationally binding charters on animal rights has not been for want of trying. People in modern times have attempted to identify and advance the rights of animals at least since the 18th century. Credit usually goes to Henry Stephens Salt (1851‚Äì1939) for writing the first book on animal rights, published in 1892 and subsequently. And Salt traces efforts back to John Lawrence (1753‚Äì1839), one of the earliest modern writers on animal rights and welfare. Lawrence argued in his 1796 book, A Philosophical and Practical Treatise on Horses and the Moral Duties of Man Towards Brute Creation (T N Longman: London), that we have to care for animals and common law should support this principle in practice The 20th century saw a number of international declarations supporting animal rights. Perhaps the most prominent venture was the announcement (The Times, 17 October) in 1978 at the United Nation‚Äôs Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris of the Universal Declaration of Animal Rights. Among the Declaration's pronouncements were that all animals have the same rights to existence, no animal shall be ill-treated or subject to cruelty, animals shall command the protection of law, and dead animals shall be treated with respect. The Declaration, however, waned and faded away before it could reach significant levels of international agreement. More recently some of the world's leading animal welfare organisations have started campaigning for the United Nations to adopt a new declaration. This time the declaration is on the welfare of animals: the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare. Why welfare and not rights? Probably because welfare is a softer option than rights and therefore easier for people to accept. Thus it has a better chance of endorsement and of enduring. The animal organisations behind this new declaration envisage that signatory countries to the document will recognise animals as sentient beings. They hope their declaration will make animal welfare an important global issue, pioneer the way for legally binding international agreements on animal welfare and hasten a better deal for animals worldwide. Their declaration would also underscore the importance of animal welfare as part of the moral development of humanity. So far a number of United Nations member states are acting as a steering group to advance the initiative at the UN. See Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, below, for a draft copy.  Overview of the proposed declaration  A draft text of the declaration, most recently updated by the OIE in 2014 provides a basis for states and peoples to work to improve their national animal welfare legislation, introduce animal welfare legislation in countries where it does not currently exist, encourage those businesses which use animals to keep welfare at the forefront of their policies, link humanitarian, development and animal welfare agendas nationally and internationally, inspire positive change in public attitudes towards animal welfare. The declaration calls for: *Recognition that animals are living, sentient beings and therefore deserve due consideration and respect *Recognition that animal welfare includes animal health and encompasses both the physical and psychological state of the animal and that good practices in animal welfare can have major benefits for humans and the environment *Recognition that humans inhabit this planet with other species and other forms of life and that all forms of life co-exist within an interdependent ecosystem *Recognition of the importance of the ongoing work of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in setting global standards for animal welfare and that member states should adopt all necessary measures to give effect to the principles of UDAW, including the implementation of these standards *Acknowledgment that many states already have a system of legal protection for animals, both domestic and wild and that the continued effectiveness of these systems must be ensured, with the development of better and more comprehensive animal welfare provisions *Awareness that the Five Freedoms (freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; freedom from fear and distress; freedom from physical and thermal discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; and freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour)The Five Freedoms as defined on the Farm Animal Welfare Council website, accessed 5 August 2008 and the Three Rs (reduction in numbers of animals, refinement of experimental methods and replacement of animals with non-animal techniques)For definition, see 7.1 of Chapter 7: The Three R's: Alternatives to animal experiments by the Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures, accessed 5 August 2008 provide valuable guidance for the use of animals *Recognition that the provisions contained in this declaration do not affect the rights of any state The principles of the declaration are: #The welfare of animals shall be a common objective for all states and all appropriate steps shall be taken by member states to prevent cruelty to animals and to reduce their suffering. #The policies, legislation and standards of animal welfare attained by each state shall be promoted, recognized and observed by improved measures, nationally and internationally. Each member state should care for and treat animals in a humane and sustainable manner in accordance with the principles of the Declaration. #All appropriate steps shall be taken by states to prevent cruelty to animals and to reduce their suffering. #Appropriate policies, legislation and standards on the welfare of animals will be further developed and elaborated, such as those governing the use and management of farm animals, companion animals, animals in scientific research, draught animals, wildlife animals, and animals in recreation.  Public campaign  The public campaign to gain support for a UDAW, branded ‚ÄòAnimals Matter‚Äô, was launched in June 2006. It reached one million signatures in December 2007 with the President of Costa Rica, Sr. Oscar Arias, becoming the official one millionth signatory and hosting celebrations in San Jos√©, Costa Rica in March 2008. As of 2014, the petition had over 2.5 million signatures and support from people in a variety of UN member states.

PLS works to ensure that publishers are fairly compensated for any copying of their works through the collective licensing scheme, among other rights management services, which have become an increasing important secondary revenue stream for publishers. Its primary goal is to oversee collective licensing in the UK for book, journal, magazine and website copying. The society was established in 1981. Together with the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society, PLS own and direct the Copyright Licensing Agency. They also work in partnership with NLA media access. PLS distributed over ¬£34m to publishers from collective licensing in 2017‚Äì18, and they work to encourage innovation and good practice in rights management, whether that is in print or online. Services PLS also provide a range of rights management services and initiatives.  What is Collective Licensing?  Collective Licensing offers a simple and cost effective solution both for those who wish to copy from published materials without breaking the law, and for rights holders where direct licensing would be inefficient and unduly burdensome. A blanket license allows users to copy from a broad range of repertoire in return for a license fee. The license fee is paid to the rights holders whose publications have been shown to have been copied.  Governance and authority  PLS is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. It is owned and controlled by the four trade associations representing publishers' interests: the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP); the Independent Publishers Guild (IPG); the Professional Publishers Association (PPA); the Publishers' Association (PA). Up to three directors are nominated by each of the trade association members of PLS (the Association of Learned and Professional Publishers, the Professional Publishers Association, the Independent Publishers Guild and the Publishers Association) and are approved by the Board. The Chairman is appointed by the Board and is independent of the members. The Chief Executive is appointed by the Board.  History and collective licensing  This version of events has been adapted from a document written circa 1999 by John Davis, then of the Publishers Association. With the introduction of the dry photocopier in the early 1970s, the situation on control of copyright in the UK‚Äôs main institutions ran out of control. Machines appeared everywhere and infringements proliferated. A committee was formed, chaired by Mr Justice Whitford, on Copyright and Design Law and asked to investigate the situation. It reported early in 1977 and recommended collective copyright licensing as the solution. It also recommended the abolition of the fair dealing and library privilege exceptions. This was desired by publishers but never achieved. Political pressure from information- users was always too great. Later that year, the Publishers' Association (PA) convened a Committee chaired by Lord Wolfenden, formerly Vice Chancellor of Reading University and Director of the British Museum, to look at the implementation of the Whitford proposals on licensing. Represented on the Committee where the PA, the PPA, ALPSP, the Music Publishers Association, the Society of Authors, the Writers Guild and the Composer Guild. The newspaper associations were invited to join but declined to participate. Publishers were initially unresponsive to the concept of collective licensing, particularly on a blanket basis. And at an early stage, the Music Publishers Association and the Composers Guild withdrew from the Wolfenden Committee. They conducted two successful and much publicised actions against infringement by photocopying at a public school. This encouraged them to think that the best solution was to issue a Code of Practice backed by legal action rather than licensing. Printed music was excluded from the collective licence. To this day music publishers have never returned. The Wolfenden Committee made licensing of schools its first objective. The Scottish local authorities always recognised the necessity of licensing. In England and Wales, however, long arguments persisted that all their multiple copying was legal because it did not represent substantial parts of works. The only course of action was to resort to law. A case came to hand over the copying of technical drawings in Manchester local authority. The local authorities backed down and agreed to negotiate a licence. So did the universities, where solicitors‚Äô letters had been issued over similar infringements. Lord Wolfenden bowed out of the scene and leading copyright lawyer Denis de Freitas was asked to work on the structure of the licensing agency. Publishers wanted there to be an agency, but authors insisted a forceful language from the President, Lord Willis, that all their payments must go through ALCS. It was therefore necessary to form the Publishers Licensing Society, established in 1981, to manage publishers‚Äô rights and pay publishers accordingly. Setting up a licensing structure on the publishing side had been met by loans from the PA and PPA. When the Copyright Licensing Agency was formed, PLS passed all administration of collective licensing to the new body. Colin Hadley was appointed as the Manager of CLA. PLS was deliberately run as a low key operation in contrast to ALCS. Eventually the profile of PLS was raised by expanding the management team. The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 was a landmark and demonstrated the wisdom of having put the societies and licensing agency in place. The whole principle of licensing was endorsed and written into legislation via Chapter VII of the 1988 Act. In April 2008 collective licensing completed a full circle with the launch of the first licenses in UK to cover the copying, or re-use, of digital material ‚Äì the first of their kind to be developed in Europe. Despite some operational tensions over rights and licensing proposals between PLS and CLA over the years, the creation of the two organisations has been a great success and now raises many millions of pounds each year for publishers. Important to the success of PLS have been the avoidance by the principles (ALPSP, PA, & PPA) of any attempt to undermine each other's position and their willingness to consult with publishers to ensure that the various proposals were acceptable. In September 2015, The Independent Publishers Guild (IPG) was accepted membership of the Publishers Licensing Society (PLS) ‚Äî the first new member to join the society in more than three decades. The IPG is the first new member of PLS since it was established in 1981, and joins existing trade association members the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP); the Publishers Association (PA); and the Professional Publishers Association (PPA).

Bernard Lafayette (or LaFayette), Jr. (born July 29, 1940) is a longtime civil rights activist and organizer, who was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement. He played a leading role in early organizing of the Selma Voting Rights Movement; was a member of the Nashville Student Movement; and worked closely throughout the 1960s movements with groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the American Friends Service Committee. Early life Lafayette was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. His parents were Bernard Lafayette, Sr., and Verdell Lafayette. Bernard was the eldest of eight children. His siblings were Harold Rozelia, Brenda, Geri, Michael, and Victoria. Lafayette spent much of his childhood in Tampa. His family grew up poor, so Bernard started working odd jobs to gain more income by the age of 11. His jobs included cashiering, meat cutting, delivering produce, and collecting change at a coffee shop. When reminiscing on his childhood, Bernard says \\"I had to grow up rapidly. In other words, I didn't have a childhood.\\" Despite being black in the south, Bernard says he went to school in an integrated Elementary School, and eventually began to go to schools that were still segregated. While he was at the integrated school he says that \\"even though it wasn't segregated, i could still see the contrast between the two worlds.\\" Bernard has clear recollections of some of the racism that he experienced at a young age. When Bernard was seven years old, he was heading downtown with his grandmother, Ma Foster, so they decided to catch a cable car. One of the segregation laws regarding cable cars was that black people would pay at the front door, and then enter through the back door. When His grandmother paid the cable car driver, the driver started driving before either of them could board, pocketing their money and leaving them stranded. He says this is one of the first instances where he realized he wanted to do something about how his people were being treated. Early adult life and career  Bernard was married to Kate Bulls Lafayette in 1969. He had two children with his previous wife Colia Liddell Lafayette, Bernard Lafayette, III and James Lafayette, Sr. According to his children, Bernard was a loving father, who never yelled at, was stern with, or even expressed anger towards his wife or his kids. The family had a very tight-knit relationship, and spent tons of time together. James became an ordained preacher (influenced by his father, who was a religious man), and Lafayette III attended American Baptist College. As a young man at the age of twenty, Lafayette moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and enrolled in the American Baptist Theological Seminary. During the course of his freshman year, he took classes in nonviolence at the Highlander Folk School run by Myles Horton, and attended many meetings promoting nonviolence. He learned more about the philosophy of nonviolence as lived by Mohandas Gandhi, while taking seminars from activist James Lawson, a well-known nonviolent representative of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Lafayette began to use the nonviolent techniques as he became more exposed to the strong racial injustice of the South. In 1959, he, along with his friends Diane Nash, James Bevel, and John Lewis, all members of the Nashville Student Movement, led sit-ins, such as the 1960 Lunch Counter Sit-In, at restaurants and businesses that practiced segregation. As an advocate of nonviolence, in 1960 Lafayette assisted in the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Freedom Rides In 1961, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) initiated a movement to enforce federal integration laws on interstate bus routes. This movement, known as the Freedom Rides, had African American and white volunteers ride together on bus routes through the segregated South. Lafayette wanted to participate, but his parents forbade him. After the Freedom Riders were violently attacked in the city of Anniston, Alabama, the Nashville Student Movement, of which Lafayette was a member, vowed to take over the journey. At the time, some civil rights leaders worried that the Freedom Rides were too provocative and would damage the movement. Despite many doubts, these Nashville students were determined to finish the job. In May 1961, in the city of Montgomery, Alabama, Lafayette and the other riders were \\"greeted\\" at the bus terminal by an angry white mob, members of Ku Klux Klan chapters, and were viciously attacked. The Freedom Riders were brutally beaten. Their attackers carried every makeshift weapon imaginable: baseball bats, wooden boards, bricks, chains, tire irons, pipes, and even garden tools. During the Montgomery attack, Lafayette stood firm; his fellow riders William Barbee and John Lewis were beaten until they fell unconscious. Lafayette, Fred Leonard and Allen Cason narrowly escaped being killed by jumping over a wall and running to the post office. Everyone inside was carrying on individual business, just like nothing was happening outside. Lafayette later stated, \\" I thought they were shooting Freedom Riders.\\" It was the gunshot of Alabama's Director of Public Safety, Floyd Mann, who was fighting for the protection of the Freedom Riders. Lafayette with other Riders was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, and jailed at Parchman State Prison Farm during June 1961. During Lafayette's participation in civil rights activities, he was beaten and arrested 27 times. Selma In the summer of 1962, Lafayette accepted a position with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to do organizing work in Selma, Alabama alongside his then wife Colia Liddell Lafayette.\\"Colia Liddell Lafayette Clark\\" Civil Rights Movement Veterans website Upon arriving in the city in February 1963, he began leading meetings at which he spoke about the condition of African Americans in the South and encouraged local African Americans to share their experiences. He met the representatives of the Dallas County Voters League who impressed him. On the night of June 12, 1963, (the same night that Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi), Lafayette was severely beaten by a white assailant. While badly injured, he was not deterred from continuing his work. In late 1964, the board of Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) decided to join the ongoing Alabama Project organized by James Bevel, Diane Nash, and James Orange, and chose Selma as the focal point to gain voting rights for African Americans. In early 1965, Lafayette, Bevel, Martin Luther King Jr., Orange, Nash and others organized a series of public demonstrations that finally, with the march from Selma-to-Montgomery initiated by Bevel, put enough pressure on the federal government to take action and gave enough support to President Lyndon Johnson for Johnson to demand the drafting and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Life after Selma Lafayette went on to work on the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement (he had worked in Chicago earlier with Kale Williams, Bill Moyer, David Jehnsen and other leaders of the American Friends Service Committee). He later became ordained as a Baptist minister and served as president of the American Baptist Theological Seminary. In 1973, Lafayette was named first director of the Peace Education Program at Gustavus Adolphus College, Saint Peter, Minnesota. The Gustavus program enabled Lafayette to infuse the entire curriculum of the college with peace education. Lafayette served this Lutheran liberal arts college for nearly three years. Lafayette has been recognized as a major authority on strategies for nonviolent social change. He is also recognized as one of the leading exponents of nonviolent direct action in the world. He was a Senior Fellow at the University of Rhode Island,Bernard Lafayette at URI Retrieved 3 July 213 where he helped to found the Center for Nonviolence and Peace Studies.

In 2014, The University of Rhode Island honored LaFayette with an honorary doctorate in recognition of his lifetime nonviolence leadership for civil and human rights.

HECJF is a state recognized degree in France. The diploma allowed to teach economics and management in grammar schools and granted credits to become a chartered accountant.  History  * In 1916, when Louli Sanua created the school, dedicated to young women, she selected students among those who passed the baccalaur√©at (French national secondary- school diploma, required to study at university). * In 1924, Louli Sanua sold the school to the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIP). The CCIP already owned the \\"√âcole sup√©rieure de commerce de Paris\\", ESCP, established in 1821, and the \\"√âcole des Hautes √©tudes commerciales\\", HEC, established in 1881. Coeducation did not exist, neither at HEC, nor at ESCP. The Direction of HEC had refused to admit girls. In the same year (March 25th), the decree B√©rard allowed girls to pass a baccalaur√©at which was equivalent to that of the boys. * In 1954, a preparatory course after the baccalaur√©at became compulsory to apply for the competitive examination to HECJF. Year after year, as competition strengthened, two years were more often necessary for entry to the 3-year programme at HECJF. * In the early 70's, the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry decided to introduce coeducation to all of its schools and to close HECJF. * Since 1973, HEC Paris, ESCP, EAP, and also ESSEC (√âcole sup√©rieure des sciences √©conomiques et commerciales) have been accepting women.  Alumnae = Association of graduates  * The HECJF alumnae association was created in 1917, and is still established in Paris. * In New York, the Association of graduates was also a member of AAGEF (Association des amis des grandes √©coles de France - New York network of alumni associations of French Grandes √âcoles) * From 1 January 2013, the HECJF Alumnae will be full members of the HEC Paris Alumni Association.

The most popular and successful series relating the adventures of Sylvain and Sylvette were drawn by Jean-Louis Pesch and are currently published by Dargaud. This is the only series still unfinished and published. Publication history The first series dedicated to the comics characters Sylvain and Sylvette was created by Maurice Cuvillier in 1941 for the magazine C≈ìurs Vaillants, and later published in the magazine Fripounet et Marisette. From 1956, Jean-Louis Pesch and Claude Dubois took over the series and drew and wrote albums on their own and separately, but still in the same series, published by Fleurus from 1953. Cuvillier stopped drawing in 1958, and a new series was launched in 1967, with the same authors and publisher. In 1973, an alternative series called \\"Seribis\\" was created, grouping Jean-Louis Pesch's albums and published in the casual size for comics, so that the former series stopped and from 1978, Dubois and Pesch published albums in distinct series. In 1986, Fleurus stopped publishing these adventures. While Dubois gave up, Pesch's series went on being published thanks to Le Lombard from 1990, then by Dargaud from 2001. All the albums of the former series \\"Seribis\\" were republished by Le Lombard and Dargaud. Evolution of the series At the beginning of the series, as drawn and written by Maurice Cuvillier, the story is a call to go back to nature and a traditional way of life influenced by the catholicism and the attachment to land. In the first series, Sylvain and Sylvette has fewer animals than in the current series. At that time, their pets comprised only Gris ‚Äì Gris, Cui ‚Äì Cui, Moustachu, Panpan, Barbichette, Mignonnet, Raton, Poulette, and all of them play active roles. As for the \\"comp√®res\\", they are all very dangerous and mean and are the archetypes of the villains, so that the series was designed as largely dualistic and moralistic. The themes of justice and punishment are very present in the spirit of the Cuvillier's albums, and Sylvain and Sylvette don't hesitate to severely retaliate against their pets when they joke or do a mistake. Gradually, these characters evolved under the influence of Claude Dubois and above all Jean- Louis Pesch who turned the comperes into comic protagonists and added some characters. But the theme of nature is still very present in the recent albums who praise the beauty and the harmony of the country. Jean-Louis Pesch focused much more than Cuvillier on the life in the forest and the necessary protection of nature. The graphic style of the series also evolved a lot, and while Jean-Louis Pesch had a style similar to that of Cuvillier and Dubois, his drawings became more original and individual. Synopsis This is the synopsis of the series currently published by Dargaud and designed by Jean- Louis Pesch Sylvain et Sylvette, are the main characters of the comics series. Orphans, they live alone and autonomously in a house that they call their \\"cottage\\", in the middle of the forest. They live with several animals referred in the series as their \\"friends\\" and have a very simple way of life, wearing clogs and eating with picking and fishing. Sometimes they pass to Laville (literally \\"Thetown\\" in French), a small village near their house, when they need a doctor or a veterinary for example. However, four starving animals, the \\"comperes\\", who live in a cavern not far from the cottage, seek to catch their animals or to steal their food. The atmosphere of the series is largely humoristic and the so-called villains' attempt to catch animals always fails. In some albums, Sylvain and Sylvette live more adventurous situations than the usual fight against the Comperes, particularly when Tartalo, a scientist, intervenes in the story. Characters Here are the characters present in the series drawn by Jean-Louis Pesch and published in the casual format for comics. The characters are described as they appear in this series only. The main characters of the series, as they appear on the back cover of the most recent albums. Main characters * Sylvain: rather optimistic and resourceful to avoid the Comperes' traps and attacks. * Sylvette: courageous and pessimistic, she takes care of cooking, washing and cleaning. Sylvain and Sylvette's pets *Cui-cui, small red bird, very vigilant, he watch over the cottage and warm in case of danger. *Gris-gris, the donkey who pulls the owners' carriage, often complain about this charge. *Barbichette, the manny- goat, is the most relentless enemy of Compere Renard. *Mignonnet, a lamb, very naive and weak, he is a frequent target for Renard and Loup. *Poulette, a hen and another target for the Comperes. *Coin-coin, a duck also threaten by the Comperes' appetite. *Sidonie, wild goose cured by the owners, and also targeted by the Comperes. *Raton, a rat joker and mischievous. *Clo√©, a turtle who claims not to be afraid of the Comperes. *Alfred, a spotted watchdog. *Panpan, a comic rabbit. *Moustachu, a red-haired cat. *Olga, a crow. The \\"comp√®res\\" In the French series, these four animals are called \\"les comp√®res\\" (\\"the mates\\" or \\"the partners\\" in French), and each of them are called either by their zoological name with capital letters, which suggests it is their real name (for example, the fox is called \\"Renard\\" or \\"Compere Renard\\"). *Renard (fox), his specialities are spying the cottage and finding ideas. *Loup (wolf), rather wary of Renard's ideas, he doesn't hesitate to scold him each time they fail. *Ours (bear), very stupid and thoughtless but very strong, he can sometimes be helpful in the Comperes' attempts. *Sanglier (boar), inactive compere, he contends himself with eating potatoes and laughing at other mates' failures. Others characters * Bastien, bear who used to work for a circus, he decided to retire. Compere Ours' cousin, he is a reader of \\"l'Ours libre\\" magazine. * L√©ocadie, former circus bear and Bastien's wife, very wary of the Compere, especially Renard * Basile, Bastien and Leocadie's son, likes following Renard especially when he is suited by Barbichette, believing it is a race. * Croa-croa, a raven who stammers, and occasional ally of the Comperes, he provides them with information. * Hurluberlu, an owl who lives in the forest and sleeps during the day, but occasionally helps Sylvain and Sylvette. * Tartalo, a scientist who seeks refuge either in a castle or in a mill not far from the cottage to develop unbelievable inventions.

Charles Nicolas Fabvier () (10 December 1782 ‚Äì 15 September 1855) was an ambassador, general and French member of parliament who played a distinguished role in the Greek War of Independence.  Career under Napoleon  He was born at Pont-√†-Mousson in Meurthe and was a student at the √âcole Polytechnique before joining the 1st Artillery Regiment in Napoleon‚Äôs army in Germany in 1804. He participated in the 1805 Ulm Campaign, and was wounded in the battle of D√ºrenstein. In 1807, he was part of the French military mission to the Ottoman Sultan Selim III, tasked with shoring up the defences of Constantinople. Fabvier then managed to join the diplomatic mission of General Charles Mathieu Gardanne, Napoleon's envoy to Persia, who tried to combat British and Russian influence in the region. Fabvier was tasked with creating an artillery school and arsenal at EsfahƒÅn, and was awarded the newly constituted Order of the Lion and the Sun for his efforts. In 1809, he returned to Europe via Russia, and served for a while as a volunteer in the Polish army of the Duchy of Warsaw. Arriving at Vienna, he was named captain in the French Imperial Guard. He served as aide-de-camp of Marshal Auguste de Marmont in Spain, and was sent by him to Russia to inform Napoleon on the Battle of Salamanca. He arrived at Napoleon's headquarters on 6 September 1812, the eve of the Battle of Borodino. Fabvier was gravely wounded in this battle, leading the charge during the final assault on the Russian fortifications. Napoleon rewarded him by naming him artillery major in the VI Corps under Marshal Ney. He distinguished himself further during the operations of the War of the Sixth Coalition in Germany, and was raised to colonel of the General Staff and made baron de l'Empire. He participated in the retreat into France, and on 31 March 1814, on behalf of Marshals Marmont and Mortier, he signed the surrender of Paris to the Coalition armies. During the Hundred Days, he joined the frontier defence forces as a volunteer.  Life after Napoleon  After Napoleon's downfall in 1815, he continued to serve in the royal French army. In 1817, he accompanied Marshal Marmont as chief of staff in quelling the riots at Lyon, provoked by the harsh conduct of the local military governor, General Simon Canuel. Soon after, he was suspended from his military duties for his liberal beliefs, and was arrested in August 1820 and charged with participation in a military conspiracy. Although he was released for lack of evidence, he was later called as a witness, but refused to disclose a name demanded by the public prosecutor, for which he was fined 500 francs. In 1822, he was charged with aiding the flight of four sergeants at La Rochelle, but was acquitted. In 1823 he decided to leave France and went to Greece, to help the Greeks during their ongoing War of Independence. His first task was the supervision of the fortifications of Navarino. Then he travelled to Britain to drum up support among the Philhellenes. Returning again to Greece, he was appointed head of the small Greek regular army, with which he participated in several battles, most notably the Siege of the Acropolis of Athens in 1826. In 1828, he returned to France, only to return to Greece alongside the French Morea expedition. In 1830, he returned to France and took part in the July Revolution. Initially chief of staff to General √âtienne Maurice G√©rard, on 4 August Fabvier was named military commander of Paris. In 1831, he resigned his commission and retired with the rank Lieutenant General. Fabvier was made a peer of France in 1845, and in 1848, he was sent as the French ambassador to Constantinople, and thereafter to Denmark. Back in France he was elected to the National Assembly of France as a representative of Meurthe. There he sided with the conservative group of the assembly. He retired from public life on 2 December 1851, and died in Paris four years later.

Biography Jean- Gabriel Eynard although belonging to a family who had settled in Switzerland since the 17th century was actually born in Lyon, France - where his father owned a business - on 28 December 1775. During the French Revolution the family fled France and took refuge in Rolle, Switzerland. In 1795, Jean- Gabriel and his brother Jacques went to Genoa and both were soon heading a flourishing commercial concern. In 1800 Massena's troops entered the town and Jean-Gabriel was entrusted with their supply. In particular he furnished them with uniforms cut from the blue cloth called \\"bleu de Genes\\" whence later derives the famous garment known worldwide as \\"blue jeans\\". In 1801, he entered in a highly speculative and hazardous financial venture becoming the sole subscriber to a bond issued by the duke of Etruria. That audacious move was crowned with success and constituted the foundation of his immense fortune. Portrait of Eynard by Firmin Massot. In 1803, he moved to Florence called forth by the Queen of Etruria, and thence he devoted much zeal and talent to the reformation and improvement of the finances of the Principality of Lucca and Piombino and he was also successful with those of the Tuscan state. Under the reign of Elisa Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister, as Grand-Duchess of Tuscany he continued his work with much success and was showered with honours and privileges. In 1809, he spent a long time in Paris in order to await the Emperor's return having been entrusted with the mission of thanking him, on behalf of both the Mediterranean Department and the Chamber of Commerce of Livorno, for the nomination of Elisa as Grand Duchess. In 1810 he moved to Geneva. He was ambassador of the Geneva republic at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. In the following year he helped to organize the administration of Tuscany, which he represented at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. Being a friend of Ioannis Kapodistrias, he was very enthusiastic for the cause of the Greeks during the Greek War of Independence. He was the chief of the philhellens community in Europe, and aided the revolutionaries financially. For his services to this cause, he was made a Greek citizen. He advised the new state. His recommendation of Otho of Bavaria for the throne of Greece was adopted. In 1842, he became one of the co-founders of the National Bank of Greece. In 1839, he was one of the first Swiss to use the daguerreotype. He had this passion until his death in 1863. He bequeathed his fortune to various charitable enterprises. He was married to Anna Eynard-Lullin.

He is best remembered for winning the first United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in 1919 with his Hall of Fame colt, Sir Barton. In 1911, he set the world record for catching the largest tuna () by rod and line at St. Anns, Nova Scotia. After his father, he was the second Canadian to be made a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Early life James Ross mansion on Peel Street, Montreal, with J. K. L. Ross (pictured standing), 1910 Ross was born in Lindsay, Ontario, the only child of James Leveson Ross, who made his fortune constructing the Canadian Pacific Railway and become a prominent art collector and the first Canadian to be made a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. His mother, Annie Kerr (1847‚Äì1915), was the daughter of John W. Kerr (1824‚Äì1904) of Kingston, New York, a prominent politician with the Democratic Party and formerly the Sheriff of Ulster County, New York. Known as \\"Jack\\" to his friends, Ross grew up in Montreal's Golden Square Mile at his parents' French ch√¢teau-style mansion at 3644 Peel Street, designed by architect Bruce Price. The home was later bought by John W. McConnell and donated to McGill University, when it was renamed Chancellor Day Hall. Ross was educated at Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Quebec, and at McGill University. He was an enthusiastic squash and racquets player, and was on the McGill ice hockey team and a member of the university's Canadian football championship team.

In 1909, a house was built for Ross in Montreal at 3647 Peel Street, opposite his father's mansion.J.K.L. Ross House, McGill University Designed by Edward Maxwell and his brother William Maxwell,3647 Peel Street, Montreal, McGill University it is now known as J.K.L. Ross House and is occupied by the Biomedical Ethics Unit and the Department of Social Studies of Medicine of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine.Director of Buildings website for the Faculty of Medicine, McGill University After his father's death in 1913 (when he inherited $16 million), he moved back to his childhood home and used the second one to house guests, the newer one being too small for parties. It was purchased by Marianopolis College in 1961 and used as administration offices until 1976, when McGill University acquired the property. At one time, his father owned a controlling interest in Dominion Coal Company and Dominion Iron and Steel Company. As a result, Ross built a summer home at St. Anns Bay in the northern part of Victoria County, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island. After his father's death, Ross moved to Nova Scotia, where for a time he was involved in the management of the companies. Tuna fishing It was while at St. Anns, Nova Scotia, that Ross developed a passion for the sport of deep-sea fishing. He tackled the sport scientifically and was a pioneer among tuna anglers, developing fishing techniques that later became standard practice. He wrote two books on the subject, describing various discoveries and adventures. He had remarkable tenacity, bearing in mind that harnesses were not yet invented, on one occasion he fought a tuna for 19 hours before being forced to cut his line.Sports Illustrated ‚Äì Test Time for Tuna On 28 August 1911, after a struggle of a mere four hours and forty five minutes, Ross landed a tuna which set a record for the largest fish caught with a rod and reel. The record held for several years until he himself bettered it by catching a tuna. That record was broken in 1950 by his son-in- law, Commander Duncan Hodgson, who in the same way landed a tuna off Cape Breton. World War I During World War I, Ross donated three large yachts for use in the war effort by the Royal Canadian Navy and took command of one of them, , in the North Atlantic. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for distinguished naval service. Afterwards, the media would commonly refer to him as \\"Commander J.K.L. Ross.\\" Ross was the second Canadian (after his father) to be made a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Philanthropy Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal James Ross had used his enormous wealth to become a major benefactor to Montreal, and his son continued the family's philanthropy. In 1916, acting on his late father's desire to support the Royal Victoria Hospital, Ross donated $1 million for the building of the first major addition to the hospital, which became known as the Ross Memorial Pavilion, one of Canada's first private patient pavilions. During World War I, Ross donated $500,000 in cash to the Royal Navy. He also gave a further $500,000 to be distributed between the families of enlisted men killed in the war. He donated money to fund a new building (Ross Boarding House) at his alma mater, Bishop's College School, Lennoxville, and also gave liberally to McGill University. Thoroughbred racing Sir Barton and jockey Johnny Loftus, Preakness Stakes, 1919 Ross owned several riding horses that led to an interest in Thoroughbred horse racing and breeding. In 1915, he purchased twelve Thoroughbreds that immediately paid dividends when Damrosch won the 1916 Preakness Stakes. Later that year, he acquired a farm property at Vercheres, Quebec where he established his own breeding operation. Ross contracted jockeys Earl Sande, Carroll Shilling and Johnny Loftus, all of whom would be elected to the United States Racing Hall of Fame, plus he hired H. Guy Bedwell who became one of America's leading trainers and who, too, was inducted in the US Racing Hall of Fame. Running one of the most successful racing stables in North America, at Toronto's Old Woodbine Race Course, his horses won numerous races including five editions each of the Maple Leaf Stakes, the Connaught Cup, and the Grey Stakes. Racing success led Jack Ross to build a second breeding and racing stable near Toronto he called Agincourt Farms and a third such operation in the State of Maryland called the Yarrow Brae Stud Farm. Sir Barton In 1919, Ross owned two of the best three- year-olds in North America. Sir Barton and the 1918 American Champion Two- Year-Old Colt, Billy Kelly, finished one-two in the 1919 Kentucky Derby. Sir Barton then went on to win the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes to become the first-ever winner of the US Triple Crown. For 1919, Sir Barton was voted American Horse of the Year. The following year, Sir Barton set a world record for 1 3/16 miles on dirt in winning the 28 August 1920, Merchants and Citizens Handicap at the Saratoga Race Course. However, plagued by tender hooves, Sir Barton was beaten in a now-famous match race on the hard dirt surface of the Kennilworth Park in Windsor, Ontario by Man o' War. In 1957, Sir Barton was inducted in the US Racing Hall of Fame. In addition to Sir Barton, notable among the Ross stable of racehorses were: * Damrosch (b. 1913), won 1916 Preakness Stakes * Cudgel (b. 1914), American Champion Older Male Horse (1918, 1919) * Milkmaid (b. 1916), American Co-Champion 3-Year-Old Filly (1919), American Champion Older Female Horse (1920) * Constancy (b. 1917), American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly * Hallucination (b. 1920), multiple stakes winner including the Autumn and Durham Cups Financial reverses forced Ross to disband his entire racing operations in 1927. In 1920, he had been appointed president of Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal, and although no longer a stable owner after 1927, he held the position until 1931, when he retired to a home in Jamaica. Reputation Ross was widely respected for his good manners and sportsmanship, and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame says that the United States press called him \\"the best sportsman Canada has ever sent to this country.\\" On one race he put down $20,000 and won back $160,000, but he spotted an irregularity, and although legally he was allowed to keep his winnings, he gave $40,000 back to the bookies. Though he betted frequently, he won as often as he lost, but he is remembered on one occasion for winning $50,000 from a notoriously sharp New Yorker. The Rosses lived lavishly, even by many of his contemporaries' standards. Princess Patricia of Connaught became engaged to Alexander Ramsay at Ross' fishing lodge on the Bay of St. Anns, Nova Scotia. She was heard to remark that the Rosses lived more royally than royalty. He did keep thirty servants, but many of his supposed trappings were fictional: he had one or sometimes two Rolls-Royces, not eight, and his single private railway car was not an entire private train. Bankruptcy There was no doubt that Ross was very generous with his money and spent a fortune on parties, horse racing and yachts, but there was no single cause for the financial downfall that befell him in 1928, when he was down to his final $300 after inheriting $16 million fifteen years earlier. His investments in Turner Valley and the Mexican oil wells had been premature, and he had been exceedingly generous in his philanthropy and to many friends alike. His saddest memory was when his friends to whom he'd been so generous before crossed the street when they saw him coming. Certainly his passion for horse racing cost him dearly, as his only son, Jim Ross, explained: \\"To own a few mediocre horses is an expensive luxury. To own many good ones demands a truly vast sum of money. In those days a large racing establishment, even a highly successful one, never made back its expenses.\\" Family and final years Mrs Ethel (Matthews) Ross, c. 1924 Mrs Hylda (Ross) Hodgson, 1929 In 1902, at St. James Cathedral, Toronto, Ross married his first wife, Ethel (Etheldine) Alice Matthews, daughter of Wilmot Deloui Matthews (1850‚Äì1919), one of Toronto's most influential businessmen, by his wife Annie Jane Love. One of Ethel's brothers was married to Annabel, daughter of Sir Edmund Boyd Osler, and the other married the New York City socialite Constance Greening. Her sister lived with the Rosses for some time in Nova Scotia before marrying Bruce MacKinnon and moving to Switzerland. The Rosses were the parents of a son and a daughter, *James Kenneth Matthews Ross (1903‚Äì1966). Known as Jim, he was educated at Bishop's College School. He shared his father's passion for racing and in 1956 published a book entitled Boots and Saddles: The Story of the Fabulous Ross Stable in the Golden Days of Racing. He married Marjorie Arnott Ballantyne (d. 1974), of Montreal. Following her husband's death, she took up residence at the Ritz-Carlton, Montreal. They had one daughter, Joan. *Hylda Anne May Ross, married Commander Duncan McIntyre Hodgson, RCN, of Montreal, and had three daughters. He was the son of 'Archie' Archibald Arthur Hodgson (1869‚Äì1960), the scorer of the winning goal for the Montreal Hockey Club in the first Stanley Cup final. His mother, Mary, was a first cousin of his father and a daughter and co-heiress of Duncan McIntyre. As mentioned earlier, Duncan Hodgson broke his father-in-law's world record by a catching a 997 lb Bluefin tuna from a rowing boat with rod and line, without a harness. Two years after Ross was declared bankrupt, Ethel divorced him in 1930. She continued to live in Montreal, remarrying a Boston attorney, which also ended in divorce. Ross was saved from penury by a trust fund. A few years before, the home he had built for himself on Peel Street was valued at over a million dollars but by 1930, with Montreal in a recession following the Wall Street Crash, there were no takers for a mansion that size. As an act of charity Ross's friend, the 2nd Lord Shaughnessy, purchased it from him for $51,000 in 1935. Ross briefly moved into an apartment before leaving for Jamaica, where he met and married in 1931 his new wife, Iris de Lisser, the daughter of a Jamaican planter and sister of H. G. de Lisser. He bought a house on Montego Bay (that after his death was purchased by Lord Beaverbrook) and was made deputy governor of the island. Apart from occasional visits to Montreal, he remained in Jamaica, fishing and sailing until his death in 1951 ‚Äì happier (he told his confidantes), than when he was rich. In accordance with his wishes, J. K. L. Ross was buried at sea. On its formation in 1976, he was inducted posthumously into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

The device consists of an integrated circuit connected to a series of exposed electrical contacts, in a curved package which matches the lens mount. It is designed to be affixed in a particular position on the mount, in order to mate with matching contacts on the camera body. The contacts on both sides of the mount are commonly known as CPU contacts. Camera functions enabled by the chip may include exposure metering, aperture display and control, focus confirmation and fine-tuning, and Exif metadata recording. The level of additional functionality enabled by the chip depends on the camera. Some cameras provide certain electronic functions even with a non- electronic lens. For example, professional-level Nikon DSLRs provide metering and focus confirmation, and store lens data programmed into the camera, regardless of whether the mounted lens has electronic contacts. By contrast, many consumer-level Nikon DSLRs require an electronically enabled lens to perform functions as basic as metering.

Ltd. (also known as Extel) was created in March 1872 specifically to distribute financial and business information from the London Stock Exchange and other commercial markets direct to subscribers. The company established ticker tape telegraph machines in offices, gentlemen's clubs, banks etc. and provided a continuous stream of commercial information to them. It introduced a parliamentary service in 1876, a general news service in 1879 and a legal service in 1891. The business was so successful that by 1906 they had opened ten other branches outside London. The company continued to grow and improve, becoming increasingly more efficient. It added a faster financial service in 1907 and began operating a worldwide news service in 1913, with a separate sports service included in the 1930s. Over the course of its history, Extel (the name coming into common use for the company in the 1950s) grew into one of the leading news agencies, provider of financial information and associated businesses. Among the many notable achievement were 'Extel cards', the very first corporate snapshots/tear-sheets with brief data on profit and loss, employees, business activities and executive management. Extel cards, naturally in hard copy, were first produced in 1922. Recent history Extel was acquired by United Newspapers in 1987. In 1991, Extel set up a joint venture with Agence France Presse to create a financial news service, AFX News. Pearson plc acquired Extel in 1993 and merged it as Financial Times Information into its Financial Times division. Financial Times reorganised the company into two divisions: Market Data and Research. The research division retained the Extel branding. Primark acquired the Extel brand from Pearson in 1999 and it became part of Thomson Financial in 2000. AFP's share in AFX News was sold in 2006 to Thomson Financial.

It was developed by Viggo Brun in 1915. Description In terms of sieve theory the Brun sieve is of combinatorial type; that is, it derives from a careful use of the inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle. Let A be a set of positive integers ‚â§ x and let P be a set of primes. For each p in P, let Ap denote the set of elements of A divisible by p and extend this to let Ad the intersection of the Ap for p dividing d, when d is a product of distinct primes from P. Further let A1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P(z) denote the primes in P ‚â§ z. The object of the sieve is to estimate :S(A,P,z) = \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\in P(z)} A_p \\\\right\\\\vert . We assume that Ad  may be estimated by : \\\\left\\\\vert A_d \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\frac{w(d)}{d} X + R_d where w is a multiplicative function and X = A. Let : W(z) = \\\\prod_{p \\\\in P(z)} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{w(p)}{p} \\\\right) . Brun's pure sieve This formulation is from Cojocaru & Murty, Theorem 6.1.2. With the notation as above, assume that *Rd  ‚â§ w(d) for any squarefree d composed of primes in P ; * w(p) < C for all p in P ; * \\\\sum_{p \\\\in P_z} \\\\frac{w(p)}{p} < D \\\\log\\\\log z + E; where C, D, E are constants. Then : S(A,P,z) = X \\\\cdot W(z) \\\\cdot \\\\left({1 + O\\\\left((\\\\log z)^{-b \\\\log b}\\\\right)}\\\\right) + O\\\\left(z^{b \\\\log\\\\log z}\\\\right) where b is any positive integer. In particular, if log z < c log x / log log x for a suitably small c, then : S(A,P,z) = X \\\\cdot W(z) (1+o(1)) . \\\\, Applications * Brun's theorem: the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges; * Schnirelmann's theorem: every even number is a sum of at most C primes (where C can be taken to be 6); * There are infinitely many pairs of integers differing by 2, where each of the member of the pair is the product of at most 9 primes; * Every even number is the sum of two numbers each of which is the product of at most 9 primes. The last two results were superseded by Chen's theorem, and the second by Goldbach's weak conjecture (C = 3). References   .

In 2001, he returned to The Football League with Swansea City where, after beginning the season on the bench, he established himself in the first team, making 16 appearances in all competitions, before his season was ended in February 2002 when he suffered a double fracture in his jaw after being struck by a deliberate elbow thrown by David Partridge during a match against Leyton Orient on 9 February 2002. Evans was released by Swansea at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, moving to non-league club Newport County. After one season at Newport he was released by then manager Peter Nicolas in June 2005. He then had a brief spell playing for Cardiff Grange Quins, but re-joined Newport County in 2005.

The details being disputed, he was imprisoned and died. Life The third son of John Shelley of Michelgrove, Clapham, Sussex, he was for some time abroad in attendance on his uncle Sir Richard Shelley, the last Grand Prior of England of the Order of Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem. He was given permission to return to England in May, 1583, which he did shortly afterwards. The petition Two accounts are extant of the petition he presented on behalf of his fellow Catholics, at that time severely limited by legislation in the practice of their religion. One is by Peter Penkevel, who was his servant in the Marshalsea at the time of his death. This is printed by John Hungerford Pollen. Peter Penkevel says he came to London about 1584, when Mr. Robert Bellamy and others were prisoners in the Marshalsea: but Robert Bellamy was not committed there till 30 January 1586. So Penkevel must be wrong in his dates, and all that he knows about the petition, which was presented (as he says, to the queen) nearly a year previously, is mere hearsay. John Strype on the other hand seems to have seen the petition, and according to him it was presented to Parliament. The only result was that Richard Shelley was sent to the Marshalsea, 15 March 1585. There he remained till his death, which probably took place in February or March, 1586. He was certainly alive and in the Marshalsea in October, 1585. He was sick when Peter Penkevel came to him, and \\"shortly after died, a constant confessor in the said prison\\". Richard Shelley of Findon This Richard Shelley must be distinguished from the Richard Shelley of Findon, Sussex, and All Cannings, Wiltshire (second son of Edward Shelley of Warminghurst, Sussex, and brother of Edward Shelley the martyr), who was committed to the Marshalsea for his religion, 13 August 1580. Mass was said in his chamber there by the priest William Hartley, 24 August 1582. He was still there 8 April 1584, but was liberated soon after. He was again in prison in 1592.

It is found in forest understory and bushes in northeastern Brazil. The Ceara gnateater is locally called ‚Äúcupadente‚Äù, or ‚Äúspitter‚Äù in Portuguese due to the sound it produces when it vocalizes.  Appearance  They are about 11.5 to 14 cm (4.5 to 5.5 in) long. The Cear√° gnateater used to be considered a subspecies of the rufous gnateater (Conopophaga lineata), but recent evidence shows they are distinct species.Ceara Gnateater (Conopophaga cearae), In Neotropical Birds Online (, Editors).

Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia- Brazilian Journal of Ornithology, 10(16): 5. Once prey is captured, such as small arthropods or beetles, they head to the safety of dense underbrush. They prefer to forage alone or with their mate and tend to avoid larger groups. This behavior of group avoidance is not well explained.  Reproduction  Similar to most gnateaters, this species is monogamous. Pairs remain together throughout the year. Mated-pairs may avoid mixed-species flocks found in the understory. Courtship involve males erecting their white ear tufts and chasing females while performing simple aerial displays. Male primary feathers are modified to produce specialized sounds while in flight. Both their ear tufts and sound production with their wings can be used for courtship or for territory defense. A pair's territory size may extend to 40m¬≤.Leite, G. A., Gomes, F. B., & MacDnald, D. 2013. Description of the nest, nestling and broken-wing behavior of Conopophaga aurita (Passeriformes: Conopophagidae). Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia-Brazilian Journal of Ornithology, 20(48): 4. Nest building involves placing twigs and leaves in low branches or shrubs to create a camouflaged cup-nest. The clutch consists of 2 eggs, but it is often that only one survives to fledge. Males aid the females in incubation. Incubating adults attempt to camouflage themselves when predators approach by shrinking into the nest and often rely on shadows to hide their rufous color. Adults will only flee if predators are dangerously close to the nest. Other strategies include females luring predators away using a \\"broken-wing display\\" in which they feign an injury to distract away from the nest. This behavior is intensified when nestlings are in later stages of development, such as close to fledging.  Conservation Status  There has been conflicting information on this species endangered status. Its population is considered stable, but there has been a lack of studies regarding actual population numbers. Some sources say its status should be changed to vulnerable due to its restricted range which makes it susceptible to habitat loss. AQUASIS is a non-profit organization that works in the Brazilian state of Ceara to prevent the extinction of endangered species. Although the Ceara gnateater is not one of their species of focus, this organization works to protect areas where they exist.‚ÄúGrey-breasted Parakeet‚Äù. AQUASIS website. 2017.

In 125 BC Lepidus was an augur (a divinatory priest). In that year he was persecuted by the censors. According to Velleius Paterculus, he was persecuted by both censors, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla, for extravagance in the rent of his house. He hired a house for a yearly rent of 6,000 asses.Velleius Paterculus, Roman Histories, II.10 According to Valerius Maximus, he was persecuted by Lucius Cassius and punished with a fine by a court of the people for building too high a holiday home in the region of Alsium.Valerius Maximus, Memorable Deeds and Sayings 1. damn. 7. Command in Hispania Citerior  Lepidus was sent to Hispania Citerior during his consulship to replace his colleague Gaius Hostilius Mancinus, who was recalled to Rome and put on trial because he made a peace treaty with the Celtiberians during the Numantine War (153-133), which was rejected by the senate. Lepidus did not wait for instructions from Rome and, according to Appian, tired of idleness and seeking glory, he resolved to make war upon the Vaccaei, who were not at war with Rome, under the pretence of their having assisted Numantia. He persuaded Decimus Junius Brutus, the governor of Hispania Ulterior and his brother-in- law, to join him. They ravaged the countryside and besieged Pallantia, the largest city of the Vaccaei. Lepidus and Brutus were reached by Cinna and Caecilius, two messengers from Rome \\"who said that the senate was at a loss to know why, after so many disasters had befallen on them in Spain, should he be seeking a new war.\\" They warned him not to attack the Vaccaei. Lepidus sent the messengers back to Rome and wrote that it was too dangerous to abandon this war. Lepidus took advantage of the senate's ignorance of the situation and Brutus' involvement to continue his operations.Appian, Roman History Vol 6, The Spanish Wars 81-82 Lepidus and Brutus begun to build siege machines and gather provisions. The siege was protracted and the Roman food supply failed. There was hunger and many soldiers and all the animals died. The two commanders persisted, but eventually had to give up. The Romans withdrew in a disorderly manner. They left everything behind, even the sick and wounded. The Vaccaei attacked their flanks and rear all day killing many Romans. This happened during Lepidus' proconsulship in 136 and, when the news reached Rome, Lepidus was stripped of his command and consulship. He got away with just a fine.Appian, Spanish Wars, 83Livy, Periochae, 56.1-2;Orosius, A History, against the Pagans, V.5 Oratory Lepidus was a man of education and refined taste. Cicero, who had read his speeches, spoke of him as the greatest orator of his age and says that he was the first who introduced in Latin oratory the smooth and even flow of words which distinguished Greeks. He helped to form the style of Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Carbo, who were accustomed to listen to him with great care.Cicero, Brutus, 95-96 Cicero mentioned Lepidus and his relatives among the Roman orators who \\"were little, if at all, inferior to the Greeks.\\"Cicero, Tusculanae Disputationes, I.3 He was, however, very deficient in a knowledge of law and Roman institutions.Cicero, de Oratore, 1.9.40, ; Auctor, Rhetorica de Herennium IV.5. Politics In politics Lepidus seems to have belonged to the optimates, a conservative political faction which supported the interests of the aristocracy. During his consulship he supported the opposition by Marcus Antius Briso (a plebeian tribune) against a bill on the introduction of voting by secret ballot in the Plebeian Council (Lex Cassia Tabellaria) proposed by another plebeian tribune, Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla. This bill would free the plebeian voters from electoral pressure. However, on the advice of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus, Brisio dropped his opposition and the bill was carried.Cicero, Brutus, 97 It appears from a fragment of Priscian,Priscian, Grammatici Opera, vol. I. p 456 that Lepidus spoke in favour of a repeal of the lex Aemilia, which was probably the sumptuary law proposed by the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus in 115.Meyer, Orator. 2nd. ed, Rom.

The Height of Buildings Act of 1910 was an Act of Congress passed by the 61st United States Congress on June 1, 1910 to limit the height of buildings in District of Columbia, amending the Height of Buildings Act of 1899.\\"Fiscal Relation of the District of Columbia,\\" from \\"Senate Documents - Volume 5\\" for the 64th Congress, pg. 863, published by GPO, 1916 (https://books.google.com/books?id=2q8qAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA863&lpg;=PA863&dq;=1899+%22Act+to+regulate+the+height+of+buildings+in+the+District+of+Columbia%22&source;=bl&ots;=jpSP9wRVH2&sig;=oZxxJCRd9xE1WKhAHeqT1vYeWI0&hl;=en&ei;=lq1YS4mDM47KsQOF5PjFBw&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=5&ved;=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q;=1899%20%22Act%20to%20regulate%20the%20height%20of%20buildings%20in%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%22&f;=false) The new height restriction law was more comprehensive than the previous law, and generally restricts building heights along residential streets to , and along commercial corridors to the width of the right-of-way of the street or avenue on which a building fronts, or a maximum of , whichever is shorter. Background In response to the construction of the 164-foot (50-meter) Cairo Hotel in 1894, D.C. Commissioners issued height regulations for buildings in D.C., limiting their height to for residential and for business, or to the width of the street in front, whichever was smaller.http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/building_height The original Height of Buildings Act, passed by Congress in 1899, removed the front street restriction, but reaffirmed limiting buildings to on residential streets and on business streets. It also made an exception for buildings on business streets wide, which were permitted to be tall. Description The 1899 act was amended in 1910 creating Chapter 6, Subchapter 1, Section 5. Section 5 added the restriction that the height of any building would be limited to the width of the adjacent street plus up to a maximum of on residential streets, on commercial streets, and on a small portion of the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between 1st and 15th Streets Northwest opposite the Federal Triangle. The act has since been amended eight times, of which five amendments made exceptions for specific buildings: St. Matthews Church in December 1930, the Harrington Hotel in June 1914, the National Press Club Building in April 1926, the United Masonic Temple in April 1930, and finally the Georgetown University Hospital in March 1945. The other two amendments including raising the height maximum on residential streets by five additional feet, and permitting residential buildings to have eight instead of ten floors. Tallest buildings in District of Columbia The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, completed in 1959, was granted an exemption to the law by the District Zoning Commission. At 329 feet tall, the National Shrine stands as the tallest building in Washington, D.C., excluding the Washington Monument () and the Hughes Memorial Tower (). When the original act was passed in 1899, the Old Post Office Building was grandfathered in, and remains as the tallest high-rise federal building in the district. One Franklin Square is the tallest commercial building in District of Columbia and the fifth highest building overall. Completed in 1989, its twin towers rise to and above the main roof line, which reaches the district's height limit of . Proposed policy changes The current policy of the 1910 Height Act has been in place with only small modifications for over 100 years. Its influence on the development of the district both within the monumental core and beyond has shaped District of Columbia's skyline. In order to determine if the district could be provided some relief related to building heights within the original boundaries of the L'Enfant Plan and a loosening of federal oversight outside of the monumental core while protecting federal interests, a revisiting of policy was deemed warranted by Congress at this time. One specific issue the District of Columbia government identified that is impacting development within the downtown core is the law prohibiting the use of the penthouse level (i.e. roof) for needs other than mechanical (i.e. HVAC equipment) structures. For example, the height of a building as calculated by the Height Act does not include roof top structures used for mechanical needs within the total allowable height. However, if structures on the roof top (such as a pool house associated with a roof top pool) are constructed for human occupation, it is then calculated as part of the overall height of the building under the law. As a result, architects and designers currently would have to lower their building designs by an entire floor to allow for some human occupied space on the roof, if the building is to reach the maximum allowable height. By allowing usable, human occupying space at the penthouse level, the District of Columbia is arguing that there would be no real impact on the overall height limit and it would not change the \\"human scale\\" of the current landscape within the district. The current allowable height within the downtown area of the district prohibits \\"people's enjoyment of some of the district's greatest spaces and most striking views\\".Testimony of Ms. Harriet Tregoning, DC Office of Planning, Changes to the Heights Act: Shaping Washington, D.C. for the Future, 112th US Congress, Second Session, July 19, 2012, Serial No. 112-184, pg. 5-6 The second problem identified focuses on the area of the District of Columbia outside of the original Federal City laid out by L'Enfant. This area is typically north of Florida Avenue, NW (originally known as Boundary Avenue) and east of the Anacostia River. The passage of the 1973 District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Home Rule Act) allowed for many local government functions to be controlled at the local level for the first time. However, within the Home Rule Act, Congress specifically stated that the DC Council does not have the authority to \\"enact any act, resolution or rule which permits the building of any structure within the District of Columbia in excess of the height limitations contained in Section 5 of the Height Act.\\" District of Columbia Home Rule Act, Public Law No. 93-198, Title 6, Section 602(a)(6), December 24, 1973. The District of Columbia can argue that its local zoning regulations are as stringent, if not more stringent, in managing building heights throughout the District.District of Columbia Zoning Regulations, Overlay Districts, http://dcoz.dc.gov/info/overlay.shtm The local government has been a strong steward of the evolving architectural landscape of the district through zoning and preservation laws since gaining control through the Home Rule Act.DC Historic Preservation Regulations, 10DCMR Title 10-C, Rule 10-C2002 Design and Construction Standards and Guidelines, http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/ChapterHome.aspx?ChapterNumber=10-C20 On November 19, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission released their final recommendations regarding the Height Master Plan for District of Columbia. The plan, which looked at the question of possible changes to the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, also reviewed \\"who or what entity should manage building heights....[and] gave voice to questions related to Home Rule as well as the role of the U.S. Congress...\\".National Capital Planning Commission, Executive Director's Recommendation-NCPC File Number 6886, November 19, 2013, http://www.ncpc.gov/heightstudy/ The Commission has put forth four recommendations for Congress's consideration that would include both keeping the status quo in one instance, but proposing policy changes in the other. The first recommendation focuses on the area of the District of Columbia within the original L'Enfant city. \\"Due to the concentration of federal interests within the L'Enfant City and to protect the integrity of the form and character of the nation's capital, the federal Height Act should remain in place and no changes should be made to the formula or approach for calculating allowable building height.\\" The second recommendation focuses on the area outside of the L'Enfant City and provides the District of Columbia government a mechanism in which to identify targeted areas in the district where they could proposed building heights to exceed the maximum currently allowed by the 1910 Height Act. \\"These may be authorized through the existing Comprehensive Plan process, pending Congressional approval. Should such targeted exceptions be authorized through the Comprehensive Plan, the Height Act would remain in place for all other areas both inside and outside of the L'Enfant City.\\" The third recommendation focuses on the important vistas that currently exist within the district. \\"The city's most significant viewsheds, to include without limitations, those to and from the U.S. Capitol and White House, should be further evaluated and federal and local protections established, which include policies in the Federal and District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan.\\" Finally, the last recommendation is in response to a specific request that the District of Columbia government put forth before Congress during the hearing in 2012. The National Capital Planning Commission agrees and recommends amending \\"the Height Act to allow for human occupancy in existing and future penthouses, with restrictions.\\" See also *The Height of Buildings Act of 1899 *Downtown Washington, D.C. *List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C. *List of United States federal legislation References Category:1910 in American law Category:District of Columbia law Category:Urban planning in the United States Category:1910 in Washington, D.C.

They formed after Lenie was invited to join Anjali, Ella, Andrea and Delia - who were all living together (bar Delia) in a squat in Islington - to form a band. They became part of a vibrant music scene in the early 1990s which centered around three indie labels in London at the time, namely Clawfist, Too Pure and Wiiija. Their sound was a mixture of garage, punk, and pop and they had links to British riot grrrl bands such as Huggy Bear. Drummer Anjali Bhatia left in 1992 in order to form the Voodoo Queens and guitarist Ella Guru joined her in 1993. The other members of the 1992 line-up appearing on the first single - a double 'A' side of \\"Prom Queen\\" written by Anjali and \\"Insecure\\" written by Lenie - were: Lenie (lead vocal/bass), Delia (guitar/vocals) and Andrea (organ/vocals).Stallard, Sam, \\"Cab Happy\\", NME, late 1992 Karin Rapp (drums/vocals) joined the band from the second single onwards. After the departure of Anjali and Ella the band went on to record one album In Love With, featuring songs composed by all band members, but with lyrics mostly written by Lenie, covering topics as diverse as sexual abuse (\\"Velvet Youth\\" written by Lenie), religion (\\"Evangelical\\" written by Andrea) and women's issues such as single motherhood (\\"Push that Pram\\" written by Lenie), depression and self-harm (\\"Happy Claire\\" written by Karin Rapp); all other tracks were written by Lenie including the 'hit' single \\"Poems on the Underground\\" and the non-album single \\"Do you Always Dress Like That...\\" Mambo Taxi videos were early works by Nicholas Abrahams. The band's name was taken from the film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown by Pedro Almodovar and was a reference to the taxi used by the film's heroine.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 855 Ella Guru, in an interview with NME's Sam Stallard in 1992, described it as \\"tacky\\" but \\"with all sorts of different things in it that sort of clash, but everything‚Äôs useful as well as fun.\\" thus describing the band. Lenie is from Belgium; Delia, Andrea and Anjali are British, Karin comes from Germany and Ella from Ohio. Post break-up Following the band's dissolution, Lenie formed Jolt with former Senseless Things frontman Mark Keds, they formed their own label 'Scared of Girls' and were signed by Warner Chappell. They released an EP Punk Jungle Rules and several singles. She briefly played in Square Mile Group and has been writing music ever since whilst bringing up a family. She has contributed songs to plays and the Libertines song, \\"Can't Stand Me Now\\", which features lyrics taken from a song written by Lenie and Mark Keds recorded in Brittania Row Studios called \\"Walking in LA\\". Delia went on to be in the Phantom Pregnancies along with members of Huggy Bear and Wat Tyler, and has proved to be the most prolific of ex-Mambo Taxi members, later appearing in the line-up of Baby Birkin, the Family Way and the A-Lines, as well as Manic Coughh, the Schla La Las, the Action Time, the Werewandas, and others. Delia and Karin were also in short-lived band Punjab Rovers, a collaboration with Cornershop which produced one 7\\" single.

Battle After the Turkish defeat at the battle of Valtetsi, the Turkish leader K√¢hya Mustafa Bey decided to attack and destroy the Greek camp of Vervena where 2,500 armed Greeks had gathered and its destruction would seriously damage Greek morale.According to Spyridon Trikoupis So, during the night of 17 - 18 May, an Ottoman force of six thousand men and two cannons marched from Tripolis, against Vervena.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 54 The plan could succeed if the Ottoman army could pass Doliana; where Nikitaras was with two hundred or so men. By the time the Ottomans reached him he had fortified some houses and ordered fire against them. The Ottoman army was surprised by Nikitaras and the troops panicked.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 54 Meanwhile at Vervena a part of the Turkish army arrived but it was forced to retreat because the troops of the camp, realising the danger, attacked the Ottomans and flanked them. Due to the increasing casualties, Mustafa Bey retreated but the Greeks kept hunting them down until Tripoli. According to Kolokotronis, the Ottomans lost seventy men and left on the battlefield much booty with the cannons that were left there after the death of the artillery's chief at the beginning of the battle.According to Th. Kolokotronis' Memoirs Nikitaras, who had up to that point lived in the shadow of his uncle Theodoros Kolokotronis, earned a name for himself and the nickname \\"Tourkofagos\\" (Greek: Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒøœÜŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ) (Turk-eater).

A real attacking talent, Cave was another young player who has come up through the Ulster Academy system and upgraded his development contract to a full contract with Ulster ahead of the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He is a strong runner and tackling centre who has made a rapid progression at international level, having helped Ireland win the Grand Slam during 2007 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, starred in Ireland's Rugby World Cup Sevens qualification and he has represented Ireland 'A' as they won the 2009 Churchill Cup. Ulster Rugby In 2010/11 Cave struggled with injuries but returned towards the end of the season and scored some vital tries as Ulster reached the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup and semi-finals of the Magners League. Cave showed excellent form on his return to action but picked up another injury in early 2012, just as he looked likely to be included in Ireland's Six Nations squad. He made another magnificent comeback as Ulster made the Heineken Cup final for just the second time in their history, but they lost to Leinster in the 2012 Heineken Cup Final, 42-14. Cave agreed a new two-year deal with Ulster in December 2012, keeping him at the Irish province until the summer of 2015. He told Ulster's website: \\"Signing this new contract was probably the easiest decision that I have ever made in my life, especially at a time when the team have just won 12 competitive matches in a row. I honestly think that Ulster are going to win something between now and the summer of 2015 and I would never forgive myself if I wasn't around to be a part of that. In the 2012/13 campaign, Cave was ever-present as Ulster reached the final of the PRO12 and recorded a series of notable firsts including winning in France and beating every Welsh region in Wales. Cave scored five tries the following season and was a stand-out player for the province as Ulster won all six of their Heineken Cup Pool matches and reached the PRO12 Play Off. His form was rewarded with a place on the Ireland tour to Argentina where he played in both test matches. Cave retired from rugby union at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. International career Cave was included in Ireland's extended 2009 Six Nations squad and won his first international cap against Canada in May 2009. His form was recognised with an international call up for the summer tour to New Zealand in June 2012 where he won his third cap and he then scored a brilliant individual try for an Ireland XV side that played Fiji at Thomond Park on November 17, 2012. Cave was named in the Ireland squad for their 2013 US and Canada summer tour and played in both matches, scoring a try vs Canada match. In the summer of 2014 Cave was included in the following summer tour and played twice against Argentina. After initially not been selected for the Autumn International, he was recalled by Joe Schmidt and made his eighth appearance in the comprehensive 49-7 victory over Georgia on Sunday 16 November 2014.

Adam was created by William J. Bell as the son of Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) and was introduced on April 24, 1995. Adam left town two years after his birth and was raised in Kansas by his mother, growing up without knowing that Victor is his father. In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult. After a year in the role, Engen announced his exit from The Young and the Restless because of objections over his storyline, and Michael Muhney was recast in the role. Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, saying he was unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney was fired from the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016. In May 2019, Mark Grossman took claim over the role, receiving his first credit as Adam on May 9. The character is known as an anti-hero, described as \\"one of the most devious characters on daytime\\" by The Advocate. He is notable for his relationships with Sharon Newman (Sharon Case)‚Äîa pairing regarded as \\"dark\\" by SoapNet‚Äîand Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan). Adam has a severely bad relationship with his father, who often does not accept him as part of his family. Muhney, Hartley and Grossman's performances in the role have been met with favorable reception from audiences and critics. Muhney was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Adam in 2013. Hartley received a nomination in that same category in 2016. Meanwhile, Grossman earned himself an Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category in 2020. Casting and creation Justin Hartley was cast in the role of Adam in 2014, and exited in 2016, when the character was presumed dead. Series creator William J. Bell created Victor Newman, Jr. in 1995 as part of a social issue storyline. The plot involved Hope Adams' decision to carry Victor's child to term despite the possibility that he could inherit his mother's blindness, which could manifest later in life. Adam was first portrayed in 1995 by infant actors, including twins Celeste and Coryn Williams, followed by Danielle and Sabrina Helper and then Spencer Klass. Hayden Tank played the role from December 1996 to August 1997, and returned for a guest appearance on June 26, 2002. In 2008, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged to an adult. Chris Engen assumed the role of Adam on February 21, 2008. In May 2009, it was announced that Engen was leaving the program and that Muhney had immediately been recast in the role. Muhney made his first appearance as Adam on June 25, 2009. In 2011, Muhney signed a contract that would keep him in the role for an unspecified period. In April 2013, Muhney announced that he had signed a new contract that would expire in June 2015. In December, however, Muhney announced that he had been abruptly let go from the soap opera, with his last airdate on January 30, 2014. In August, it was announced that Hartley had been cast as Adam, due to begin taping in September; he first aired on November 5, 2014. Upon the news of his casting, the actor told TV Guide: \\"I'm so pumped about joining Y&R; ‚Äî I watch it all the time and can't wait to get in there and get my hands dirty!\\" In 2016, it was announced that Hartley had been cast in a regular role on the NBC drama series This Is Us, which was picked up by the network, placing his future with The Young and the Restless into question. In September 2016, Hartley confirmed his exit from the soap opera on his Facebook page, thanking fans for their support as well as encouraging them to watch him on This Is Us. In March 2019, Daytime Confidential broke the news that actor Mark Grossman had been cast in the role. He received his first credit in the role on May 9, although his first appearance would be on May 13, 2019. Development=Characterization and portrayal Michael Muhney described Adam as a \\"puppeteer\\" with \\"survival instinct\\", but also someone with a conscience. Adam's off-screen background was established to reflect that of his father; the character was highly self-motivated, studying at college and beginning a career in finance. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Engen said, \\"Luckily, I'm not going to be compared to anyone else ... anything I do and anything I try to project, and [the] kind of ideas that I have to influence the character are okay\\". The actor stated his intent to portray Adam as a \\"rich, three-dimensional character with ambitions, flaws, and the positive qualities of his mother Hope\\". As the character's storyline progressed, he became \\"one of the most devious characters on daytime\\" as part of a Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, \\"I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [who portrayed Hope] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I thought it would be a dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark.\\" Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers \\"know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more ... drama.\\" The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming \\"irredeemable\\", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does \\"interesting and human\\". Muhney said in an interview that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, \\"What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television.\\" Muhney described the character as a \\"puppeteer\\" with \\"survival instinct\\", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: \\"You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, \\"If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam.\\" Relationships Adam's first romance was with Heather Stevens (Vail Bloom), which received viewer support. Engen said that he \\"thanked God\\" for that aspect of his storyline, that he felt Adam \\"genuinely loves\\" Heather and that she had been \\"the only light in this world of darkness that the character had lived in\\" since Engen started portraying the character. Adam has been involved with his brother's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case)a relationship which SoapNet described as \\"dark\\". Adam stole Sharon's newborn baby, Faith, and gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson)whom he caused to have a miscarriage and a phantom pregnancy. Despite knowing this and seeing Sharon grieve, Adam bonded with her out of guilt; however, they fell in love and married. Muhney told SoapNet that Adam \\"unequivocally loves her 100%\\", and said, \\"You can argue as much logic as you want about what Adam has done and what he is doing.\\" Sharon remained in love with Adam after his kidnapping of Faith was revealed. The soap's other characters, who viewed him as a criminal, were displeased with the romance. Case described Sharon's ability to forgive Adam as a \\"tough pill to swallow\\", and also compared it to Nick's love for Phylliswho had \\"blown people up and ran people over\\". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described Adam and Sharon's relationship as \\"inappropriate\\" yet \\"red-hot\\". Several of Sharon's friends, including her ex-husband Jack, disowned her because of the relationship. After Sharon's conviction for the murder of Adam's ex-wife Skye, she escaped after being sentenced to life imprisonment. During this storyline, Case still supported the coupledubbed \\"Shadam\\" by viewerssaying that the pairing \\"took us all by surprise\\". Case also said, \\"That is what I was referring to with this storyline because of the pace and the vitality that \\"Shadam\\" has.\\" While on the run, Sharon slept with a man named Sam when Adam thought she was dead. Feeling betrayed, Adam tricked her into a jailhouse wedding where he abandoned her, leaving Sharon heartbroken and angry. NicholasSharon's first husband and Adam's brotherlater forced Sharon to get a restraining order against Adam. The night before it became active, she spent the night with Adam, who vowed to fight the order, refusing to give Sharon up. Jae' Jones from Yahoo! said that Sharon's actions \\"always\\" lead her back to Adam. Adam was attacked by Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk), and his impaired vision returned. Sharon looked after Adam and even returned him to his mother's farm in Kansas where they reconnected. Adam proposed to her and they returned to Genoa City. However, Sharon ended their relationship shortly after learning of Adam's role in freeing Pattywho went on to wreak havoc and hurt loved onesfrom a psychiatric hospital two years earlier. Although Sharon knew Adam had changed, she refused to bet anything on him. Despite Adam's marriage to Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), he helped Sharon after she had a mental breakdown and burned down the Newman ranch. Case said that Sharon's relationship with Nick \\"held more weight\\", and that Sharon and Adam is \\"just as deep\\". Adam had an arsonist set fire to another building to avoid Sharon being implicated for the fire at the ranch. The arsonist burned down a restaurant owned by Chelsea's father. Chelsea became insecure and bitter towards Sharon, and was enraged at Adam for breaking the law to save Sharon. Chelsea warned Sharon to stay away from Adam; Sharon told her that Adam would never love Chelsea the way he loves her. Luke Kerr of Zap2It said that Chelsea was \\"out of her league\\" and the storyline was \\"fun\\". Egan said: \\"I love working with Michael Muhney. I heard about him because my mom had watched Y&R; before I joined. So when I told her my character was going to be mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'\\". Egan said that her mother \\"told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun.\\" She said that \\"everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry\\" and that \\"it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the \\"bad guys\\" in town.\\" Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up. Controversial plot twist and recast When news broke of Engen's exit from the show, reporters speculated that he had quit because of personal objections over an upcoming same-sex relationship between Adam and Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). Commentatorsincluding celebrity blogger Perez Hilton who wrote \\"homophobe\\" on an image of the actorcriticized Engen. In an interview with TV Guide Canada, former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell stated that while she would not comment on Engen's decision, she was \\"saddened that they had to recast because Engen was really gelling in the role\\", but added that she had \\"no doubt\\" that Muhney would make Adam his own. In another interview, Eileen Davidson, who portrayed Ashley Abbott, said that she \\"couldn't judge\\" Engen's decision since it was a \\"personal one\\". Davidson said, \\"Everybody has his or her own demonsand makes their own choices due to their creative process.\\" In other interviews, Eric Braeden, who portrays Adam's father Victor Newman, stated his disappointment with Engen's departure, and told Soap Opera Digest that he unsuccessfully tried to convince the actor to stay with the soap opera. Braeden stated, \\"He was somewhat disturbed by the fact that he was playing this evil character. I said, 'Listen, I remember Victor feeding rats to people.' I told him to embrace it because he had the most riveting storyline around, period.\\" In another interview with Soaps In Depth, Braeden said that he too was \\"saddened by the fact that he left\\", saying it was a \\"hell of a role\\". Braeden also said, \\"Whatever personal reasons he has, you've got to respect that. But he was a very nice guy, very professional. We all liked working with him. We were shocked when he decided to leave, but that's his personal decision.\\" After the controversy surrounding his departure from the show, Engen posted a message on his Myspace page stating he had been unhappy with Adam's storyline long before the homosexual plot twist had emerged. Muhney's exit and controversial allegations After the sudden announcement that Muhney had been fired from the role in December 2013, viewers and critics alike expressed their disappointment in the decision. Michael Ausiello of TVLine wrote that the news was the \\"worst Christmas present ever\\", as well as Jamey Giddens of Zap2it writing: \\"Outspoken and insanely-gifted, Michael Muhney has definitely shaken things up in daytime since joining The Young and the Restless. Whether he was demanding changes in the Daytime Emmy nomination process, or getting into fights with his TV pappy on Twitter, one thing was for certain ‚Äî Muhney always brought it on screen as bad seed Adam Newman. Well, not anymore.\\" Immediately after the news of his firing, Muhney conducted an interview with the Huffington Post and stated: \\"Part of me feels this is because I've always been outspoken, and sometimes I've been too outspoken. Sometimes I've walked around with a big backpack full of hubris. That is entirely on me. CBS, Sony, and Jill Phelps are not to blame for that.\\" Muhney also said that the writers were planning to \\"take a break from Adam for 3 to 6 months\\" and then recast the role. In January 2014, however, celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that according to multiple sources that the reason Muhney was allegedly let go from the soap was because Muhney had sexually harassed co-star Hunter King (who portrays Summer Newman). The site wrote: \\"38-year-old Muhney allegedly bullied and harassed 20-year-old Hunter King, who plays Summer on the show. She went to higher-ups and complained recently Muhney had fondled her breasts on 2 occasions ‚Äî and she said both were unsolicited and unwanted.\\" The rumor generated significant negative publicity for the soap opera; Margaret Eby of the New York Daily News wrote, \\"The set of \\"The Young and the Restless\\" may have turned into a real life soap opera thanks to star Michael Muhney, who was allegedly fired for groping one of his co-workers.\\" Fox News reported that several viewers were upset by Muhney's firing and the sexual harassment allegations, writing: \\"Many Y&R; fans were none too pleased to find out Muhney was leaving, and several blasted the allegations.\\" TMZ later reported that angered viewers had paid US$785 to have an airplane fly over CBS Studios in Los Angeles with a banner to have Muhney rehired, and the plane flew three days later. Muhney made his final appearance on January 30, 2014. In August 2014, Muhney claimed on his Twitter page that the allegations were indeed false and it was only a salacious rumor. Storylines Hope gives birth to Victor Adam Newman, Jr. in 1995, and soon after she and Victor divorce, prompting Hope to move to Kansas with Victor Jr. He was raised believing Cliff Wilson was his father until June 2002, when Victor visited Kansas to see Victor Jr. Six years later in February 2008, Hope tells Victor that she is dying from pancreatic cancer, and tells their sonknown as \\"Vic\\"that Victor is his father. A Harvard Business School graduate, Vic is resentful of Victor for abandoning his own child. He later agrees to move to Genoa City with Victor and work at his company, Newman Enterprises, but still refuses to build a relationship with his father. Vic then begins using the name Adam Newman, and is resented by Victor‚Äôs other children Victoria and Nicholas Newman (Amelia Heinle and Joshua Morrow) for splitting up their parents during Victor and Hope‚Äôs marriage. Victor's girlfriend Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine) urges him to mend his relationships with his children. Adam then begins dating Heather Stevens (Vail Bloom), and Victor‚Äôs dislike of her causes their romance to become secretive. When Victor is presumed dead while in Mexico searching for the men responsible for Sabrina‚Äôs death, Adam takes over at Newman Enterprises, fires his siblings and instates Victor‚Äôs nemesis Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). Adam's family are powerless to stop him after they discover Victor left most of his possessions to Adam in his will. Adam plots to frame Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) for murder, but when Victor appears alive, Jack reverses the plot and Adam is framed for murder, resulting in his imprisonment. Heather begins to notice Adam‚Äôs failing eyesight; he may have inherited his mother‚Äôs blindness. After Adam is brutally beaten by an inmate, Victor has the charges against his son dropped. In 2009, Adam becomes friends with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who continuously hears a baby crying and finds things supposedly left for her by Sabrina, who is dead. The housekeeper Estella Munoz (Anne Betancourt) is blamed and arrested; however, Adam was secretly gaslighting Ashley. Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, causing her to miscarry her child, whose father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, Charles Taylor, into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity. Heather discovers Adam's affair with Rafe and ends her relationship with Adam. Ashley is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a pregnant Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) is also staying. Sharon goes into labor and Adam steals her daughter, Faith, and passes her off as Ashley‚Äôs child. Sharon believes her child had died, and guilt-ridden, Adam pursues a relationship with Sharon and they elope, but she leaves him when she remembers elements that contradict her losing her child. A note from a dying Charles Taylor saying that Ashley had miscarried and Faith is really Sharon and Nicholas‚Äô daughter is found. Adam is jailed again but gets the insane Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to help him escape to attend a masquerade ball, where he unsuccessfully begs Sharon for forgiveness. An explosion at the ball occurs and a burned corpse is positively identified as Adam. Nicholas is arrested for Adam's murder. The corpse is actually that of Richard Hightower, to whom Adam had donated bone marrow and carries Adam's DNA. Adam meets up with Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone) and they plot a confidence trick together, but Adam still dreams of Sharon. Adam and Skye, now married, return to Genoa City to testify on Nicholas‚Äô behalf, but Adam fakes a mental breakdown and is sent to the psychiatric hospital where Patty is being treated. She recollects the night of Hightower‚Äôs death to the district attorney, but Adam confuses her, leads her out of the hospital, gives her a new identity and tells her never to return. Adam and Sharon reunite in New Orleans, just before he faces charges for murdering Skye. Sharon travels to Hawaii to prove Skye is alive, but Skye falls to her death in a volcano and Sharon is arrested for her murder. Adam helps Sharon to escape from prison and flee the state, and she is presumed dead when her burned-out car is found. Sharon is actually carjacked and the carjacker died in the fire. Adam is devastated and still looks for proof that Sharon did not kill Skye. He eventually finds proof but when he discovers that Sharon had been living with a veterinarian in New Mexico, he disposes of the evidence in a river in July 2011. Adam then plots with Diane Jenkins (Maura West) to make Victor suffer, almost framing him for Diane‚Äôs murder. However, when Diane's murdered body is found, a six-month investigation ensues with Adam as an initial suspect. Adam again takes over at Newman Enterprises when Victor falsely confesses to the murder and later reunites with Sharon, but she leaves him again when his scheme against Patty is revealed. Adam later befriends Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) and they begin dating in April 2012, later eloping to Kansas where Sharon tries to stop the wedding. Chelsea becomes pregnant but miscarries in a car accident with Summer Newman (Hunter King). Adam takes in Sharon, who is mentally unstable, and gets her the help she needs; Chelsea disapproves. After he is reinstated as chief executive officer at Newman Enterprises and shares a kiss with Sharon, Adam promises Chelsea they can move to Paris, but when he cannot leave the company they decide to divorce. While trying to save Victor, Adam is shot at Victor's wedding in March 2013, and they mend their relationship by working together at Newman Enterprises. Chelsea discovers she is pregnant again, but tells Adam the child was fathered by Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). After Adam finds out Connor is his son, he plans to go for full custody and plans to cut Chelsea out of Connor's life, believing she is an unfit mother. Victor and Adam's partnership at the company ends months later when it is revealed that Adam's silent partner in taking Newman Enterprises private again was Jack. When Victor announces Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) left her company, Chancellor Industries, to him in her will, Adam leaves him all of his shares in the company and resigns. Shortly after, Adam suspects he may have struck Delia Abbott (Sophie Pollono) with his car while driving on a dark road. After Delia dies in the accident, investigations begin to find the driver, leaving Adam guilt-ridden. Chelsea moves in with him to help take care of Connor, and they eventually reunite. After not telling anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the investigation is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit- and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in as long as he can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) put the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death. In November 2014, Adam is revealed to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, and is in the care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it is revealed that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham, the man who died saving Adam's life. When Adam returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows but none of them recognize Adam or they get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance Bingham. However, they would later divorce in April 2015. He later reconnects with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their lives back together with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. Upon leaving the courthouse, he was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine later found the car at a nearby motel. The car turned out to be a rental and it was revealed that Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) was behind the attack after Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart) found a surveillance picture that showed Chloe behind the wheel. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery and expressed no ill will towards Chloe. In August 2016, Chloe returned to Genoa City again to frame Adam for poisoning Constance Bingham. When Adam found the evidence to clear his name, it disappeared and winds up in prison. Victor later helped Adam escape and planned to help Adam leave the country with Chelsea and Connor. Both Adam and Chelsea escape with Connor to a cabin. Connor, at the time, was sick so Chelsea called Nick to help her get medication for Connor in town while Adam stayed at the cabin, seen as he was wanted and Chelsea didn't want him risked getting arrested. After Nick and Chelsea, Chloe appeared at the cabin and shot Adam with a tranquilizer gun. She then revealed that she had never forgiven him for Delia‚Äôs death and that she wanted him to suffer the same fate Delia did. When Chelsea returned with Nick, the cabin exploded and Adam was presumed dead as DNA evidence indicated that he was inside at the time. In April 2019, Victor met with a mysterious man in Las Vegas. Nikki becomes suspicious and wants to find out what Victor was hiding so she hires Rey Rosales (Jordi Vilasuso) to track him down. Sharon later joins Rey on his investigation and they both leave for Las Vegas. Later, Victor catches onto them and makes a surprise visit to their hotel room, where he revealed to Sharon that Adam is confirmed alive and survived the explosion at the cabin. He also said Adam has amnesia and has no memory prior to the explosion. He asked Sharon to meet with Adam to help him regain his memory and gave her Adam's phone number. Sharon later meets with Adam at an apartment after he texted her the location. The two talk about their past and how they were connected. Sharon then convinces Adam to return to Genoa City to see if his brain will trigger any memories, in which he agrees. Soon after Adam returns to town, he is shot by an unknown assailant, traumatizing him enough to gain his memories back. After recovering from surgery, he hires a private investigator to track down Chloe Mitchell, who he affirms shot him. Adam later finds out that Chelsea got re-married and that her new husband adopted Connor. Devastated by this news, he tries to get custody of his other son, Christian, who is fathered by Nick. Reception Soaps In Depth reported that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, as did the character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, \\"To think there was any likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans ... they've been so supportive.\\" The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, \\" ... he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: he looks like he regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris informed me he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain.\\" Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, \\"[t]he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned.\\" Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with \\"sardonic humor\\". Soap Opera Digest named Engen \\"performer of the week\\" for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor \\"gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind\\". The story of Adam causing Ashley's miscarriage was named \\"editor's choice\\" by the magazine. Engen was nominated for a SoapCentral Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. Some fans were upset that Adam and Rafe's \\"sex scene\\" was implied rather than shown onscreen; Branco spoke out about the issue, saying, \\"[f]ilming a sex scene between a straight and gay man could come off as offensive. Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc.\\" Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, \\"[f]or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened. You can create that in your head and try to interpret it by how the characters reacted afterwards.\\" Muhney's performance in the role, has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered him his first nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2013. Branco referred to him \\"as the most-talked-about recast in Y&R; history\\" and praised his debut performance on the show. Denette Wilford of TV Guide Canada also complimented the actor's portrayal of Adam, saying, \\"[v]iewers aren't supposed to empathize with him, but his portrayer managed to make it happena testament to Muhney.\\" Michael Jensen of AfterElton.com wrote that viewers enjoyed the character as portrayed by Muhney. The actor said he received both positive and negative reviews from online fans. Paulette Cohn of About.com wrote that Adam was one of \\"daytime's best villains\\". Muhney's onscreen romance with Chelsea has received praise; Zap2it placed them at number three on their \\"Top 10 Soap Opera Couples of 2012\\" list. Writing for Music Times, Cate Meighan observed that Muhney's performance kept \\"longtime fans glued to their television\\", noting that ratings dropped following his exit. Upon Grossman's casting in 2019, many discussed his noticeably younger appearance compared to his predecessors. Soaps.com editor Lori Wilson discussed this at length, suggesting that Grossman's casting brings the character back to his initial age-range, stating: \\"Recasting with a noticeably younger actor is a curious choice, but character-wise, a 32-year-old Adam is closer to the character‚Äôs real age than the other previous incarnations.\\" The following year, the website cited Grossman's casting as one of the all-time best recasts on a soap opera.

When it was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, the district encompassed the town green and 17 buildings that faced it, at the junction of Russell Street (Massachusetts Route 9) and Middle Street (Massachusetts Route 47). The district was expanded significantly in 1994, adding more than 400 buildings representative of the village's growth from colonial days into the first decades of the 20th century. This expansion encompasses the entirety of a tongue of land extending west from East Street and bounded by a bend in the Connecticut River, which separates Hadley from Northampton. Its oldest property, the Samuel Porter House on West Street, was built in 1713. Hadley was settled in 1659 and incorporated as a town in 1661. The land use patterns laid out at that time are still evident in the area surrounding the town center. The agricultural areas of the tongue of land in the Connecticut River floodplain were laid out in narrow strips, generally oriented north-south, which still dominate land ownership and usage patterns. Its major roads, including Russell, East, Middle, and West Streets, were laid out around this time, and were where houses and civic institutions were built. Bay Road, formerly a Native American trail, was the major road heading east from the river. The town grew slowly until the early 19th century, when it was joined to Northampton by a bridge over the Connecticut River. It remained agricultural, with a few cottage industries, with tobacco a major 19th-century crop before market gardens came to dominate in the early 20th century. The town center's architecture is reflective of its slow growth, with instances of architectural styles spanning more than three centuries.

The area, first laid out in 1661, is bounded by Maple Street to the south, the Connecticut River to the east, Day Avenue and School Street to the north, and the Mill River to the west. The area's layout and land use patterns are relatively little altered since they were laid out, leaving a well-preserved early colonial village landscape. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history Hatfield's town center is basically linear, running north-south on Main Street, which is separated from the Connecticut River by agricultural fields. The district abuts the Elm Street and the Mill-Prospect Street Historic Districts to the west. Main Street is characterized by well-spaced residential lots containing homes built in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the civic heart of the town, where the town hall, Center School, and Memorial Hall are located. The lot arrangement, with houses built close to the street, was in part a deliberately defensive plan, which was in the colonial period surrounded by a fortified palisade against attacks from Native Americans. Although most of the buildings are now of later construction, the plan is still evident. The oldest buildings in the district were built about 1740. These two houses, at 30 School Street and 72 Main Street, are typical Georgian 2-1/2 story wood frame structures with gabled roofs and five-bay facades. Most of the houses in the district were built before 1830, and are either Georgian or Federal in their style. As the village grew in the 19th century, houses in other styles were either filled in or extended to the edges of the village. Most of the villages civic and religious buildings were built after 1870; the notable exception is the Congregational church, which is Greek Revival and style and was built in 1849.

It includes properties on Main and High Streets, and Kingsley Avenue. Its most prominent feature is the former Haydenville Manufacturing Company premises, built in 1875 after a flood washed away the previous factory in 1874. This building located on Main Street (Massachusetts Route 9), is now known as the Brass Works, and features elaborate Italianate and Victorian styling. Overlooking the factory across Main Street are two high-style Greek Revival houses, each with four-column Greek temple porticos, built for the brothers Joel and Josiah Hayden, for whose family the village is named. The Haydens were the primary civic and economic force in the village. David and Daniel Hayden, uncles to Joel and Josiah, first entered into business here in 1808, manufacturing power looms and a variety of small metal objects. The latter came to dominate their business under Joel and Josiah, who established a business that survived until 1950. The Hayden family's influence in the village is visible in the 1852 Haydenville Congregational Church, and the 1900 library, both built with family funds, and in the row of high-quality worker housing lining High Street. The Haydenville Cemetery, also located on High Street, was established by the brothers in 1847 after their father died, and is where the family plot is located.

It was part of the European formation known as Canadian Forces Europe. The formation served as the main forward deployed land element of Canada's armed forces, and was stationed in West Germany from 1957 until it was disbanded in 1993. In 1951, 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade arrived in Europe, to be succeeded by the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade in 1953, then 2 CIBG in 1955, then 4 CIBG in 1957. In 1959, when 4 CIBG's tour was due to end, a change was made in the reinforcement policy for Germany. Instead of whole brigades rotating every two years, the decision was made to keep 4 CIBG and its associated brigade units in place, instead rotating the major combat elements to Germany every three years. The presence of the three mechanized infantry battalions led Canada's brigade in Germany to be renamed as 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group on 1 May 1968, three months after Canada's three separate armed forces were unified into the single Canadian Forces. Around the same time, a review of Canada's foreign policy was announced by the Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, part of which involved an investigation into the role of 4 CMBG, which was the Canadian military's main overseas force.

The district includes much of the area in Hadley west of Mount Holyoke and east of the river. Its formal boundaries run from Hockanum Cemetery in the southwest, following the river and the summit ridge of Mount Holyoke to the northeast corner of J.A. Skinner State Park. It includes the summit area of Mount Holyoke, including the Summit House, Halfway House, and other historic structures within the park, along with the agricultural lands of the valley below. The views of the Connecticut River valley from Mount Holyoke were popularized in the early 19th century by the writing of Timothy Dwight, a Northampton native and president of Yale College. The summit area was a tourist destination, and artists such as Thomas Cole immortalized the views in art. In the late 19th century tourism waned, but saw a brief resurgence in the 1910s and 1920s due to the activities of Joseph Skinner, a local industrialist and philanthropist. He purchased and rehabilitated the mountaintop facilities and modernized the road to the summit. His success was brief, hurt by the Great Depression and the effects of the 1938 New England hurricane, which nearly destroyed the Summit House. He donated his holdings to the state to form the core of Skinner State Park. The agricultural lands in the valley have undergone only relatively modest changes, and farming continues to be a dominant activity in the area. Most of the structures in the valley are related to agricultural activities. There is no church, but the community has historically been focused around taverns that were in the area, and more recently around the Hockanum School, a small brick schoolhouse built c. 1853.

Most of the district was built up between the middle 19th and middle 20th centuries. The area was home to several textile mills, powered by the Westfield River, but none of which have survived. Most of the district's contributing properties are therefore residential, commercial, and civic, and represent a diversity of architectural styles predominantly from the mid to late 19th century. The district includes properties along the two main roads, as well as Upper Russell, Basket, Laurel, Pleasant, and Park Streets. Of particular architectural note are a concentration of Greek Revival houses characterized by their temple fronts, found in the western part of the village, and Stanton Hall, a fine Italianate structure built as a church, but now owned by the town.

Colloquially known as Millionaire's Row, the district extends along Lincoln and Sunset Avenues between Northampton Street (Massachusetts Route 9) and the campus of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This area was one of Amherst's first planned residential subdivisions, and features a large number of high-quality houses, built by merchants, businessmen, and academics. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The town of Amherst was incorporated in 1768, having historically been part of Hadley. The town grew in the 19th century on the basis of a number of local industries, and the growth of both Amherst College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Residential development west of the town center was initially concentrated on Amity Street, then the main road to Hadley, and it is where this district's oldest house, the c. 1751 Solomon Boltwood House, is located. Land south of Amity Street in the area was donated to Amherst College, which remained in agricultural use for the first half of the 19th century. Industry arose east of the town center, where the railroad had been routed, so the west side developed as a fashionable area for the well-to-do business owners, merchants to avoid the odors and density associated with industry. Lincoln Street was formally accepted by the town in 1873, and much of it was platted into house lots by the local partnership of Stockbridge, Westcott & Westcott in 1882. Deeds issued when they sold house lots required minimum building costs and conformity to adjacent properties. The district is located two blocks west of downtown Amherst, from which it is separated by the Prospect-Gaylord Historic District, a residential district of mainly 19th century houses. It extends along Lincoln Avenue roughly from Fearing Street to Route 9, which it ends just short of. Also included in the district are houses on Sunset Avenue between Amity and Elm Streets. The area is characterized by houses built mostly between 1870 and 1930, although there are some mid-19th century structures, and some that date to the 1950s. There is a uniformity of scale and landscaping, which was partly imposed by developers who subdivided the area in the late 19th century. The roads are arched over by mature trees, and the houses are set on generous lots with large lawns. Most buildings are 2-1/2 stories in height and of wood frame construction. The single styles that appear most frequently are the Queen Anne Victorian and the Colonial Revival.

The district is located about south of Southampton Center along College Highway (Massachusetts Route 10), in the area where the road crosses the Manhan River. The river in this area provided a drop in elevation that was used to provide power for a modest mill complex, which operated from the 1830s until about 1900. The district includes the house of the first documented mill family, the Ichabod Strong House (c. 1786), the Lyman Mill (established c. 1854), Lyman Pond and the dam that impounds it (built in 1838 after a flood washed out the previous dam). The area also includes a sheet metal factory established by the Lyman family in 1894. This business became more prominent after the mills were forced to close due to a loss of water power after the city of Holyoke began drawing water from the river. There is also a remnant of the c. 1835 New Haven and Northampton Canal, which traversed three locks in the area, giving it its name. Other features associated with the canal include a former hotel building, a storehouse (both now private residences), and the remains of one of the locks. The areas around Lyman Pond are thought to include industrial archeological remnants from mills that may have been established as early as 1732.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The district runs along Prospect Street, a north-south road that roughly bisects Hatfield, from its southern end at Elm Street to a point north of its junction with Chestnut Street, and includes properties on adjacent roadways. The central focus of the district is the Mill River which meanders from west to east across the district's middle. At the Prospect Street crossing is a cluster of former late 19th century industrial buildings, some of which comprise the Old Mill Site Historic District, listed in 1982.  History  The area was first settled by English colonists in the 17th century, and it is known that a gristmill stood in the area near the Prospect Street crossing of the river in 1661. Water powered industry operated in that area from then until the 1970s. The rest of the district was agricultural, and the early millworks have not survived. Interest in the area picked up in the early decades of the 19th century; there were houses depicted on a 1794 survey, but none survive. Bridge Street, built by 1830, running west from the mill area, brought increased traffic and development. In 1830 the area was also used in the first formal geographical survey of the state: one end of the Borden Base Line is located in the district demarcated by a buried marker off Bridge Street. The district's height of growth came in the second half of the 19th century. A significant number of homes lining Prospect Street are in styles typical of the period, and it is when the surviving industrial properties, the Shattuck Gun Factory (now the Old Mill Inn) being the most notable.

Built in the first decade of the 20th century, it served as a retreat for Christian missionaries to foreign countries during periods of furlough in the United States, and as a training facility for future missionaries. The camp was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The camp closed in 1970, and in 1987 the complex was converted to condominiums. Description and history Mountain Rest is located in the northwest part of Goshen, a rural community in the central eastern Berkshires. It is a cluster of buildings on Wildwood Road, formerly the camp's access road, north of Massachusetts Route 9 off Spruce Corner Road. The camp has seven buildings, all of wood frame construction, organized around the drive, which ends in a loop around which most of the buildings are arranged. The largest of the buildings is Scudder Hall, a two-story building constructed in 1902 as a dormitory, which served as the focal point of the community. The most architecturally sophisticated is Avery Cottage, a four-story multi-gabled structure with Victorian stylistic elements. left The camp was established in 1902 by Dr. George Dowkontt, a leading missionary physician and founder of the New York Medical Missionary Society. It was established on land donated by Alvan Barrus, a state senator. The purpose of the camp was to provide a retreat for missionaries and their families while in between assignments, and to provide for the exchange of formal and practical knowledge associated with missionary activities. Notable attendees of the camp included Dr. William Wanless and Dr. Ida Scudder, for whom Scudder Hall was named. Ronald and Lillian Brook, Presbyterian fraternal workers to Cameroon, West Africa, also brought their family to Mountain Rest during furloughs (1950s-60s). Their children were Kathleen, Norma, Larry, Bill, Paul, Sarah, and Joy. Early in 2000 Kathleen and her husband Bill Kelly \\"found\\" Mountain Rest after asking a local fireman where it might be. In 2008 Larry and his wife Juanita and daughter Joanna visited and discovered that all of the missionary facilities and been turned into private housing.

It is a well-preserved example of a traditional farming village, centered at the five-way junction of Meadow, Pine, and North Pleasant Streets, and Sunderland and Montague Roads. The area developed as a village center in the early 19th century, and has been relatively little-changed since the late 19th century. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The crossroads at the center of North Amherst took shape in the mid-18th century, when the area was still part of Hadley. The area had been surveyed in 1739, with land divisions for farming resulting in its creation. A grist mill was located on the Mill River a short way north of the center. By the early 19th century there was a small cluster of buildings around the junction, and by 1833 there were a church, school, and tavern, as well as parsonage and doctor's residence. The area remained predominantly agricultural; small-scale industrial activity took place on the river, but did not last. The most significant late addition to the village streetscape was the 1893 Romanesque library. The historic district radiates a short way away from the central five-way intersection a short way along each roadway. It extends furthest to the east on Pine Street and the south on North Pleasant Street, where it extends roughly five properties. Most of the residential buildings are of wood frame construction, and were built before about 1850, although there are a number of later instances. Prominent public buildings include the 1826 North Amherst Congregational Church, the 1893 North Amherst Library, and the c. 1845 North Amherst Hall, which has seen a number of uses, including as a school and as a performance and lecture venue.

One of the rural community's early settlement nodes, it thrived into the early 19th century around a stagecoach tavern, a few small mills, and farming, and retains buildings and archaeological remains representative of this history. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history Most of the properties in the district are strung in a widely spaced rural manner along East River Road, extending from a home and former factory site in the north to a village core with church and cemetery in the south. A few unbuilt parcels of land on Smith and North Chester Roads also contribute to the district, as did the Howe truss iron bridge that carries Smith Road across the middle branch of the Westfield River until its replacement in 2009. In addition to a variety of primarily 19th century residential and agricultural buildings, the district also includes a number of industrial archeological sites, based on the area's history of water-powered mill development. Chester was settled in the 1760s, with early settlers of the North Chester area including members of the Elder, Smith, and Mann families. One of the most substantial buildings, known as the Cushman Tavern, stands at the junction of East River, North Chester, and Smith Roads; it was built by Thomas Elder about 1773, and served stagecoach travelers on the River Road, which was the preferred route between Springfield and Pittsfield. A short way north of the Smith Road bridge are the remains of a breached dam, where the first sawmill and gristmill stood, built by John Stevens. Later small industry was supported by dams further up and down the river, but these faded in importance after Chester Factory was served by the railroad, and came to dominate the town in industry.

It consists of a small cluster of buildings along West Street (United States Route 5) and Depot Road in the vicinity of a former railroad station. It includes a few buildings associated with the railroad, including a depot and freight buildings, as well as commercial and residential structures, most of which postdate the 1848 arrival of the railroad. The village was important in the community as an arrival point for immigrants working in its fields and industry. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history Hatfield was settled in the 17th century and incorporated in 1670. The North Hatfield area was basically undeveloped land for sometime, seeing some agricultural development in the 18th century. The area saw an increase in population beginning in the 1850s, when the railroad was built through the area, and a stop was placed at what is now called Depot Road. Construction of the railroad brought an influx of Irish and French Canadian immigrants, who worked on the railroad and in some cases remained to settle the area. North Hatfield also thrived as a small village center based on the transshipment of agricultural goods from farmers across northern Hatfield to market, and by the delivery of goods such as coal to them. A number of small industries were developed, powered by the Mill River. The village survived the decline of the railroads and the rise of the road system, with United States Route 5 continuing to serve as a major transportation route. Area farmers and village suffered during the Great Depression, from which the village never really recovered. The historic district covers , centered on the junctions of US 5 with Depot Road and North Hatfield Street. Most of the architecture in the village is vernacular wood frame residential construction, built on a modest scale.

He played hurling with his local club Newport and with the Tipperary and Galway senior inter- county teams in the 1970s. Early life S√©amus Shinnors was born in Newport, County Tipperary in 1945. He was educated at the local national school and later attended Limerick CBS. Here his hurling skills first came to prominence. Shinnors won a Harty Cup medal with the school in 1964. Playing career=Club Shinnors played his club hurling with his local club in Newport, however, he never won a senior county title. After moving to County Galway he later played hurling with Ballinasloe. Inter-county Shinnors first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Tipperary under-21 hurling team in the 1960s. He was a substitute goalkeeper on the team in the inaugural year of the competition in 1964, however, by 1965 Shinnors was the first choice net minder. He won a Munster title in that grade that year before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. Wexford provided the opposition on that occasion and triumphed by 3-7 to 1-4. Tipp lost their under-21 provincial title in 1966. Shortly afterwards Shinnors joined the Tipperary senior hurling team. He was the sub goalkeeper to John O‚ÄôDonoghue in 1967 and 1968 as Tipp reached the All-Ireland final in both years. They lost both games to Kilkenny and Wexford respectively; however, in 1970 O‚ÄôDonoghue retired from inter- county hurling. It looked likely that Shinnors would now become the number one goalkeeper on the team, however, before the start of the 1971 championship he was unceremoniously cut from the panel of players. In 1974 Shinnors was back with the Tipp senior team and he was finally installed as the first choice goalkeeper. He remained between the posts until 1976, however, during those three seasons Tipperary failed to win a single championship game. After the final defeat in 1976 Shinnors retired from the Tipp panel. To many it seemed as if Shinnors‚Äôs playing days were over. Two years later in 1978, however, he was drafted onto the Galway senior panel by his old under-21 teammate Michael ‚ÄòBabs‚Äô Keating. He trained in secret until May 1979. Shinnors‚Äôs first outing with Galway was an All-Ireland quarter-final meeting with Laois. While Galway were expected to win the game easily they struggled in patches but still won by 1-23 to 3-10. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Cork providing the opposition. Cork had been the reigning champions for the previous three years and were two games away from capturing a record-equaling four in-a-row. In an exciting game Shinnors made some excellent saves and contributed to Galway‚Äôs 2-14 to 1-13 victory over one of the greatest teams of all-time. The subsequent championship decider saw Galway take on Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of recent decades Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A ‚Äô70 by Liam 'Chunky' O‚ÄôBrien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however. They failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day as Kilkenny went on to win by 2-12 to 1-8. This defeat shook Shinnors‚Äôs confidence; however, he remained on the panel for the National Hurling League in late 1979 and early 1980. He assumed that he would be lining out in the championship, however, a few weeks before Galway‚Äôs first outing Shinnors receive a letter explaining that he had been dropped from the panel. It was the end of his inter-county career. Even more heartbreaking for Shinnors was the fact that Galway went on to win the All-Ireland that year, their first title in fifty-seven years. Provincial Shinnors also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1980 as Connacht defeat Munster. It was Connacht‚Äôs second Railway Cup title and their first in thirty-three years.

The district, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, includes three other elements: an 1891 Warren pony truss bridge across the Mill River, now closed to traffic, and a machine shop and garage (located across the river from the mill), both built in 1886. The district was also included in the larger Mill-Prospect Street Historic District in 2002. The mill site has a history of industrial use since 1661, when Thomas Meekins was granted water rights on the falls, and established a grist mill. He eventually also built a sawmill. Additional mills were built in the early 19th century, including a sawmill which spanned the river. This site was one of Hatfield's major industrial employers in the 19th century. In 1865, the complex was adapted for the production of guns, first by Henry Porter and later by Charles Shattuck. Most of the existing buildings were destroyed in a fire, and Shattuck built the existing mill building in 1881. The main mill building is a three-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is seventeen bays long and six wide, and is capped by a cupola with a pagoda-shaped roof.

Now owned by Historic Northampton, the property includes three houses built between 1730 and 1830. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description The core of the Nathaniel Parsons House, 58 Bridge Street, was built c. 1719, and still exhibits characteristics of First Period construction. The building was extensively modified and added on during the Federal period between 1795 and 1815, and wings were added between 1815 and 1830. Modifications thereafter were comparatively modest. The Shepherd House, 66 Bridge Street, was built in 1795, and remains a fine example of Federalist architecture with later stylistic modifications. It received Greek Revival detailing when that style was fashionable in the mid-19th century, and a Colonial Revival porch c. 1900. The Isaac Damon House, 46 Bridge Street, was built c. 1813, and its main block is a typical five-bay two story Federalist. The building includes a series of additions on its rear, including one whose construction suggests it was originally attached to a different building. The house was acquired by Historic Northampton from the Damon family. History and significance Northampton was settled in the 17th century, and was by the late 18th century a major regional center in the Connecticut River valley. These three houses stand near the junction of Main and Bridge Street, on some of the earliest plots laid out. The Parsons House stands on land granted in 1654 to Cornet Joseph Parsons, who oversaw the early growth of the town on behalf of John Pynchon. The Damon House was built by Isaac Damon, one of the area's most important proponents of the Federal style of architecture; his influence, and that of Asher Benjamin, had a major influence on the architecture of the area and the time.

It also includes the 1843 Greek Revival Congregational church, and the town's first cemetery, founded in 1739. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The land which became Pelham was acquired by the Lisburn Proprietors, Scotch-Irish emigrants, in 1738. The next year, a lot of was laid out for a meeting house, town pound, training field, and cemetery. The meeting house (now the town hall) was built on this parcel in 1743. Initially used for both religious and civic purposes, its religious function ended after the state mandated the separation of church and state in 1833. The Greek Revival church was built next door in 1839; it now houses the local historical society. The town center is historically significant as the last organized encampment site of rebel forces led by Daniel Shays during the Shays' Rebellion. The town hall is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a projecting central square vestibule. The church is a single-story frame structure, with its gabled roof oriented perpendicular to that of the town hall. It has corner pilasters, which rise to an entablature, and it is topped by a single-stage square belfry with octagonal spire.

Contributing properties include most of the houses on Prospect Street, which parallels Pleasant Street, as well as properties on Gaylord and Amity Streets running west from Prospect. These houses are generally in late Victorian styles such as Queen Anne, although some, for example a workman's house at 24 Gaylord Street, are in a more vernacular style. A central element of the district is the Hope Community Church, a historically African American church built in 1912 for a congregation whose history dates to 1869. Funds for its construction were raised in part through the efforts of W.E.B. Du Bois. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Amherst, settled in the 17th century, remained a scattered agricultural community until the early 19th century. At that time, the town center began to take on a more pronounced commercial character, and its importance in the town was cemented by the establishment of Amherst College in 1825. Prospect Street was laid out in 1824 between Amity Street (1703) and Northampton Street, the original main road to the Connecticut River. This area was built up with modest Greek Revival houses set on small lots, while North Prospect Street, north of Amity Street, was developed later, with larger lots and more typical Victorian styling. Gaylord Street was laid out as a private lane in the early 1880s, and was subsequently lined with Queen Anne and later styles of housing.

This area developed as a rural residential village hub in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The town of Amherst was settled as part of Hadley in the early 18th century, and was separately incorporated in 1759. The South Amherst Common, also known as Fiddlers Green, was formed out of a road junction created in 1760 by laying out the southern portion of what is now South East Street, the northern portion and Middle Street having been laid out in 1703. The first house known to be built facing what is now the common was built about 1742 by Nathaniel Coleman, and still stands at 1055 South East Street, at the south end of the common; a second 18th century house, the Jonathan Dickinson House, dates from around 1750 and faces the common from the southwest at 445 Shays Street. In 1788 the town reduced the rights of way for its roads, and sold off the excess land, but keeping the area that is now South Amherst Common. Over the next 150 years, the common became a local nexus for the surrounding rural community, with a school (first one built in 1764) and church (1825), and several cottage industries. Station Road was built extending eastward from the common in 1821, and Pomeroy Lane to its west in 1825. The area has remained rural with increasing suburbanization since then. The common today consists of a roughly triangular area bounded by South East Street on all sides. Shays Street, Pomeroy Lane and Middle Street terminate into South East Street at the southwest side of the common. This triangular area is further cut by cross roads into a total of five different areas. The common itself is a grassy area unadorned by monuments and dotted with trees. Facing the common are primarily residences of 19th-century wood-frame construction, with a few instances of 18th and 20th-century buildings. One brick residence, the Enos Dickinson House, which was built in 1825 and for a time housed a post office, stands at 324 Pomeroy Lane with its eastern side facing the common, and there are four non-contributing but sympathetically styled 1950s Capes that also face the common. Prominent non-residential buildings are the 1825 Congregational Church, the 1902 South Amherst School, and the 1930 Munson Memorial Library and Community Center.

The aim is to find a geometry where all forces are in equilibrium. In the past this was done by direct modelling, using hanging chains and weights (see Gaudi), or by using soap films, which have the property of adjusting to find a \\"minimal surface\\". The dynamic relaxation method is based on discretizing the continuum under consideration by lumping the mass at nodes and defining the relationship between nodes in terms of stiffness (see also the finite element method). The system oscillates about the equilibrium position under the influence of loads. An iterative process is followed by simulating a pseudo-dynamic process in time, with each iteration based on an update of the geometry,W J LEWIS, TENSION STRUCTURES: Form and behaviour, London, Telford, 2003 similar to Leapfrog integration and related to Velocity Verlet integration.

Return to step 3 until the structure is in static equilibrium Damping It is possible to make dynamic relaxation more computationally efficient (reducing the number of iterations) by using damping.W J LEWIS, TENSION STRUCTURES: Form and behaviour, London, Telford, 2003 There are two methods of damping: *Viscous damping, which assumes that connection between the nodes has a viscous force component. *Kinetic energy damping, where the coordinates at peak kinetic energy are calculated (the equilibrium position), then updates the geometry to this position and resets the velocity to zero. The advantage of viscous damping is that it represents the reality of a cable with viscous properties. Moreover, it is easy to realize because the speed is already computed. The kinetic energy damping is an artificial damping which is not a real effect, but offers a drastic reduction in the number of iterations required to find a solution. However, there is a computational penalty in that the kinetic energy and peak location must be calculated, after which the geometry has to be updated to this position.

The district extends from Fomer Road in the south, along High Street and College Highway (Massachusetts Route 10) to Maple Street, and includes a line of houses along East Street from College to Elm. This area is the historic heart of the town, being first laid out in the 1730s. The district includes, in addition to a number of 18th- and 19th-century residences, the town's only church, the town hall, and the old public library. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The area that is now Southampton was originally incorporated as part of Northampton 1654, but was not formally settled until 1730. It was separately incorporated in 1775. The plan for the town center was drawn in 1730, and has been relatively unchanged since then, with a broadly spaced grid of roads between College Highway and High Street. The town grew significantly after 1790, resulting in a range of high-quality Federal period residences, and the present Congregational Church, built in 1788 on or near the site of the town's first colonial meeting house. In addition to civic functions, the center served as the economic hub of the largely agrarian community. The town's economy suffered in the late 19th century, its agriculture from competition with larger midwestern farms, and its industry from the cooption of its waterways for use as public water supplies.

His sporting career began with SC DHfK Leipzig. He was the first German to win the amateur competition of the World Cycling Championships and the Peace Race. Between 1959 and 1990 Schur was a member of the Volkskammer, the East German parliament.  Life  \\"T√§ve\\" Schur (a shortening of Gustav) grew up near Magdeburg. He only took up cycling aged 19 and won the highest honors an amateur cyclist could reach. Schur won the East German championships 6 times in that period and won the GDR tour 4 times. In 1953 he had a great stake in East Germany winning the blue jersey of the best team at the Peace Race. His real breakthrough came in 1955, however, when he was the first East German to win the Peace Race, considered the most prestigious amateur stage race. Schur won the Peace Race once more in 1959. As a member of the United Team of Germany he won a bronze medal in the team time trial at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and a silver medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, at a time when the impact East Germany would have in later Olympic Games was not foreseen yet. Between 1955 and 1963 Schur studied at the DHfK Leipzig and finished with a diploma as coach. In late 1950s Schur was at the height of his form, as proven by his two wins at the amateur road race at the road world championships in 1958 and 1959, he was the first amateur to defend his title. Schur reached the summit of his popularity by not winning, however: At the 1960 UCI Road World Championships that took place at the Sachsenring, Schur was favorite to defend his title again, but instead he let his teammate Bernhard Eckstein pass who eventually won the race. This selfless gesture capped Schur's myth, the dimensions of which can be sensed if one considers the results of a survey conducted after the end of East Germany: here Schur was voted greatest East German sports personality of all time, 25 years after ending his career. Schur was selected as East-German Sportspersonality of the Year nine times in a row from 1953 to 1961. His son Jan (born 1962) won an Olympic gold medal in the team trial at the 1988 Summer Olympics, together with Uwe Ampler, Mario Kummer and Maik Landsmann. Schur was more deeply involved politically than other sports people in East Germany. Between 1959 and 1990 he was a member of the Volkskammer. After German reunification he kept to his views and joined the SED successor party PDS and was a member of Germany's parliament, Bundestag, between 1998 and 2002. Schur is also a member of the \\"Kuratorium Friedensfahrt Course de la Paix e.V.\\", and works to keep the traditional race alive. In 1992 Schur opened a bicycle store in Magdeburg that is now run by his other son Gus-Erik Schur. \\"T√§ves Radladen\\" supports the bicycle racing club \\"RC Lostau\\" and takes part in races all over Europe under the name \\"Team T√§ves Radladen\\".

Its encompass the historic center of Wilbraham, as well as the historic central portion of the campus of the Wilbraham & Monson Academy. It includes properties on Mountain Road (roughly the southern boundary of the district), Main Street, and Faculty Street. Wesleyan Academy was founded in 1817 and moved to Wilbraham in 1824; its oldest buildings date to 1825. It merged with Monson Academy in the 20th century to form the present school that occupies the academic premises. The academy was a major center of Methodist teaching in New England, and was a prominent factor in the town's growth. The main historic building of the Academy is called the Old Academy, and is a large brick Federalist building designed by Enoch Mudge in 1825. It is a two-story building with a slate roof and a white clapboard belltower. Next to it is Fisk Hall, an 1851 two story building made of brick with sandstone trim; it is topped by a cupola. Binney Hall, built in 1854, is similarly a two-story brick building. The Smith Hall Gymnasium was built in 1896, and has Richardsonian Romanesque details and a hipped slate roof. The Alumni Memorial Chapel stands next to the Gymnasium; it was built in 1867 of red sandstone. In addition to the academy buildings, the district includes a number of civic and residential buildings, including the Old Meetinghouse (built 1793), which was originally designed as a meeting hall, but was converted in 1835 into a residential duplex. Adjacent to the Old Meetinghouse, is the Hearse House, an outbuilding that housed the town's hearses from 1890 to 1920. The district also includes a number of residences built mostly in the middle of the 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The district covers most of the buildings along Elm Street and Main Street radiating out from their intersection in both directions. The district is predominantly residential in character, although it does contain a number of commercial, industrial, and civic buildings. Many of the buildings in the district stand at a uniform setback from the street, giving the district a coherent feel. Agawam's center began to take shape in the early years of the 18th century. By 1750 the town center lay on one of the main roads connecting Northampton to Hartford, Connecticut, and the area became a significant rest stop along the way. It received significant development in the 1790s when the road was more formally laid out, private homes began to join the taverns, and what is now Elm Street connected the village to points east and west. By 1831 the center also had churches, a school, and a cemetery. The oldest building in the district is a tavern dating to 1750, and there are about a dozen houses that date to the 1790s. As the 19th century progressed the village continued to grow, yet retained some rural character, with only low levels of industrialization. The arrival of streetcars connecting the village to the city of Springfield saw the transformation of the village into one with a more suburban feel. Agawam was not formally incorporated until 1855, and it is during this time that the village assumed its role as the civic center of the town. The district features a variety of architectural styles, from Georgian and Federal buildings of the early period to mid-20th century ranch housing. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

This section of Springfield was the city's first \\"Gold Coast,\\" built primarily during the early Industrial Revolution, from approximately 1812-1850. The Ames Hill/Crescent Hill Historic District includes Mulberry Street, the upper-class street made famous by Dr. Seuss's first children's book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, (1937.) Dr. Seuss's grandparents lived on Mulberry Street. This National Historic District overlaps somewhat with both the Ridgewood and Maple Hill Historic Districts designated by the City of Springfield. Ames Hill was named for the Ames Family of Springfield. David Ames, Jr., a Springfield paper manufacturer, was the son of Colonel David Ames, the first superintendent of the Springfield Armory. The David Ames Jr. House, at 241 Maple Street, on Ames Hill in Springfield, was built in 1826-7 and was the work of Chauncey Shepard, a prominent local architect and builder. In 1867, Solomon J. Gordon, a New York City lawyer, purchased the property and Shepard was hired to remodel the house he had built forty-one years earlier. Gordon lived in the house until his death in 1891. Today the house is known as Young House and is part of the campus of the MacDuffie School. Crescent Hill continues along the steep trajectory of Maple Street, which snakes up along a bluff overlooking the scenic Connecticut River and Connecticut River Valley. Crescent Hill also features many of Springfield's largest mansions, most of which date from the mid-19th century. Unfortunately, the Ames Hill/Crescent Hill Historic District was devastated during the June 1, 2011 Greater Springfield tornado.

The Apremont Triangle Historic District includes the Apremont Triangle Park, nicknamed \\"the Heart of Springfield\\" by the city's arts community; the historic, 10-story Kimball Towers Condominiums, (formerly the luxurious Hotel Kimball - \\"Western Massachusetts' Leading Hotel - built in 1910;) a nine-story historic, former YMCA, which now houses apartments at 122 Chestnut Street, (1915); the six-story Neo-Gothic Tarbell- Waters Building (1923), a former office building that was auctioned in August 2011; the two-story Harris-Green building, a 1920s Rolls Royce showroom, which is, actually, two buildings; and the two-story Birnie Building, a 1930s Pontiac showroom. Currently, the district is the center of Springfield's bohemian arts community, featuring multi-media organizations, artists' lofts, ethnic restaurants, and organizations like The Apremont Arts Community - group of multi-media artists, non-profit organizations, and businesses. Located in a walkable area, the Apremont Triangle Historic District is less than half a mile from Springfield's Club Quarter, its Downtown Business District, Union Station, the Quadrangle, the MassMutual Center, Symphony Hall, the Springfield Armory, and numerous other sites. 2011 sales of 122 Chestnut and the Tarbell-Waters Building As of June 2011, the Renaissance Revival 122 Chestnut - the former YMCA building that was, during the 1980s, adaptively re- used to become 99 rental apartments - and the Neo-Gothic Tarbell-Waters Buildings are both for sale. These are two of the five properties that constitute the Apremont Triangle Historic District. The buyer of these properties could substantially change the character of the Apremont Triangle Historic District, which in recent years has flourished as an increasingly bohemian arts district. The asking price for 122 Chestnut is 6.5 million, including an attached 144 car parking lot. Residents of the Apremont Triangle Historic District look at dual building sales with both caution and optimism, because in recent years, the neighborhood has had great success in attracting artistic and bohemian residents to the Kimball Towers, 122 Chestnut, the Birnie Building, and the McIntosh - an adaptively re-purposed shoe factory on Worthington Street. However, precisely because the neighborhood has been on an upward trajectory for years; the sale of two of the district's most important buildings are temporarily, in 2011, depressing market values at the Kimball and McIntosh, reflected in 1 bedroom units selling in the $30,000s-$80,000s. Apremont Triangle Park The Apremont Triangle Park was named after Springfield's 104th Infantry - the first U.S. military regiment ever honored by a foreign power for bravery in war. Following the 104th Infantry's valor at Apremont during World War I, it received the croix de guerre from the Nation of France. The Apremont Triangle Park is named in honor of the U.S. 104th Infantry Regiment's heroism at Apremont. In the park, there is monument to the 104th Infantry, Springfield's own, noting its heroism at Apremont. Amazingly, again in World War II, the 104th Infantry Regiment again received the prestigious Croix de Guerre for its valor at war. In World War II, the 104th Infantry fought under General George Patton and in the Battle of the Bulge. Kimball Towers Condominiums The Hotel Kimball was once \\"Western Massachusetts finest hotel.\\" Built in 1910, and opened on St. Patrick's Day, 1911, the New York Times reviewed the Hotel Kimball as \\"ranking with the finest [hotels] in the country. A magnificent hotel, modern and metropolitan in every appointment.\\" In 1920 it hosted the United States' first-ever commercial radio station - WBZ, Springfield. U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy all stayed at The Kimball - some before and some after the 1940s transition into the Sheraton-Kimball Hotel, operated by Sheraton Hotels and Resorts. The Kimball was the first \\"grand hotel\\" purchased by Sheraton, a company that was, at the time, headquartered in Springfield. Today, the Hotel Kimball is the Kimball Towers Condominiums. During the 1980s, when the building's condo developer was converting over 300 hotel rooms to approximately 120 condominiums, he filed for bankruptcy. Many of the Kimball's units, (especially those on the lower floors,) were left in disrepair or completely bare. From the 1990s until the 2000s, the building was managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation because - due to it historic designation - it could not be torn down. In the 2000s, urban living in Metro Center Springfield became popular, especially among bohemians, artists, empty-nesters, and LGBT residents - people attracted to urban living without the high price. The Kimball Towers, due to its low- prices (from its formerly troubled history as a condominium development) and essentially 'blank canvas' left by the initial condominium developer, became a center for Springfield's arts community. As of 2011, it is one of Springfield's most prominent buildings for artists, bohemians, and others in the creative class.

The properties are at 77‚Äî103 Belle St. and 240‚Äî298 Franklin Street, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Belle and Franklin Street area was developed by local builder William Lay between 1914 and 1916. It includes a series of almost entirely residential buildings along Belle and Franklin Streets, two streets that parallel each other near Interstate 291, north of Springfield's downtown. Lay built 16 apartment houses, half of which were four story brick construction, with the others being three story wood frame structures. The district also includes a mixed residential/commercial building Lay built, and an early (1862) frame house. The development is remarkably intact despite the construction of I-291 nearby: only one of Lay's buildings, another mixed use building, has been demolished. The area now covered by this district was first developed as a series of modest estates and stylish homes in the 1850s. These properties were subdivided and built more densely in the late 19th century, when streetcar lines made the area convenient for workers employed downtown. The property developed by Lay was originally an estate owned by Samuel Brooks, a doctor, and then George Fisk, president of the Wason Manufacturing Company. Fisk sold his property in 1913 to John Lester, who had sold properties in the area to William Lay, an English-born real estate developer and builder. Lay first proposed subdivision of the area in February 1913, and received building permits in December for the first building, one of the six-unit wood-frame buildings on Franklin Street. The brick eight-unit buildings on Belle Street were built in 1915. The building at 296 Franklin Street, also built during this time, has twelve units, and includes retail spaces on the ground floor.

The district is centered on the town common, and includes properties radiating out from that center on Main Street, Brookfled, Wales, Sturbridge and Warren Roads. Brimfield Center was first laid out in 1721 along a Native American trail that ran through the area, and developed over the years into what is now US Route 20, or Main Street. The district includes properties ranging from early colonial houses to the town hall, built in 1878. The center has retained some coherence because the Brimfield Fair, a major antiques market that takes place three times a year, takes up significant open space in the areas near the center. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The town of Brimfield is located in central Massachusetts, just west of Sturbridge and roughly midway between Worcester and Springfield. The town was permanently settled by European colonists in 1721, and its civic center was laid out along a former Native American trail that ran east-west through the town. This route, now Main Street, and in this area aligned with United States Route 20, grew to become part of the principal post road running west from Boston to Springfield and beyond. Two roads leading northward, Warren and Brookfield Roads, lead to the towns for which they are named, and Wales Road leads south to Connecticut. This road network was established early in the colonial period, and the town common was laid out in 1721 at the junction of Main and Warren Streets. The town center is architecturally dominated by Georgian and Federal period housing, with commercial and civic buildings mostly later in construction, as needs for such facilities changed over time, and fire claiming some structures. The town was bypassed by the railroads, and most of its industries were located away from the center. In the 20th century, the advent of regular antiques fairs has served to keep the town center separated from other, more modern development. The oldest surviving elements of the town center are the common and the cemetery, both laid out in 1721. The oldest house is believed to be the c. 1738 ell attached to the Converse House at 7 Brookfield Road, and there are only a few other Georgian period houses. The town's Federal period architecture benefits from the residency of architect Elias Carter, who designed a number of homes, notable among them the c. 1823 Hitchcock House at 15 Wales Road; it has a porch with colossal Doric columns. Carter is also believed to have designed the Converse House to which the c. 1738 ell is attached. The First Congregational Church, on the common, is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture, built in 1848. The Hitchcock Free Academy (1855, pictured above), is also a Carter design, showing early Italianate influence. Town Hall, built in 1878, is a fine example of Stick style, designed by Springfield architect Eugene Clarence Gardner.

It is centered on the park now called Lucy Wisniowski Park, which was previously known as \\"The Common\\", and includes all of the buildings that face the park, as well as a few on immediately adjacent city streets. It was developed in the 1830s and 1840s as an area where mid-level employees of Chicopee's mills and factories lived, between the simpler tenements and boarding houses of the lower classes, and the elite mansions of the proprietors and top-level managers. Most of the building stock in the district was built between 1846 and 1870, and were single family brick or wood-frame Greek Revival houses. The Common, whose original purpose was to provide shared pasturage for area residents, was by the end of this period converted to a park. From the 1870s to the 1890s the housing stock was predominantly multi-family in scale, and exhibited the architectural fashions of the time: Italianate, Second Empire, and Victorian. Thereafter development was limited due to a lack of available land, and only a few brick apartment houses were built between 1890 and 1915. Since that time there have been only modest changes to the neighborhood. A school was torn down, and was replaced by a wading pool and bath house. Buildings have been altered and added, and a few have been moved. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

The area was first laid out by Chester's first settlers in 1763. It remained the center of commerce and civic life in the rural agricultural community until railroads were built in other areas of the town in the 1840s. The village center declined in importance as economic activity moved to areas more readily accessible to the railroad, and the town hall was eventually moved to Chester Factories. The district includes properties on Skyline Trail near the intersection of Bromley and Lyman Roads, and features Greek Revival, colonial, and Federal architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Chester Center is located on an upland site on a ridge separating two branches of the Westfield River, along Skyline Trail, a major north-south route through the rural community. The historic elements of the district are three houses, a district schoolhouse, the 1840 First Congregational Church, and the Chester Burying Ground, the latter having a first burial dating to 1769. The Rev. Aaron Bascomb House was also built in 1769, for the town's first settled minister; it is a typical Georgian five-bay house with a large central chimney. The Searles House is a modest 1-1/2 story Cape, built in 1787. The Dr. Anson Boies House was built in 1810 by Reverend Bascomb, whose daughter married the doctor. The district schoolhouse, built in 1798, is one of the oldest in Massachusetts. The town of Chester was settled in 1763 and was incorporated in 1765 as Murrayfield. The site of the town center was set aside by the town's early proprietors as part of its initial land division. Its first meeting house was built sometime thereafter, eventually to be replace by the Greek Revival First Congregational Church now standing. The town's early economy was largely agrarian, but industry developed in the area now known as Chester Factories, which had more ready access to water power, and was nearer an early (1800) turnpike. When the railroad bypassed the center in preference to Chester Factory in 1842, the village center declined in importance, and was not developed further.

Chester was settled in the 1760s, and the factory village was a location where water power was harnessed at an early time for grist mills and sawmills. The village got its name from the Chester Glass Factory, which operated in the area through the War of 1812. It benefited from the construction of a turnpike (now United States Route 20) leading to Chester Center in 1804, and was transformed by the arrival of the railroad around 1840. The village became an important provisioning stop for trains, and the village further benefited by the fact that the railroad bypassed Chester Center. The economic and civic life of the town gradually shifted, and Chester Factories is where the town hall and library were built. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The district is roughly bounded by Middlefield Road, River, Main, and Maple Streets, US 20, and Williams Street. The southern boundary is roughly US 20, with the tracks formerly of the Western Railroad the boundary to the northeast. There are some older houses in the area along US 20, while more intensive industrial development took place along the Westfield River branch which runs between the two transportation routes. The village's greatest period of growth was between 1879 and 1915, when the production of abrasive materials, and granite quarrying and cutting operations became major industries. The Fay's Clothing Store, built in 1896, is at three stories the village's tallest building.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Springfield was from an early date a significant transportation crossroads, with traffic on the north-south Connecticut River and the east-west Boston Post Road as major transportation routes. With the arrival of railroads in the 1830s, the city became a major transit point for freight moved on railroads along similar routes. Its early train stations were located at the northern end of downtown, on the west side of Main Street near the main rail junction. A major former freight house, built in 1875, is located north of the tracks and east of Main Street. In 1889 the grade-level crossing of Main Street was replaced by a stone arch bridge; it and the stone embankment wall on the north side of Lyman Street were designed by H. H. Richardson. This change was accompanied by the construction of new stations on the east side of Main Street, which were consolidated into a single large Union Station in 1924. That building, vacant for many years, underwent rehabilitation in 2016-17 and again serves as a transportation hub.

Fought towards the end of the Scanian War, the siege was one in a string of Danish losses that saw Swedish forces under King Charles XI of Sweden establish control over the southern region of Sweden. An illustration of the siege. Prelude A portrait of the Swedish commander, Fabian von Fersen. The fortified city of Malm√∂ was the only Swedish stronghold that had not fallen into the hands of the Danes during the 1676-1677 period of the Scanian War. It was used as a base for Swedish operations in the southwestern corner of Scania. To win the war, it was important for King Christian V of Denmark to capture Malm√∂ and strike a blow against Swedish presence in the region. The siege began on June 11, with the Danish navy anchoring in the roadstead north of the town and the Danish army camping on the plain south of the town. Danish engineers soon began digging trenches leading up to the castle in the west and to the eastern and southern gates on the city wall. On June 12, the Danes brought in 28 siege guns and 27 mortars, using them to start bombarding the castle and the city walls. The Swedish administration of Malm√∂ was unsure of the loyalty of the local citizens, as they had only been under Swedish rule since 1658. But reports from Kristianstad about how Christian V had allowed his soldiers three hours of plunder after the capture of the town by the Danes in August 1676, convinced the local citizenry that their best option was to support the Swedes. The Swedish defense was under the command of General Fabian von Fersen, who served as the Swedish Chief Commander in the regions of Scania, Halland and Blekinge. During the siege, he suffered a head wound from Danish musket fire. Fabian passed away on July 30th, following an unsuccessful operation. Battle The bombardment became more intense on the evening of June 25, and at 1 o'clock on the morning of June 26 the battle began with a diversionary attack on the Malm√∂ Castle (Swedish: Malm√∂hus slott), followed by two frontal assaults on the city, one at the southern gate (S√∂derport) and one at the eastern gate (√ñsterport). The Danes used fascines, ladders and pontoons to cross the moat. After fierce fighting Danish forces under the command of Siegfried von Bibow were able to break through the defense close to the eastern gate. However, as soon as Danish troops reached the crest of the town wall the Danish artillery ceased firing, which gave the Swedish defenders the opportunity to man their guns. The Swedish artillery soon began firing on Danish troops making their way across the moat, which inflicted several casualties on the advancing Danish troops and made it impossible for the Danes to bring reinforcements to von Bibow. Inside the town, von Bibow didn't have enough troops to force his way to the gate and open it, and eventually he and all his men were cut down by Swedish soldiers and civilians. Another attack on the other side of the eastern gate made it to the crest of the wall before being repulsed, while the attacks at the southern gate failed to even cross the moat. After the failed siege, on July 5 the Danish army began its retreat north to the town of Landskrona, where they would engage the Swedish at the Battle of Landskrona. Aftermath The Danes had lost the initiative in the war, as well as some of its best troops in the region and some of its most talented commanders. It has been suggested that the latter consequence may have affected the outcome of the subsequent Battle of Landskrona (Swedish: Slaget vid Landskrona) which followed on July 14. While the Danish navy had the upper hand over the Swedish, the siege was one of a number of Swedish victories on land that would, in the end, restore the status quo of Scania being under Swedish control.

His four concert √©tudes for the solo cello were compulsory works at the prestigious International Cello Competition in Markneukirchen in May 2005. Biography Bukinik was born in 1872, in Dubno in the area of Rivne, which is in today's Ukraine (about 400 km west of Kiev). Four of his family members, including his brother Isaac (violinist, teacher, music critic) and his two daughters decided that music would be their profession. From 1885 to 1890 Bukinik attended the music school in Kharkiv, where he was also a member of the Society for Russian Music. During these five years he studied with Alfred von Glehn (who was also the teacher of Gregor Piatigorsky) at the Moscow Conservatory. In his solo performances and concerts as a member of the orchestra, he played together with musicians such as Sergei Taneyev, Nikolai Medtner, Konstantin Igumnov, Alexander Goldenweiser, Alexander Goedicke and W. Lambowskaja. Among his fellow students were well-known musicians such as Ferruccio Busoni, Alexander Scriabin and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Bukinik finished his studies in 1895. He then went on tour in Russia with a symphony orchestra led by Dimitri Achscharumow. After a brief stay in Berlin, Bukinik came to Saratov in 1899, where he remained until 1904 as a teacher at the Mariinsky Institute. At the same time, he met with the famous painter Victor Borisov-Musatov, who became his lifelong friend. Pavel Kuznetsov was another painter with whom Bukinik was very close. In 1901, together with Borisov-Musatov, the field doctor and writers Vladimir Stanjukowitsch and his wife Nadezhda, he founded the so- called English Club of Saratov. In the following two years (1904‚Äì1906) Bukinik lived in Germany, France and Switzerland. From 1906, he had many appearances in Moscow. There he was also cello teacher at the prestigious Gnessin School of Music (now the Gnessin Institute). After the Russian Revolution in October 1917, the school was temporarily closed. From 1919 to 1922 Bukinik was professor at the Conservatory of Kharkov. In 1922 he emigrated to the United States, where he worked with a Ukrainian string quartet and also played in a Ukrainian musical theater. In 1944 he published his memoirs; he died in 1947. Bukinik was the first to play Rachmaninoff's Cello Sonata in G minor in Paris. He was the author of some cello works, and edited several works by Russian composers.

They were a major provider of side arms, swords, light artillery, and heavy ordnance for the Union in the American Civil War. They also cast a number of bronze statues which can be found throughout New England.  Company history  Undated woodcut. The Ames Manufacturing Company has its origins in a factory established in 1774 in Chelmsford, Massachusetts by the Ames family. Brothers Nathan P. Ames, Jr. and James T. Ames moved their tool and cutlery business to a new industrial town on the Chicopee River near Springfield, Massachusetts in 1829. They were invited by Edmund Dwight, who owned textile mills nearby. The Ames company soon moved to manufacturing swords for the federal government and state militias. As the town of Chicopee was formed in 1848, the Ames brothers were leaders in the new community. Upon the death of Nathan P. Ames in 1847, ownership of the company turned to younger brother James Tyler Ames. Iron and bronze foundries The Ames foundry mark can be seen on Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue By 1835, the company was creating works in brass and bronze, and in 1845, an iron foundry was added. The company used the foundries for casting statuary as well for producing as military cannons and cannonballs. The bronze doors of the East Wing of the United States Capitol and Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue at the Lexington-Concord bridge were cast at the Ames company. Other statues included large equestrian statues of George Washington (at the Boston Public Garden and in Washington, D.C.), a statue of Benjamin Franklin (Boston), and a statue of Major John Mason. When the Mexican War came, the foundry's primary output switched to armament. Civil War Upon the secession of the South and the formation of the Confederate States of America, the Union lost access to its southern arsenals. Therefore, independent arms manufacturers were crucial to the success of the Union army. Ames was one of the Union's most important manufacturers of side arms, swords, and light artillery, and the third largest producer of heavy ordnance. Post-war diversification and decline This foundry mark, on a Civil War memorial in Attleboro, Massachusetts, indicates that Ames Foundries were acquired by the Spalding company. In addition to producing military equipment for many years, including (in addition to swords) cannons, cannonballs, it also produced sewing machine and bicycle parts in the later 19th century. The company was a major supplier of bicycles to the Overman Wheel Company from 1883-1887. The sword manufacturing business was formally separated into an independent company in 1881. By 1907, the Ames foundries had been purchased by Chicopee's A.G. Spalding Company. Surviving buildings The historic Ames Company factory, located at 5-7 Springfield Street in Chicopee, Massachusetts, is a complex of connected industrial buildings, the oldest of which date to 1847. Most of the older elements are brick in construction, and range in height from one to four stories. This complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The largest surviving buildings have been converted into residences.

Summary Both gentle and assertive, Nelly is an ideal mother. While most people would be overwhelmed by the responsibility of four children that are developmentally impaired and have special needs, Nelly isn't fazed. She treats them as if they were normal children. The documentary show how under her supervision, the children learn to play musical instruments, use appropriate table manners, and feel loved. Nelly's foster children came from cruel circumstances. Tom and Suzie, the first two children Nelly took in, were previously placed in a foster home where they were force fed so roughly that they would end up eating blood with their food. It them a long time to trust and feel comfortable in Nelly's gentle home. The documentary explores what it means to be a mother, whether it's a matter of biology or behavior. Suzie's biological mother explains, quite honestly, that she loved her daughter when she was a baby, but as soon as Suzie started to grow older, and her disorder became evident, she felt incapable of caring for her. She still visits Suzie, now and then, but says that she considers Nelly Suzie's real mother. What's initially surprising about Nelly's situation is the lack of support she receives from her immediate family. Her husband divorced her because he couldn't handle having four young children in the house again, and her eldest daughter doesn't support Nelly's decision to adopt one of the foster children. While their behavior seems harsh at first, as the documentary progresses, they become more sympathetic. Their lives were just as devastated by the family tragedies as Nelly's; and, perhaps, in some ways, Nelly abandoned her original family when she decided to take in new children.

The Shaws' three sons have returned home to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. Mr. Shaw has been a coal miner for 49 years, and has only one year left until retirement. Mrs Shaw is the daughter of a pig breeder, meaning she came from a higher social class. The parents urged their sons to abandon their father's trade in pursuit of professional careers, but the results have not been entirely positive. Andrew, the eldest, became an solicitor but has abandoned it to pursue painting. Colin, who was a Communist party member for a year, is now a prosperous but unfulfilled industrial relations manager for a car manufacturer, dealing with negotiations with the unions. The youngest brother, Steven, is a teacher, married with four children, and has abandoned a book he had been writing for several years.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Baystate Corset Block stands on the north side of Springfield's downtown area, at the northeast corner of Dwight and Taylor Streets. The main portion of the building, facing Dwight Street, was built in 1874 by Marsh & Robinson. It is a four-story brick structure, whose original styling, visible on the side elevation, includes segmental arch windows and a corbelled cornice. The front facade, which was redone in 1918, consists on the upper level of five bays of tripled windows, separated by brick piers. The storefronts are largely unaltered. The first tenants of the building were woodworking shops, who occupied it until 1883, when it was occupied by a paper products business. P. P. Kellogg, its owner, expanded the premises, building an extension along Taylor Street in 1888. In 1886, the Baystate Corset Company, founded two years earlier in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, leased space in the building. Baystate grew rapidly, and purchased the building in 1895, occupying it until 1920. It was one of the nation's largest corset manufacturers at the time, shipping products all across the country. Baystate used the top floor of the building as a cutting room, with the second and third floors arrayed with sewing machines at which its products were manufactured.

The district became a target for industrial development after construction of the Springfield and New London Railroad in 1870, which included a stop nearby. The oldest building in the district is that of the Bullard Repeating Arms Company, built in 1883 for a company that manufactured rifles. Its founder Jean Bullard, a prolific inventor, also built an early steam-powered automobile in 1887. One building was eventually taken over in 1895 by the Springfield Industrial Institute, which trained generations of workmen for Springfield's industries. The fire station was built to meet demand for improved fire department response time in the developing area.

The complex is dominated by a 2-1/2 story brick building with modest ornamentation that is ten window bays long and three wide. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings with headers formed out of soldier bricks. The roof eave is adorned with brick corbelling, and the main entrance is sheltered by a Victorian-era porch with turned posts. The building was built about 1887 for the A.G. Barnes Whip Company, and was purchased in 1893 by the United States Whip Company, which was formed out of a merger of many local whipmakers. Beginning in 1910, the building underwent a number of ownership and usage changes, although significant elements of the whipmaking machinery were retained through uses that included the manufacture of paper tubes, dog collars, and hardware for funerary caskets. In 1957, the building was purchased by the recently founded Westfield Whip Company, which uses some of the facility's specialized machinery for whip manufacturing.

It is centered on a portion of Worthington Street, a major east-west road in the city, between Armory Street and Summit Street, and includes 33 buildings on those three streets as well as Federal and Taylor Streets, near their junctions with either Worthington or Federal. Most of the contributing buildings are four story brick buildings with Georgian detailing and stone trim. The district was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, including 28 buildings; the district was expanded in 1992 to add the five buildings on Taylor Street. The district is located on the northern side of the plateau that also houses the Springfield Armory. In the mid-19th century this area was developed with summer estates, which eventually succumbed to development pressures for higher density housing late in the 19th century. The Upper Worthington area was originally the estate of Horace Kibbe, which the firm of Gagnier & Angers offered to buy in 1908. Gagnier & Angers was a partnership of two French Canadian immigrants, who were one of the city's major real estate development and construction firms in the early 20th century. When the estate was finally partitioned in 1912, they purchased the largest part of it, and proceeded to build out the area over the next twenty years. Most of the residential blocks in the district were built either by that firm, or by one established by Albert Gagnier and Larry Angers, sons of its principals. The development was the largest of its type in the city at the time, and preserves a distinctive streetscape from the period.

It encompasses a significant number of Queen Anne style houses built in the second half of the 19th century by wealthy residents of Chicopee, as well as housing for skilled workers at the nearby textile mills. It is centered where Springfield Street and Fairview Avenue meet. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history Chicopee developed in the 19th century as a major industrial community in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts, with numerous textile mills lining the Chicopee River east of the Connecticut River. The Cabotville area, now its principal downtown, began industrial development around 1831, when the Springfield Canal Company was organized by Boston-based investors to provide water power to new mills. Springfield Street had long been a principal north- south route paralleling the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, and retained that importance after Cabotville was laid out. Prior to 1860, most development was restricted north of South Street, with farmland to the south. The upper areas, away from the mills, were typically developed by individuals engaged as skilled laborers or management in the mills. After 1860, development began to push southward along Springfield Street, with larger, handsomely appointed lots and more architecturally sophisticated housing. The historic district is centered around the junction of Springfield Street with South and Fairview Streets, extending several blocks in each direction. At its northeastern corner is the Maple Grove Cemetery, and its southward boundary is the Gaylord Street east of Springfield (ending at the northern edge of the Elms College campus), and Casino Avenue to its west. The older developments to the north and west are primarily vernacular versions of Greek Revival and Italianate housing, while the later development to the east and south are more stately examples of the Queen Anne, Second Empire, and Colonial Revival. The district includes a small number of commercial buildings near its northern edge, as well as four churches.

The buildings, located at 12, 14‚Äì38, and 11‚Äì31 Park Street, are noted for their historic association with the locally important Smith Carriage Company, a major manufacturer of carriages in the 19th century. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Smith Carriage Company was founded in 1827 by David Smith, who had apprenticed at another carriage maker in Westfield. The company specialized in the manufacture of carriages with light frames, but also resold carriages made by others. In the early 20th century, it provided a chassis to the Stevens- Duryea Company that was used in one of its prototype automobiles. The company focus changed to the manufacture of automobile parts in the 1910s and 1920s, a business the company continued in until its final closure in the 1940s. The three buildings on Park Street were built in later phases of the company's history. The oldest of the three, 12 Park, is a three-story brick building dating from the late 19th century; it has typical industrial architecture of that period, with segmented-arch window openings and a corbelled cornice and terra cotta detailing. The other two buildings have steel and concrete frames, finished in brick with concrete ground floors, and vary in height from two to four stories. Windows are large industrial sashes set in rectangular openings, with brick piers separating the bays on the upper floors. These were built to facilitate the company's production of automotive parts.

The present center's first major building was a Baptist church, built in 1792. The area gained in importance because of the presence of the main stage route (now United States Route 20), and then the arrival of the railroad (which was at first run on the south side of the Westfield River, but has since been rerouted to its north). It was aided economically by the development of papermaking as an enterprise, which continues to be an economic force (albeit at a reduced level) today. The historic district consists of a stretch of Main Street between US 20 and the river. Most of the buildings are residential, and are typified by common setbacks from the road and a similarity of scale. Most of the buildings were built between 1850 and 1895, and the oldest building, the Horace Parks House, dates to 1830.

When first added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, the district encompassed North High Street, between Dwight and Lyman Streets. This part of High Street was built between 1850 and 1885, and is lined with masonry buildings in Italianate and Second Empire styles. In 1992 the district was extended southward, adding three blocks of High Street between Dwight and Essex Streets. This expansions encompasses the growth of Holyoke during the height of its commercial success, between 1880 and 1930; it also includes the separately-listed Holyoke City Hall. The district was extended a third time, in 2008, adding a complex of three buildings at Dwight and Maple Streets that now houses the Holyoke Health Center. Prior to 1847, the area that is now Holyoke was a sleepy agricultural area of West Springfield. In that year, investors from Boston purchased a mill privilege on the Connecticut River, on which they proceeded to develop the industrial sites that fueled the growth of the city. By 1880, Holyoke was one of the nation's major producers of paper products, and had a population of more than 10,000. Many buildings on High Street in the 1986 district boundaries date to this period of rapid growth, which was completely built out by 1880. Between 1880 and 1930 the area northeast of the early cluster of commercial buildings was developed, spurred by the construction of City Hall in the 1870s, and by the extension of streetcars line for the Holyoke Street Railway in the latter half of the 19th century.

The area started to take over from Ludlow Center as the center of economic importance with the arrival of jute mills on the Chicopee River. The district is roughly bounded by Winsor, Sewall and State Sts. and the Chicopee River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history Ludlow was originally part of Springfield upon that community's settlement in 1634, and was separately incorporated in 1774. Its early settlement areas were on the north bank of the Chicopee River, which forms its southern border, but the town's civic center was located near its geographic center. The Wallamamumps Falls on the river were recognized as an ideal place for the development of water-powered industry, which took place beginning the late 18th century. The Falls was also the site of one of the first bridges across the river, which resulted in travel-related economic development as well. The village economy remained dominated by the mills, with a large complex built in 1901 just east of the present-day bridge. The historic district consists of three sections: the first is a cluster of mainly civic and commercial buildings, bounded by Winsor, Sewall, East, and Center Streets. It includes the 1845 Union Church of Christ, the 1890 Hubbard Memorial Library, and the town's first high school (now a senior center), among other buildings. The second portion of the district is the mill complex between State Street and the river, and the third is the former power station for the mill complex, located about upriver on the Wilbraham side of the river.

Centered on the junction of Center, Church and Booth Streets, it is the site selected as the town center when Ludlow was established in 1774. Its notable structures include the Congregational Church (the third, a Romanesque structure built in 1859), the old town hall (more recently serving as the local grange hall), and a number of farmhouses that date to the first half of the 19th century. The area has remained a center of civic life in the town, even though its economic center moved later in the 19th century to Ludlow Village. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Ludlow was part of Springfield upon that community's settlement in 1634, and was separately incorporated in 1774. Prior to the mid-18th century, the area that is now Ludlow was largely undeveloped forest, reaching a population of two to three hundred by the 1770s. Upon incorporation, the town fathers selected a geographically central location for the site of its first meeting house, which was not built until after the American Revolutionary War. A road network, principally Center and Church Streets, was laid out by that time, and a modest village center arose. In the early 19th century, a mill was established on the Chicopee River in the southern reaches of the town, around which Ludlow Village developed as its principal economic center. In 1893, the town meeting was moved to Ludlow Village, and the center has stagnated developmentally since then. The historic district is centered at the junction of Center, Church, and Booth Streets, and includes just twelve buildings. The First Church Common is a small triangular green at the junction of Church and Center, forming (along with the church itself) the focal point of the district.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The district's primarily residential architecture and streetscape is reflective of more than two centuries of development trends, and a late 19th- century desire to maintain a more rural atmosphere. Description and history The area that is now Longmeadow was originally settled by colonists in the 17th century as part of Springfield, from which it was separately incorporated in 1783, after many years of political maneuvering. The town had a mainly agricultural focus well into the 20th century, the bottomlands of the Connecticut River (which forms the town's western boundary) proving extremely fertile and giving the town its name. Longmeadow Street, located on a terrace above that plain, was from an early date the principal north-south route on the east side of the river, and the town's principal thoroughfare. In the 19th century, the quarrying of brownstone became a major industry, prompting a shift in population away from the river and toward the quarries further east. As a result, the northern portion of Longmeadow Street was shifted eastward sometime between 1870 and 1894. A local preservationist organization was formed in 1876 to maintain the character of Longmeadow Street as a tree-lined and predominantly residential street. East Longmeadow, more industrialized than the rural west, was separated from Longmeadow in 1894, and a streetcar line was extended from Springfield along Longmeadow Street in 1896, setting the stage for its transformation into a residential suburb. Most of this development took place on either side of Longmeadow Street, with new road junctions the principal alteration to the streetscape. As a result of this history, the area between the Springfield town line and Cooley Brook contains a number of fine examples of residential architecture spanning from the 18th to the 20th century. There are only six non-residential buildings: a church, four small commercial buildings, and a former town building. The area around Cooley Brook, which once served as the town's main water supply, was converted into a public park, designed by the well-known Olmsted Brothers firm.

Granville Center was one of its early places of settlement, and is where its first meetinghouse, supposedly near the junction of Main Road (Massachusetts Route 57) and Blandford Road, in about 1747. The foundational remains of an early sawmill and gristmill (c. 1759) survive, and the center's oldest surviving building, the Hubbard House, may have belonged to their owner. The center became the civic, spiritual and economic center of the agricultural community, but declined in economic and religious importance due to religious divisions, and the rise of Granville Village as an industrial center to the east. As a result, the center's architecture is largely reflective of the first half of the 19th century. Its continued civic importance was reinforced when a new town hall was built at the western end of the district in 1927.

West Granville developed in an upland valley isolated from the rest of the town as an agricultural area, and the village began to take shape at a crossroads with the construction of the Second Congregational Church in 1778. The village continued to prosper through the first half of the 19th century, but declined thereafter, as economic prospects improved in the eastern part of the town (particularly the growing industry at Granville Village), and Tolland, located just to the west, was separated from the town.

The district is basically linear in character, extending along Main Road (Massachusetts Route 57) between its junction with Crest Lane to the east, and the four-way junction with Beech Hill Road and Hartland Hollow Road to the west. It extends a short way north on Beech Hill Road. In addition to the civic buildings at the center of the village, it includes primarily residential buildings stretching along Main Road from west of Beach Hill Road to South Lane No. 2. The civic buildings consist of the 1778 Congregational Church, a district schoolhouse, and a larger academy building, built in 1830. Houses in the district were built from the mid-18th century into the late 19th century, and feature Greek Revival, Georgian, and Federal architecture.

It presently houses the Westfield city offices and the local district court. It was built in 1889 to house the state normal school (now Westfield State University), serving in that role until its acquisition by the city in 1959. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Hartwell and Richardson. The second partner was William Cummings Richardson, not H. H. Richardson, but the design of this building, only a few years after the latter's death, was strongly influenced by his distinctive style. The building has an L shape, with a front facade of . The main block is deep, and the ell extending off the east side is deep. It rests on a granite foundation, and is made of red brick with brownstone trim. There are two entrances on the front facade, each under classic Richardsonian arches, with additional entrances on the east side and the rear. In its first use as a training school, the first floor included a reception area, science classrooms, and training classrooms for elementary grades. The second floor housed a study hall and assembly hall capable of holding the whole student population (about 175), as well as the principal's office, science laboratories, other classrooms, and studio space for artistic disciplines. There was a gymnasium in the basement. The exterior of the building received only modest modifications when the city took over the building in 1959, although it was extensively remodeled inside. Two brick additions were added, one on the east side as vault space, and the other on the north side for storage. The entrance formerly used by the school now serves as the district court entrance, providing access to the clerk's office, a courtroom, and probation offices. The remainder of the building has been converted for the use of a number of city departments. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and as part of an expanded Westfield Center Historic District in 2013.

Wason Car Company and the Springfield Steam Power Company as facilities to support the development of new businesses in what was then called the North Blocks area of the city. Development on the north side of downtown Springfield was spurred by its proximity to the railroad lines that made the city an important regional transportation hub. In the 1850s, the Lyman and Taylor Streets, the two streets nearest the station, developed with small wood-frame and brick commercial and industrial buildings. A portion of this area became the plant of the Wason Manufacturing Company, maker of railroad cars. It moved to a new outlying factory in 1872, leasing its old factory to smaller businesses. The Powers Block, a six-story brick building at 27-37 Lyman Street, was built in 1873 by the Wason Company on part of its old factory grounds. It has five stories, and provided warehouse and factory space to the Powers Paper Company. An addition in 1881 increased its size by more than half, and a sixth floor was added in 1910.

Built in 1931, it is a good local example of Classical Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Palmer's main post office is located on the eastern outskirts of its downtown area, at the southeast corner of Park and Central Streets. It is a roughly rectangular single-story structure, with a steel frame and an exterior finished in brick and limestone. Its main entrance is centered on the long, street-facing side of the building, which is lined with large Ionic columns set in antis in a broad recess. The columns support a brick and limestone frieze, cornice, and low balustrade that encircles the truncated hip roof. The steps leading to the entrance are flanked by original Art Deco lampposts. The interior lobby area has terrazzo marble flooring and marble wainscoting, as well as original woodwork. The post office was built in 1931, to a design by the Office of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury, then under the direction of Louis A. Simon. The building cost more than $75,000 to build, a high price for the period, and apparently bankrupted the first contractor to work on it, since it was completed by another. The building's relative grandeur is somewhat offset by its odd location in what is a mostly residential area on the fringe of the city's downtown.

Early life Duffey was born to Cordelia and Charles A. Bisbee and raised in Geauga County, Ohio. While in Ohio she spent her early years working for The Jeffersonian Democrat as a printer. After moving to Columbus, Ohio to help edit the publicationThe Alliance, she met her husband, John B. Duffey. From 1861 to 1867 the Duffeys resided in Philadelphia. While there Eliza Bisbee Duffey exhibited her paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where she eventually became an Associate Member. By 1867, the Duffeys were living in Woodbury, New Jersey until relocating to Vineland, New Jersey in 1872 where she and her husband became editors and publishers of The Vineland Daily Times in 1877. Eliza was a strong advocate for equality between men and women. She published several essays and books about female sexual health and education, education for women, gender roles and the ideal world for both men and women. These works have influenced many reformers and advocates after her. Her body of work on gender issues includes articles, such as Women's Work and Women's Wages (1870) in Arthur's Illustrated, and several books such as What Women Should Know: A Woman's Book about Women, Containing Practical Information for Wives and Mothers (1873), The Relations of the Sexes (1889), and The Ladies' and Gentlemen's Etiquette: A Complete Manual of the Manners and Dress of American Society. Containing Forms of Letters, Invitations, Acceptances and Regrets. With a Copious Index (1877).  Scholarly work  As an ardent feminist in the Victorian era, Eliza Bisbee Duffey made waves with her pro-female writing. As a writer she engaged Edward Hammond Clarke in a debate on educating females. Clarke wrote an extremely popular book entitled Sex in Education; or, A Fair Chance for the Girls in which he argued against educating women in the same environment as men due to their supposed intellectual disadvantages. Duffey responded to Clarke's arguments with her book No Sex in Education; Or, An Equal Chance for Both Boys and Girls (1874) in which she advocated for the equal and co-education of both genders. Duffey continued to take controversial stances. The next topic she tackled was the relationship between men and women. In her book The Relations of the Sexes (1876), she discussed a myriad of topics from the biology of each of the sexes to problems faced by women in marriage. One of the boldest proclamations she made in her book was on the issue of non-consensual sex in marriage. She believed that marital rape was a real crime being committed and that it should be seen as equal to other forms of rape. In addition, she discussed spousal abuse of women and argued that brutality should be sufficient grounds for divorce. She continued this assertion in many of her writings and in one of her articles, she went so far as to say that a woman was \\"no more bound to yield her body to her husband after the marriage between them, than she was before, until she feels that she can do so with the full tide of willingness and affection.\\" In continuation, her work and writing in The Relations of the Sexes (1876) illustrated how changing ideas in science impacted society's views on once-popular opinions. For instance, she takes a stand against the notion of quickening, and claims that it does not represent a proper view of human gestation. Just one year after publishing The Relations of the Sexes, Duffey continued to write about her views on society with her 1877 book, The Ladies' and Gentlemen's Etiquette. In this book she discusses the proper etiquette for 35 different situations in which an individual may find themselves. This book, though straightforward in its content, has a sharp introduction in which Duffey affirms that women should have a higher place in society. Later in life, Duffey became interested in spiritualism and although she claimed to have little knowledge of the field, she wrote Heaven Revised (1889) through the technique of automatic writing.

It provides intensive pre-professional training with internationally acclaimed artists and artistic companies. It is open to all New York State high school age students who qualify through audition. Seven component schools offer training in the specific disciplines of ballet, choral studies, dance, media arts, orchestral studies, theatre and visual arts. Schools=Ballet Students are housed at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, close to the National Museum of Dance and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, which hosts the New York City Ballet during the summer. The program is under the direction of internationally acclaimed NYCB Principal Jenifer Ringer. Students work every day with members of the NYCB and attend all of the company's performances at night. The School of Ballet also presents lectures on dance and career opportunities led by the staff and guest artists from around the world. Students receive intensive instruction in ballet, pointe, character, jazz, variations, and pas de deux. The dancers also partake in a physical therapy program. Choral studies The School of Choral Studies is takes place at SUNY Fredonia, where students are led in daily chorus and private voice training, as well as given lessons in musical theater, opera, small ensembles, and voice recital. Students perform in the Roche Recital Hall in Mason Hall at SUNY Fredonia, as well as the Amphitheater at the nearby Chautauqua Institute. Classes are led by a highly skilled staff of professional music instructors from around the U.S.. Students are also encouraged to enjoy concerts, operas, and many other social events planned by the staff at NYSSSA. Dance The School of Dance takes place at Skidmore College during the latter half of the summer, after the Ballet program is completed. Instruction takes place in the dance studios of the National Museum of Dance and the Skidmore Dance Theatre. Classes provide instruction in modern dance technique, composition, music for dance, career possibilities, repertory and performance. In addition to the staff and faculty, guest artists attend many nights a week. Workshop performances are also offered to the students, as well as trips to the National Museum of Dance and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. Media arts The School of Media Arts takes place at Alfred State College, in Alfred, New York for four weeks in July. The program includes classes in video, filmmaking, photography, computer graphic arts, and new media, with courses providing a review of fundamentals of the craft, overview of aesthetics, and surveys of contemporary work, trends, and ideas, as well as giving students an opportunity to use professional equipment and facilities. Students work on a number of projects, both individually and collaboratively, throughout the four weeks of the program. While the curriculum stresses creative production, it is not exclusively goal-oriented. Exploration, experimentation, and discovery are stressed in each project. The program culminates with a final show and screening. Orchestral studies The School of Orchestral Studies takes place at Skidmore College, and is cosponsored by the New York State School Music Association, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Students have the ability to take seminars in topics such as musicianship, free improvisation, and practice techniques. In addition to the full orchestra, a string orchestra and a wind ensemble, as well as other small ensembles, are available for students to perform in. Over the course of the program students participate in a number of performances, including shows in the Empire Plaza in front of the state capital and at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The program's repertoire is arranged in conjunction to the Philadelphia Orchestra's summer repertoire and many of the small ensembles give concerts before the Philadelphia Orchestra's SPAC performances. Additionally, the students have weekly coaching sessions with members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Theatre The School of Theatre takes place over 4 weeks during July at SUNY Delhi. Students are given daily courses in improvisation, movement, voice and scene study. Guest artists and performers also provide master classes, readings, and workshops in diverse areas, such as stage combat, comedy and improvisation, mask, play writing, and directing. Students are also taken on field trips to New York City to see on and off-Broadway plays. In addition to their rigorous course load, students write and direct plays, as well as perform in fellow students‚Äô work. The School of Theatre is a summer intensive conservatory program. The students take six hours of rigorous classes daily and attend nightly workshops for 3 hours, along with assigned reading and out of class homework assignments. Much of voice and movement study is rooted in the Alexander technique. The scene study curriculum leads a daily hour and a half Meisner technique class that delves into the process of repetition, eventually applying activities, given circumstances, and eventually scene work. The improvisation class derives from Konstantin Stanislavski's teachings and Michael Chekhov's work. Students are required to read Stanislavski's book An Actor Prepares, as well as William Esper's The Actor's Art and Craft. Admission to the School of Theatre is by a competitive audition. 32 students are selected to participate. The audition consists of two contrasting monologues and an interview. Visual arts The School of the Arts takes place at SUNY Fredonia during the month of July, where students work in the studio with drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, mixed media, figure, and inter-disciplinary arts under the direction of noted exhibiting artists/educators. Related activities include drawing and painting from a live model, trips to farms and lakes in the area, and experience with art processes that include welding, casting, direct carving, modeling life-size objects in clay, and experimenting with a variety of printmaking techniques. Group critiques and discussions of student work provide feedback throughout the program. History The New York State Summer School of the Arts was established in 1971, under Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, opening with the Orchestral Studies program. In 1976 the School was expanded with the addition of Ballet, Choral, Theater, Media Arts, and Visual Arts programs. NYSSSA was expanded further in 1988 with the Dance and Jazz programs. Application Placement in the schools is reserved for New York State residents who meet the selection criteria. If there are remaining openings after this selection, they may be filled by out-of-state students who meet additional criteria. Students must be enrolled in grades 8 through 12 and students must audition for the NYSSSA School they wish to attend. This audition is completed in person at a regional audition site, through a portfolio review, or in certain instances, through a video or audiotape review. Tuition for the schools is $2,500 which includes, room, board and classes and artistic events for the four-week residential program. State funds keep these tuitions considerably lower than the actual program costs. Students are selected for the NYSSSA schools without regard to their financial need and tuition assistance forms are mailed to each student who is offered acceptance or alternate status for each program. NYSSSA awards financial assistance based upon individual need, but is limited to New York State residents only. Auditions are held throughout the state.

Description and history The former Bicycle Club Building is located in downtown Springfield, on the west side of Worthington Street opposite Stearns Square. It is four stories in height, sharing a party wall with the adjacent Wells Block. The ground floor is five bays wide articulated by engaged pillars, with a frieze above that has a gable pattern; the building entrance and the retail entrance for the ground floor are set in a recess in the rightmost bay. The second and third floors are four bays wide, with paneled sections above the windows and fluted pilasters at the sides. The fourth floor width is spanned by a Romanesque arch, and the building is crowned by a projecting metal cornice. The building was constructed in 1891 for the Springfield Bicycle Club. The ground floor, used as a retail space, has undergone a variety of changes through the years, but the upper floors have retained much of the original form. The club originally leased the ground floor to a bicycle shop, and had club offices and library on the second floor. The third floor housed a game room, and the top floor had an exercise gym. After the rise of the automobile, the club declined in popularity, and the building has seen a succession of uses.

Built sometime between 1720 and 1740, it is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and a station on the Underground Railroad. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Elijah Burt House is located south of the center of East Longmeadow, on the north side of Chestnut Street roughly midway between Shaker Road and Prospect Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a central chimney. The main entrance is at the center of the front facade, flanked by pilasters, and topped by a corniced entablature. Its interior retains original wide pine floors, fireplaces with beehive ovens, and gunstock posts in the corners. Part of the interior includes a secret passage that may have been used to shelter escaping slaves as part of the Underground Railroad. The house was built sometime between 1720 and 1740, and is believed to be the oldest house in East Longmeadow. It served in early days as a stop on stagecoach routes. In the years before the Civil War, an abolitionist owner is said to have harbored fugitive slaves in the basement, with a tunnel providing an escape into nearby woods. The house underwent a Victorian update in the late 19th century, with a Queen Anne style porch with turned posts; most of these changes were reversed during 20th-century work to restore its 18th-century appearance.

Built in 1874, it is one of that commercial district's finest examples of Victorian architecture and a rare representative example of the development of the city's Scottish immigrant community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1979, and was included in the North High Street Historic District on June 26, 1986.  Description and history  Emblem of the Holyoke Caledonia Benefit Club, c. 1904‚Äì1962 The Caledonia Building is located in Holyoke's downtown North Nigh Street commercial district, on the northwest side of High Street opposite John Street. It is a four-story brownstone structure, sharing party walls with neighboring buildings and topped by a mansard roof. The ground floor is divided into four storefronts articulated by fluted pilasters, with the main building entrance near the center. Three of the four store fronts have recessed entrances flanked by display windows on both sides, while the storefront left of the entrance is flanked by a window on just one side. A cornice separates the ground floor from the upper floors, which have eight bays of windows. Piers of decorative stonework separate the window bays, which are capped by ornamented brownstone lintels. The roof is slate, with single- window dormers flanking a central projecting pavilion. The building was constructed in 1874 for Roswell P. Crafts, a local businessman and politician who served as Holyoke's second mayor, and was thus known as the Craft Building. Its first floor housed businesses, the second and third floors house offices, and the fourth floor was an open ballroom space. In 1879, the Caledonian Benefit Society, established to assist immigrating Scots, began meeting on the top floor; it purchased the building in 1909. From 1910 until 1966, the third floor banquet hall of the building served as the regular practice space of the Holyoke Caledonian Pipe Band.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Carreau Block is located in Chicopee's Willimansett neighborhood, at the southwestern corner of Chicopee and Walter Streets. It is a roughly L-shaped brick building, three stories in height, presenting finished facades to both streets. It is built out of red-brown brick with trim that is either yellow brick or sandstone. Undulating rounded window bays mark the main building corner and flank the two entrances facing Chicopee Street, and also on that facing Walter Street. Bands of yellow brick separate the first and second floor, and also the third floor from the cornice, which is a slight concrete projection. The building houses fifteen residential units. The block was built in 1912, a period in which Willimansett was growing rapidly as a housing area serving the industries of adjacent Holyoke. The area had benefited from the construction of a bridge across the Connecticut River in 1893, followed by the introduction of streetcar service two years later. Most of the early residents of this block shared the ethnic affiliation of its builder, the French Canadian Louis Carreau. Carreau was a prominent builder in Chicopee and Holyoke, but most of his residential buildings were wood-frame single or multiunit buildings.

Built in 1917 for a bank founded in 1872 by Chester Chapin, it is a notable local example of Classical Revival architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It now houses other commercial businesses. Description and history The Chapin National Bank Building is located in downtown Springfield, at the northeast corner of Main and Lyman Streets. It is a two- story masonry structure, built out of cast stone. The Lyman Street facade has a classical Doric frieze, with four monumental fluted columns set in antis. The Main Street facade originally had a similar appearance, except for the main building entrance, but this has been obscured or replaced by modern paneling, leaving only the frieze below the roofline. Chester Chapin, a native of nearby Ludlow, made a fortune first in stagecoach operations, and then in railroads and other businesses. He founded a bank in 1872, which was formally chartered as Chapin National Bank in 1878. Chapin was a city selectman and served a single term in the United States Congress (1875-77).

Life Lamormaini was born near Dochamps in the Duchy of Luxembourg (nowadays part of Manhay in the Belgian Luxembourg province), since 1482 part of the Habsburg Netherlands. His father, Everard Germain, was a farmer at the hamlet of Lamormenil, hence the name. Lamormaini studied first at the Jesuit gymnasium of Trier, and thence went to Prague, where he received his doctor's degree, and in 1590 entered the Jesuit Order in Brno. Ordained priest at Bratislava in 1596 and afterwards working as a teacher in ≈Ωilina and Prague, he was called to the Jesuit University of Graz in Styria as professor of philosophy in 1600, became professor of theology in 1606, and in 1614 was appointed rector of the college. His strong Catholic manners attracted Archduke Ferdinand II of Inner Austria, then residing at Graz Castle. Between the years 1621 and 1623 he stayed in Rome, but became in the latter year rector of the Jesuit college merged with the University of Vienna, and in 1637 rector of the academic college. From 1643 to 1645 he was provincial of the Austrian province of the Jesuit order, but was compelled to relinquish this office on account of his gout, which made his visitations a task of the greatest difficulty. During the last years of his life, he established a seminary for poor students in Vienna, the Ignatius- und Franciskus-Seminarium f√ºr Stipendisten. Father Confessor After the death of his fellow Jesuit Martin Becan in 1624, he became the confessor of Ferdinand II, and as such his name appears in the political affairs of the time. As counselor of the emperor, his enemies affirmed that it was not Ferdinand, but the Jesuits who ruled the empire. He was an intransigent proponent of the Counter-Reformation, and when the Protestant princes of the Empire were compelled by the 1629 Edict of Restitution to give up all former ecclesiastical property seized from the Catholic Church, Lamormaini was influential in having it used for the propagation of the Catholic faith. However, these measures met with opposition even by the Catholic estates and ultimately enfeebled the Imperial authority. Having unsuccessfully tried to restrain Ferdinand from antagonizing the French by interfering in the War of the Mantuan Succession, Lamormaini was placed in an unpleasant position when the Spaniards accused him of espousing the cause of their enemies, and tried to have him banished from court. But Lamormaini was able to vindicate himself. His concerns became real, when the French Cardinal Richelieu abandoned the common Catholic cause and had the Treaty of B√§rwalde signed with the Swedish Empire in 1631. Lamormaini also took part in the proceedings against the emperor's removed generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein in January 1634. Lamormaini's rise ended with the emperor's death in 1637. He was offered a large sum by the Senate of Hamburg in recognition of his services on the occasion of the election of Ferdinand III as King of the Romans. The city of Augsburg, in gratitude for the services he had rendered to it, erected a costly altar in the church of the Viennese Novitiate. He died at Vienna. By his advice many Jesuit institutions were established in the empire. He took a leading part in the Counter-Reformation in the Habsburg lands of Austria, Styria, Bohemia, and Moravia. Works Only a part of the biography of Ferdinand II upon which Lamormaini labored appeared, \\"Ferdinand II, Romanorum Imperatoris, Virtutes\\" (1638); this was republished frequently, and in different languages.

Located in the heart of Chicopee at Market Square, the building (built 1871) is in the Italianate style, with a rose window (usually associated with churches) and a tower modeled on that of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Charles Edward Parker. History and architecture Chicopee purchased land from the Ames Manufacturing Company in 1869 as a site for its new city hall, and a committee of leading citizens was established to oversee its design and construction. The committee selected Charles E. Parker of Boston to design the new building, and construction took place in 1871. Parker's design was modelled on the Palazzo Vecchio, the historic town hall of Florence in Tuscany, Italy. The building was dedicated on December 21, 1871. By far the most prominent feature of the building is its tower, similar to its Florentine inspiration. It is topped by a golden eagle statue weighing and having a wingspan. The tower houses a bell, which was historically used on public occasions and to announce fire alarms. A clock mechanism was added in 1888, with faces on three of the tower's four sides. The civic building is unusual for having a rose window, usually associated with churches and finished in stained glass. The building continues to be used for city offices. The police station was originally located in the basement, but was moved in 1929 to a newly constructed annex before later being moved to the Chicopee Falls section of the city where it presently shares its own complex with the Chicopee Fire Department. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. As of 2020 the City Hall is undergoing a major external renovation project.

It has also anchored the southern part of Springfield's downtown area where it begins transitioning to more residential use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Colonial Block is located near the southern end of the built-up commercial downtown area of Springfield. It is on the north side of Main Street at the southeast corner with Stockbridge Street, and is adjacent to the McKinney Building to the east, across Crossett Lane, and abuts the Guenther & Handel's Block on Stockbridge Street. It is five stories in height, with a facade of yellow brick and brown sandstone. The Main Street facade is eleven bays, articulated by brick pilasters with stone capitals on the upper levels. Projecting polygonal bays at intervals give the facade an undulating character, in part because the projections are continued in the elaborate bracketed cornice. The ground floor storefronts, of which there are three on Main Street, have been modernized, with plate glass display windows flanking recessed entrances. The building was built as a speculative venture in 1902 by a local builder and real estate developer, Pascal Morse. It is a relatively rare example of a mixed use building from the period, in particular for its inclusion of residences, at a time when most building in the area were built for commercial and retail purposes. Its first floor was for built for retail use, the second floor housed offices and commercial space, and the upper three floors were residential. The building marked a transitional area between the urban downtown center of Springfield to the north, and more residential areas to the south. It also features distinctive Georgian Revival details not found on many other Springfield buildings. For many years, the principal retail tenant in the building was a furniture store.

It purports to be a direct communication between the head of Iraqi Intelligence, General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, to Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, outlining mission training which Mohamed Atta, one of the organizers of the September 11 attacks, supposedly received in Iraq. The letter also claims that Hussein accepted a shipment from Niger, an apparent reference to an alleged uranium acquisition attempt that U.S. President George W. Bush cited in his January 2003 State of the Union address. The authenticity of the letter has been disputed since it was first made public in December 2003. In 2008, journalist Ron Suskind claimed that it was a forgery created by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), under the direction of the White House. Two of Suskind's sources denied having knowledge of anyone in their chain of command ordering the forging the letter. John Conyers, Chairman of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, released a report into the allegations in 2009, in which he concluded that \\"the Administration figures who ordered and authored the apparent forgery ... remain unidentified\\".  Background  On December 13, 2003, the day of Saddam Hussein's capture by US forces, The Daily Telegraph of London ran a front-page story that not only claimed Saddam Hussein had trained one of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, but also that his government, assisted by a \\"small team from the Al Qaeda organization\\", was expecting to receive a suspicious consignment from the country of Niger. This exclusive article, and a second piece, were both written by Con Coughlin, executive foreign editor to the paper.Coughlin, Con (December 13, 2003). \\"Terrorist behind September 11 strike was trained by Saddam\\". Daily Telegraph.Coughlin, Con (December 13, 2003). \\"Does this link Saddam to 9/11?\\" Daily Telegraph. Coughlin's information came from a secret intelligence memorandum, purportedly handwritten during Saddam Hussein's final days in power and discovered later by the newly formed Iraqi Interim Government, which summarized an operational relationship between Mohamed Atta, a known associate of al-Qaeda and one of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS). The letter was signed by General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, chief of IIS, and directed to the President of Iraq. Coughlin said that he had received this document from a \\"senior member of the Iraqi interim government\\", though this person \\"declined to reveal where and how they obtained it.\\"\\"The Capture of Saddam Hussein\\". Meet The Press. December 14, 2003.  Content  Habbush's July 1, 2001, letter is labeled \\"Intelligence Items\\" and is addressed: \\"To the President of the Ba'ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you.\\" It continues:  Initial reaction to the letter  Ayad Allawi Ayad Allawi, interim Prime Minister of Iraq, was quoted in the original report, offering personal assurance over the document's authenticity: \\"We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam's involvement with al-Qaeda. ... But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far. It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al-Qaeda, he had contact with those responsible for the September 11 attacks.\\" The story was quickly picked up and repeated by several conservative columnists in the US, including syndicated columnist Deroy MurdockMurdock, Deroy (December 15, 2003). . National Review. Archived from the original on June 17, 2010. and William Safire.Safire, William (December 15, 2003). \\"From the 'Spider Hole'\\" New York Times. Safire talked about the document in an op-ed for the New York Times, claiming Saddam had attempted to cover-up his links to 9/11 by assassinating Abu Nidal, who the letter claims was with Mohammed Atta in Iraq. Three weeks later, in an interview with the Rocky Mountain News, Vice President Dick Cheney spoke more broadly on Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations:  Doubts  On December 17, 2003, a Newsweek article titled \\"Terror Watch: Dubious Link Between Atta And Saddam\\", by Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball, outlined some of the main reasons to doubt the authenticity of the letter: The article also quoted an Iraq document expert named Hassan Mneimneh, as well as unnamed US officials, who claim that the document was probably part of \\"a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents\\".  Ron Suskind's allegation  Ron Suskind, in his 2008 book The Way of the World, claimed that the Habbush letter had been forged by the White House, with the co-operation of senior CIA officials, including Robert Richer, the Associate Deputy Director of Operations. The letter was intended to be used as evidence of a link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, thereby further justifying the invasion of Iraq. Suskind goes on to describe what he believes happened next: Richer spoke to John Maguire, a CIA Iraq expert, who said that this plan would not work, as Habbush would not sign anything himself because the insurgency would harm his family. This, by Suskind's account, led to the White House telling the CIA to hand-write the letter itself. Suskind's book says that this new order was eventually passed down to the Iraq Operations Group, who carried it out. Maguire left for Baghdad to help run the CIA station there and was not involved directly in the mission, other than discussing the mission with Richer. Suskind also contends that Habbush, who still carries a $1 million reward for his capture, was secretly resettled in Jordan by the CIA with $5 million in US taxpayers' money. Suskind claimed to have held tape-recorded interviews with Richer, Maguire, and Nigel Inkster of the British Secret Intelligence Service, in which they apparently testified that the White House was behind the forging of the letter.. NPR. August 7, 2008. Archived from the original on August 28, 2008. According to a partial transcript of one of Suskind's interviews with Richer, published on Suskind's website, Richer saw a letter on White House stationery that had been passed down the ranks of the CIA ‚Äì through George Tenet, then-CIA director, then to James Pavitt, the Deputy Director of Operations, then to Pavitt's chief of staff, who passed it on to Richer. The letter, which Richer said might or might not have come from the vice president's office, described a plan to create a forged document and release it \\"as essentially a representation of something Habbush says\\". On August 5, 2008, the White House issued a statement on behalf of George Tenet, Robert Richer and John Maguire, addressing Suskind's allegation. Tenet said: The CIA issued its own statement on August 22, 2008, saying that Suskind's allegations regarding Habbush \\"did not happen\\", and Tenet followed the same day with a second statement saying that Suskind's charges were \\"demonstrably false in every regard.\\" Nigel Inkster told the Guardian that \\"Mr Suskind's characterisation of our meeting is more the stuff of creative fiction than serious reportage\\".  Subsequent reactions  In The American Conservative on August 7, 2008, Philip Giraldi stated that \\"extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community\\" told him that Suskind's basic story about the White House ordering the forgery was correct but that some of his details were not. According to Giraldi, his source cleared CIA officials George Tenet, Robert Richer, and John Maguire of involvement, but stated that Dick Cheney ordered the forgery using the Office of Special Plans run by Douglas Feith. Author Joe Conason noted that Ayad Allawi had visited CIA headquarters in Langley just days before speaking with Con Coughlin of the Telegraph.Conason, Joe (August 8, 2008). \\"New evidence suggests Ron Suskind is right\\". Salon. Coughlin, in a blog post highly critical of Suskind, confirmed that he had indeed received the letter from Ayad Allawi. He also called the letter a \\"leak\\" and said he got it in November 2003, in Baghdad.Coughlin, Con (August 19, 2008). \\"The Great WMD Conspiracy Theory Unravels\\". Daily Telegraph. John Conyers, Chairman of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, released a statement on August 11, 2008 indicating that he had instructed his staff to review a number of Suskind's allegations. On August 20, he wrote to six current and former officials with the Bush administration‚ÄîTenet, Richer, Maguire, Lewis Libby, A. B. Krongard, and John Hannah‚Äîrequesting that they contact his committee staff regarding the allegations. A month later, his inquiry was reported to have made little progress. In January 2009, Conyers released his report entitled Reining in the Imperial Presidency that he described as \\"detailing the abuses and excesses of the Bush administration and recommending steps to address them.\\" He reiterated Suskind's allegation and stated that he received no information from the officials that confirmed any knowledge of the fabrication.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Cutler and Porter Block is located on the north side of downtown Springfield, on the south side of Lyman Street opposite the Amtrak railyard. It is a brick structure, four stories in height, with an elaborate cornice and parapet on the front, and a slightly less elaborate one on the exposed west side. Top-floor windows are set in round-arch openings in the Romanesque style, while the first two floors are faced in stone, with ground-floor window bays filled with glass blocks. The four story brick building was constructed in 1894 for the firm of Cutler and Porter Inc, a wholesaler of shoes, boots, and rubber goods, founded in 1880. It was designed by F.S. Newman, and made to be visually sympathetic to the adjacent Produce Exchange Building. Cutler and Porter occupied the building until 1907. In the 1920s the firm W.F. Young, Inc., founded in Meriden, Connecticut, occupied half of the building, eventually taking it over entirely. Young remodeled the premises to accommodate its business, the production of horse liniments, and made changes to the facade, integrating its logo into the brickwork.

It is based on a book by Israeli author Gadi Taub and is geared towards both children and adults as it tells the story of the magical summer that Assaf fell in love for the first time with a neighborhood girl and became close friends with the witch who lived on his street. Summary The Witch From Melchet Street is told from the perspective of a grown up Assaf, remembering what it was like to be young and in love and the quirky friend who helped him through it. Plagued by her own broken heart, the three-hundred-year-old witch (with a surprisingly youthful appearance) finds it easy to sympathize with her little neighbor friend, who‚Äôs spending his summer pining over a little neighborhood girl who hardly acknowledges his existence. Nearly two decades after the summer Assaf is still gripped by his memories. Since then, the little girl has grown up and moved away, but Assaf never left. ‚ÄúWhen you live in the house you grew up in, your childhood is always right beside you,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúYou buy cigarettes where you used to buy popsicles, you sit at a cafe overlooking your old school.‚Äù Now, when Assaf spots his first love wandering through his neighborhood, he can‚Äôt help but follow a few steps behind her, keeping her hot pink dress in sight at all times. As he watches her walk, he can't help but remember the brassy little girl who, long ago, showed no remorse while breaking his heart.

(n√©e Janina Siestrzewitowska; 1900‚Äì1988), later known as Anna Borkowska, was a Polish cloistered Dominican nun who served as the prioress of her monastery in Kolonia Wile≈Ñska near Wilno (now Pavilnys near Vilnius, Lithuania). She was a graduate of the University of Krak√≥w who had entered the monastery after her studies. During World War II, under her leadership, the nuns of the monastery sheltered 17 young Jewish activists from Vilnius Ghetto and helped the Jewish Partisan Organization (FPO) by smuggling weapons. In recognition of this, in 1984 she was awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Hiding Jews Patron Saint of Dominican Sisters, Blessed Lucy, in Dominican habit Vilnius (Vilna) was taken over by the Germans on 24 June 1941, in Operation Barbarossa, and the killing of the Jews began almost immediately. Mother Betranda first inquired about saving Jews following the start of the Ponary massacre in July 1941. She initially sought to gain the support of the Wilno Catholic leadership, but they rebuffed her efforts out of fear that the Nazi German occupation forces would destroy church property and kill any Christians found to be aiding Jews. Acting on her own initiative, Mother Betranda then took in 17 members of Hashomer Hatzair, a local Zionist group, and hid them within the grounds of her monastery. The activists included Abba Kovner, the movement's leader, Abraham Sutzkever, Arie Wilner and Edek Boraks. They helped the nuns with working their fields, while Kovner, realizing the goals of Hitler's Final Solution, worked on organizing a political resistance to the occupation and writing his manifesto for the later uprising. When several of her nuns objected, Mother Bertranda reportedly threatened them with expulsion from the monastery and excommunication from the faith. Some of the Hashomer Hatzair members later decided to leave their monastery hideout and to return to the Jewish Ghetto in Vilnius, where they organized an underground resistance movement, the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO). Helping Jewish resistance Soon after that, Mother Bertranda left the monastery and went to the Ghetto to volunteer her services. She was dissuaded from this by Kovner, who asked that she organize the procurement of supplies instead. She and the other Dominican nuns then took it upon themselves to help the Jewish resistance by smuggling in arms and ammunition. The other nuns of the community included Sister Bernadeta (Julia Michrowska), Sister Cecylia (Maria Roszak), Sister Diana (Helena Frackiewicz), Sister Imelda (Maria Neugebauer), Sister Jordana (Maria Ostrejko), Sister Ma≈Çgorzata (Irena Adamek) and Sister Stefania (Stanis≈Çawa Bednarska). In this they became among the first to supply hand grenades and other weapons to the Vilnius Ghetto underground. Between August and September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated and some 12,000 men, women and children were deported to camps in Estonia. The uprising, organized by FPO on 1 September 1943 was crushed. The final Nazi destruction of whatever remained of the Ghetto followed. In September 1943, Mother Bertranda was arrested by the Nazi German occupation authorities and sent to a labor camp at Perwejniszki near Kovno (, now Pravieni≈°kƒós near Kaunas, Lithuania). The monastery was closed and the community of nuns was forced to disperse. After the war, Mother Bertranda asked for a dispensation from her vows and left the monastery, where she adopted the name Anna Borkowska. Recognition In 1984, Borkowska, now living alone in a small apartment in Warsaw, was awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Abba Kovner, one of the young Jews who had been saved by Borkowska, personally presented a medal to her at a ceremony in Poland. She and [Sister] Cecylia Roszakcan were two members of this monastic community to be honored, according to the statistics given by Yad Vashem.

It is a large breed, with males averaging over 100 pounds. They have long low-set earage, heavy flew, and dewlap similar to their ancestors from the Ardennes. They carry more excess skin on average than the American Blue Gascon Hound. As a modern crossbreed, it is not formally recognized by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. History The creation of this breed is very recent, but the stem stock goes back to medieval northern France and the hounds of St. Hubert. Big game hounds of the old Bloodhound/Talbot/St. Hubert type inhabited American soil for many years, and these were crossed with a variety of other hounds for coldtrailing work. The Majestic people say they crossed these Bloodhounds with \\"western big-game hounds.\\" These dogs may have been of the Gascon type like the Old Line dogs or even strains from those long ago Porcelaines that went west with the Rousseau family. Lee Newhart, Jr., and several others created the National Majestic Tree Hound Association in 1980 and registered the first hounds in that year.

It is very closely related to the Radon transform, and coincides with it in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the X-ray transform of a function is defined by integrating over lines rather than over hyperplanes as in the Radon transform. The X-ray transform derives its name from X-ray tomography because the X-ray transform of a function ∆í represents the attenuation data of a tomographic scan through an inhomogeneous medium whose density is represented by the function ∆í. Inversion of the X-ray transform is therefore of practical importance because it allows one to reconstruct an unknown density ∆í from its known attenuation data. In detail, if ∆í is a compactly supported continuous function on the Euclidean space Rn, then the X-ray transform of ∆í is the function X∆í defined on the set of all lines in Rn by :Xf(L) = \\\\int_L f = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} f(x_0+t\\\\theta)dt where x0 is an initial point on the line and Œ∏ is a unit vector giving the direction of the line L. The latter integral is not regarded in the oriented sense: it is the integral with respect to the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean line L. The X-ray transform satisfies an ultrahyperbolic wave equation called John's equation. The Gauss hypergeometric function can be written as an X-ray transform . References *.

Built about 1735, it is one of the city's few surviving pre-Revolutionary buildings. It is now maintained as a museum property by the local historical society. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Joseph Dewey House is located south of downtown Westfield, on the west side of South Maple Street (United States Route 202). It is a wood frame structure, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters set on tall paneled blocks, and topped by a frieze and gabled pediment. The flanking first-floor windows are also topped by gabled lintels. The house was built in about 1735 for Joseph Dewey, whose family had been living in the Westfield area since the mid-17th century. Dewey was a local farmer who was also involved in local politics. His grandson Benjamin bought the house later in the 18th century, and added a gristmill and sawmill to his property. He enlarged the house and added Federal style details. The house remained in the Dewey family until 1847. The property then went through a succession of owners, including a several-year period in which a Dewey descendant owned it. The mills were sold off, and redeveloped by the papermaker Crane & Co. In 1873 the property was purchased by Emma Jane Turner, and it remained in her family for about 100 years. In the 1970s, under threat of demolition, it was acquired by the West Hampden Historical Society, moved to its present location, and carefully restored to its early colonial state. It is now operated by the society as a house museum.

Description and history Driscoll's Block is located in downtown Springfield, on the southeast side of Worthington Street, just southwest of Stearns Square. It is a modest four-story brick building, with a flat roof and decorative corbelled brick cornice. The ground floor houses a single store front, with recessed entrances (one to the retail space and the other to the upstairs) flanking a display window. Windows on the second and third floors are set in segmented-arch openings, in two groups of three with shared sills. Fourth-floor windows are similarly arranged, but are set in round-arch openings. The exterior of the building was, at the time of its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, notable for a series of mid-20th-century advertising stencils that were applied to its eastern facade after the 1940 demolition of the adjacent building. Those advertisements have since faded significantly. The block was built for J.R. Driscoll, and at first housed a bowling alley. This business ran until 1915, and was followed by a succession of tenants, including briefly a Sears and Roebuck branch. The tenants have principally been manufacturing or warehousing concerns.

Roughly bounded by Front, Depot, Dwight, Exchange, and Chestnut Streets, it encompasses a variety of housing built for mill workers at Chicopee's mills during the 19th century. This cluster is one of few remnants of such housing, which was built on a larger scale now diminished by urban renewal. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history Chicopee's major industrial history began in 1832, when the Chicopee River was dammed, with textile mills beginning to operate soon afterward. Funded largely by investors from Boston, including early investors in mills at Lowell, a number of mills were built between 1832 and 1841. Four separate firms were consolidated into the Dwight Manufacturing Company in 1856; Edmund Dwight, for whom it was named, was from a prominent local family who was a lawyer and businessman in Boston. Early mill owners built boarding houses to attract single young women from area farms, offering concerned parents the security of a supervised living environment for their daughters. One typical boarding house is the brick building at 2-6-10 Dwight Street, which was built about 1832 for the Springfield Canal Company and sold to the Dwight Company in 1844. Later housing catered more toward immigrant families, who eventually came to dominate mill employment. A good example of this type is at 15-17 Chestnut Street, a modest two-story brick building with Greek Revival style. The district is composed of buildings on or near the city block formed by Front, Depot, Dwight, Exchange, and Chestnut Streets, and includes buildings dating from 1830 to the 1870s. These buildings were owned by the mills until they shutdown in 1927, after which they were sold into private hands. These types of buildings were built in large numbers in the areas near the mills, but many have been demolished for subsequent development or significantly altered.

Friedrich Company, a manufacturer of metal architectural parts. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Friedrich Block occupies a prominent location in downtown Holyoke, at the northwest corner of Main and Sargent Streets. It is a four-story brick structure with a diversity of Renaissance Revival styling on its street-facing exteriors. The ground floor is finished mainly in dressed brownstone, although it as also been significantly altered by its commercial tenants over the years. The upper floors are organized into groups of window bays set in brick, with intervening slightly-projecting bay windows finished in metal. The brick is laid to give a banding effect, which alters to form keystone-like forms above the windows. Windows on the second and third floors are set in rectangular openings, while those on the third floor are set in round-arch openings. The building is crowned by a projecting metal cornice, with garlanding, dentil work and modillions. The building was constructed in 1908 by the E.H. Friedrich Company, a manufacturer of metal architectural parts with a factory in the city; it was designed by local architect George P. B. Alderman, and the company's metal parts may have been used in its construction. At the time of the building's construction the city was engaged in an effort to build housing that was more resistant to fire than wood frame tenements. This building was designed to house fifteen residential units and three storefronts. The building has undergone only modest alterations over the years, principally by the commercial tenants on the ground floor. Its longest- serving commercial tenant was the Weinstein Furniture Company, which operated on the premises from 1926 to 1995; Samuel Weinstein purchased the building in 1948. The apartments, which housed an ethnic diversity of primarily factory workers, saw significant wear as well as damage from vandalism. The building has recently been rehabilitated.

The building once featured an onion dome at the corner, but this was removed sometime in the 20th century. Early tenants included prominent local clothiers and doctors.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Guenther & Handel's Block is located near the southern end of the built-up commercial downtown area of Springfield. It is on the east side of Stockbridge Street just north of its junction with Main Street, from which it is separated by the Colonial Block. It is a three- story brick building with vernacular Greek Revival styling. Its facade is essentially five bays in width, although the upper two floors only have windows in the three rightmost bays. The ground floor is arranged with a storefront in the right three bays, with display windows in the inner two and the entrance on the right. The building's left bays are both occupied by doors. The block was built in 1845, and is one of the oldest commercial buildings in downtown Springfield. It was built for Elam Stockbridge, who laid out and began to develop Stockbridge Street in 1839. In the 1880s the ground floor business was a grocery shop, which in 1913 was acquired and operated by Emil Guenther and his brother-in-law, Richard Handel. The grocery operation had a local reputation for high-quality goods from around the world, and used the second floor of the building as a kitchen. It remained within the family and at the same location until 1972; the business was sold out of the family and moved to other premises in 1973.

Located across the street from the Springfield Armory, they were built in the 1830s, and are the two of the oldest commercial buildings in Springfield. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Gunn and Hubbard Blocks are located northeast of downtown Springfield, on the south side of State Street at its junction with Walnut Street. They are set facing north toward the historic Springfield Armory grounds, across State Street. They are brick buildings of similar late Federal style, 3-1/2 stories in height, and are joined by a party wall. The Gunn Block (473-477 State Street) is seven bays wide, and has a slightly trapezoidal shape, owing to its position on the street corner. The ground floor has two store fronts flanking a center entrance, which provides access to the residential spaces on the upper floors. The Hubbard Block (461-471 State Street) is eleven bays wide. Built in two stages, its older portion is like the Gunn Block seven bays, with a similar configuration, including chimneys at each end. The extension is four bays, and also has chimneys at the outer end. The Gunn Block was built in 1830 by Elisha Gunn, who traded in goods from the West Indies. The Hubbard Block was built five years later by Asahel Hubbard, an inspector at the Armory, as a real estate venture. His principal tenant was Jonathan Bangs, the operator of a local grist mill, and the second floor housed a large meeting space used by community groups such as the Masons. As the 19th century progressed, the center of commerce in Springfield moved to what is now the downtown area, but these two blocks continued to serve the neighborhood's needs until the 1890s, when Winchester Square became more important.

This was the county's second courthouse. The first courthouse was a small meetinghouse structure built in 1740, and the second and was constructed in 1822, but by the 1860s, popular pressure was developing for a new proper courthouse. A grand jury indicted the county commissioners in 1869 for official misconduct since the courthouse did not have fireproof storage for the registry of deeds and the safekeeping of public records. This forced the county to build a new courthouse. Construction began in late 1871, and the building was dedicated on April 28, 1874. The original building cost $214,068. The site, within the middle of a city block and measuring 160 by 90 feet, cost $75,716. The building is shaped roughly like the capital letter I, with the main facade emphasizing vertical lines, tall windows, and two tall dormers on either side of the bell tower. The facades were built of light gray Monson granite in rough-faced random ashlar masonry, with smooth-faced trim. The overall design reflects Richardson's evolution as a designer, showing development from the Brattle Square Church. In his 1972 treatise on Springfield history, Town Into City, Dr. Michael Frisch, professor of American Studies at University at Albany, described the structure as \\"the single most impressive building of the period [1840 to 1880], well symboliz[ing] Springfield's new importance in the life and economy of its region\\". The courthouse as it appeared in 1908, before its renovation and removal of the dormers The county's growth eventually pushed the probate court and registry of deeds into another building in 1907, and the county built a large addition to the building between 1908 and 1912. This was designed by Richardson's successor firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. The sloping roof and high dormers were eliminated in the remodeling, making it difficult to visualize some parts of Richardson's original design. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Today, it houses the juvenile and Western Division of the Massachusetts Housing Court. The Courthouse is part of the Court Square Historic District.

Records throughout the 1970s. Each album (usually a 2-record set) contained a wide variety of tracks by artists under contract to Warner Bros. and its subsidiary labels (primarily Reprise Records); often these were singles, B-sides, non-hit album tracks, or otherwise obscure material, all designed to arouse interest in the artists' regular albums. Also found on some were humorous, bizarre interstitial audio material‚Äîclips from old records and movies, short skits, found sound, etc.-- and most albums featured clever, humorous cover art and liner notes. Most of the 1970s albums were compiled and annotated by Barry Hansen, better known as Dr. Demento.  Overview  Warner advertised the Loss Leaders albums by magazine and by inserting special illustrated inner sleeves in all of its regular album releases, listing all of the currently available Loss Leaders and including an order form. Each Loss Leader double album was priced at US$2, significantly less than a comparable regular-release double album of the time. (There were also a few single disc issues in 1969-71, and at least one triple disc set.) The fact that Warner sold these double albums at low cost in hopes of increasing sales of their regular releases is the source of the series name Loss Leaders. The first Loss Leaders compilation was The 1969 Warner/Reprise Songbook, featuring a wide range of artists from Miriam Makeba to the Mothers of Invention; the last of the original series was the punk and new wave- themedTroublemakers in 1980.

The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. Its title refers to the surrealist game, Cadavre Exquis, invented by Andr√© Breton, in which the participants draw consecutive sections of a figure without seeing what the previous person has drawn, leading to unpredictable results, and is meant to describe the meandering nature of the film with its unpredictable foray into the world of political manipulations, as well as the (\\"illustrous\\") corpses of the murdered judges. In 2008, the film was selected to enter the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved.Massimo Bertarelli, Il cinema italiano in 100 film: i 100 film da salvare, Gremese Editore, 2004, . Plot The film starts with the murder of Investigating Judge Vargas in Palermo, amongst a climate of demonstrations, strikes and political tension between the Left and the Christian Democratic government. The subsequent investigation failing, the police assign Inspector Rogas (Lino Ventura), a man with a firm faith in the integrity of the judiciary, to solve the case. While he is starting his investigation, two judges are killed. All victims turn out to have worked together on several cases. After Rogas discovers evidence of corruption surrounding the three government officials, he is encouraged by superiors \\"not to forage after gossip,\\" but to trail the \\"crazy lunatic who for no reason whatever is going about murdering judges.\\" This near admission of guilt drives Rogas to seek out three men wrongfully convicted by the murdered judges. He is joined by a journalist friend working for a far-left newspaper, Cusan. Rogas finds his likely suspect in Cres, a man who was convicted of attempting to kill his wife. Mrs. Cres accused her husband of trying to kill her by poisoning her rice pudding, which she escaped only because she fed a small portion first to her cat, who died. Rogas concludes that he was probably framed by his wife, and seeks him out, only to find that he has disappeared from his house. Meanwhile another investigating judge is killed, and eyewitnesses see two young revolutionaries running away from the scene. Rogas, close to finding his man, is demoted, and told to work with the political division to pin the crimes on the revolutionary Leftist terrorist groups. Rogas discovers that his phone is tapped. He seeks out the Supreme Court's president (Max von Sydow) in order to warn him that he is most likely the next victim. The president details a philosophy of justice wherein the court is incapable of error by definition. Music from a party in the same building leads to Rogas discovering the Minister of Justice (Fernando Rey) at the party with many revolutionary leaders, amongst them the editor of the revolutionary paper Cusan is working for, Galano, and Mrs. Cres. He and the Minister have a discussion, where the Minister reveals that sooner or later, his party will have to form a coalition with the Communist Party, and that it will be their task to prosecute the far-leftist groups. The murder of the judges as well as Rogas's investigations help raise the tension and justify the prosecution of the far-left groups. Rogas also discovers that his suspect, Cres, is present at the party. Rogas meets with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party in a museum. Both of them are killed. Amongst rising tensions between revolutionaries and the government, which mobilizes the army, the murder of the Secretary-General is blamed on Rogas by the chief of police. The film ends with a discussion between Cusan and the vice-secretary of the Communist Party, who claims that the time is not yet ready for the revolution and the party will not react to the government's actions. \\"But then the people must never know the truth?\\", asks Cusan. The vice-secretary answers: \\"The truth is not always revolutionary.\\" It is a sardonic concluding comment on the strategy at the time of the 'historic compromise' with Christian Democracy adopted by the Communist party, referring back to the motto 'To tell the truth is revolutionary' adopted from Ferdinand Lassalle by Antonio Gramsci, the party's most famous former leader and author of the Prison Notebooks.

Illustrious Corpses was presented, out of competition, at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.

Serving both as the city administrative center and a public timepiece for the industrial city's workers, construction began on the Gothic Revival structure in 1871 to a design by architect Charles B. Atwood. Difficulties and delays in construction were compounded by Atwood's failure to deliver updated drawings in a timely manner, and the design work was turned over to H. F. Kilburn in 1874. The building was completed two years later at a cost of $500,000. It has housed city offices since then.

City Hall is a large stone structure in the Gothic Revival style, built with granite quarried in Monson. Basically rectangular in shape, it has transept-like wings on both long sides, near the ends. It has pointed-arch windows, and is structurally supported by Gothic buttresses. The roof is predominantly dark slate, with bands of red and green slate interspersed. The main tower is tall, and houses a bell weighing over . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and included in a boundary expansion of the North High Street Historic District in 1992.

During a busy Massachusetts tour in his 1912 presidential campaign, Woodrow Wilson concluded a day of touring in Boston, Worcester, and Springfield with a campaign rally on the evening of April 27, 1912 in the grand ballroom, in tandem with speeches by Dudley Field Malone and Mayor Newton D. Baker of Cleveland. * * Though prior to his campaign for president, then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt would lead a fundraiser for the American Red Cross in a packed hall in 1918. Following the legalization of boxing in Massachusetts, the grand hall was used for a time as a venue for hundreds of bouts, by the army and other promoters. * * At the end of the Second World War this space would be converted to a basketball court in 1946, with these changes reversed in 1973 for the city's centennial. On November 9, 1901, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union donated and dedicated a Temperance fountain modeled after the Gothic aesthetic of the City Hall building and made of the same Monson granite, which stands at the corner of Dwight and High Street today. The gift, costing between $1,500 and $2,000 at the time, was presented to Mayor Chapin by Mrs. Rosina A. Whiting, and was said to provide drinking water to originally be cooled in pipes by a chamber for ice beneath it. On its sides read two inscriptions from the Bible and one passage from Shakespeare's Othello, as follows- > O thou invisible spirit of wine, if > thou hast no name to be known > by, let us call thee devil. I give waters in the wilderness, > rivers in the desert. To > give drink to my people. He whose spirit is without restraint > is like a city that is broken > down and hath no walls. In contrast, during the Prohibition Era, City Hall's employees, reportedly including mayors and police chiefs of the era, would access a since-razed speakeasy across Dwight Street through a tunnel connected to the building. Later accounts of P. J. Murray's, better known as The Bud, described this tunnel as located in City Hall's basement or on its grounds, leading to a series of passageways hidden behind the former bar's fireplaces. * * It is unknown when such a tunnel was constructed or demolished; The Bud however, would be razed in 2015. A session of the aldermen was interrupted on April 29, 1930, while several councilors, as well as city employees, successfully extinguished a fire on building's roof started by high winds blowing embers from a large blaze in the Caspar Ranger Lumber Yard. Due to the severity of the other fires started across downtown, the public was evacuated and the roof fire had to be extinguished by hand, as too many hydrants were in use to provide adequate pressure for fire hoses. Contemporary history Up until the 1980s the clock and its bell were often used in special occasions, one of the last being a bell-strike during the re-lighting of the torch of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986 by President Reagan. However increasing maintenance costs and maintenance deference kept the clock from running much of the time in the latter half of 20th century, with one of the most notable problems being the collapse of a sub-ceiling above the bell chamber in 1975. Until a grate was put across the belfry, damage from birds remained a persistent problem, with one notable repair attempt leaving mechanics to fight off a reported 1,500 blackbirds that returned to roost during one evening in January 1982. For several years the clock gears had also been lubricated with standard motor oil rather than a specialty lubricant, leading to the coagulation of residue on the gear teeth. One problem that prevented the use of the bell was the seepage of water into the wooden driveshaft case, causing it to expand and warp. While the exact date the clock stopped regularly functioning is unknown, after about 30 years of being out of service the mechanism was restored in the Spring of 2018 by local steeplejack and arborist Dave Cotton, and a UMass professor emeritus of English, John Nelson, who worked on the clock of the Old Chapel previously. On July 4, 2018, the clock was restarted with new face lighting and repaired electrical systems, all from donated components and time. Due to problems with its mechanics, the bell however does not function and no immediate plans have been put into place to restore it in the foreseeable future. During a town hall meeting held at City Hall on September 29, 2018, Senator Elizabeth Warren first expressed interest in running for president in 2020, saying she would \\"take a hard look\\" at the idea; Warren would later make her candidacy official in Lawrence, Massachusetts on February 8, 2019.

The Classic Revival building was constructed in 1909 to a design by John Donohue, and was the first permanent branch library building in the Springfield public library system; it was funded in part by a grant from Andrew Carnegie. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999; it continues to serve as a library as a branch of the Springfield City Library system. Architecture and history The Indian Orchard Branch Library is located in Springfield's northeastern Indian Orchard neighborhood, at the junction of Worcester and Oak Streets. It consists of the original 1909 building, and an addition made to the rear. The original block is a single story in height, with walls that are mainly brick, and a slate hip roof. A gabled entry vestibule projects to the front, with the entrance recessed behind Tuscan columns. The flanking wall facades each have a band of three windows set in a shared opening. Both the building corners and window openings exhibit stone quoining. The interior retains many original features, including Tuscan columns and pilasters and brick fireplaces. Indian Orchard developed in the 19th century as a somewhat isolated enclave of industry and residence apart from the rest of the city. Its first library was a private effort founded in 1859 by the Indian Orchard Mills Corporation, which was offered as a free service to area residents. This library had a collection of 1500 volumes by 1884. The city's public library by then had a small collection of 900 volumes maintained by a volunteer. Calls for a permanent branch library began in 1901. Henry Kirke Wight donated space in a commercial building at Oak and Main Streets, which was put to use in 1901. Later in the decade, the city received a grant from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for new and updated library facilities, which was used in part to fund construction of the present building. It was designed by John Donohoe, a prominent local architect, and opened in 1909. The building was featured in a 1911 edition of The American Architect for its simple but elegant Classical Revival design.

Built in the 1870s and 1880s, with a major restyling to two of them in 1912, the buildings were a major factor in the urban development of the area north of the city's traditional core. They were listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Kennedy and Worthington Blocks occupy the length of one city block of Main Street in downtown Springfield, between Taylor and Worthington Streets. The buildings are built out of brick; the Worthington Block was built in two stages, and had a unifying facade of stone designed for it in 1914. It is separated from the Kennedy Block by a narrow alley, in which pedestrian bridges connect them at various points on the upper floors. Both are five stories in height, and have somewhat elaborate facades. The Kennedy Block is fourteen bays wide, with windows on the upper floors set in segmented-arch openings with red sandstone sills and lintels. An elaborate bracketed and dentillated cornice projects at the top of the facades facing both Main and Taylor Streets. The Worthington Block's Main Street facade is also fourteen bays wide, with differing treatments on each level. The most elaborate level is the fourth, where the windows are grouped under carved arches with medallions at the ends, and carved panels below the windows. Its main entrance is set near the center, surrounded by block pilasters topped by an elaborate entablature. The Kennedy Block was built in 1874, in part using the remains of an 1860 building heavily damaged by fire. It was built by Emerson Wight, a prominent local businessman who served four terms as mayor. It was the first building of four stories to be built in this area; it was damaged by fire, and rebuilt as a five-story in 1875. The Worthington Block was built in 1872 to a design by George Potter, and was extensively damaged by a fire in the building in 1888, and another in an adjacent building in 1893. Its 1914 stone facade is the work of E.C. and G.C. Gardner, local architects. The buildings have had a number of tenants important in Springfield's economic and civic life, including the offices of the Springfield Daily News, the Daily Union, and manufacturers such as Morgan Envelope and R.H. Smith.

Description and history The Kenwyn Apartments are located on the eastern edge of Springfield's Forest Park Heights neighborhood, at the northwest corner of Kenwood Park and Belmont Avenue. It is a four-story masonry structure, with Mission style construction and detailing. Built of stone, it has a stuccoed exterior, and other Mission elements such as round arch entries, barrel-style overhangs, and Spanish-style parapets. The block was built in 1916 by William H. Carpenter, during a brief period in which the Spanish Colonial Revival style was popular; it faded after some of its principal features (stucco walls and clay tiles) proved unsuitable for the climate. The city was at that time undergoing a residential building boom, in which large numbers of apartment houses were built along recently introduced streetcare lines. The building went through a rapid succession of owners, until it was acquired by the Pasquale Corporation in 1940. The building remained in its ownership for thirty years. Thereafter, with declining economic conditions in the neighborhood, the building again went through a number of owners. After a foreclosure proceeding in 1990 there were calls to tear the building down, but preservationists were able to propose a rehabilitation of the structure.

Probably built in the early 19th century, it is a fine local example of Federal style architecture. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Laflin‚ÄîPhelps Homestead is located on the eastern fringe of Southwick's village center, on the north side of Depot Street opposite its junction with Sheep Pasture Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It originally had a 1-1/2 story ell on the back, which was expanded to a full 2-1/2 stories sometime between 1830 and 1850. The main facade is five bays wide, with a single-story Victorian porch extending across the front. It has wooden corner quoining, and a fully pedimented gable with an oval window in the center. The interior follows a modified center hall plan, with the central staircase closed off from the hall and set further back than is typical for houses of its period. The right front parlor features a particularly fine Federal style fireplace mantel, and wide pine floors are found in several rooms. A barn, built c. 1820, was demolished in 2004; only its foundation remains. The date of the house's construction is uncertain: the property was purchased in 1809 by Heman Laflin, member of the locally prominent Laflin family, who were among Southwick's early settlers. It is not believed that there was a house on the property in 1807, so the house may have been built either by or for Laflin. The Laflins were the first family in the town to establish industry in Southwick, founding mills for the manufacture of gunpowder in 1775, some of which supported the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The house was purchased from the Laflin family by Marcus Phelps in 1865, in whose family it remained as of 2016. The house stands on just over , reduced from a larger farm parcel.

Probably built in the 1750s, it is a good local example of Georgian architecture, and it was for about a century an important local social gathering point, and a major stop on the east-west stagecoach road. Now a private residence, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Landlord Fowler Tavern stands east of downtown Westfield, on the south side of Main Street (United States Route 20, a major route through the Berkshires to the west). It is set a short way west of the confluence of the Little River with the Westfield River, at the southwest corner of Main and Exchange Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with two full stories topped by a broad gambrel roof. The steep portion of the roof is pierced by three gabled dormers, and a large brick chimney rises at its center. The front facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance. The entrance is a simplified modern version of its elaborate original, with pilasters rising to a scrolled pediment; the original is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The building is estimated to have been built in the 1750s, or no later than 1761, the year in which Daniel Fowler was granted a license to operate a tavern in Westfield center. It was for many years a center of business and civic affairs in the town as well as a rest stop for travelers on the post road, on which it was located. During the American Revolutionary War, it served as a muster site for the local militia, and was where the local committee of safety met. Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, a Hessian commander in the army of John Burgoyne, was quartered here after that army was captured at the end of the 1777 Saratoga campaign. The 1830 construction of the Hampshire and Hampden Canal led to a decline in business on the post road, and Westfield's business district eventually developed further to the west. By the 1860s the building was in use as a residence. It was used briefly as a cigar factory between 1885 and 1916. Its original Georgian front door surround, a classic Connecticut River valley pediment, was removed from the building in the early 20th century.

During sialoendoscopy a small endoscope is placed into the salivary glands through the salivary ducts that empty into the mouth. Sialoendoscopy is an efficient yet simple mode of treatment for major salivary gland obstructions, strictures and sialoliths (salivary stones). Depending on the obstruction, sialoendoscopy can be conducted under local anesthesia in an outpatient office or in the operating room under general anesthesia.  Conditions indicating sialoendoscopy  Salivary gland stones are one of the major causes of salivary gland infections (sialadenitis). These types of stones can be found in 1.2 percent of the general population.Rauch S GR: Diseases of the salivary glands. (ed. 6th). St. Louis: Mosby, 1970:997 The second leading cause of salivary obstruction is from strictures and adhesions, which can happen from prior salivary gland infections, including childhood infections like mumps. Most strictures could be seen in the parotid duct and mostly in the disease process of chronic recurrent sialadenitis.  Description of the technique  Generally, the salivary duct opening needs to be either dilated or incised prior to introduction of the endoscope. Once the sialoendoscope is in place, saline is utilized to dilate the salivary duct and its branching. Once the endoscopes are introduced into gland, the internal anatomy is explored either for diagnosis or for treatment of a specific disease entity. The endoscope is introduced into the gland through its natural orifice in the mouth or by a making a small incision in the duct opening. These techniques for introduction are completely intraoral techniques. Salivary gland stone removalNahlieli O, Nakar LH, Nazarian Y, Turner MD: Sialoendoscopy: A new approach to salivary gland obstructive pathology. J Am Dent Assoc 2006;137:1394  *When the diameter of the stone is 5mm or less, it can be removed purely by an endoscopic technique, particularly when the stone is located above the muscles that comprise the floor of the mouth. The four common techniques used to remove the salivary gland stones are: #The grasping technique #Using a small wire basket retrieval system #Mechanical Fragmentation #Laser fragmentation *When the diameter is larger than 5 mm, a twofold (endoscopic assisted) approach can be utilized. The endoscope is introduced and the stone localized, and then dissected and removed in an intraoral approach. After a sialolith is removed from an affected gland, a sialastic stent is inserted into the duct for two to four weeks for the duration of the healing process of the oral region and until normal function of the gland is restored. This prevents scar formation which can develop overlying the ductal opening into the mouth. Treatment of strictures and adhesions In the case of strictures or adhesions, the following technique can be used as a treatment modality. First the surgeon will make their diagnosis and find the exact location of the obstruction using a sialogram. Following this, the surgeon can use the endoscopic method. The first step in this is anesthetizing and laving the duct with 2 percent lidocaine and saline. If there is no improvement, the surgeon then can insert a dilation balloon, which can be inflated up to 3 mm. The pressure created by the inflation can be sufficient to dilate most strictures. Another technique for dilating strictures is to expand the stricture region with grasping forceps used as a dilator. Instrumentation The ability to perform this technique is the result of the development of miniaturized endoscopic imaging tools. The majority of sialoendoscopes that are currently in use are of the semirigid type. The semirigid endoscope allows for visualization of the diseased process, but the stiffness allows manipulation and navigation of the internal salivary anatomy. Multiple types of micro instrumentation are available, including grasping forceps, biopsy forceps, drills, needles, laser fibers, and lithotripters (although the last is currently unavailable in the US pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval). Multiple companies make various types of sialoendoscopes and instrumentation. There are advantages and disadvantages to all of the systems and none are recommended over the other [reference needed]. Different practitioners utilize different systems due to the experience and clinical training of the surgeon.

The area is prominent as the location of the Springfield Female Seminary building (77 Maple Street, built 1832, now in residential use), and for the distinctive homes of several of Springfield's prominent 19th century citizens. The house at 83 Maple Street, was first owned by Solomon Merrick, inventor of the monkey wrench, and was later owned by Ansel Phelps, the fourth mayor of Springfield. Townhouses at 76-78 and 80-84 Maple Street comprise the rest of the district; owners or occupants included Francis Fuller, owner of the Fuller Block, and Edmund Chapin, president of the John Hancock National Bank. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The cluster of buildings are located on the north and south sides of Maple Street, extending westward from its junction with Union Street. 83 Maple Street is at the corner on the north side; it was built in 1841, and is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture in brick, with a two-story columned portico across the front. The former seminary building stands just to its west; it is a two-story brick structure, with a three-bay facade and gabled roof.

The area represents a planned residential development covering several hundred acres, which was built in the mid to late 19th century. The architects of the development were John and William McKnight, who, in addition to developing and enforcing construction guidelines in the area, built and landscaped many of the properties. The area was largely built by 1910, and there has been little new construction in the area since. Most of the houses built in the area were constructed in most of the architectural styles that were popular between 1880 and 1990, although there is a predominance of the Queen Anne style. The McKnights began to develop the area, which had previously been mainly farmland, in 1870 with the purchase of a parcel on which they and a partner built their own homes. They proceeded over the following years to acquire additional parcels of land in the area, plat out roads, and either build houses themselves, or sell plots to other builders. They enforced some uniformity in the area through the use of deed restrictions, which required uniform setback requirements, banned fencing, and required a minimum cost of construction (the latter to prevent the building of inexpensive tenement-style housing). The neighborhood is roughly defined by the railroad tracks on the north and the Bay Street to the south. On the west it is roughly bounded by Armory and Magazine Streets, and on the east by Monmouth, Clifford, Bay, and Marion Streets. A portion of the neighborhood, encompassing some and 350 homes, was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. This was expanded in 1986 to and 884 properties, encompassing virtually the entirety of the McKnight's development.

Arrayed around the Memorial Square at the junction of Main and Plainfield Streets are seven buildings of architectural and/or historic significance, including the Memorial Church (now St. George's Greek Orthodox Church), and the former Memorial Square Branch Library, now a Greek cultural center. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history Springfield Street Railway Building in 2018 Memorial Square is now little more than a landscaped triangular area at the junction of Main and Plainfield Streets, with its northern boundary called Bradford Street. In the mid-19th century, the surrounding area was predominantly one of large estates of Springfield's business and civic elites. After the American Civil War, the area began to be developed, and the square became a focal point for civic development. The Memorial Church, which stands north of the triangular square, was built in 1866 to a design by Richard Upjohn and his son, Richard M. Upjohn; it is one of the city's architectural landmarks. On the west side of the square, the library was built in 1914 to a design by Edward Tilton of New York City; it is a significant local example of Italian Renaissance architecture. On the east side of the square is a row of five buildings. The most southerly was built in 1897 as the trolley barn for the Springfield Street Railway, a business owned by George Atwater, one of the area's estate owners. To its north stands the Memorial Square building, at six stories the tallest facing the square; it is a primarily residential building constructed in 1911. Three houses stand to its north, two of them distinguished examples of Queen Anne architecture, as well as the Classical Revival former parish house for the Memorial Church.
