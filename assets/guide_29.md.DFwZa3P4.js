The title of the film quotes the name of the game Alan Turing proposed for answering the question \\"Can machines think?\\", in his 1950 seminal paper \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\". It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during the Second World War. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance, and Mark Strong also star. It was released theatrically in the United States on November 28, 2014. The Imitation Game grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, winning for Best Adapted Screenplay, five nominations in the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and three nominations at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. It also received nine BAFTA nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival. The film was criticized by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and for downplaying Turing's homosexuality. However, the LGBT civil rights advocacy organisation the Human Rights Campaign honoured it for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience with its subtle and realistic approach. Plot In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break- in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. In 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from bovine tuberculosis. When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages. Turing is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him. Turing's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken. Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she'll undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done. In the 1950s, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives. The final scene shows an on screen message saying, \\"After a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. He was 41 years old. Between 1885 and 1967, approximately 49,000 homosexual men were convicted of gross indecency under British law. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous Royal Pardon, honouring his unprecedented achievements. Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by more than two years, saving over 14 million lives. It remained a government-held secret for more than 50 years. Turing's work inspired generations of research into what scientists called \\"Turing Machines\\". Today, we call them computers.\\" Cast Production Before Cumberbatch joined the project, Warner Bros. bought the screenplay for a reported seven-figure sum because of Leonardo DiCaprio's interest in playing Turing. In the end, DiCaprio did not come on board and the rights of the script reverted to the screenwriter. Black Bear Pictures subsequently committed to finance the film for $14 million. Various directors were attached during development including Ron Howard and David Yates. In December 2012, it was announced that Headhunters director Morten Tyldum would helm the project, making the film his English-language directorial debut. Bletchley Park, \\"the home of the codebreakers\\" where parts of the film were shot Principal photography began on September 15, 2013 in Britain. Filming locations included Turing's former school, Sherborne, Bletchley Park, where Turing and his colleagues worked during the war, and Central Saint Martins campus on Southampton Row in London. Other locations included towns in England such as Nettlebed (Joyce Grove in Oxfordshire) and Chesham (Buckinghamshire). Scenes were also filmed at Bicester Airfield and outside the Law Society building in Chancery Lane, and at West London Film Studios. Principal photography finished on November 11, 2013. The bombe seen in the film is based on a replica of Turing's original machine, which is housed in the museum at Bletchley Park. However, production designer Maria Djurkovic admitted that her team made the machine more cinematic by making it larger and having more of its internal mechanisms visible. The film's title refers to Turing's proposed test of the same name, which he discussed in his 1950 paper on artificial intelligence entitled \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\". The Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for US distribution rights at the European Film Market. The film is also a recipient of Tribeca Film Festival's Sloan Filmmaker Fund, which grants filmmakers funding and guidance with regard to innovative films that are concerned with science, mathematics, and technology. Music Desplat composed the film's score in under three weeks In June 2014, it was announced that Alexandre Desplat would provide the original score of the film. It was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Desplat uses continuous piano arpeggios to represent both Turing's thinking mind and the workings of a mechanical machine. He said of the complexity of the continuity and structure of the score: > [W]hen the camera at the end of the film has those beautiful shots of the > young boy, the young Alan, and he's meeting with the professor who's telling > him his friend Christopher is dead, and the camera is pushing in on him, I > play Christopher's theme that we heard very early on in the film. There's a > simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can > slowly but surely play that make it even stronger. The score received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, losing to the score of The Grand Budapest Hotel, also composed by Desplat. Release =Marketing= Following the Royal Pardon granted by the British government to Turing on December 24, 2013, the filmmakers released the first official promotional photograph of Cumberbatch in character beside Turing's bombe. In the week of the anniversary of Turing's death in June 2014, Entertainment Weekly released two new stills which marked the first look at the characters played by Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, and Allen Leech. On what would have been Turing's 102nd birthday on 23 June, Empire released two photographs featuring Mark Strong and Charles Dance in character. Promotional stills were taken by photographer Jack English, who also photographed Cumberbatch for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Princeton University Press and Vintage Books both released film tie-in editions of Andrew Hodges' biography Alan Turing: The Enigma in September 2014. The first UK and US trailers were released on 22 July 2014. The international teaser poster was released on September 18, 2014 with the tagline \\"The true enigma was the man who cracked the code\\". In November 2014, the Weinstein Company co- hosted a private screening of the film with Digital Sky Technologies billionaire Yuri Milner and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Attendees of the screening at Los Altos Hills, California included Silicon Valley's top executives, such as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Airbnb's Nathan Blecharczyk, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Director Tyldum, screenwriter Moore, and actress Knightley were also in attendance. In addition, Cumberbatch and Zuckerberg presented the Mathematics Prizes at the Breakthrough Awards on 10 November 2014 in honour of Turing. The bombe re-created by the filmmakers has been on display in a special The Imitation Game exhibition at Bletchley Park since November 10, 2014. The year-long exhibit features clothes worn by the actors and props used in the film. The official film website allowed visitors to unlock exclusive content by solving cryptic crossword puzzles supposedly conceived by Turing.The Imitation Game website, theimitationgamemovie.com; accessed November 18, 2014. The website puzzle was a shorter version of the Daily Telegraph puzzle of 13 January 1942 that was actually used in Bletchley Park recruitment during the war (and the puzzle was not set by Turing, who was no good at them). Google, which sponsored the New York Premiere of the film, launched a competition called \\"The Code-Cracking Challenge\\" on November 23, 2014. It is a skill contest where entrants must crack a code provided by Google. The prize/s will be awarded to entrant/s who crack the code and submit their entry the fastest. In November 2014, ahead of the film's US release, The New York Times reprinted the 1942 puzzle from The Daily Telegraph used in recruiting codebreakers at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Entrants who solved the puzzle could mail in their results for a chance to win a trip for two to London and a tour of Bletchley Park. TWC launched a print and online campaign on January 2, 2015 featuring testimonials from leaders in the fields of technology, military, academia, and LGBTQ groups (all influenced by Turing's life and accomplishments) to promote the film and Turing's legacy. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales all gave tribute quotes. There were also testimonials from LGBT leaders including HRC president Chad Griffin and GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis and from military leaders including the 22nd United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates. =Theatrical release= TIFF, September 2014 The film had its world premiere at the 41st Telluride Film Festival in August 2014, and played at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival in September. It had its European premiere as the opening film of the 58th BFI London Film Festival in October 2014. It began a limited theatrical release on November 28, 2014 in the United States, two weeks after its premiere in the United Kingdom on November 14. The US distributor TWC stated that the film would initially debut in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York, expanding to six new markets on December 12, before being released nationwide on Christmas Day. =Home media= The Imitation Game was released on March 31, 2015 in the United States in two formats: a one-disc standard DVD and a Blu-ray with a digital copy of the film. Reception =Box office= The Imitation Game grossed $91.1 million in North America and $142.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $233.5 million, against a budget of $14 million. It was the top-grossing independent film release of 2014. The film opened at number two at the UK box office behind the big-budget film Interstellar, earning $4.3 million from 459 screens. Its opening box office figure was the third highest opening weekend haul for a British film in 2014. Its opening was 107% higher than that of Argo, 81% higher than Philomena and 26% higher than The Iron Lady following its debut. Debuting in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York on 28 November, the film grossed $479,352 in its opening weekend with a $119,352 per-screen-average, the second highest per- screen-average of 2014 and the 7th highest of all time for a live-action film. Adjusted for inflation, it outperformed the Weinstein Company's own Oscar- winning films The King's Speech ($88,863 in 2010) and The Artist ($51,220 in 2011), which were also released on Thanksgiving weekend. The film expanded into additional markets on 12 December and was released nationwide on Christmas Day. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 280 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the 'prestige biopic' genre.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The film received a rare average grade of \\"A+\\" from market-research firm CinemaScore, and a 90% \\"definite recommend\\" rating from its core audience, according to PostTrak. It was also included in both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute's \\"Top 10 Films of 2014\\". The New York Observers Rex Reed declared that \\"one of the most important stories of the last century is one of the greatest movies of 2014\\". Kaleem Aftab of The Independent gave the film a five-star review, hailing it the \\"Best British Film of the Year\\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post described it as a \\"thoroughly engrossing Oscar- caliber movie\\", while critic James Rocchi added that the film is \\"strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic\\". Empire described it as a \\"superb thriller\\" and Glamour declared it \\"an instant classic\\". Peter Debruge of Variety added that the film is \\"beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed\\". Critic Scott Foundas stated that the \\"movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms\\". Critic Leonard Maltin asserted that the film has \\"an ideal ensemble cast with every role filled to perfection\\". Praise went to Knightley's supporting performance as Clarke, Goldenberg's editing, Desplat's score, Faura's cinematography and Djurkovic's production design. The film was enthusiastically received at the Telluride Film Festival and won the \\"People's Choice Award for Best Film\\" at TIFF, the highest prize of the festival. Cumberbatch signing autographs at the Toronto International Film Festival, September 2014 Cumberbatch's performance was met with widespread acclaim from critics. TIME ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation \\"the actor's oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times declared Turing \\"the role of Cumberbatch's career\\", while A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that it is \\"one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone asserted that the actor \\"gives an explosive, emotionally complex\\" portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it is a \\"performance for the ages ... proving he's one of the best actors working today\\". Foundas of Variety wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is \\"masterful ... a marvel to watch\\", Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as \\"delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic\\" and Owen Gleiberman of the BBC proclaimed it an \\"emotionally tailored perfection\\".Toronto Film Festival coverage, nytimes.com, 13 September 2014; accessed 18 November 2014. It is \\"a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll\\" declared Dave Calhoun of Time Out. In addition, Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded in her review, \\"It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression\\". The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, \\"whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work\\". Critic Roger Friedman wrote at the end of his review, \\"Cumberbatch may be the closest thing we have to a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier\\". While praising the performances of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of The Guardian stated that the film is \\"too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message\\". Tim Robey of The Telegraph described it as \\"a film about a human calculator which feels ... a little too calculated\\". Some critics also raised concerns about film's alleged reluctance to highlight Turing's homosexuality. British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: \\"Historically, The Imitation Game is as much of a garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code\\". Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting \\"a bizarre departure from the historical record\\" that changed Turing's rich life to be \\"multiplex-friendly\\". L.V. Anderson of Slate magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, \\"I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park\\". Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, \\"... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license – which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling.\\" Computing historian Thomas Haigh, writing in the journal Communications of the ACM, said that \\"the film is a bad guide to reality but a useful summary of everything that the popular imagination gets wrong about Bletchley Park\\", that it \\"combines the traditional focus of popular science writing on the lone genius who changes the world with the modern movie superhero narrative of a freak who must overcome his own flaws before he can save the world\\", and that, together with the likes of A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, is part of a trend of \\"glossy scientific biopic[s]\\" that emphasize those famous scientists who were surrounded by tragedy rather than those who found contented lives, which in turn affects the way \\"[s]ome kinds of people, and work, have become famous and others have not.\\" =The Turing family= Despite earlier reservations, Turing's niece Inagh Payne told Allan Beswick of BBC Radio Manchester that the film \\"really did honour my uncle\\" after she watched the film at the London Film Festival in October 2014. In the same interview, Turing's nephew Dermot Turing stated that Cumberbatch is \\"perfect casting. I couldn't think of anyone better.\\" James Turing, a great- nephew of the code-breaker, said Cumberbatch \\"knows things that I never knew before. The amount of knowledge he has about Alan is amazing.\\" Social action In January 2015, Cumberbatch, comedian-actor Stephen Fry, producer Harvey Weinstein, and Turing's great-niece Rachel Barnes launched a campaign to pardon the 49,000 gay men convicted under the same law that led to Turing's chemical castration. An open letter published in The Guardian urged the British government and the Royal family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to aid the campaign. The Human Rights Campaign's Chad Griffin also offered his endorsement, saying: \\"Over 49,000 other gay men and women were persecuted in England under the same law. Turing was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013. The others were not. Honor this movie. Honor this man. And honor the movement to bring justice to the other 49,000.\\" Aiding the cause were campaigner Peter Tatchell, Attitude magazine, and other high-profile figures in the gay community. In February 2015, Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, Jessica Alba, Bryan Cranston, and Anna Wintour among others joined the petition at Pardon49k.org demanding pardons for victims of anti-gay laws. Historians, including Justin Bengry of Birkbeck University of London and Matt Houlbrook of the University of Birmingham, argued that such a pardon would be \\"bad history\\" despite its political appeal, because of the broad variety of cases in which the historical laws were applied (including cases of rape) and the distortion of history resulting from an attempt to clean up the wrongdoings of the past post facto. Bengry also cites the existing ability of those convicted under repealed anti-homosexuality laws to have their convictions declared spent. This petition eventually resulted in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, informally known as the Alan Turing law, which serves as an amnesty law to pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts, and which was implemented on 31 January 2017. As the law and the disregard process applies only to England and Wales, groups in Northern Ireland and Scotland have campaigned for equivalent laws in their jurisdictions. Controversy Knightley portrayed code breaker Joan Clarke During production, there was criticism regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality, particularly condemning the portrayal of his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancée Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having \\"built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was\\". Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as \\"rather plain\\", and said: \\"I think they might be trying to romanticise it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense.\\" Speaking to Empire, director Tyldum expressed his decision to take on the project: \\"It is such a complex story. It was the gay rights element, but also how his (Turing's) ideas were kept secret and how incredibly important his work was during the war, that he was never given credit for it\\". In an interview for GQ UK, Matthew Goode, who plays fellow cryptographer Hugh Alexander in the film, stated that the script focuses on \\"Turing's life and how as a nation we celebrated him as being a hero by chemically castrating him because he was gay\\". The producers of the film stated: \\"There is not – and never has been – a version of our script where Alan Turing is anything other than homosexual, nor have we included fictitious sex scenes.\\" In a January 2015 interview with The Huffington Post, its screenwriter Graham Moore said in response to complaints about the film's historical accuracy: > When you use the language of \\"fact checking\\" to talk about a film, I think > you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact > check Monet's Water Lilies. That's not what water lilies look like, that's > what the sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like. That's the goal > of the piece. In the same interview, Tyldum stated: > A lot of historical films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia > page to you onscreen, like just reciting \\"and then he did that, and then he > did that, and then he did this other thing\\" – it's like a \\"Greatest Hits\\" > compilation. We wanted the movie to be emotional and passionate. Our goal > was to give you \\"What does Alan Turing feel like?\\" What does his story feel > like? What'd it feel like to be Alan Turing? Can we create the experience of > sort of \\"Alan Turing-ness\\" for an audience based on his life? For the most part, Hodges has not commented on the historical accuracy of the film, alluding to contractual obligations involving the film rights to his biography. Historical inaccuracies Several events depicted in the film did not happen in real life. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was just 42.3% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing that \\"shoe-horning the incredible complexity of the Enigma machine and cryptography in general was never going to be easy. But this film just rips the historical records to shreds\\". =Historical events= * The naming of the Enigma-breaking machine \\"Christopher\\" after Turing's childhood friend, with Turing the only cryptographer working on it while others either did not help or outright opposed it. *: In reality, this electromechanical machine was called \\"Victory\\" and it was a collaborative, not individual, effort. It was a British Bombe machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938, called bomba kryptologiczna, which had broken an earlier version of Germany's Enigma machines by the Polish Cipher Bureau before the Second World War. *: A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing in 1940 with a major contribution from mathematician Gordon Welchman, who goes unmentioned in the film, his contribution instead attributed to Hugh Alexander. * The building of only one machine, with Turing playing a large role in its construction. *:More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of chief engineer Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. None of them were built at Bletchley Park. * The overall plot arc in which the British cryptographers were stymied for the first few years of the war and then a sudden breakthrough enabled them to finally break Enigma. *: In reality, the Polish cryptanalysts Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski from the Polish Cipher Bureau had been breaking German Enigma messages since 1932. Their effort allowed the Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for the Polish secret service. Just before the war, the Polish secret service revealed their work to their French and British allies in a secret meeting on 26 and 27 July 1939,Ralph Erskine: The Poles Reveal their Secrets – Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry. Cryptologia. Rose- Hulman Institute of Technology. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia PA 30.2006,4, p. 294. in Pyry near Warsaw. Thousands of men and women were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labour, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film gives the impression that the Bombe was developed first, and only became effective later, after it was realised that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message, a practice known in cryptanalysis as employing a crib. In reality, the opposite was true: the use of cribs was the central attack model upon which the Bombe's principal design was based, rather than being an afterthought to the design. * The suggestion that Enigma was the only German cipher broken at Bletchley Park. *: The breaking of the Lorenz cipher, codenamed \\"Tunny\\", arguably made just as important a contribution to Ultra intelligence as the breaking of Enigma, and breaking Tunny was in many ways more difficult. Neither the Tunny effort nor its main contributors, mathematician W. T. \\"Bill\\" Tutte and electrical engineer Tommy Flowers, are mentioned in the film. The Colossus computer they built goes unmentioned by name in the film, although there is an implicit suggestion that Turing was responsible for it, which he was not. * The scene where the Hut 8 team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers (Peter Hilton) is serving on, to hide the fact they have broken the code. *: In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence were made at much higher administrative levels. * The sequence in which Turing writes a letter to Churchill to gain control over the project and obtain funding for the decryption machine. *: Turing was actually not alone in making a different request with a number of colleagues, including Hugh Alexander, writing a letter to Churchill (who had earlier visited there) in an effort to have more administrative resources sent to Bletchley Park, which Churchill immediately did. * The recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper. *: In reality, Joan Clarke was recruited by her former academic supervisor, Gordon Welchman, to the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;). Puzzles were used by Bletchley Park in recruitment but neither Turing nor Clarke were ever involved with them. =Turing's personality and personal life= * The presentation of Turing's social difficulties as so severe as to suggest Asperger syndrome or some form of autism. :: While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working co-operatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing. Despite enjoying working alone, Turing was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.Alan Turing: The Enigma, Burnett Books Ltd, 1983. , pp. 272–3. * The scenes depicting Turing's childhood friend, including the manner in which Turing learned of Morcom's illness and death. * The sequence, which brackets the whole film, in which Turing is arrested in 1951 when a detective suspects him of being a Soviet spy, which leads to the discovery that Turing is gay. *: Turing's arrest was in 1952. The detective in the film and the interview as portrayed are fictional. Turing was investigated for his homosexuality after a robbery at his house and was never investigated for espionage. * The suggestion that chemical castration made Turing unable to think clearly or do any work. *: Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including gynaecomastia, at that time he was doing innovative work on mathematical biology, inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration. While the physical changes distressed Turing, his friends did not notice any meaningful changes to his disposition or comportment in the period between the beginning of his castration and his death. * The scene in which Clarke visits Turing in his home while he is serving probation. *: There is no record of Clarke ever visiting Turing's residence during his probation, although Turing did stay in touch with her after the war and informed her of his forthcoming trial for indecency. * The statement that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment. *: In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended 14 months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from Snow White, Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, Jack Copeland, an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted. =Personalities and actions of other characters= * The depiction of Commander Denniston as a rigid officer, bound by military thinking and eager to shut down the decryption machine when it fails to deliver results. *: Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an \\"unwarranted sideswipe\\" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a \\"baddy\\" and a \\"hectoring character\\" who hinders the work of Turing. They said their grandfather had a completely different temperament from the one portrayed in the film and was entirely supportive of the work done by cryptographers under his command. There is no record of the film's depicted interactions between Turing and Denniston. Indeed, before the war, Denniston recruited lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge, and Turing, Welchman, and others began working part-time for him then. Turing was always respected and considered one of the best code-breakers at Bletchley Park and in short order took on the role of a leader there. * All the interactions between Turing and Stewart Menzies, head of the British Secret Intelligence Service. *: There are no records showing that they interacted at all during Turing's time at Bletchley Park. * An espionage subplot involving Turing and Soviet spy John Cairncross. *: Turing and Cairncross worked in different areas of Bletchley Park and there is no evidence they ever met. Alex Von Tunzelmann was angered by this subplot (which suggests that Turing was for a while blackmailed into not revealing Cairncross as a spy lest his homosexuality be revealed), writing that \\"creative licence is one thing, but slandering a great man's reputation – while buying into the nasty 1950s prejudice that gay men automatically constituted a security risk – is quite another.\\" * Hugh Alexander is said to have won the British Chess Championship twice near the beginning of the film. Although this is true, he won it once in 1938 and the second time in 1956, after the war. * In the scene where Joan Clarke arrives at Bletchley park for the first time she travels there on a coach with vehicle registration HOD 75. *:This vehicle registration was not issued until 1949, several years after the end of the war. Accolades The Imitation Game was nominated for, and received, numerous awards, with Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing particularly praised. The film and its cast and crew were also honoured by Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organisation in the United States. \\"We are proud to honor the stars and filmmakers of The Imitation Game for bringing the captivating yet tragic story of Alan Turing to the big screen\\", HRC president Chad Griffin said in a statement.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Matapédia, Quebec. Background Flower-class corvettes like Matapedia serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Matapedia was ordered on 23 January 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City on 2 February 1940 and launched 14 September 1940. Matapedia was commissioned at Quebec City on 9 May 1941. During the war, Matapedia had three significant refits. Her first major refit took place at Pictou from May until July 1942. The second began at Dartmouth in September 1943 as general repairs after being rammed. However, in October, she was towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia for a more extensive refit which was completed in February 1944. During that time she had her fo'c'sle extended. Matapedias final major refit took place from 15 February 1945 until 28 April at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Service history After initial workups, Matapedia was assigned to Sydney Force as a local escort. This lasted until September 1941 when she transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force. She worked as an ocean escort with convoys traveling from St. John's to Iceland until March 1942. In March 1942, Matapedia was reassigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). She remained with this escort force for the majority of the war. In June 1943, with the establishment of escort groups within WLEF, Matapedia was assigned to group W-5. On 8 September 1943, she was rammed amidships by the freighter SS Scorton in foggy conditions near the Sambro Light Ship at the entrance to Halifax Harbour. The damage was significant and Matapedia would not return to service until 1944. After workups in Bermuda, she rejoined W-5 for a brief period before transferring to escort group W-4. For the remainder of the war, Matapedia was a part of this group with the exception of November–December 1944. During that brief two-month period, she was assigned to Gaspe Force. Matapedia was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 16 June 1945. She was sold in December 1950 for scrapping and was broken up at Hamilton, Ontario.

English. Great King's Street) is the longest street in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It extends northeast from Kongens Nytorv to Esplanaden, running parallel to Bredgade, where it breaks left, continuing northwest to Grønningen. Store Kongensgade is part of the Ring 2 thoroughfare. Traffic is one-way, moving from Østerport station to Kongens Nytorv, while traffic moving in the opposite direction goes by Bredgade which is also one-way. History Store Kongensgade in 1849, painting by Heinrich Gustav Ferdinand Holm Store Kongensgade was established in 1663 in the area known as New Copenhagen., a large expansion of fortified Copenhagen which had recently been created by giving the city's East Rampart a new course. The street connected the King's New Square, Kongens Nytorv, to Frederikshavn Fortress (now Kastellet), which had just been expanded. The name of the street was originally Ny(e) Kongensgade (literally: \\"New King's Street\\") since the city already had a Kongensgade on Christianshavn where present day Wildersgade north and south of Torvegade was known as Store and Lille Kongensgade respectively. The two streets received their current names in 1859. The Guard Hussars' barracks was in the 19th century located at the northern end of the street, next to Kastellet. The facility was demolished in about 1900 and the site was built over in connection with the establishment of Grønningen. The masterplan for the area was adopted on 29 June 1903. The smaller streets in the area have names associated with the island of Bornholm. Notable buildings and residents Bernhard Hertz Sølvvarefabrik (No. 23) is a former silver factory created by the goldsmith Bernhard Hertz in 1782. The Danneskiold-Laurvig Mansion at No. 58, from about 1745, is attributed to the German court architect Johann Adam Soherr. Mecanicus Kretz' House (No. 67A-V) is a listed complex dating from the 1830s. The De Coninck House (No. 72) was built for Frédéric de Coninck, probably to design by the French architect Joseph-Jacques Ramée. The building at No. 86-88 was built to an opulent, Historicist design by Ferdinand Meldahl in connection with the rebuilding of the Marble Church. The intention was to build an identical building on the opposite corner but Carl Frederik Tietgen who sponsored the rebuilding of the church never managed to acquire the site. The building was for more than a hundred years left as an empty site and became Colloquially known as \\"Tietgen's Annoyance\\" (\\"Tietgens Ærgrelse\\"). In 2006, Realdania charged Tony Fretton with the task of designing a modern building which fitted into the historic environment. The building was completed in 2010. Christians Plejehus (No. 108) is a former hospital and workhouse built to design by Carl Pflueg in 1765 to 1769. The street has a colourful mixture of facades representing different periods and architectural styles. The last section of the street, north of Esplanaden, passes the Nyboder terraces. Public art and memorials The Edouard Suenson Memorial At Store Kongensgade, in front of Nyboder, there is a memorial to Vice Admiral Edouard Suenson who commanded the Danish ships in the Battle of Heligoland 9 May 1864. The monument was designed by Theobald Stein and inaugurated on 9 May 1889. It consists of a bust of Suenson mounted on a high plinth decorated with a laurel wreath and prows. On its front side, it has the inscription: \\"VICE- ADMIRAL/EDOUARD SUENSON/Vorn 13 APRIL 1805/DIED 16 MAY 1887 The foot of the plinth is guarded by bronze lions which hold a coat of arms with the inscription \\"HELGOLAND/9 MAY/1864\\". The Atlas statue At the pointed corner of Store Kongensgade and Grønningen, looking north, stands Anne Marie Carl- Nielsen's Pegasus statue which commemorates her husband, the composer Carl Nielsen. A small triangular greenspace sponsored by M. Goldschmidt Holding was created in front of the company's head office on the corner of Grønningen and Store Kongensgade. It includes a bronze statue of the titan Atlas which was originally commissioned by Carl Jacobsen from the sculptor Nicolai Schmidt in 1899. It has previously decorated the roof of Carlsberg's building in Copenhagen Freeport and later the Central Machine Building in the Carlsberg neighbourhood. The sculpture is used in M. Goldschmidt's logo. Cultural references Store Kongensgade is used as a location in the 1977 Olsen-banden film The Olsen Gang Outta Sight.

He was one of the pioneers of the kaseko-genre; hence his other nickname King of Kaseko. Biography =Washboard Orchestra= Lieve Hugo sang in a choir and played drums and percussion in a variety of bands with or without other retired boxers. In 1967 he joined Washboard Orchestra; in this band, who more or less invented kaseko, he was both a drummer and a singer. A mutated version headlined the 1970 Holland Festival at the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and got the crowd on their dancing feet. Health-reasons forced him to leave Washboard Orchestra and put down the drumsticks too.Muziekencyclopedie, Lieve Hugo =Solo albums= Now living in the Bijlmermeer-area of Amsterdam, Lieve Hugo signed to EMI and released his debut solo-album in 1974. Lieve Hugo: King of Kaseko became one of the biggest- selling albums in Surinamese music. Lieve Hugo and his backing-band The Happy Boys toured extensively through the Netherlands, Belgium and South America. 1975 was the year that Suriname gained independence; Lieve Hugo chronicled the subject on his second album Wan Pipel (as in one people, one nation), but didn't live to see the moment. During a performance at Club Sosa in Amsterdam, Lieve Hugo suffered a heart-attack; he died on November 15, 1975, ten days before the Independence Day-ceremony for which he was scheduled to play. His body was flown back to Suriname and buried at Mariusrust on November 23. =Happy Boys= The Happy Boys continued as a band with several lead vocalists, including Lieve Hugo's cousin Edgar Burgos. They released two albums in 1977 and 1978; debut album Akoeba included the tribute-song Memoria Foe Iko (on the melody of Historia de amor). After the break-up in 1980, Burgos and four Happy Boys-alumni formed the original line-up of Trafassi; they took Lieve Hugo's unfulfilled ambitions to further heights and became one of the leading live-acts in the Netherlands. =Revival and tribute-concert= In 2008, the Netherlands appeared to be ready for a Lieve Hugo-revival. The Metropole Orchestra paid tribute to the King of Kaseko at the Concertgebouw backing up artists such as De Dijk, Oscar Harris, Re-Play, Boris Titulaer, Berget Lewis, Izaline Calister, Angela Groothuizen and Edgar Burgos.Ode aan de King of Kaseko AVROTROS.

Israel's son, Lester, a bomber navigator during World War II, expanded the business into supplying military bases. In 1970, Richard Cohen graduated from the Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts and then in 1974, he graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a degree economics, concentrating in accounting, and joined the family company. After a painful union strike, he persuaded his father to move the company to Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1989, Cohen took control of C&S; after his father retired. In 2003, he moved the company headquarters to Keene, New Hampshire. As the food distribution business is very low margin and customer retention is critical, C&S; has been able to attain excellent efficiencies - less than 2 percent of the orders processed have errors or omissions - by using generous performance incentives combined with self-managed teams of workers who are responsible for assembling customer orders thereby eliminating costly supervisors. If a customer is having trouble, rather than letting them go bankrupt (and losing them as a customer), Cohen will often purchase them outright, restructure their operations, and then sell them later for a profit.Coffey, Brendan and Siraj, Zohair. \\"Hidden Billionaire Cohen Hauls Fortune in Unmarked Trucks\\", Bloomberg, 5 August 2013.

Cohen is also founder of Symbotic LLC, which produces an automated storage and retrieval system for dry goods. The system is used by C&S; and other large retailers. Philanthropy The Holocaust studies center at Keene State College was renamed after the Cohens in thanks of their financial support.

Constructed in the late nineteenth century along the railroad's main line, it was the center of life for local residents and served as a significant maintenance site for the railroad. As a simple functional structure, the depot qualified for designation as a historic site in 1976, but it no longer stands. Structural history A caboose by the site of the depot, seen in 2013 When the Illinois Central Railroad reached Bardwell in the 1870s, its first \\"station\\" was a camp car temporarily placed along the tracks. A standing structure was soon built in the middle of the decade.Rayburn, Lovey. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Illinois Central Railroad Station and Freight Depot. National Park Service, 1976-06-01. During its existence, the first permanent building was the center of the community; when the General Assembly incorporated Bardwell as a city in the late 1870s, its boundaries were defined as being a circle with a radius of centered on the depot. This first permanent station remained until 1890, when a team of carpenters employed by the railroad erected a replacement building. Like its predecessor, the second permanent station sat at the heart of the city; Bardwell is platted with its streets parallel to the railroad line, and the depot's location places it in the heart of the small commercial district. By this time, the station was a key location for the railroad as well as for the community; as early as 1885, Bardwell was deemed one of the region's premier Illinois Central stations, and it had become the center of a very extensive grain and livestock trade. Services such as a water stop were placed at Bardwell, for it lay on the main line between Chicago and New Orleans; the railroad's grand Ohio River bridge at Cairo is just a short distance to the north. Locals have long remembered that Purchase native Alben W. Barkley typically began his railroad journeys back to Washington, D.C. while he was the Vice President of the United States. Relations between railroad and residents extended past that of shipper and shipping company: the Illinois Central operated a seed-sales division to serve farmers along its lines, and Bardwell's station hosted multiple trains that the railroad used to show off the latest agricultural products. The station continued to serve both as seed showroom and transportation hub well into the twentieth century, but by the 1970s the railroad had ceased using the depot. Architecture The second Illinois Central depot at Bardwell was typical of small-town railroad stations constructed in the late nineteenth century. Constructed without unnecessary decorations and built in a simple rectangular plan, it featured large doors and windows, a hip roof with wide eaves and simple brackets, and a loading dock with ramps for the freight doors. Exceptions to the simple rectangle were few: they included a signal tower, which was placed after the original construction, and an original bay window that was placed in order to facilitate a better view of trains for railroad employees inside the depot. Its walls were clapboard placed in an unusual manner: horizontal boards were placed midway between the ground and the roof on all sides of the building, but the remainder was covered with vertical boards. Part of the building's interior space was devoted to storage areas for railroad maintenance vehicles. Preservation Site of the station in 2013 After the railroad ceased using the depot, local residents proposed its conversion into a library and museum in the 1970s, partly because all other historic Illinois Central stations between Cairo and Fulton, Kentucky had been demolished by 1976. In that year, the depot received recognition far beyond western Kentucky: on June 16, the National Park Service announced that the depot had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Illinois Central Railroad Station and Freight Depot, qualifying both because of its place in local history and as a significant example of vernacular architecture. Despite its historic significance, the depot no longer stands; its site is now an empty lot along the rail line.Photograph in this section. The depot remains listed on the National Register despite its destruction; it is one of five Carlisle County locations on the Register, along with the Neville-Patterson-Lamkin House near Arlington, the George W. Stone House near Milburn, and the Marshall and Turk Sites, a pair of archaeological sites from the Mississippian culture located near Bardwell.

In the liner notes to Blackstone Legacy, Shaw states: :“This album is dedicated to the youth who will benefit mankind. To the youth who are constantly aware of the turmoil in which the world is and who are trying to right all these wrongs – whether in music or in speech or in any other way of positive work. :This album is dedicated to the freedom of Black people all over the world. And it’s dedicated to the people in the ghettos here. The ‘stone’ in the title is the image of strength. I grew up in a ghetto – funky houses, rats and roaches, stinking hallways. I’ve seen all of that, and I’ve seen people overcome all of that. This music is meant to be a light of hope, a sound of strength and of coming through. It’s one for the ghetto. :We’re trying to express what’s happening in the world today as we – a new breed of young musicians – feel it. I mean the different tensions in the world, the ridiculous war in Vietnam, the oppression of poor people in this, a country of such wealth. The cats on this date usually discuss these things, but we’re all also trying to reach a state of spiritual enlightenment in which we’re continually aware of what’s happening but react in a positive way.

Perth, who had been a powerhouse ever since the end of World War II, winning six premierships and playing in the finals during twenty-four of the preceding thirty-two seasons, underwent a long-term decline that has seen the play in the finals since only in 1986, 1991 and 1997, and take the wooden spoon on seven occasions as opposed to none between 1936 and 1980. With the loss of a number of veterans and major coaching problems which culminated in the resignation of newcomer Percy Johnson for former premiership mentor Graham Campbell, West Perth, also a power club of the WANFL during the third-of-a- century before 1979, declined to their worst record since 1939 with only four wins.

The Titans, led by first year head coach Dedrique Taylor, played their home games at Titan Gym as members of the Big West Conference. The Titans brought in a whole new coaching staff this season with Josh Smith, Robert Spence, and Danny Sprinkle joining Taylor as first-year assistant coaches. They finished the season 11–20, 6–10 in Big West play to finish in a tie for sixth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big West Conference Tournament to Long Beach State. Season =Preseason= Cal State Fullerton announced the hiring of former Arizona State associate head coach Dedrique Taylor as the program's 10th head coach on April 3, 2013. Taylor replaced Andy Newman, who spent one season as the Titans' interim head coach. Taylor had been with Arizona State since 2006, serving as an assistant for four seasons and spending the past three years as an associate head coach. He had spent time as an assistant at UC Davis, Loyola Marymount, Portland State, and Nevada prior. Taylor completed his first recruiting class as the head man for the Titans on May 8, 2013, with the announcement of the signing of forward Joe Boyd. Boyd, a forward from Scottsdale, Arizona, joined guard Sheldon Blackwell (from Rancho Cucamonga, California) as the second and final member of the Titans' 2013 recruiting class. The Titans completed their coaching staff on May 17, 2013. All three of Cal State Fullerton's assistants from the season prior had left, and Taylor replaced them with John Smith, Danny Sprinkle, and Robert Spence. Smith, who had spent nine years as the head coach of Riverside City College, joined as an associate head coach, while Sprinkle, an assistant with Cal State Northridge, and Spence, who came over with Taylor as Arizona State's Director of Basketball Operations, joined as assistant coaches. On August 15, 2013, Taylor welcomed four newcomers to the squad, introducing Dutch freshmen Floris Versteeg and Hiddie Vos, DePaul transfer Moses Morgan, and walk-on Ian Spruce. Morgan, due to NCAA rules, was forced to sit out the 2013-14 season after averaging 6.6 points over three seasons for the Blue Demons. Versteeg, Vos, and Spruce all joined the team as true freshmen with four years of eligibility remaining. Taylor announced the finalization of the Titans' schedule a day later on August 16. Key games on the Titans' schedule included road games against USC, San Jose State, and UNLV, along with home games against Seattle and Sacramento State. The Titans also scheduled to play in The Wooden Legacy with teams such as Marquette and Miami (FL).

On August 21, 2013, Taylor announced the additions of two more junior college transfers. Taylor received commitments from Riverside City College and former Hampton Pirates guard Corey Walker, and Trinity Valley Community College and former North Dakota guard Josh Gentry. Walker needed to sit out the season due to transfer rules while Gentry was eligible immediately as a junior. The Titans opened their season with an easy exhibition victory over the University of Redlands, winning 108–77.

One of Sarsfield's men fell behind when his horse lost a shoe, and got chatting to a woman also walking; she was the wife of a Williamite soldier on the way to meet her man, and told him that the Williamitets' password was \\"Sarsfield\\". The Jacobites used the password to get into the camp - Sarsfield himself shouting \\"Sarsfield's the word, and Sarsfield's the man!\\" and they captured the 500 horses, ready saddled with pistols in saddle holstered, 150 wagons of ammunition and some 30 cannons and mortars, plus 12 wagons of provisions, all of which they blew up. The result of Sarsfield's ride was that William of Orange's siege of Limerick failed after a fortnight, and the king sailed back to England. However, for the hero of the song, Donal, a soldier in Sarsfield's Jacobite army, is killed at Garryowen, an area within Limerick's walls, during that siege, defending his country; the song calls on all Irish women to love only those who \\"wear the jackets green\\" - a telling description, as the United Irishmen of the following century would wear green, and the Yeomen who suppressed that Rising summarily executed men and women found wearing green. Sarsfield and his defence of Limerick are a touchstone of Irish national feeling, and the song by a Castlemahon poet who emigrated to Chicago and founded a successful candy business, there becoming a member of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood which funded Ireland's struggle for independence, was popular in Ireland during that struggle. \\"Jackets green\\" is a joking statement by Irish people for any disaster, as is \\"down the glen\\", meaning lost and hopeless. Sarsfield himself, one of those thousands of Irish aristocrats and others who took service in the armies of Europe, died fighting for James II/VII's patron Louis XIV of France at the Battle of Landen in Flanders, exactly three years later, on 19 August 1693; as his life's blood flowed away he was heard to cry \\"Would that this blood were shed for Ireland\\". Lyrics > When I was a maiden fair and young, > On the pleasant banks of Lee, > No bird that in the greenwood sung, > Was half so blithe and free. > My heart ne'er beat with flying feet, > No love sang me his queen, > Till down the glen rode Sarsfield's men, > And they wore the jackets green. > > Young Donal sat on his gallant grey > Like a king on a royal seat, > And my heart leaped out on his regal way > To worship at his feet. > O Love, had you come in those colours dressed, > And wooed with a soldier's mein > I'd have laid my head on your throbbing breast > For the sake of your jacket green. > > No hoarded wealth did my love own, > Save the good sword that he bore; > But I loved him for himself alone > And the colour bright he wore. > For had he come in England's red > To make me England's queen, > I'd rove the high green hills instead > For the sake of the Irish green. > > When William stormed with shot and shell > At the walls of Garryowen, > In the breach of death my Donal fell, > And he sleeps near the Treaty Stone. > That breach the foeman never crossed > While he swung his broadsword keen; > But I do not weep my darling lost, > For he fell in his jacket green. > > When Sarsfield sailed away I wept > As I heard the wild ochone. > I felt, then dead as the men who slept > 'Neath the fields of Garryowen. > White Ireland held my Donal blessed, > No wild sea rolled between, > Till I would fold him to my breast > All robed in his Irish green. > > My soul has sobbed like waves of woe, > That sad o'er tombstones break, > For I buried my heart in his grave below, > For his and for Ireland's sake. > And I cry. \\"Make way for the soldier's bride > In your halls of death, sad queen > For I long to rest by my true love's side > And wrapped in the folds of green.\\" > > I saw the Shannon's purple tide > Roll by the Irish town, > As I stood in the breach by Donal's side > When England's flag went down. > And now it lowers when I seek the skies, > Like a blood red curse between. > I weep, but 'tis not women's sighs > Will raise our Irish green. > > Oh, Ireland, sad is thy lonely soul, > And loud beats the winter sea, > But sadder and higher the wild waves roll > O'er the hearts that break for thee. > Yet grief shall come to our heartless foes, > And their thrones in the dust be seen, > So, Irish Maids, love none but those > Who wear the jackets green.

It opened on May 6, 1895 and closed south of Damen station on February 25, 1951, when it was partially replaced by the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. The remainder of the branch is currently a part of the O'Hare branch of the Blue Line. Operations The Logan Square branch separated from the Metropolitan Main Line at the Marshfield Junction, just west of the Marshfield station. The Humboldt Park branch split off just northwest of the Damen station (originally called Robey). History Service began on the Northwest branch on May 6, 1895, with service as far as Robey Street (Damen Avenue), and was extended to Logan Square on May 25, 1895. On February 25, 1951, the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway began service, and service ended on the Logan Square branch south of the Damen Avenue station. The portion between the subway portal the junction with the other Metropolitan West Side branches was retained as the Paulina Connector, a non-revenue connecting track, as the other Met branches were rerouted from the Loop into the south end of the Milwaukee–Dearborn subway, meaning there was no other connection to the rest of the \\"L\\" system. As part of the replacement of the Garfield Park branch with the Congress branch, a new junction between the Paulina Connector and the Lake Street branch was constructed, allowing trains from the Douglas branch to continue to reach the Loop while construction was ongoing. After construction was complete, Douglas branch trains resumed using the Milwaukee–Dearborn subway, and the connector was returned to non-revenue use only. The portion north of the Lake Street branch was demolished in 1964, as the junction with the Lake Street branch rendered it superfluous. By 2003, the Paulina Connector was in need of renovation, as it remained the only connection between the Blue Line and the rest of the system. As part of a renovation of the Cermak (formerly Douglas) branch, the connector was rebuilt. Following the reconstruction, in 2006 the CTA introduced a new service pattern in which trains from the Cermak branch use the Paulina Connector to travel to the Loop via the junction with the Lake Street branch. This service is the current Pink Line. Besides the Paulina Connector and the section of the Blue Line between the subway and Logan Square, one other extant section remains at Paulina and Kinzie Streets, where the trestle over the Union Pacific (Former Milwaukee Road) Metra rail lines has been re-used as a signal bridge.

Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, issued the Proclamation of Bangsamoro Independence on July 27, 2013 in Talipao, Sulu and declared the capital of Bangsamoro to be Davao City. History According to Misuari, the republic's territory encompasses the islands of Basilan, Mindanao, Palawan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi where the Bangsamoro traditionally lived. However, according to Misuari's legal counsel, Emmanuel Fontanilla, the state also encompasses the Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. This declaration of independence, which was made under the authority of the United Nations General Assembly 1514 resolution of 1960 granting independence to all colonized countries, escalated into the Zamboanga City crisis. The MNLF, the group which proclaimed Bangsamoro, is an observer of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. As of September 28, 2013, with the defeat in Zamboanga City by the Philippine government, the MNLF no longer controls any territory openly anywhere and the Bangsamoro Republic has been debilitated. However, the MNLF has not renounced its bid for the independence of the Bangsamoro Republik.  Etymology  The term Bangsamoro comes from combining the word bangsa, meaning nation or people, and the Spanish word moro, which was originally applied to the Moors that ruled Spain prior to the Reconquista, and was subsequently applied to predominantly Muslim Malay tribes. Bangsa = Nation, Moro = Muslim; Bangsamoro or Muslim Nation. Background =Earlier declarations= An independent state of Bangsamoro Republik was first declared on April 28, 1974,W.K.

According to the 18th-century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti, Erekle, soon after Alexader's accession to the throne of Kakheti, took offence at his brother Davit and clandestinely repaired for the Ottoman court in Constantinople. The Safavid Iranian shah Tahmasp I saw this as a renege on the Kakhetians' pledge of loyalty. Advancing with his army into Karabakh, the shah summoned Alexander to his camp. Through the machinations of Prince Cholokashvili, the Kakhetians managed to divert the shah's attention to the political intrigues in the principality of Samtskhe, which was invaded and ravaged by the Iranians in 1574. In 1578, when Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha's Ottoman army marched into Georgia, Alexander II of Kakheti accepted the sultan's suzerainty and helped Lala Pasha to conquer Shirvan. Alexander's son Erekle was briefly appointed by the Ottomans a governor of sanjak of Shaki in Shirvan, which had hitherto been ruled by Alexander's alienated brother Isa- Khan on the shah of Iran's behalf. Erekle reappears in the historical records as a signatory, together with his father Alexander II and brothers, Davit and Giorgi, to the oath of allegiance to Feodor I of Russia on 28 September 1587, a culmination of the mission of the Russian envoy Rodion Birkin, which, however, did not bring about any tangible changes in the regional political climate.

Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) has an area of 4600 ha, covering about 20% of the island. It encompasses the 3045 ha Morne Seychellois National Park, which includes the 914 m peak of Morne Seychellois, the highest mountain of Seychelles. During the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries there was extensive exploitation of the original forests for timber as well as for cinnamon plantations. Present human activity, including forestry, tourism and some tea cultivation, affect less than 10% of the area of the IBA. =Flora and fauna= Land within the national park is characterised by steep terrain covered with dense secondary forest and shrub woodland, punctuated by cliffs and large granite boulders. Above 600 m elevation there are remnant stands of primary forest with few exotics. Endemic species include the very rare Medusagyne oppositifolia and Vateriopsis seychellarum, the commoner Dillenia ferruginea and Northea hornei, as well as Phoenicophorium borsigianum, Nephrosperma vanhoutteanum, Erythroxylum sechellarum, Nepenthes pervillei and Secamone schimperianus. Outside the national park the IBA includes the mountainous area to the south- east as well as the adjacent districts of La Misère and Cascade. The latter contain much anthropogenic habitat, such as orchards, small farms, tea plantations, housing, roads and other infrastructure. Forests at low and intermediate altitudes are dominated by exotic plants such as Cinnamomum verum, Falcataria moluccana (= Paraserianthes falcataria), Alstonia macrophylla and Chrysobalanus icaco. The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Seychelles kestrels, Seychelles blue pigeons, Seychelles scops owls, Seychelles swiftlets, Seychelles bulbuls, Seychelles white-eyes and Seychelles sunbirds.

The label was resurrected in 2013 as Jem Recordings. History Jem Records, based on South Plainfield, New Jersey, was founded in 1970 by college friends Jeff Tenenbaum, Ed Grossi, and Marty Scott, also known as Martin L. Scott. Scott was attending Franklin and Marshall College, while Tenenbaum was attending Cornell University and Grossi was attending Wesleyan University.Interview: Excavating Jem with Marty Scott; The Second Disc.

The company was formed to sell imported records from Europe.Julia Flynn Siler, Business People: Jem Records president confident despite woes; The New York Times, August 22, 1988. Retrieved 2013-08-20. The motivation for establishing the label was when co-founder Marty Scott discovered that he could only obtain the album Direct Hits, by The Who, by importing it from England. The co-founders also imported foreign releases of records by US artists and sold them at their respective colleges. Jem's most successful deal was the licensing from Epic Records of the right to import Cheap Trick at Budokan, which at the time was only available in the United States as an import from Japan. As a result of this success, Epic Records delayed release of the next Cheap Trick studio album, Heaven Tonight and released Budokan domestically, to great success. \\"I Want You to Want Me\\", from the album, became the band's breakout single.Jem Recordings, What is Jem Recordings?; www.jemrecordings.com. Retrieved 2013-08-25. Another notable success was importing The Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack album. The record, released in 1975, had been deleted everywhere but in Canada. Marty Scott contracted with Lou Adler, whose label, Ode Records, had originally released the album, to distribute Canadian copies, under a production and distribution license in the US. Jem Records also released in the United States the first albums by The Cure, Simple Minds, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. These were licensed from foreign labels. Jem Records was also the exclusive US distributor for such labels as WEA International, EG Records, and the Virgin International division of Virgin Records. The company's principal record label was Passport Records, which it formed in 1973, in partnership with the Sire Records Group. Concurrently with the founding of Passport Records, the company established an alternate record distribution network, with warehouses on both the East and West coasts of the US. The Passport Records partnership was dissolved in 1977, when Sire Records was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. Jem operated Passport Records on its own, thereafter. Jem Records went public in 1984, with its initial public offering meeting with mixed success, resulting in a reduction in the offering price. At the same time, the import and distribution activities of Jem Records were negatively affected by the loss of a copyright lawsuit brought by T.B. Harms Music. Prior to this judgement, Jem Records had not been paying royalties on imported records. Jem Records went from reported net income of approximately $391,000 on sales of approximately $14 million in 1984 to a loss of approximately $225,000 on sales of approximately $16 million in 1985.JEM Records reports earnings for Year to July 31, The New York Times, October 31, 1985.

They are also referred to as the Hanoid languages by Lama (2012) and as the Akoid languages by Bradley (2007). Approximately 1.5 million people speak these languages, mainly in China, Laos, Burma (Myanmar), and Vietnam; more than 90% of the speakers of these languages live in China. Various ethnicities that use Hani languages are grouped into a single class recognized nationality named Hani after the largest subgroup. In China, the languages of this group—which include Hani proper, Akha, and Hao-Bai (Honi and Baihong)—are considered dialects (). Western scholars, however, have traditionally classified them as separate languages. Varieties In China, Akha and other related languages are considered to be derivatives of Hani. They are not mutually intelligible, which means that speakers of one language do not necessarily understand speakers of the other language. In 2007, according to Ethnologue, there were almost 1.5 million speakers of all Hani varieties. Slightly more than half (760,000) of these speakers can speak Hani properly (considering age etc.). Lama (2012) groups the principal varieties of the Hani languages identified by Bradley (2007) as follows: Yunnan locations and speaker populations are from Haniyu Jianzhi 哈尼语简志 according to information from 1986. *Ha-Ya 哈雅 had 850,000 speakers in 1982.

Hani is also spoken in Lai Châu Province of northwestern Vietnam, northern Laos, and Shan State of northeastern Burma. =Vietnam= Edmondson (2002) reports that the Hani of Vietnam is distributed in 2 provinces of northwestern Vietnam. The earliest Hani pioneers to Vietnam probably numbered around 5 to 6 families, and arrived in Mường Tè District from Jinping County and Lüchun County in Yunnan about 325 years ago. The Hani of Phong Thổ District and Bát Xát District arrived later, about 175 years ago from Yunnan. The Hani of Vietnam claim to be able to communicate in the Hani language with ethnic Hani from different areas of Vietnam despite significant geographical barriers. Edmondson (2002), however, reported different Hani speech varieties in various parts of northwestern Vietnam, which differ mostly lexically. *Mường Tè District, Lai Châu Province **Sín Thấu **Chung Chải **Mù Cả (Bản Mù Cả, etc.; Hà Nhì Cồ Chồ clan) **Ca Lăng **Thu Lũm **Xạ Hua Bun (Bản Chang Chau Pa, etc.; Hà Nhì La Mí clan) *Phong Thổ District, Lai Châu Province (Hà Nhì Đen or Black Hani people) *Bát Xát District, Lai Châu Province (Hà Nhì Đen or Black Hani people) **Y Tí **A Lù Further reading Tang Mingsheng (2011, ed.) contains word lists and ethnographies of Hani subgroups.

Lorentz was born in Kahla, Thuringia. He initially studied theology at the Universities of Jena and Erlangen. From 1858 he studied botany at the University of Munich, where he was a pupil of Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli. He focused his attention towards the study of mosses, subsequently collecting specimens throughout Europe (the Black Forest, the Austrian Alps, Switzerland, northern Italy and Scandinavia). With Wilhelm Philippe Schimper, he collaborated on Geographie der Moose.JSTOR Global Plants Lorentz, Paul (Pablo) Günther (1835–1881) In 1870 he emigrated to Argentina, where he was appointed professor of botany at the University of Córdoba. In 1871–72, he explored the mountainous regions of Tucumán and Catamarca provinces with geologist Alfred Wilhelm Stelzner (1840–1895). Bryological specimens found on the expedition were kept for personal study by Lorentz, while vascular plants that he collected were sent to August Grisebach for further analysis, who described the vascular specimens in the treatise \\"Plantae Lorentzianae\\" (1874). With his assistant, Georg Hieronymous, he conducted botanical investigations through the northern provinces of Jujuy and Salta, and into the lowlands of the Gran Chaco and Bolivia. Collections from this expedition were described by Grisebach (along with Lorentz's later collections from Entre Rios Province) in the treatise \\"Symbolae ad Floram Argentinam\\" (1879). His collection of lichens from the expedition were shipped to August von Krempelhuber and his Hepaticae specimens were sent to bryologist Karl Müller. In 1874, due to political events, he relocated to Concepción del Uruguay as an instructor of natural history. In 1879, with Gustavo Niederlein (1858–1924), he participated in a scientific expedition across the Pampas to the Rio Negro. Lorentz died in Concepción del Uruguay at the age of 46 on 6 October 1881, a victim of liver disease. As a result of his Argentine excursions, he collected many species of flowering plants, mosses and lichens that were new to science. Also, he is credited with providing the first phytogeographical map of Argentina.Deutsche Biographie  Selected works  * Beiträge zur Biologie und Geographie der Laubmoose, 1860 * Moosstudien, 1864 * Bryologisches Notizbuch. : Zum praktischen Gebrauche, 1865 * Reiseskizzen aus Argentinien, 1875 * La vegetación del nordeste de la provincia de Entre Ríos, informe científico, 1878.OCLC Classify (publications)  References   External links  * IPNI List of plants described & co-described by Lorentz.

According to a United States embassy cable dating back to 2006 that was leaked by WikiLeaks, the Research Division is actually the public name for the Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation (MEIO), the country's main foreign intelligence agency. A news report stated that the MEIO may be abolished under the new Mahathir government. Activities and structure The Research Division or Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation is part of Malaysia's national security covert intelligence agency. It is believed to have more than 1,000 agents, officers, and operatives around the world. MEIO works with several other Malaysian government departments and agencies including the Special Branch, military intelligence, and the National Security Council. MEIO has covert intelligence sources around the world and shares its information with the Prime Minister, the Malaysian Cabinet, Special Branch, and other agencies. The Division's Director-General was Datuk Hasanah Abdul Hamid until the 2018 Malaysian general election. History =Origins and operations= The Research Division was established during the 1960s as part of Malaysia's national security covert intelligence agency. Muhammad Hatta, the Secretary of the Malaysian National Security Council, was known to have served as MEIO's Director General from 2002 to 2005. It was also known to have helped the Malaysian Special Branch in combating the Malayan Communist Party. According to WikiLeaks, the Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation also covertly supported the secessionist groups in Mindanao. In 2006, it also facilitated peace talks between the Philippines government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. More recently, MEIO reportedly helped to combat the Islamic State. =Post-2018 Malaysian general election= According to reports by several Malaysian news media including The Star, The Sun, and the news blog Malaysia Today in May 2018, the Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation had 300 personnel, operated as a spy agency, and reported directly to former Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak. The organization was allegedly used to monitor government critics at home and abroad. Following the 2018 Malaysian general election, members of the Royal Malaysia Police's Commercial Crime Division searched the home of a female individual, who was reported to be the head of the Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation, for documents that Najib had given her two days before the 2018 election. The Police also searched two buildings belonging to the agency. In late July 2018, a letter from MEIO's Director-General Hasanah Abu Hamid dating back to 4 May 2018 was leaked to the media. The letter was reportedly addressed to Gina Haspel, the designated Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and appealed for the Trump Administration to support Najib's administration even in the event that Barisan Nasional won by a simple majority or just one seat. She also described the Pakatan Harapan leader Mahathir Mohamed as an anti-Semite. In response, the Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng called for an investigation into allegations that the Research Division had written to the CIA, describing the letter as an attempt to solicit foreign intervention. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Najib denied having any knowledge of the Research Division's letter, claiming that it was a government secret not meant for public eyes. During a press conference on 31 July, Hasanah's lawyer Datuk Shaharudin Ali confirmed that the letter was genuine and asserted that the letter between MEIO and the CIA was part of the work of intelligence gathering and national security. The former Director Hasanah lodged a police report on the grounds that the letter should not have been leaked for national security reasons. On 6 August 2018, Ab Jalil Backer, the leader of a group called Angkatan Karyawan Nasionalis, claimed that the CIA had leaked MEIO's letter and also alleged that the US spy agency had been colluding with Pakatan Harapan. In late August 2018, former MEIO director-general Hasanah was remanded in police custody over the alleged misappropriation of election funds during the 2018 general election.

The Sangirese people are fishermen and nutmeg growers in their home areas and also work as wage labourers in industrial crops enterprises in Bolaang Mongondow Regency and Minahasa Regency. The Sangirese have traditionally been concentrated in the province of North Sulawesi in Indonesia and the Region of Dávao in the Philippines. Language They speak their native Sangirese language, Talaud language and Indonesian language, as well as their dialects, which belong to the Austronesian languages family. While Sasahara language (meaning, \\"Sea Speech\\") is a secret language developed in the first half of the 20th century, are widely spoken among Sangirese sailors or pirates. It includes a large number of words borrowed or distorted. History alt= The primary settlements of the Sangirese people are the Sangihe Islands. Archaeologists have determined that the first humans that arrived in the region of islands were in the 3rd millennium BCE and probably were a mix of Veddoids and Negritos. In 1st millennium BCE Austronesian migrant came here through the southern Philippines. They displaced the natives, and began to developed agriculture, to produce fabrics and ceramics. Modern Sangirese people are the direct descendants of that population that has developed on Sangihe Islands before the start of the modern era. The Sangirese people consider themselves to have originated directly from Sangir Island and their primogenitor being Gumansalangi, a cultural hero who lived around the 14th to 15th century. During this period the Sangihe Islands formed a government under the authority of the Muslim rulers of the Maluku Islands. In the 16th century, the Ternatean people subdued the Sangirese people, and the islands were discovered by the Portuguese. Then, in the 17th century, they were initially captured and became part of the Spanish colonial rule; which resulted in vocabulary borrowed from the Spanish language that is still preserved in the Sangirese language., and then followed by the Dutch who came later to occupy them in 1677. Maluku sultans also continued to consider Sangihe Islands as part of their territory. By the 19th century, European influence was limited to trading. As Sangihe Islands were between Dutch and Spanish possessions, the local inhabitants had successfully performed the role of middleman dealers and smugglers. This led to the emergence of Sangirese settlements on Sulawesi and the southern Philippines. Sangirese resettlements in other areas of the eastern Celebes Sea were contributed by the catastrophic volcanic eruption of Mount Awu on Sangir Island on 2 March 1856. In the 19th century, presence of Protestant missionaries and increased role of colonial officers began to appear on the island. In 1945, Indonesia gained its independence. In 1950, Sulawesi and Sangihe Islands became part of Indonesia. The first decade of the reign under the Indonesian Administration started the fight against smuggling, which involved many Sangirese people, as well as the participation of some Sangirese people in anti-government movement. In the late 1950s to early 1960s, disappointed Sangirese Indonesians took action to recreate migration to the Philippines. Migration of the Sangirese population between the two countries took place in that period. Religion Ancient belief system of the Sangirese people are polytheistic in nature, which include the belief in many spirits of nature and ancestral, the ritual worship of inanimate objects and magic. Among Sangirese people are class of distinguished shamans or priests that acted as mediators between the world humans and spirits, to protect patients and children, and to perform miracles. Despite the spread of Islam and Christianity, many ancient rituals are still being practiced today. Islam began to spread in the 15th to 16th century from the Maluku Islands and North Sulawesi; but before the arrival of Europeans, they had a very limited impact. In the 17th century, a group of Sangirese Muslims migrated to the area of Manado, which has a separate religious and ethnic group from the Sangirese people. In the 19th to early 20th century, Muslims among the Sangirese people became preachers to other Dutch colonies in Asia. The first Christian missionaries that arrived were the Spanish Catholic monks in the 17th century, but their activity had no long-term effects. Since 1857, the Sangihe Islands opened to Protestant missionaries. The majority of Sangirese people today profess Protestantism, being at the same time strongly influenced by the Minahasan people. Today, about 79% of people of Sangihe Islands Regency profess Christianity, the majority being Protestants. Adherents of other faiths are Muslims with about 20% of the people, while the rest profess native beliefs. Culture A Sangir man in koffo attire, 1929. Sangirese folklore is famous for its dance art. Local dances include gunde, alabadiri, masamper, ampawayer and so on. Previously, they had ritual gatherings, but nowadays it is also accompanied by public holidays. Sangirese dance represents a certain set of smooth body movements of the dancer performing the dance but organized dance of large group of dancers are usually accompanied with a musical band and female rhythmic singing. =Lifestyle and economy= Sangir people are engaged in fishing, hunting, farming (the main crops are tubers, root crops, bananas, sago) and transit marine trading between Sulawesi, Maluku Islands and the Philippines. The sources often mention the cultivation of taro culture, which was cultivated on the slopes of mountains and near rivers. To protect the cultivated fruits like coconuts from thefts, residents from Sangir hung small dolls (in Sangirese language, urǒ), which, according to legend, will \\"pursue a thief\\". Agriculture is considered to be mainly women's work. Relationship lineage and the transfer of previously inherited lands occurs in the female line. The main occupations of Sangirese men are such as ship building, seafaring and trade. Forestry production (harvesting of rattan and ebony wood), blacksmithing and weaving were also widely spread. The economy is mainly characterized by manual labor. It is known that the main diet of Sangirese people is fish with vegetables. The main centers of settlements of the Sangirese people are located in the coastal zones. Previously, their houses were erected on stilts, but gradually they are replaced by modern houses built like the typical Indonesian type. Families who lived in the same village, forms a community called soa. Resettled Sangirese people from Sangihe Islands seek out and continually maintain family ties with their soa; which would help them to preserve their identity in an environment similar in language and culture of their people. =Institute of marriage= In the Sangirese society; which reached a high density by the 20th century, marriage is entered relatively late. Historically, the tradition of buying a bride as an important institution of public organization. Sometimes the ransom looked like whole plots.

That time was the beginning of his friendship with Willi Baumeister and Oskar Schlemmer. In Schlemmer's Triadic Ballet, he participated later and organized the Paris show in 1932. In 1922 he moved to Munich and continued his studies until 1925. There he studied at Franz von Stuck at the Academy, Hans Hofmann at the School of Fine Arts and took additional lessons from Heinrich Wölfflin at the University. In 1923 and 1924 as a student in Munich he wrote about \\"the lack of understanding of modern art\\". = Paris = In 1926 he moved to Paris and worked there as a painter, at the same time he also studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière (at Othon Friesz and André Lhote). His friends in Paris at that time included Colette, André Derain, Rene Jurdain, Paul Poiret, Maurice Ravel. Bayrle followed the invitation of Rene Jurdain to share his studio space, from 1928 to 1934, however, he spent in summertime months in St. Tropez at Madame Aude. In Paris he was in contact with Giorgio de Chirico, Jean Cocteau, Le Corbusier, Raoul Dufy, Aristide Maillol, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Although an active and recognized member of the Parisian art scene his exhibitions there are poorly documented and researched today. In 1927, he had together with Arno Breker an exhibition, who also lived in Paris. = Africa = In 1934 the Institute of Morphology, run by Leo Frobenius of the University of Frankfurt offered him a position as an artist. The institute offered Bayrle the opportunity to paint without the fear of persecution of the regime. In the same year Frobenius and Bayrle made their first expedition to Africa. Two years later their book about South Abessinia was published which contains 40 plates in photogravure prints of drawings of Alf Bayrle. Until today these drawings, as well as the unpublished have a great importance from a scientific, ethnographic and artistic point of view. Some other expeditions were made to the South of France, Spain, Libya and Ethiopia. = Germany = In 1937 the work-up of the expeditions was finished and Bayrle moved to Berlin, where 7 November 1937, where his son was born, he became also a painter. In 1939 he was drafted into the military and was taken prisoner. The 1943–44 bombing destroyed much of his recent works. In 1948 he was released from war captivity and moved to Frankfurt and opened a studio there, he was a member of the Professional Association of Visual Artists Frankfurt. In the early postwar period, next to his artistic activity he made scenes and decorations, and taught as an art teacher at the Gutenberg school. His studio was at the Röderbergweg in Frankfurt (near the Zoo) in the same house with his son's studio. In 1966 he opened a second studio in Bonn and in 1968 was a founder member of the artist group \\"semicolon\\" and a member of the Artist Group Bonn. Bayrle never wanted a retrospective of his work, so the great exhibition in 1980 showed mostly contemporary works. Alf Bayrle died in 1982. When the German author Adam Seide published his novel \\"Rebecca\\" in 1987 he dedicated it in memory of the painter Alf Bayrle.  Themes  Unlike several of his avant-garde contemporaries, Bayrle rejected non- representational painting; instead, he took up and advanced the tradition of figurative painting. His work was influenced by his time with Hans Hofmann, the artists circles in Paris and the expeditions to Africa. During his time in Paris he often painted still life. Bayrles solo exhibition in 1925, shows figurative works inspired by impressionism. His chief interest was even at this time already in cubism and Paul Cézanne, whose work remained important to him throughout his life. Sina Hofmann Ginsburg and Karla Bilang confirmed \\"a strong Cezannism\\" in the work of Alf Bayrle. Much of his early work was destroyed by bombing, a fortunate circumstance is that he had sold a lot in the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered as a visitor in 1967, the still life \\"plant with pineapple\\" in the exhibition of the Kazimir Hagen collection, which he had painted in Paris in 1929. The Africa-topic influenced him even after the expeditions especially his late work. He started a collection of African art and antiques which he had to sell in the late 1940s. One single known work \\"Vom Bau des Atlantikwalls\\" from 1940 (\\"Building a Bunker, Atlantic Wall\\" in the Portland Art Museum) shows a scene from his military service. His late work was focused on heads, which he drew in many ways mostly in ink. They represent various emotions and characters and are characteristic for his turn away from classic portraiture. He signed his works with Bay and in some cases with his full name, some sketches and designs he left unsigned. Little known is his work as a graphic designer: His poster \\"Der Reichskolonialbund ruft auch Dich!\\" (The Reichskolonialbund calls also you) from 1938 is part of the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London und der Sammlung der University of California, Berkeley.and in the collection of the University of California, Berkeley.

Standing 6'2\\" on a muscular frame, Yoyoy got his nickname because of Filipino singer-comedian Yoyoy Villame, as their surnames sounds exactly the same. In the PBA, however, Villamin earned the moniker \\"Bicolano Superman\\" because of his strength and ability to dominate on both ends of the court. He played for Solid Mills and later, Asia Pacific Finance Corporation (APCOR) in the MICAA, where he distinguished himself as a valuable \\"utility man\\" for being a very good defensive guard, a driving forward and a high-leaping center. PBA career Villamin was one of the five players recruited by the Crispa Redmanizers during the final conference of the 1981 PBA season. In 1983, he was Crispa's leading offensive rebounder in the All-Filipino while finishing the conference third overall in rebounds. After five seasons, Yoyoy became the fourth player in the PBA \\"Protected-list\\", meaning he could not play alongside top centers Ramon Fernandez, Abet Guidaben and Manny Victorino on the same team. In his first season with Hills Bros Coffee Kings in 1987, Villamin finished second in the MVP race to Abet Guidaben, the eventual MVP winner, but his performance merited the award from the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) and Sports Columnists Organization of the Philippines (SCOOP) as their Most Outstanding Pro player of the year in 1987. It was also during this phenomenal season that Villamin came to be known as the other half of Alaska's twin-tower combination known as the \\"Bruise Brothers\\" alongside another tough defensive big man Ricky Relosa. A knee injury slowed him down in later years, starting with his stint with Diet Sarsi, after Alaska dropped him from their lineup beginning the 1991 season, and opted for younger players in a major revamp.

The twenty-third episode of the series is co-written by Mark Richard and Reed Steiner and directed by Dennie Gordon. In the episode, when his railroad crew is attacked, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) first suspects the natives but learns Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney) might be behind it. Declan Toole (Damian O'Hare) arrives in town to claim Eva (Robin McLeavy) and her baby to honor his brother's memory and Irish custom. The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl), now calling himself \\"Mr. Anderson,\\" helps a stranded family. Plot Cullen and his work crew re-set downed telegraph poles. A man approaches on the tracks via a handcar to reveal he has a scalped head. He says Indians have killed five railroad men and stolen 300 head of cattle. Cullen telegraphs the fort with the message to pursue and kill Indians and show no mercy. He and Elam (Common) then ride off in search of the Indian raiders. Back in town, the scalped cattle wrangler repeats the events to anyone who pays a nickel for his tale. Louise Ellison (Jennifer Ferrin) listens in, although he changes his story each time. After hearing a woman scream, she enters the prostitutes' tents. Eva tends to a bleeding woman. Mickey McGinnes (Phil Burke) tells Eva that his whorehouse is not a hospital, but a place of business. When Louise calls him a pimp, he says she doesn't understand their world at Hell on Wheels. Cullen and Elam find a horse that's been painted — not dyed — and realize that their cattle were not stolen by Indians, but white men. From a hill, they watch a group of drunk and sleeping rustlers camped by the river. Cullen tells Elam to not kill them all. They rush the campsite, shooting all the men but one. He tells Cullen that he doesn't know where the cattle are, but the plan was to get paid out of Omaha. Cullen suspects Durant is behind all this. Elam shoots the rustler dead when he tries to run. Declan Toole arrives via train at Hell on Wheels. He enters the saloon and introduces himself to Mickey as Gregory Toole's (Duncan Ollerenshaw) brother. Declan asks Mickey for information about his brother's death. Carrying the rustler's corpse, Cullen kicks open the door to an Omaha restaurant. He drops the corpse at Durant's table and pulls up a chair. He accuses Durant of hiring men to kill his crew and steal his cattle. The sheriff enters and supports Durant, then tells Cullen to leave. Cullen leaves the body at Durant's table. Outside, he tells Elam they need to telegraph the fort and call off Bendix (Leon Ingulsrud). Maggie Palmer (Chelah Horsdal), a rancher in negotiations with Durant, introduces herself to Cullen. She offers him a good deal for her cattle, foreseeing a future range war that Cullen's railroad is about to breach. Eva continues tending to the sick prostitute while Louise watches. She asks about Eva's past as a prostitute. Eva says Elam and Toole helped her survive it. She blames herself for Toole's death and believe things are now cursed. That night, Declan knocks on Eva's tent. He's come for her and the baby — it's Irish custom to marry a brother's widow. She closes the door in his face. The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl), now calling himself \\"Mr. Anderson,\\" repairs a family's wagon axle. He thanks them for providing food and shelter, then grieves over his own family, who he says have been killed by Indians. He later leads a prayer before a meal with the traveling family. In town, Cullen orders Sean McGinnes (Ben Esler) to send railroad stock to Maggie as payment for the cattle. He then tells Sean that Durant sends his regards. Major Bendix and his troops ride into town carrying poles with piked Indian heads. Cullen reminds him of his redacted orders, but Bendix says he's just hastening the end of the war with the Indians. Cullen later warns him that the Indians will now retaliate. Bendix claims the Indians need to be wiped out. Cullen tells him to fight the war and Cullen will build the railroad. Outside, Sean tells Cullen that Indians have attacked the surveyors. He warns Sean not to tell anyone, then instructs him to request more soldiers. Cullen and Elam bury the dead surveyors then go to the saloon. Declan enters and confronts Elam about Eva and the baby. He wants to take them back to New York, but Elam forbids it, warning Declan to stay away from his family. Cullen brings Ruth food in the church. He admits innocent people have died at his hand. Ruth tells him killing is a sin, but adds Cullen can be redeemed if he hates his sin, even if he can't turn away from it. Walking through a field, Durant and Maggie discuss plans for their railroad city. Elsewhere, Cullen places the severed Indian heads on a sacred burial platform.

The museum is dedicated to the culture and history of Chinese Australians, particularly in the region. Built on the historical site of one of Bendigo's Chinatowns, the museum's precinct also includes Chinese Gardens and a temple to Kuan Yin. Through the museum accreditation program, it was the first accredited museum in Victoria. History The Golden Dragon Museum opened in 1991. The current site for the museum is the area of one of Bendigo's Chinatowns. The Bridge St Chinatown was the centre for Chinese activity in the region from the late 19th century to 1964.McKinnon, Leigh. (2012). Loong Bendigo's Golden Dragon. The Golden Dragon Museum. . pg 32-40 The old buildings of Chinatown were bulldozed by the city council to make room for a car park. It was in the 1980s that Russell Jack pushed forward his vision for a Chinese museum in the area. Once the funding was acquired, Harry Charalambous was chosen as the architect.The Golden Dragon Museum. (2010). The 1880s Processional Regalia of the Bendigo Chinese Association. The Golden Dragon Museum. Bendigo. . pg 6-7 His design incorporated Chinese symbolism and architecture with distinctly Australian materials like corrugated iron and red brick. In this way, the building of the Golden Dragon Museum reflected the history of the Chinese of Bendigo. Chinese heritage constitutes a significant part of the town of Bendigo's cultural identity. The Victorian gold rush saw thousands of Chinese migrate to Bendigo in the latter half of the 19th century. Most of these people were young men from the Guangdong province. They were seeking better economic opportunities for them and their families. Once they arrived in Bendigo, the Chinese formed their own community and began raising money for charities. In the 1870s, the local Chinese were invited to take part in the annual Easter festival. The Chinese elders of the region raised money to purchase extravagant costumes and regalia for the event. These costumes form the basis of the museum's collection and are well preserved garments, made from silk and gold bullion thread. =Origins of the name= In 1988, the Chinese year of the Golden Dragon, official fundraising for the museum by the Chinese of Bendigo began. The most significant artifact in the museum's collection was to be the processional dragon Loong ().McKinnon, Leigh. (2012). Loong Bendigo's Golden Dragon. The Golden Dragon Museum. . pg 24 Collection The Golden Dragon Museum was founded to protect, preserve and teach the history of the Chinese in Bendigo. It inherited the large and significant collection of Chinese processional regalia from the Bendigo Chinese Association. These formed the basis of the museum's collection. The collection has grown significantly since then with both small and large donations. =1880s Processional Regalia Collection= The basis for the museum's collection. This vast collection contains theatrical costumes made from materials including silk, furs and gold bullion thread. These pieces were once used in Bendigo's Easter Parade. The Chinese of Bendigo had a long history of parades and celebrations in their camps on the goldfields. These were usually for Chinese New Year or other Chinese cultural events. Later in the 1870s when the Easter Parade became an annual institution in Bendigo, the Chinese joined. The Chinese section of the parade soon became one of the parade's most interesting and elaborate sections. In these early performances the Chinese used regalia they had made in Australia themselves or brought with them from China. In 1880 the Chinese community leaders in Bendigo decided to place a levy on all Chinese in the region to buy items for use in the Easter Parade. Through this levy £750 was raised. It was sent to China and used to acquire a number of crates full of richly embroidered theatrical costumes. There were enough costumes to fit hundreds of players into a theatrical Chinese court, with scholars, generals, soldiers, princesses and an emperor. Some positions within the parade became highly sought after. The Chinese of the region would bid for the honour of wearing certain costumes. All the money would go to local charities. Much of this collection remains today.Stephen Munro. (2013) the museum, issue three MAR-AUG 2013. Australia Press. Canberra. pg 37 The Golden Dragon Museum. (2010).

TAASA Review, Volume 18 3 September 2009 =Dragons= The Golden Dragon Museum houses what are believed to be the oldest and the longest imperial dragons in the world. Sun Loong, the longest imperial dragon, is over long and was brought out every year for the Bendigo Easter Festival until Sun Loong was retired in favor of the long Dai Gum Loong in 2019. Loong, the oldest imperial dragon, is heritage listed. Loong is an important part of Australian history thanks to his presence at the parades for Federation in 1901 and the Centenary of Federation in 2001. The museum also contains other dragons which all still perform today. =John St Alban Collection= In 2001, John St Alban, a private collector from Adelaide began donating pieces of his collection to the museum. Acquired from Chinese dealers in the 20th Century this collection contains lavish furniture and adornments from palaces and temples of the late Qing Dynasty. Such large pieces are rarely seen on public display in collections outside of China. These include screens, thrones and chairs made of Huanghuali wood. Many ornate silver, cloisonné and bronze incense burners. Jade carvings have been inlaid on both the wooden pieces and elsewhere throughout the collection, as well as some Jade pieces which stand on their own. There are also cloisonné bronze and marble statues of guardians and religious icons. Porcelain items were also donated. One dish has been dated back to the Song Dynasty. =Dai Gum San Wax Works Collection= The Dai Gum San Wax Works in Bendigo closed down in the late 1980s. It contained a range of wax Chinese figures including a likeness of Dr Sun Yat-sen. All these figures were given into the care of the Bendigo Chinese Association and when the Golden Dragon Museum opened they were an important part of the displays. These wax figures were made in Hong Kong by Vivian Sun. They arrived in Bendigo in 1973.The Golden Dragon Museum. (2010). The 1880s Processional Regalia of the Bendigo Chinese Association.

Bendigo. . pg 2 Qin Dynasty era coin from the Golden Dragon Museum =The Horrie Bridges Collection= Horrie Bridges was a local Bendigo man with a passion for collecting foreign currency. Over many years and several trips to China he amassed a comprehensive collection of Chinese currency. He donated this to the museum in 1991. The collection contains several Zhou Dynasty era pieces of knife money. The earliest round coins in the collection are two Qin Dynasty ones. From there the collection of ancient Chinese coinage is vast and comprehensive. Horrie Bridges also collected paper money. All of the paper items are from the 20th century. There are notes from the Republic of China era, 1912-1949, there are notes from the People's Republic as well as some rare notes from Manchukuo. This collection is believed to be the largest collection of Chinese currency on display anywhere in Australia. Education The Golden Dragon Museum hosts tour groups from schools throughout Australia. It contains several displays which portray the success and value of multiculturalism. The museum also contains displays which show the hardships and racism many Chinese faced because of the White Australia policy at the beginning of the 20th century. Alongside these specific displays the assorted Chinese artifacts are great examples of Chinese culture and history. The Golden Dragon Museum also offers educational craft workshops to tour groups and it also offers its expertise to other community museums around Australia. In 2013 the museum began running night time Chinese language classes.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux on 30 October 2013. A handheld version titled Football Manager Handheld 2014 was released for iOS and Android on 14 November 2013. A PlayStation Vita version titled Football Manager Classic 2014 was released on 11 April 2014. Gameplay FM14 features similar gameplay to that of the Football Manager series. Gameplay consists of taking charge of a professional association football team, as the team manager. Players can sign football players to contracts, manage finances for the club, and give team talks to players. FM14 is a simulation of real world management, with the player being judged on various factors by the club's AI owners and board. FM14 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. In addition, a number of new ‘real world’ transfer clauses have been added, such as the ability to loan a player back to the club he's just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. The old ‘turn-based’ system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new ‘live’ system, similar to that used in Football Manager's contract negotiations. Interaction between players, managers, their rivals and the media has been improved. For example, members of the coaching staff now offer feedback on how reserve and youth team players are performing. Managers can also ask key players to have a word with unhappy squad members, while the introduction of an end-of-season meeting allows the manager to let the squad know how they have performed and set targets for the coming season. Contract negotiations are more realistic in the game, as managers and boards can now make demands and lay down their visions for the club in both initial job interviews and contract renewal discussions. Managers can attempt to renegotiate transfer and wage budgets as a reward for staying loyal if they've been offered a job by another club, with the outcome helping to aid their decision on whether to move or not. The news system has been overhauled so managers can now deal with many club matters directly from their inbox. In addition, news is now colour-coded, based on category, and contains more detail – for example, scout reports now appear as a single news item with a top-line report on all players scouted and the facility to short-list or make an offer for each of these players. For the first time in the series, star players will have a testimonial having been at the club for a certain period of time or when they announce their retirement. The match engine features extensive improvements, including enhanced AI, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations. Creation of tactics, selection and implementation with player roles and team strategies, definable roles for players for multiple positions, new player roles and instructions and improvements to rival managers’ AI have been overhauled so that they adapt their tactics more readily over time.Football Manager 2014 Development The game was announced on 14 August 2013 on Football Manager's official website. A beta version of the game was available for download 2 weeks prior to the game is released, exclusive to those who pre-order The PlayStation Vita version is titled Football Manager Classic 2014 and unlike other handheld versions of the previous instalments in the series it will include the 3D match engine.

The school's population is just under 700 students, aged between 5 and 18 years. It was founded in 1929 by the school benefactor Baroness Strickland, Countess della Catena, who gave a generous gift to establish the college. The college was built on the grounds of what was once a Knights of Malta fort and the rear end of the school is still today surrounded by the bastion walls of the fort. The school was modelled on the ideas and ideals of British public schools, initially to educate the boys of the Maltese aristocracy and the boys of the British military officers based in Malta.Cannadine, David. Aspects of Aristocracy: Grandeur and Decline in Modern Britain. Background history  Cottonera Military Hospital in 1906 The Governor of Malta, Sir John Philip Du Cane, obtained the buildings of what was once the Cottonera Military Hospital in Vittoriosa, along with the parade ground adjoining to St. Clement's bastions built by the Knights of Malta. The hospital was where Florence Nightingale once worked and spent some time nursing the wounded soldiers from the Crimean War. The perimeter of the western side of the site formed part of the impressive Cottonera lines, a fortified wall built by the Knights of St John. The extensive grounds between the bastion walls and the old hospital buildings would serve as ideal recreational areas and would also give the college enough space for expansion when needed.Rossiter, Stuart. Malta – The Blue Guide. Thus, with an ideal site secured and the necessary financial backing guaranteed, a small group of distinguished gentlemen, among them senior notable members of the Maltese nobility, gathered in the Governor's Palace in Valletta on 18 January 1929 to sign a Foundation Deed of Trust. The following October the school opened its gates to twenty-nine foundation pupils. The numbers of pupils during the college's first years would remain considerably low due to the relatively high fees which were necessary to keep the college running. The British Council's timely financial backing made it possible for the college to lower fees for local pupils. As a result, the population grew steadily with an increasing number of Maltese gentry sending their boys to the school. In the mid-1930s, an old ammunitions depot built by the Knights of St John was converted into the college's chapel. Physics and chemistry laboratories and additional dormitories were also developed at this time. By the late 1930s, it became apparent that the buildings could not be altered or modified further and the construction of a new wing was proposed. However, with the advent of World War II, these plans had to be shelved since the college's perilously close proximity to Malta's main harbours necessitated a temporary relocation to the old seminary in Mdina for the duration of the war. The building of the new classrooms (the Middle School block) occurred after the boys and college masters moved back to Cottonera in 1946. With the new classrooms completed, few other structural changes were made for nearly two decades, at which point the need for modern science facilities became a pressing issue. A successful fund-raising campaign resulted in the laying of the foundation stone of the new block in 1967 by Sir Maurice Dorman, the last British Governor-General of Malta. With a generous donation made by the Trustees of the British Boys Schools of Alexandria and the Victoria College, Alexandria Foundation, the much-needed Assembly Hall in the new block became a reality. In the 1970s, the block that used to house the married teachers was converted into the Junior School, which also included an Infant's Section. Due to the college's growing popularity, the Junior School received a structural revamping and extension in 1994. Classrooms were enlarged and the designs (by Old Edwardian Richard England) also ensured that the Junior School building now had their own drama and music hall as well as an IT room.St. Edward's College Malta: Memoirs of the first seventy five years. Published By St. Edward's College Press 2004.  Houses  The school has three houses named after three Governors-General of Malta: Ducane House Sir John Du Cane (Green), Campbell House Sir David Campbell (Red) and Congreve House Sir Walter Congreve (Blue).

With a total of 530,000 visitors in 2010, it is the second most visited tourist site in Normandy after the Mont Saint-Michel.Secrets d'histoire, « Claude Monet: jardins secrets à Giverny », Broadcast on France 2, 30 August 2011 The house and gardens, where Monet lived and painted for 43 years, have been recognised as among the Maisons des Illustres, and a Jardin Remarquable, rewarding their outstanding qualities. The estate was classified as a monument historique in 1976. Monet's paintings of the gardens, and of the sites' water lilies and the accompanying pond, bridge, and Weeping Willow tree, are exhibited in dozens of major collections.  History  Claude Monet lived and painted in Giverny from 1883 to his death in 1926, and directed the renovation of the house, retaining its pink-painted walls. Colours from the painter's own palette were used for the interior -green for the doors and shutters, yellow in the dining room, complete with Japanese Prints from the 18th and 19th centuries, and blue for the kitchen. Monet had the nearby river Epte partially diverted for the gardens and hired up to seven gardeners to tend to it. Monet gained much of his inspiration from his gardens and believed it was important to surround himself with nature and paint outdoors. When Monet died in 1926, the entire estate was passed on to his son Michel. As he never spent time in Giverny, it was left to Blanche Hoschedé Monet, the daughter of Alice and the widow of Jean Monet, to look after the garden with the help of former head gardener Louis Lebret. After Blanche died in 1947, the garden was left untended. The restored house and gardens Michel Monet died heirless in a car crash in 1966. He had bequeathed the estate to the Académie des beaux-arts. From 1977 onwards, Gérald Van der Kemp, then curator at the Palace of Versailles, played a key role in the restoration of the neglected house and gardens, which had been left in a desolate state. In a bid to raise funds, he and his wife Florence appealed to American donors through the \\"Versailles Foundation- Giverny Inc.\\". They, thereafter, dedicated themselves to its restoration. The Fondation Claude Monet was created in 1980 as the estate was declared public. It soon became very successful and now welcomes both French and international visitors from April to November. When Gérald Van der Kemp died in 2001, Florence Van der Kemp became the curator of the Fondation Monet and continued renovating the property until her death in 2008. Hugues Gall was appointed Director of the Fondation Claude Monet by the Académie des beaux-arts in March 2008.  The house  Visitors have access to: * The ground floor: the blue salon (the reading room), the \\"épicerie\\" (the larder), the living room/studio, the dining room and the blue-tiled kitchen. * The first floor: the family rooms, including Monet's which was renovated in March 2013 as well as Alice Hoschedé's bedroom and their private apartments. Also visible is the room of Blanche Hoschedé, which was recreated in 2013 based on archives and existing elements present in the house. * The studio next to the home, where Monet painted his large Water Lilies paintings and murals, including those exhibited in Paris' Musée de l'Orangerie. This studio is now the Foundation's gift shop.  The gardens  The Gardens are divided into two distinctive parts, which have been restored according to Monet's own specifications. The Clos-Normand was modelled after Monet's own artistic vision when he settled in Giverny. He spent years transforming the garden into a living en plein air painting, planting thousands of flowers in straight-lined patterns. In 1893 Monet acquired a vacant piece of land across the road from the Clos-Normand which he then transformed into a water garden by diverting water from the stream Ru, an arm of the Epte river. That garden became famous during his lifetime with his series of monumental paintings of its water lilies, the Nymphéas.

The company evolved from trans- disciplinary research at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, in London. The company was founded by Stefano Rabolli Pansera in 2009 as a collaborative practice operating public-private partnerships globally. Beyond Entropy Ltd operates at the threshold between art, architecture, and geopolitics focusing on the notion of energy influencing form. Projects vary from art installations, to architectural master-planning, to public relations.  History  Stefano Rabolli Pansera set up a cluster of research at the Architectural Association in 2009. The theme was “Beyond Entropy, when Energy becomes Form”. The research consisted in a collaboration between artists, scientists and architects to create a new discourse on the notion energy and its relationship to space beyond the rhetoric of sustainability. After a visit to the CERN Institute in Geneva and a series of workshops, lectures and symposia in London, eight prototypes were created and they were exhibited in a collateral event “Beyond Entropy When Energy becomes Form” at 12th Venice Architecture Biennale. During the opening of the Biennale, Beyond Entropy organised a 12-hour-long presentation and debate on energy with world-leading intellectuals including Toni Negri, Judith Revel, Ricky Burdett, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. The exhibition ‘Beyond Entropy’ was shown at the Milan Triennale (May 2011) and at the Architecture Association, School of Architecture in London (June 2011). After these exhibitions, Beyond Entropy evolved into an independent organisation that develops architectural, urban and curatorial projects in an effort to reveal a specific energetic understanding of territorial conditions based upon a specific method and approach.  Theoretical Approach  The theoretical approach of Beyond Entropy refers to a notion of qualitative transformation that draws back to Gilles Deleuze’s notion of Becoming, to Aldo Rossi’s urban theory and to Pascal Schöning notion of Cinematic Architecture. The specific research of Beyond Entropy refers explicitly to some of the production of Arte Povera and Land Art. The prototypes in Venice were instrumental to reconfigure an architectural language articulated in five points: * Energy as Form * Energy as Brief * Energy as Scale * Energy as Structure * Energy as Representation  Territories  Since 2012, Beyond Entropy operates globally in situations of territorial crisis. Beyond Entropy has defined several regions of investigations: each region is analysed through a set of territorial problems that can be understood within the dialectics of energy and form, transformation and resistance, energy and entropy, matter and action. Beyond Entropy is currently working in the urban sprawl of some of the most industrialized parts of the planet (Beyond Entropy Europe); in the derelict infrastructures of deserted islands and coastline of the Mediterranean (Beyond Entropy Mediterranean); the overcrowded urban areas of the cities in emerging countries (Beyond Entropy Africa). Furthermore Beyond Entropy has created a Publishing House (Beyond Entropy Publication) and a Radio (Beyond Entropy Radio) that are developed as territories themselves. = Beyond Entropy Africa = In 2011, Stefano Rabolli Pansera and Paula Nascimento founded Beyond Entropy Africa, a limited company registered in Angola. Beyond Entropy Africa focuses on Luanda as the paradigm of the urban condition of the African Sub- Saharan region, a type of city that is defined by a lack of basic infrastructures and a high density of population. In 2012, Beyond Entropy Africa curated the Angola Pavilion at the 13th Architecture Biennale in Venice \\"Beyond Entropy Angola\\", Domus entitled ‘Beyond Entropy Angola’.\\"Beyond Entropy Angola\\" Archello In 2013, Beyond Entropy Africa curated the Angola Pavilion at the 55th Art Biennale in Venice entitled ‘Luanda, Encyclopedic City’ featuring the work of photographer Chagas.

Beyond Entropy Mediterranean focuses on the proposal of a Mediterranean Kunsthalle articulated around the Museum of Contemporary Art of Calasetta and the Open Air Gallery of Mangiabarche.\\"Art beacon in the Mediterranean\\", Domus = Beyond Entropy Europe = Beyond Entropy Europe looks at the urban sprawl of Northern Italy as the privileged example of a condition where city and countryside are blurred into an entropic landscape.

As with the Potts model, each spin can take n=0,...N-1 values. To each pair of nearest neighbor of spins n and n', a Boltzmann weight W(n-n') (Boltzmann factor) is assigned. The model is chiral, meaning W(n-n')≠ W(n'-n). When its weights satisfy the Yang–Baxter equation, (star–triangle relation), it is integrable. For the integrable chiral Potts model, its weights are parametrized by a high genus curve, the chiral Potts curve.Au-Yang H., McCoy B. M., Perk J. H. H., Tang S. and Yan M-L.

Therefore, it was thought that no progress could be made for such a difficult problem. Yet, many breakthroughs have been made since the 1990s. It must be stressed again that the chiral Potts model was not invented because it was integrable but the integrable case was found, after it was introduced to explain experimental data. In a very profound way physics is here far ahead of mathematics. The history and its development will be presented here briefly. Note that the chiral clock model, which has been introduced in the 1980s, independently, by David Huse and Stellan Ostlund, is not exactly solvable, in contrast to the chiral Potts model.  The model  This model is out of the class of all previously known models and raises a host of unsolved questions which are related to some of the most intractable problems of algebraic geometry which have been with us for 150 years. The chiral Potts models are used to understand the commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions.S. Howes, L.P. Kadanoff and M. den Nijs (1983), Nuclear Physics B 215, 169.

R. Cama, was a Parsi scholar and reformer from Bombay. Indian National Congress group in 1904; Cama is fourth from the left, standing in the back row Early life From a privileged family background, Cama gained a reputation as a scholar. He had a traditional Parsi education, and then went to Elphinstone School in Bombay. Leaving in 1849, he joined a trading house in Calcutta, and then travelled in 1850 to London, returning in 1854 to Bombay. Going into business with Dadabhai Naoroji, he went again to Europe in 1855, and studied with orientalists there: Julius Mohl and Julius Oppert in Paris, and Friedrich von Spiegel at the University of Erlangen.Encyclopædia Iranica, Cama, Kharshedji Rustamh. Naoroji with Cama and his cousin Muncherjee Hormusji Cama set up the first Indian firm trading in Europe, based in London and Liverpool. Cama and Naoroji then dropped out, however, because of the firm's dealings in alcohol and opium. Reformer There was an identifiable group of Bombay Parsi reformers, including Naoroji and Manockjee Cursetjee as well as Cama, concerned with educational reform, the position of women, and political participation. These interests typically went hand in hand with opposition to the local Panchayat, and religious reform. Cama supported the major reformist publication Rast Goftar (\\"Herald of Truth\\"), founded in 1851. Cama was a member of the Amelioration Society set up in 1855 by Merwanji Framji Panday, which brought together reformers and conservative Parsis. In the 1860s he began to concentrate on his own intellectual roots, and worked to develop education in the Parsi community. He was an influential figure also in the Asiatic Society of Bombay. Cama emerged as the leading religious reformer of the period, and founded an association, the Zarthoshti Din ni Khol Karnari Mandali (\\"Society for Promoting Research on the Zoroastrian Religion\\") to promote his views, based on a meeting with dasturs in 1864. His studies in Europe of Avestan and Pahlavi gave him assurance in criticising scholarly deficiencies of the local priesthood.Shroff, pp. 180–1. His programme included the exclusion from Parsi religious practice of all Hindu elements, and improvement of the madressa schools;James Emerson Whitehurst, The Zoroastrian Response to Westernization: A Case Study of the Parsis of Bombay, Journal of the American Academy of Religion Vol. 37, No. 3 (Sep. 1969), pp. 224–236, at pp. 227–8.

He was a founding director of the Alexandra Native Girls' English Institution.Shroff, p. 84. Behramji Malabari's social programme, aimed at reforming Hindu custom, also attracted his support. Conservative orthodox Parsis named the reforming group around the Mandali the \\"Paris Protestants\\".Shroff, p. 184. Influence From 1861 Cama taught Avestan and Pahlavi in his home, with methods drawing on European philology.Shroff, p. 181.

He was an early influence on Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, later his biographer.Encyclopædia Iranica, Modi, Jivanji Jamshedji. Interested in calendar reform, Cama published on the Zoroastrian calendar in the 1860s. He contested the accepted date of the arrival of Parsis in India, setting it at 936, against the date then received (Dastur Kamdin) of 716. In the 1870s he went on to speculate more broadly on religion, encompassing Mithraism and freemasonry in his interests, and addressing those outside the Parsi community. Legacy The K. R. Cama Institute was established in 1916 to perpetuate his memory, following meetings at which the British administration, Parsi reformers, businessmen, and Wilson College were represented. The Hindu merchant Damodhardas Gordhandas Sukhadwala offered financial support for an institute, which was inaugurated by Lord Willingdon. Initially it was housed at the Sukhadwala building in Hornby Street. From 1936 it had its own premises, at 136 Apollo Street, Fort, Bombay. It publishes books and a journal. From an initial library consisting of works from Cama's personal collection, it has assembled a research library for orientalists.Shroff, pp. 149–53 Family Cama was twice married.

She was built in Scotland in 1928, and from then until 1940 Yoma ran a regular route between Glasgow in Scotland and Rangoon in Burma via Liverpool, Palma, Marseille and Egypt. She became a troop ship in 1941 and was sunk with great loss of life in the Mediterranean in 1943. Yoma was a ship of the Henderson Line of Glasgow. She was managed by P Henderson & Company and initially owned jointly by two other P Henderson companies: British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company Ltd and Burmah Steam Ship Company Ltd. From 1934 the British and Burmese SN Co Ltd was Yomas sole owner. Yoma was one of a family of similarly-sized liners built for Henderson's by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton on the River Clyde. These were , , and – completed in 1920, '21, '24 and '25 respectively. Each was about and carried cargo as well as passengers. Namesakes Yoma was the second of four similarly-named vessels in Henderson's fleet. The first was , which was built in 1926 and sold in 1927. The third was , which was built in 1948, and transferred in 1952 to Elder Dempster Lines. The fourth was MS Yoma, which was built for Elder, Dempster in 1958 as and renamed Yoma in 1965 when she was transferred to Henderson's. Engines Yomas boilers had oil-burning furnaces and supplied steam to a quadruple expansion steam engine rated at 550 NHP. In 1939 a low- pressure steam turbine was added to supplement the reciprocating engine. The turbine ran on exhaust steam from the reciprocating engine's low-pressure cylinder and drove the propeller shaft by double-reduction gearing and an hydraulic coupling. The combination of reciprocating and turbine propulsion gave Yoma a speed of . Civilian service at war For 15 months after the UK's entry into the Second World War Yoma continued her service between Britain and Burma, but sailing in convoys for the most hazardous parts of her route. On 19 September 1939 she left Liverpool for Rangoon with general cargo and 125 passengers. She sailed with Convoy OB 7 until it dispersed in the North Atlantic, then from Gibraltar as far as Alexandria she sailed with Convoy Green 3. She returned from Rangoon to Britain carrying general cargo, sailing with Convoy HG 10 from Gibraltar to Liverpool for the last leg of her voyage. In January 1940 Yoma left Liverpool for Rangoon, sailing with Convoy OB 73 which at sea became the fast convoy Convoy OG 15F to Gibraltar. On her return from Rangoon she joined Convoy HG 24 at Gibraltar at the end of March, which reached Liverpool in the first week of April. Before the end of April she left Liverpool for Rangoon, sailing with Convoy OB-133 which at sea became the fast convoy [Convoy OG 27F to Gibraltar. However, before Yomas return from Rangoon Italy entered the war, making the Mediterranean unsafe for Allied merchant shipping. She therefore made a longer return voyage via the Cape of Good Hope, the South Atlantic and West Africa. At Freetown in Sierra Leone she joined the fast Convoy SL-39F, which caught up with and joined Convoy SL 39 at sea. SL-39 reached Liverpool at the end of July. At the end of August 1940 Yoma left Liverpool for Rangoon, sailing with Convoy OB 204 until it dispersed at sea. Using the loger route via the Cape of Good Hope it was not until December that she returned, joining Convoy SL 58 for the homeward leg of the voyage from Freetown to Liverpool. Indian Ocean troop ship In January 1941 Yoma was converted into a troop ship. On 18 February carrying 1,628 troops she sailed from the Firth of Clyde with Convoy WS 6B to Freetown, and on 8 April 1941 she left Freetown with Convoy WS 6 to Cape Town. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope she spent the next two years in the Indian Ocean, moving troops mostly between Mombasa, Aden, Bombay, Colombo and Bandar Abbas. In January 1942 Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies and in February Yoma took troops from Colombo to Batavia, arriving with Convoy JS 1 and returning with Convoy SJ 5. Embarking troops at Durban 11-12 February 1943. Sailed Durban 13 February 1943 in a convoy escorted by HMS Dauntless and two destroyers; after the 22nd the escort was an armed merchantman; arriving Bombay 4 March 1943. Yomas final Indian Ocean voyage was with Convoy PA-33 from Bandar Abbas to Aden in April 1943. Convoy GTX 2 and loss , one of the Royal Australian Navy corvettes that rescued survivors , the other Australian corvette that took part in the rescue On 13 May Axis forces in Tunisia surrendered, ending the North African Campaign and opening the way for the Allied Invasion of Sicily. Yoma was transferred to the Mediterranean, and on 17 May she sailed with Convoy KMX 14X from Gibraltar to Alexandria. On 8 June she again left Gibraltar for Alexandria, this time in Convoy GTX 2. She called at Sfax in Tunisia and Tripoli in Libya, leaving the latter on 16 June. She left Tripoli carrying 134 officers and 994 other ranks of the British Army and 22 officers and 643 ratings of the Free French Naval Forces. Many of the British troops were Royal Engineers, including 994 Dock Operating Company and 1010 Dock Operating Company, who were going to Alexandria to be kitted out and were then to operate port facilities for the Sicilian campaign. On the morning of 17 June the convoy was northwest of the port of Derna, Libya. At 0733 hours many of the men were below decks having breakfast when commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Johann-Otto Krieg fired two torpedoes. Accounts differ as to what followed. U-boat historian Guðmundur Helgason states that one torpedo hit Yoma, but Second World War blogger Martin Cherrett states that both of them hit her, one in her engine room and the other in her number 4 hold, sinking her within five minutes. Either way, the Chief Officer, A Olding, reported that she sank rapidly. Olding stated that the explosion destroyed the after engine room bulkhead, rapidly flooding the engine room, boiler room and no. 5 hold and blowing the hatches of nos. 3 and 4 holds. As men scrambled for safety, the ladders on No. 2 mess deck collapsed, trapping many men below decks. Yoma settled rapidly by her stern and was shrouded by escaping steam and clouds of coal dust. Her Master, George Patterson ordered \\"abandon ship\\" and Chief Officer Olding was among those who made for their boat stations. Olding and his lifeboat crew succeeded in releasing their boat so that it floated as the ship went down. The ship sank stern first, and as she did her bow rose more steeply. Olding described: > \\"...by this time the Yoma was well down by the stern and the next thing I > knew she sank under my feet and I found myself in the water... as the boat > rose I saw a lot of men on the foc’sle head: they would not jump into the > water,... as the bow lifted a number of them lost their footing and fell > onto the bridge, many others being dragged under by the ship.\\" Two of the Royal Engineers having breakfast were Herbert Cullum from County Durham and his friend George Monk. Monk told the Cullum family: > \\"Bert was at hand's reach from me, when it happened. We all got thrown > across seats and on the floor and after I managed to regain my feet, which > was very difficult, I looked around for Bert. He was nowhere to be seen... > after great difficulty and luck I found myself in the water, and for the one > and three quarter hours in which I was drifting around my eyes were > constantly looking for Bert, but could not see him.\\" 484 people were killed: Captain Patterson, 29 crew members, three DEMS gunners and 451 military personnel. Because of the danger from enemy submarines Convoy GTX 2 continued on its way. However, a rescue operation was undertaken by the Royal Australian Navy s and , Royal Navy coastal motor minesweepers HMS MMS-102 and HMS MMS-105 and a British-registered merchant ship: the Park ship . Between them the five vessels rescued 130 crew members, five DEMS gunners and 1,342 military personnel. Monuments Most of the 484 people killed in Yomas sinking have no known grave. The Brookwood Memorial in Surrey lists those who were UK or Commonwealth military personnel. The Second World War part of the Tower Hill Memorial in the City of London lists those who were members of Yomas Merchant Navy crew. Successor ships In 1948 Henderson's took delivery of a new Yoma, a turbine steamship that at was considerably smaller than her predecessor. In 1952 Elder Dempster Lines took over Henderson's and transferred TSS Yoma to the Elder Dempster fleet. In 1965 TSS Yoma was sold to Taiwanese owners and renamed Hai Ping. In the same year Elder, Dempster transferred a 1958-built motor ship, the MS Daru, to the Henderson fleet and renamed Yoma. Also in 1965, Elder, Dempster took over John Holt & Co and its subsidiary Gulf Guinea Line. In 1966 Elder, Dempster changed MS Yoma back to Daru and transferred her to Guinea Gulf Line. In 1979 she was sold to Liberian owners and renamed Lone Eagle.

He was a member of the Legislative Council of New Munster Province from 1849, and was appointed to the new Legislative Council in 1853 until his resignation in 1860. He returned to England and died in Worcestershire. Life Seymour first comes to notice as Steward of the Public Rooms in Teignmouth (new public rooms had been opened there in 1826, replacing an earlier establishment of 1796),John F Travis The Rise of Devon Seaside Resorts 1750-1900 1993, where he organized events such as regattas and Christmas balls.Exeter & Plymouth Gazette of 8 Dec 1827, 16 Aug 1828 Evidently building on this experience, in 1830 he became the first lessee of the Pittville Pump Room in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England,'Pittville Pump Room', Steven Blake 1980 living in a house in nearby Prestbury. He was secretary of the Cheltenham Horticultural Society, and when he emigrated to New Zealand, he took acorns with him. At Pittville, he was acquainted with the architect and future New Zealand public figure Robert Stokes (politician), who tried to get Seymour a passage at the same time he himself emigrated in 1839,Archives NZ reference NZC 34/13/18 describing him as 'a most active person and of great energy'. By 1837, Seymour was combining running the Pump Room in the summer with operating the Pulteney Hotel in Bath in the winter.London Evening Standard, 3 Jan 1837 In the event, Seymour came to Nelson in April 1842 on board the Martha Ridgway, accompanied by his wife Elizabeth and daughter Fanny. Alfred Fell had arrived two months before him, and together they set themselves up as merchants and became very rich. Seymour and Fell were active as land agents, and both also speculated with land themselves. They owned the land on which Blenheim was founded, and Seymour Square is officially named for Henry Seymour, although there are some who claim that it is named for the unrelated Arthur Seymour. The Seymours left for England in late 1850, and returned with the Maori on Christmas Day in 1851. Fell and Seymour were business partners until 1857, when Seymour decided to return to England permanently as his wife was suffering from poor health. Seymour sold his business interests to Nathaniel Edwards. The Seymours left for England in April 1857 and locals of all classes signed a testimonial, expressing their appreciation of his contributions to society. His house, Prestbury Cottage, was put up for sale in February 1858 and was still on the market the following January. From England, Seymour helped with the appointment of a new head master for Nelson College in 1858, and George Heppel from St John's College in Cambridge was sent to New Zealand. Political career Seymour was appointed to the Legislative Council of New Munster Province on 18 January 1849. During his New Munster membership, the Legislative Council had its only session during May and June 1849. The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 outlined a new form of governance for New Zealand, and the Governor, George Grey, nominated the first members of the new Legislative Council in May 1853, and chose the remaining ones on 31 December of that year. Seymour was part of the latter nomination and remained a member until 28 May 1860, when he resigned. In the house, Seymour was unpopular as a representative of large absentee landlords, but in the new Legislative Council, his experience in constitutional and procedural matters was valued. Family and death Warwick House, built by his business partner and son-in- law Alfred Fell Fanny Seymour and Alfred Fell married on 26 October 1843. Their first son, Charles Fell (1844–1918), was later Mayor of Nelson during the 1880s. Their third son, Alfred George Fell (1848–1917), was Mayor of Blenheim in the 1870s. Their fourth son, also called Arthur Fell (1850–1934), was an English solicitor and represented the Conservative Party in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Their seventh and youngest son, Edward \\"Nelson\\" Fell (1857–1928), emigrated to the United States, where he founded two townships in Florida: Narcoossee and Fellsmere. Seymour and Fell purchased a section just south of Nelson bordering the Brook Stream; Bronte Street was the northern boundary. Both Seymour and Fell built houses on the land, and Fell's house, today known as Warwick House (formerly Sunnyside), still stands and is registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building. Seymour planted two Quercus robur (English oak) on the banks of the Brook Stream in 1842/43, but one of the trees was washed away in a flood the following year. After a lengthy search, the tree was found downstream on the banks of the Maitai River, and replanted by either Seymour or Fell some distance away from Brook Stream. This replanted tree is still alive and is located on road reserve outside 4 Seymour Avenue. The tree was probably the first English oak to be planted in the Nelson region. The property was later also purchased by Nathaniel Edwards, and when the Edwards family subdivided the land in 1910, the resulting road was called Seymour Avenue to commemorate Fanny Fell. Seymour died on 31 March 1883 in Kempsey near Worcester, England aged 86.

The size of today's average business card - sextodecimo - these cards often contained a president's signature and sometimes a short message or sentiment. Early Use President Abraham Lincoln instituted the first printed presidential stationary, emblazoned with \\"Executive Mansion.\\" Executive Mansion cards were first employed by President Ulysses S. Grant. These are extremely rare as only one is known to exist and it is dated by Grant as president. It is in the collection of Stephen Koschal. Executive Mansion cards signed by Rutherford B. Hayes are what collectors can basically start there collection with his example. Variations Early President cards, such as Millard Fillmore's, were simply a blank card, approximately 4x6in. Presidents have also used visiting cards since the early 19th century, usually saying simply \\"The President\\" in ornate script. Signed examples of these cards occasionally come up for sale. Otherwise, it can be difficult to determine which president used the card. The official Executive Mansion card of Rutherford B. Hayes contained the header, \\"Executive Mansion, Washington\\" on the upper left corner of the card. On later cards, such as William McKinley's, the header was displayed in the upper right corner. President Grover Cleveland distinguished cards signed during his two non-consecutive terms in office by adding the year under his signature during his second term. President Benjamin Harrison preferred to respond to autograph requests by signing a card with an engraved view of the White House. Executive Mansion cards signed by Harrison, therefore, are somewhat scarce. One month after taking office following McKinley's assassination, Theodore Roosevelt changed the name of the presidential residence from \\"Executive Mansion\\" to \\"White House,\\" which it had been popularly called since 1810. With this, he ordered the Presidential stationary to also bear the name \\"White House\\" (later \\"The White House\\"), which can be seen on his cards as well. He signed a handful of \\"Executive Mansion\\" cards prior to the change, and these are rare collector's items. Both Roosevelt and President Woodrow Wilson were concerned that an unscrupulous individual might attempt to append a message above their signatures. To prevent this, both tended to sign their names high on the left-hand side of the card. Later presidents, such as Calvin Coolidge, thwarted this possibility by making their signatures exceptionally large. In addition to the normal White House card, President Warren G. Harding also signed a larger white card with no lettering, but with the presidential seal embossed in gold at the top. Herbert Hoover was the last president to sign and distribute the cards routinely to anyone who asked. Starting with the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the vast increase in the president's workload meant the cards were increasingly signed mostly for friends and political supporters. Signed White House cards by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S Truman exist, but are less common than those of earlier presidents. President Dwight D. Eisenhower began the practice of providing the card with a printed signature, beneath the sentiment \\"with best wishes.\\" A printed or autopen signature thus became the norm. Occasionally, collectors were able to obtain authentic signatures, making these cards rare and valuable collector's items. The design of the card remained essentially unchanged from the administration of Theodore Roosevelt through Jimmy Carter. Carter moved the lettering \\"The White House, Washington\\" to the left hand corner and added an engraved view of the South Portico of the White House. President George H.W. Bush also altered the card, moving the heading \\"The White House, Washington\\" back to the right hand corner, removing the view of the White House and adding a raised presidential seal in blue on the card's left side. First Ladies also used the cards to fulfill autograph requests. Occasionally, other family members, such as Margaret Truman Daniel, as well as staff members, signed them as well. There is one known example signed by Edward, Prince of Wales, during a visit to the White House during the Coolidge Administration. White House Card Use Today The White House card has fallen out of general use and has been replaced with the popular White House greeting cards. Today, receipt of these cards is restricted to U.S. citizens and requests are only fulfilled for a limited list of specified occasions.

(10 January 1942 – c. 1977), was an Argentinian member of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, who became a victim of that nation's dirty war during the 1970s. He was arrested on the street by members of the police force on 9 April 1977, and was never seen again. Early life Bustos was born in Córdoba, Argentina, 10 January 1942. He entered the Franciscan novitiate on 3 March 1961 and was professed as a Capuchin friar the following year. Friar Carlos was ordained a Catholic priest at St. Mary of the Angels the on 2 May 1970.\\"Fray Carlos Armando Bustos (Buenos Aires 1977), Franciscans of Argentina After that, along with another friar named Pedro, he went to live in the “Ciudad Oculta” sector of Villa Lugano, within Buenos Aires. Priest and activist Experiencing the life of the severely poor of the city drew Bustos to seek a deeper identification with the people among whom he lived. While maintaining a joyful demeanor, playing on his guitar and cheering his colleagues with his jokes, he began to find that the work he was doing to help the poor was starting to bring him into conflict with the government then in power in Argentina. This was drawing him into a close collaboration with a small community of Little Brothers of the Gospel, a semi-contemplative religious order dedicated to sharing the lives of the poorest of the earth.\\"Victims\\", Nunca Mas His collaboration with Little Brother Patrick Rice, a native of Ireland, led him to start considering a transfer from the Capuchins to that congregation. To support himself, as well as sharing in the daily life of a working person, he started driving a taxi. He was also in close touch with the Movement of Priests for the Third World. These were dangerous connections to have in Argentina under the right wing military government. The summer of 1976 saw the widespread killing of members of the Catholic clergy and religious orders throughout Argentina, as the government attempted to consolidate its power and crack down on dissent. On 4 July, a small community of members of the Pallotine Congregation were murdered in their church, followed a month later by the mysterious death of the Bishop of La Rioja, Enrique Angelelli. This wave of death of the clergy and lay leaders in the Church led Bustos to begin criticizing the government publicly for its campaign against the Church. Bustos was part of a team of members of the clergy who went to La Rioja to investigate the bishop's death. In September 1976, he was among the members who released a document accusing the government of Angelelli's death as part of a campaign against the Catholic Church for its commitment to working with the poor. The document gained international attention. Early the following year, he met with his bishop, Cardinal Raúl Francisco Primatesta, who was also the President of the Bishops' Conference of Argentina, and was known to have close ties to the leaders of the military junta then ruling the country. He was seeking the cardinal's help in stopping the attacks on those priests and other members of the Church who were engaged in work for the poor. The cardinal was noncommittal. Disappearance On 8 April 1977, Bustos was returning home after participating in services at the Church of the Rosary of Nueva Pompeya for Holy Thursday, the start of the Easter observances. He was stopped on the street by the police and arrested. It was later learned that he was then taken to a secret detention center, known as the \\"Athletic Club\\" (), where he was tortured and interrogated. Nothing more was ever learned of his fate. Repeated requests by family members and the Capuchin friars brought no response from the military or government officials.

It was translated into English by Brian Stableford in 2010, and is considered by many to be Renard's masterpiece, with at least one critic exclaiming it \\"still reads as well as when it was originally published.\\" While a science fiction story, it also combines elements of the detective and horror genres. It features invisible sentient creatures living high in Earth's atmosphere who fish for men the way we do fish, and study the specimens they catch. Plot The Bugey region of France is a picturesque area in a low series of hills at the tip of the Jura Mountains. Mysteriously, human body parts start to be discovered scattered all over the landscape. Coincidentally, there have been instances of both humans and animals disappearing. Initially, we are led to believe that these are crimes of the natural sort, until it is discovered that they were kidnapped by invisible, ethereal beings, the Sarvants, living above the Earth in the upper atmosphere. It turns out that the whole planet is covered by a thin, transparent spherical membrane that covers the atmosphere in the same way that the earth's crust covers the molten rocks beneath. Once they have been collected, the humans are dissected, studied and mounted for display in a sort of museum of natural history. Certain bodies are discarded, and thrown \\"overboard\\", which is the cause of the body parts which are found scattered across Bugey. This is uncovered through an account found in the pocket of one of the bodies discovered, written by one of those unfortunate enough to have sojourned with Sarvants who managed to write and who chose to kill himself in order to be dumped out of their stratospheric dwelling. After managing to capture one of the ships of the Sarvants, the French authorities discover that these enigmatic beings do not exist as individual entities, rather they are a race of tiny insectile creatures who are able to assemble and dissemble their bodies with each other in order to form temporary and functional organs controlling their machines. Eventually, the Sarvants accidentally discover that the specimens they have been acquiring are capable of both suffering and rational thought. This realization leads the Sarvants to cease their experiments. Themes The Blue Peril is noteworthy due to its early anti-anthropomorphic treatment of the traditional science fiction theme regarding the possible existence of superior earthly life. Influences The Blue Peril may have been the inspiration of other such stories about the Earth being unknowingly occupied by superior aliens, such as Eric Frank Russell’s Sinister Barrier (1939). It was acknowledged as the central idea for John N Raphael's Up Above (1913), as well as borrowing (with permission) some of the details for his story, as was noted on the first page of Raphael's book. Notes In 2010, Le Péril Bleu was translated into English, by Brian Stableford, as part of a five-book translation of Renard's work.

Zealand. He was a member of the member of the New Zealand Legislative Council for one term from 1898 to 1905. Early life Lee Smith was born in Yorkshire in 1838. He received a private education, and was afterwards engaged at the London Stock Exchange. He came to New Zealand in 1868 and landed in Wellington. Professional career Donaghy's Rope Walk, a Category I heritage building in South Dunedin once owned by Lee Smith In Christchurch, Lee Smith had a brickworks. When he moved to Dunedin, he had a brickworks in Kensington. He then bought an interest in the firm Royse, Stead and Smith, grain and flour merchants. In 1881, he and William Royse bought Donaghy's Rope And Twine Company of its founder, John Donaghy, and Lee Smith became the company's chairman. The company still exists today as Donaghys. Donaghy's Rope Walk in South Dunedin is the only rope walk left in New Zealand, and is registered as a Category I heritage building due to its unique architectural form: the building is only wide, but long. Lee Smith then gained an interest in the Green Island Roller Mills and became the company's chairman. He was chairman of the Mutual Grain Agency, and from 1903 to 1915, he was a director and board member of the Union Steam Ship Company. He was one of the directors of the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition that was held in Dunedin in 1889–90. Political career Lee Smith entered public life when he stood for the newly-formed Dunedin Ratepayers' Association in the Leith Ward for Dunedin City Council in September 1886. It was his first election ever and he had an unexpectedly large majority. He retired by rotation after three years and did not stand for re-election. He stood in the in the three-member electorate and of the six candidates, he came last. When James William Thomson resigned from the electorate in 1892, he stood in the resulting by-election but was beaten by James Allen. Lee Smith was a man of principal and the Otago Daily Times commented in his obituary that he would have struggled in the House of Representatives to adhere to the party line, and that he was much better suited to the Legislative Council, where no adherence to party politics was required, but each issue could be discussed by him on its merits. In June and July 1894, Lee Smith was the sole New Zealand delegate at the Colonial Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Lee Smith was appointed by the Liberal Government as a member of the Legislative Council from 18 June 1898 to 18 June 1905 when his term ended. It is believed that Lee Smith fell out with Joseph Ward over a private issue and that he did not get reappointed in 1905 for that reason. At the time, though, there was a discussion whether the Legislative Council should be elected at large, and apparently the government informed the two members whose term expired on 18 June 1905 (Jeremiah Twomey was the other member) that they would not be reappointed until the controversy had been resolved. Family Lee Smith was married to Elizabeth Sharpe from Hull in Yorkshire. They lived in the Dunedin suburb of Green Island when he was appointed to the Legislative Council, but they later moved to Andersons Bay. He died on 2 May 1917 at his home in Andersons Bay and was buried at Green Island Cemetery next to his second son, Frank Lee Smith, who had died in August 1898. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1934, and his first son.

Roeder holds a master's degree in Business and Technology (MBT) from the University of NSW. Career Before becoming a writer, Roeder worked as a corporate executive, and held senior roles at UBS Banking Group, Zurich Insurance Group and Westpac and lived in London, New York, Sydney and Zurich. He currently works as a consultant with David Hale (economist) Global Economics, and is a Delphi Fellow contributor to Big Think. Works Roeder's book, The Big Mo (2011), explores the role that large-scale momentum played in the global financial crisis. It was described by the Financial Times as 'A compelling book that journeys seamlessly from finances to the Iraq war, from oil prices and climate change to religion and pop culture in an effort to explain how we behave and why we are so easily led.' Roeder explained that, The ABC broadcaster and critic Phillip Adams described The Big Mo as 'a revelation. In our personal, political and economic lives we seem to be swept along by circumstances. Our attempts to change direction are doomed. The Big Mo explains why.' The Guardian 's Steven Poole, criticised the book for 'overstretching the Newtonian-physics analogy'. Roeder's book, Unnatural Selection: Why the Geeks will Inherit the Earth (2013), analyses the impact of technology on human evolution and the rise of the ‘geek’ class.La Stampa review: http://www.lastampa.it/2015/01/02/blogs/obliqua-mente/addio- maschio-alpha-il-mondo-lo-domineranno-i-secchioni- SIs9fWTD668WM37rztdlzI/pagina.htmlAdam Spencer, ABC. 4 November 2013. http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2013/11/why-geeks-shall-inherit-the- earth.html?site=sydney&program;=702_breakfast The Australian newspaper. 18 October 2013. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/books/story-e6frgabx-1226741781473 It suggests that the Man-made environment of the Anthropocene is selecting for more non-neurotypical traits in humans, compared to previous generations, which is fostering a cognitive revolution in the human species.

The Eliot Indian Bible (officially: ', a.k.a.: Algonquian Bible) was the first Bible published in British North America. English Puritan missionary John Eliot produced a translation of the King James Bible into the indigenous Massachusett language. This is the reason that it is also known as Eliot's Indian Bible. ' and the cover page of the translated Bible means The Whole Holy His-Bible God, both Old Testament and also New Testament. This turned by the-servant-of-Christ, who is called John Eliot. It was first published as just the New Testament in 1661. The complete Bible of all 66 books (Old Testament and New Testament) was printed in 1663.  History  The history of Eliot's Indian Bible involves three historical events that came together to produce the Algonquian Bible. = America's first printing press = Stephen Daye of England contracted Jose Glover, a wealthy minister who disagreed with the religious teachings of the Church of England, to transport a printing press to America in 1638. Glover died at sea while traveling to America. His widow Elizabeth (Harris) Glover, Stephen Daye, and the press arrived at Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Mrs. Glover opened her print shop with the assistance of Daye. Daye started the operations of the first American print shop which was the forerunner of Harvard University Press. The press was located in the house of the president of Harvard College where religious materials such as the Bay Psalm Book were published in the 1640s. Elizabeth Glover married president of Harvard College Henry Dunster on June 21, 1641. = Act of Parliament = In 1649 Parliament enacted An Act for the Promoting and Propagating the Gospel of Jesus Christ in New England, which set up a Corporation in England consisting of a President, a Treasurer, and fourteen people to help them. The name of the Corporation was \\"The President and Society for the propagation of the Gospel in New England,\\" but it was later known simply as the New England Company. The Corporation had the power to collect money in England for missionary purposes in New England. This money was received by the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New England and dispersed for missionary purposes such as Eliot's Indian Bible. = Arrival of John Eliot = Eliot came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in 1631. One of his missions was to convert the indigenous Massachusett to Christianity. Eliot's instrument to do this was through the Christian scriptures. Eliot's feelings were that the Indians felt more comfortable hearing the scriptures in their own language than in English (a language they understood little of). Eliot thought it best to translate the English Christian Bible to an Algonquian Bible rather than teach the Massachusett Indians English. He then went about learning the Algonquian Indian language of the Massachusett people so he could translate English to the Natick dialect of the Massachusett language. Eliot translated the entire 66 books of the English Bible in a little over fourteen years. It had taken 44 scholars seven years to produce the King James Version of the Christian Bible in 1611. Eliot had to become a grammarian and lexicographer to devise an Algonquian dictionary and book of grammar. He used the assistance of a few local Massachusett Indians in order to facilitate the translation, including Cockenoe, John Sassamon, Job Nesuton, and James Printer. Eliot made his first text for the Corporation for the propagation of the Gospel in New England into the Massachusett language as a one volume textbook primer catechism in 1653 printed by Samuel Green. He then translated and had printed in 1655-56 the Gospel of Matthew, book of Genesis, and Psalms into the Algonquian Indian language. It was printed as a sample run for the London Corporation to show what a complete finished Algonquian Bible might look like. The Corporation approved the sample and sent a professional printer, Marmaduke Johnson, to America in 1660 with 100 reams of paper and eighty pounds of new type for the printer involved to print the Bible. To accommodate the transcription of the Algonquian Indian language phonemes extra \\"O's\\" and \\"K's\\" had to be ordered for the printing press. Johnson had a three-year contract to print the entire Bible of 66 books (Old Testament and New Testament). In 1661, with the assistance of the English printer Johnson and a Nipmuc named James Printer, Green printed 1,500 copies of the New Testament. In 1663 they printed 1,000 copies of the complete Bible of all 66 books (Old Testament and New Testament) in a 1,180 page volume. The costs for this production was paid by the Corporation authorized by the Parliament of England by donations collected in England and Wales. John Ratcliff did the binding for the 1663 edition.  Description  Eliot was determined to give the Christian Bible to them in their own Massachusett language. He learned the Natick dialect of the Massachusett language and its grammar. Eliot worked on the Indian Bible for over fourteen years before publication. England contributed about 16,000 pounds for its production by 1660. The money came from private donations in England and Wales. There was no donations or money from the New England colonies for Eliot's Indian Bible. The translation answered the question received many times by Eliot from the Massachusett was \\"How may I get faith in Christ?\\" The ecclesiastical answer was \\"Pray and read the Bible.\\" After Eliot's translation, there was a Bible they could read. Eliot translated the Bible from an unwritten American Indian language into a written alphabet that the Algonquian Indians could read and understand. He was the only missionary to make a new alphabet from an unwritten language for purposes of teaching scriptures in over a thousand years since Ulfilas constructed the Gothic alphabet. To show the difficulty of the Algonquian language used in Eliot's Indian Bible Cotton Mather gives as an example the Algonquian word ' (32 characters) which means \\"our lusts\\". He said that the Indian language did not have the least affinity to or derivation from any European speech. Some ecclesiastical questions given to Eliot by the Natick Indians that were to be answered by the new Algonquian Bible and Indian religious learning were: * If but one parent believe, what state are our children in? * How doth much sinne make grace abound? * If an old man as I repent, may I be saved? * What meaneth that, Let the trees of the Wood rejoice? * What meaneth that, We cannot serve two masters? * Can they in Heaven see us here on Earth? * Do they see and know each other? Shall I know you in heaven? * Do they know each other in Hell? * What meaneth God, when he says, Ye shall be my Jewels * If God made hell in one of the six dayes, why did God make Hell before Adam had sinned? * Doe not Englishmen their souls, to say a thing cost them more then it did? and is it not all one as to steale?  Legacy  In 1664 a specially constructed unique display copy was given to King Charles II by Robert Boyle, the Governor of the 'Corporation' for the propagation of the Gospel in New England. Many copies of the first edition (1663) of Eliot’s Indian Bible were destroyed by the British in 1675-76 by a war against Metacomet (war chief of the Wampanoag Indians). In 1685 after some debate the New England Company decided to publish another edition of Eliot’s Indian Bible. The second edition of the entire Bible was finished in 1686 at a fraction of the cost of what it took to put out the first edition. There were 2,000 copies printed. A dedication to Robert Boyle, governor of Massachusetts, had a special single leaf printed and placed into the 1685 presentation copies sent to Europe. The first English edition of the entire Bible was not published in the United States for some 120 years after Eliot's Indian Bible when Robert Aitken's Bible came out in 1782. Eliot's Indian Bible translation of the complete Christian Bible was supposedly written with one pen. This printing project was the largest printing job done in 17th-century Colonial America. The Massachusett Indian language Natick dialect that the translation of Eliot's Bible was made in no longer is used in the United States. The Algonquian Bible is today unreadable by most people in the world. Eliot's Indian Bible is notable for being the earliest known example of the translation and putting to print the entire 66 books of the Christian Bible into a new language of no previous written words. Eliot's Indian Bible was also significant because it was the first time the entire Bible was translated into a language not native to the translator. Previously scholars had translated the Bible from Greek, Hebrew, or Latin into their own language. With Eliot the translation was into a language he was just learning for the purpose of evangelization. In 1709 a special edition of the Algonquian Bible was authored by Experience Mayhew with the Indian words in one column and the English words in the opposite column. It had only Psalms and the Gospel of John. It was used for training the local Massachusett Indians to read the scriptures. This Algonquian Bible was a derivative of Eliot's Indian Bible. The 1709 Algonquian Bible text book is also referred to as The Massachuset psalter. This 1709 edition is based on the King James Bible just like Eliot's Indian Bible (aka: Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up Biblum God). A second edition printing of Eliot's Indian Bible was an instrumental source for the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project where it was compared to the King James Bible in order to relearn Wôpanâak (Wampanoag) vocabulary and grammar.

He led a colourful and turbulent life, narrated in detail in the Chronicle of the Morea. Accounted the finest knight in the Principality, he fought in the wars against the Byzantine Greeks, was captured in the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259, and was sent back to Achaea bearing the Byzantine terms in 1261. Geoffrey was twice deprived of his barony, once for rebelling against his uncle, the Prince of Achaea William II of Villehardouin, and then for abandoning the Principality without leave in order to spend time with a mistress, the wife of one of his feudatories, in Italy. He was pardoned both times, but henceforth held his title as a gift of the Prince. He died childless in 1275, and the Barony of Karytaina was split up. Origin Geoffrey was the son of Hugh of Briel and Alice of Villehardouin, a daughter of the second Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin. The family, which hailed from Briel-sur-Barse in the French province of Champagne, is variously named in the sources, e.g. Brieres or Prieres (Μπριέρες or Πριέρης in Greek), Bruières, Briers, Briel or Brielle. Geoffrey's father inherited the Barony of Karytaina sometime around 1222 from his brother, Renaud of Briel. The Barony was the third largest (after Akova and Patras) in the Principality of Achaea, counting 22 knights' fiefs and being responsible for keeping watch over the rebellious inhabitants of the mountainous Skorta area. Baron of Karytaina and revolt against William of Villehardouin View of Karytaina and its castle in the 19th century Geoffrey was born in Greece, possibly in Karytaina, soon after his father's arrival there (about 1222/3). Hugh of Briel died in early 1238, not yet forty years old, and was succeeded by the young Geoffrey. The main source on Geoffrey's life are the various versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, which, in the words of the French medievalist Antoine Bon, \\"narrates with so much detail and indulgence\\" the \\"many and colourful adventures\\" of \\"a peculiar and charming figure, very representative of the generation of Frankish seigneurs born in Greece\\". The Chronicle credits Geoffrey with the construction of the Castle of Karytaina, the \\"Greek Toledo\\" as William Miller calls it. Geoffrey enjoyed a high reputation as a warrior, and was deemed to be the \\"best knight in the Morea\\". According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle he maintained a school of chivalry at the castle Karytaina, where the sons of the Greek nobles were trained as knights in the Western manner. Geoffrey married Isabella de la Roche, daughter of the Great Lord of Athens and Thebes, Guy I de la Roche. In 1256–1258, he became involved in the War of the Euboeote Succession, at first as a lieutenant of his uncle, Prince William II of Villehardouin, leading an army that laid waste to Euboea and recovered the town of Negroponte for the Prince. Later, however, he sided with his father-in-law Guy de la Roche and the other Frankish lords who opposed William's hegemonic ambitions. William however prevailed in the Battle of Karydi in 1258, and a parliament was assembled at Nikli to judge the defeated lords. Geoffrey was pardoned by the Prince and his confiscated lands returned, but this time as a personal grant, rather than a fief held in right of conquest. Pelagonia, Byzantine captivity and sojourn in Italy In 1259, Geoffrey participated in the princely army that joined the Achaean–Epirote–Sicilian alliance opposing the Greek Empire of Nicaea. The allied forces, riven by distrust between the Latins and the Epirote Greeks, were dealt a crushing defeat in the Battle of Pelagonia. Prince William and most of his barons, including Geoffrey, were captured in the aftermath of the battle. Map of the Morea (Peloponnese) in the late Middle Ages The Frankish lords remained in captivity until 1261, when, following the recovery of Constantinople by the Nicaean Greeks, the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos offered to release them in exchange for an oath of fealty to him, and the cession of a number of fortresses in the southeastern Morea. After William agreed, Geoffrey was released in order to convey the emperor's proposals to the nobles of the Principality. A parliament was once again held in Nikli, in the presence of Geoffrey, Guy de la Roche, and the Principality's chancellor, Leonard of Veroli. The captive lords were represented by their wives, whereby this assembly became known as the \\"Parliament of Ladies\\". The parliament agreed to the terms, Geoffrey handed over the castles to the Greeks, and returned to Constantinople along with a number of hostages, whereupon Prince William and his barons were released. The surrender of the fortresses began a long period of conflict between the Greeks of the reconstituted Byzantine Empire and the forces of the Principality for control of the Morea. Prince William was absolved by the Pope of his oaths to Palaiologos, and warfare began almost as soon as he returned to the Principality. Despite this precarious situation, Geoffrey absented himself from the Morea, without William's permission, and spent the years 1263–1265 in Italy, ostensibly on a pilgrimage, but in reality living with the wife of one of his feudatories, John of Katavas. His absence allowed the inhabitants of Skorta to rise up and aid the Byzantine troops in their offensive, which was halted by the same John of Katavas in the Battle of Prinitsa. Geoffrey was again deprived of his barony for this act, but was pardoned and restored to it on his return. Final years and death Geoffrey is mentioned again in the campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed during to Palaiologos' attempts to placate the Pope in the ongoing Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed them to keep watch over the defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320. Geoffrey died childless; the barony, held by grant, was inheritable only by Geoffrey's direct descendants, and consequently was split upon his death: one half remained with his widow, Isabella de la Roche, who married Hugh, Count of Brienne, before her death in 1279, and the other reverted to the Prince's domain. Two pretenders to Geoffrey's inheritance appeared over the next few years: a certain John Pestel, who achieved nothing, and Geoffrey's nephew, Geoffrey the Younger, who after much persistence managed to obtain the fief of Moraina. Fictional portrayals Geoffrey is the eponymous subject of Alfred Duggan's 1962 novel, Lord Geoffrey's Fancy. A sympathetic but flawed hero, observed by his distant cousin, an admiring but increasingly disillusioned narrator, the baron of Karytaina is portrayed as a supreme exemplar of both the qualities and the limitations of Frankish chivalry.

Life He was the third son of Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton by his wife Lady Margaret Montgomerie, daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Earl of Eglinton. In July 1606 he was involved in an incident at Perth, during Parliament. In the evening he went with his older brother, the Master of Winton, to the lodging of the Earl of Eglinton with nine or ten companions. On the way they met the Earl of Glencairn who had thirty followers coming the other way. The Master of Winton and the Earl passed each other, but the servants at the rear of the two companies started to fight, only because of a long-standing feud between the Eglinton and Glancairn families. The town and royal guard stopped the fighting. There were few injuries, except to John Mathie, a servant of Glencairn.Melros Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 17-18. In 1612, after spending some time in Paris, and visiting the exiled minister John Welsh of Ayr, he succeeded his childless cousin Hugh Montgomerie, 5th Earl of Eglinton, as Earl of Eglinton. The 5th Earl had made a settled the earldom and entail on Seton provided he took the name and arms of Montgomerie. This was confirmed by King James VI in 1615.

Reflectance capture  The reflectance field over a human face was first captured in 1999 by Paul Debevec et al and presented in SIGGRAPH 2000. The method they used to find the light that travels under the skin was based on the existing scientific knowledge that light reflecting off the air-to-oil retains its polarization while light that travels under the skin loses its polarization. BRDF + Subsurface scattering Bidirectional scattering distribution function: BRDF + BTDF ESPER LightCage - 3D Face Scanning Rig '' Using this information, a light stage was built by Debevec et al., consisting of # Moveable digital camera # Moveable simple light source (full rotation with adjustable radius and height) # Two polarizers set into various angles in front of the light and the camera # A computer with relatively simple programs doing relatively simple tasks. The setup enabled the team to find the subsurface scattering component of the bidirectional scattering distribution function over the human face which was required for fully virtual cinematography with ultra-photorealistic digital look-alikes, similar to effects seen in the films The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions and others since the early 2000s. Following great scientific success Debevec et al. constructed more elaborate versions of the light stage at the University of Southern California's (USC)'s Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). Ghosh et al. built the seventh version of the USC light stage X. In 2014 President Barack Obama had his image and reflectance captured with the USC mobile light stage.

The club competes in the Western Australian Grade Cricket (Premier cricket) competition.  History  The club was officially formed on May 23, 1862. at a meeting held at the Freemason's Hotel, on the corner of St Georges Tce and William St. Mr James B. Roe (son of John Septimus Roe) was the first Chairman and Captain of the Club. The club is a founding member in the formation of Western Australian Cricket Association in 1885. There is some evidence of games being played prior to 1862. Newspaper articles speak of members of the Perth Cricket club meeting in 1839, each Saturday at The Flats, near where the Supreme Court Gardens are to this day. On Easter Eve 1839 the Perth Cricket Club defeated Guildford in a ‘stirring struggle’ by 40 runs. Games were held in 1846 between the Tradesmen of Perth v Perth Club. In 1871 the Weld Club was established in Perth by ‘members of the establishment of Perth’. Many of the members of the Weld Club were also members of the Metropolitan’s Cricket Club and matches would be held between the ‘Weld Club’ versus the ‘World’. Sir Walter James was a prominent figure of the time being Premier of WA, President of the Weld Club in the early 1930s and he also served as President of the East Perth (Perth) cricket club for two seasons from 1908 to 1910. In March 1878, a meeting was held to approve the merger of the Perth and Metropolitans Clubs. Strong consideration was given to using the name Perth Cricket Club, but the name Metropolitans was decided to be the name of the club going forward. Mr J.C.H. James moved a motion (that was subsequently withdrawn) that whatever name is used, the club should be generally referred to as the “Perth Club”. Mr J.H. Thomas was elected chairman and Mr James the club captain. The WA Cricket Association was formed in November 1885. The Metropolitans club was mainly instrumental in its formation. George Parker, captain of Metropolitans, was chairman of the first W.A.C.A. committee. P.L. (Percy) Hussey of Metropolitans would serve as Secretary of the committee. Metropolitans win the inaugural first grade premiership, under the leadership of club President George Randell. Notable office bearers in the early days include Sir Stephen Parker Chief Justice WA and his brother George (of Parker and Parker law firm), who both serve as President of the Club. Sir John Forrest and Septimus Burt both occupied a time as the club vice president. Another prominent politician, Sir Walter Kingsmill, was president for four seasons. With the introduction of electorate cricket in 1899, the Metropolitans/Perth club became the East Perth Cricket Club in the new seven team competition. At the turn of the 20th century, the leading batsman in WA cricket was undoubtedly Ernie Parker. Several of his records remain to this day, including his 246 at the WACA against East Fremantle in 1903. He still holds the club 2nd and 3rd wicket partnership records.http://waca.wa.cricket.com.au/content.aspx?file=1240432s East Perth won numerous Premierships in its early years. It won the first grade premiership on nine occasions from 1899 to 1925, which was the final year of a hat-trick of flags. Its final premiership under the East Perth name was in the 1948–49 season under Captain Keith Carmody. In 1955, the club changed name from East Perth back to the original Perth name, whilst still playing home matches at the WACA Ground. In 1958, with Sheffield Shield cricket now restricting playing access to the WACA, the club moved to Lathlain Park. In 1968 the club relocated to its current ground, Fletcher Park in Carlisle. Perth played its first A grade game at Fletcher Park on 12 October versus North Perth. In 2018, the club marks 50 years of Western Australian Grade Cricket played at Fletcher Park. Australian Test match representatives, whilst playing at Perth, are Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh and Adam Gilchrist = Team of the century = In November 2012, the club recognised its 150th year since formation. At a function held at the club a Team of the Century comprising the best players of the past one hundred years was announced. The team is Paul Terry, Ron Sarre, Bert Rigg (capt.), Basil Rigg, Adam Gilchrist, Luke Ronchi, Leo Bott, Allan Evans, Dennis Lillee, Bob Paulsen, Harry Price and Harry Gorringe.

Origins The Democratic Communist Circle was formed as the re-branded version of a previous communist group called the Marx and Lenin Communist Circle (French: Cercle Communiste Marx et LénineLes Vies de Boris Souvarine, 2008.). The Marx and Lenin Communist Circle (MLCC) was founded in 1926 to 'keep alive marxist, revolutionary critical thought'.Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 32-33, July 1933, pp. 529-560, (p. 529). On 1 December 1930, the MLCC opted to change its name to the Cercle Communiste Démocratique in order to 'better differentiate itself from the many other communist groups active in French Marxist–Leninist revolutionary circles'.Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 32-33, July 1933, pp. 529-560, (p. 529). The DCC's full origins, principles and organisational structure were published at length in the Bulletin Communiste No. 32-33 of July 1933. Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 32-33, July 1933, pp. 529-560, (p. 537). Political stance Through its official journal, the Bulletin Communiste (until 1933), and then via the independently published la Critique Sociale, the DCCs influential members defended a marxist critical analysis of politics and culture. Their most distinctive trait was a sharp criticism of Bolshevik state capitalism embodied in the Soviet Union from the mid 1920s onwards.Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 31, February 1931, pp. 497-528, (p. 514); Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 32-33, July 1933, pp. 529-560, (p. 529) In an attempt to demonstrate the inadequacy of Bolshevik state capitalism, the DCC published lengthy accounts of its writers' travels within the Soviet Union via the Bulletin Communiste. These accounts of daily-life in Soviet villages, towns and cities painted a desolate and miserable picture of life in the Soviet Union during the 1920s. An account published in the Bulletin Communiste of 1930 on the 'Soviet situation at the end of 1929' read: > It is a true terror. A terror that takes two forms. The first are the > tribunals who condemn whole blocks of people to death. You would be charged > with a supposed assassination attempt against some person of authority, or > for some attempt to burn a kolkhoz and so two, three, four 'kulaks' were > shot. In Kimry, a little town of koustari-cobblers, the administration wants > to shut a church, and so a crowd offers passive opposition by regrouping en > masse in front of the doors while shouting their disagreement - without the > least bit of violence, but nevertheless, five are singled out by Soviet > authorities and sentenced to death. In Abkhazia, for a reason everyone > ignores, nine have been condemned to death. In Siberia, some 15 to 20 will > be shot on Monday for offering some passive resistance to the kolkhoz, etc, > etc. The second terror were the officers of the GPU, who, we could almost > say, shot peasants indiscriminately. Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 31, > February 1931, pp. 497-528, (p. 514-515) Notable members Amongst its members the DCC counted Boris Souvarine, the writers Raymond Queneau, George Bataille, the economist Lucien Laurat and two future leaders of the French Resistance Jean-Jacques Soudeille and Pierre Kaan, www.collectif-smolny.org, La Critique Sociale in SMOLNY: Collectif d'édition des introuvables du mouvement ouvrier, retrieved 17 August 2013. the philosopher Simone Weil was invited to join, but chose not to join due to conflicts with Bataille.Simone Petrement, Simone Weil: A Life, trans. Raymond Rosenthal (New York, NY; Schocken Books, 1976) Extracts from the Bulletin Communiste * 'An idea is marking out its path within revolutionary circles- that of a new party. Our conception seemed abstract to the empiricists always ready to predict an event...after it happened. The years have passed. The irremediable decline of communiste parties, already clear for us due to their bolshevisation, seems less and less doubtful to the most optimistic of the clear-headed thinkers. And since there is no way to rejuvenate the thoughts or actions of the degenerate socialist parties, the question thus must be imposed, that of a new party.'Le Bulletin Communiste, No. 32-33, July 1933, pp. 529-560, (p. 529). * 'The Circle declares itself communist without differientiating between the principles of socialism and communism.' * 'The Soviet state is now nothing but the extension and instrument of the Bolshevik Party, who have themselves become a spoliatic bureaucratic caste.' * 'With Marx and Engels, the Circle affirms itself as democratic, by which we means we stress a contrast with the faux communists who renege on their democratic principles and the faux socialistes who degrade it from the inseparable notion of the revolutionary idea.' * 'The emancipation of workers will be the result of the workers themselves, and not professional revolutionaries, parliamentarians or trade unionists.' * 'The relationships evolved rapidly in the Internationale where the Moscow Political Bureau exercised an authority that was becoming more and more imperative, if not becoming an absolute dictatorship [...]. At the end of this process, all former traces of democratic process had disappeared from the international communist movement.'

History Sachin Dev Duggal and Saurabh Pradeep Dhoot founded nivio in 2004. The two founders had met as students at Imperial College London in 2000. Initial funding came from two executives at Deutsche Bank, where Duggal worked at the time; he claimed the idea came in 20 minutes before a presentation. Headquarters were in Switzerland, with a development center in Gurgaon. Nvivo announced a test of its first online Windows XP-based desktop service in 2007. Early reviews were mixed, noting that high data-rate continuous connections were needed for good response times, and existing products from companies such as Citrix Systems. Advanced Micro Devices announced an investment of undisclosed value in August 2007. Several patents related to the technology are assigned to SMX iNet Global Services SA, of which nivio was a subsidiary. December 2008, nivio was named a technology pioneer by the World Economic Forum for its affordable computing access. Nivio announced the nivio Companion in June 2009, with Bharti Airtel Limited of India as Internet service provider. Companion was a low-cost product including keyboard, mouse and a set-top-box style terminal. With a monthly service charge the user gets Internet access, Microsoft Office 2007 functionality and 10 GBytes of storage. One motivation given was rampant software piracy in India. The Indian media had reported on the company and its young founders since 2007. Alt URL 3 November 2009 Duggal speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009 In January 2010, Duggal promoted cloud computing at the World Economic Forum at Davos. In February 2010, nivio announced operations in Australia, hosted by NEC at the Polaris Data Centre in Springfield, Queensland. By July 2010, the company estimated about US$5 million in revenues, but had not been profitable. The earlier nivio Companion product was called only a \\"test\\". By November 2010, Duggal and Dhoot claimed their goal had been education. In 2012, nivio was reported as about to announce devices called Cloudbook and CloudPC to provide access to its services. Although the US Patent and Trademark Office shows a Cloudbook trademark with an application date of December 2009 to nHoldings doing business as \\"nivio\\", a product from Everex had been marketed as a CloudBook around 2008. The registration for nHoldings SA gives a location in Mont-sur-Lausanne, formerly using the name SMX iNet Global Services SA. The Microsoft Remote Desktop Services technology allowed nivio to be officially licensed through a service provider license agreement to use the Remote Desktop Protocol. This contrasts with other services such as OnLive Desktop and truCloud, which have licensing terms that have raised questions in the press. The approach was also contrasted with the official support of Microsoft Office for the iPad. Videocon and AEC Partners invested US$21 million in the company in February 2012. Co-founder Dhoot was a nephew of Videocon's chairman Venugopal Dhoot. Offices were opened in Palo Alto, California, in Silicon Valley, as well as New Delhi. In April 2012, nivio announced an application to use Microsoft Office files stored in Google Drive. The product received mixed reviews, since all products were still in \\"by-invitation beta\\" testing stages, and judged not easy to use. Kate Russell of the BBC reported on the company's products in August 2012. Near the end of 2012, Duggal stepped down from operational roles at nivio, and Frank Houghton became the chief operating officer, as the company announced it would provide services to businesses. Stuart Collingwood was president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As of 2014, the company appears to be gone; the Web site is shut down and its Twitter feed is dormant since 2013.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 10 Aug. 2014 The first disciples called by Jesus are all portrayed as reaching out immediately to family or friends: thus, Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote — Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph”. Nathaniel is described as initially being skeptical about whether the Messiah could come from Nazareth, saying: \\"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\\", but nonetheless, he accepts Philip's invitation to find out. Jesus immediately characterizes him as \\"an Israelite in whom is no deceit\\". Some scholars hold that Jesus' quote \\"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you\\", is based on a Jewish figure of speech, referring to studying the Torah. Nathanael recognizes Jesus as \\"the Son of God\\" and \\"the King of Israel\\".

He is credited with being a painter, etcher,Falk (1999),3102 writer, teacher, designer, and lithographer. He is best known for his etchings, America's Cup paintings and maritime watercolors.Fought (2007),95  Early life  Soderberg was born in Chicago, Illinois to Swedish immigrants Berlin and Gust Soderberg. He was one of three children born. By age of twelve, Soderberg had already shown interest in drawing. He studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Students League of New York. With a scholarship from the Art Institute of Chicago, he headed west for a summer of vagabonding in Yellowstone and British Columbia. In British Columbia, he sailed with fisherman, sailing small boats, building his own boats, and sailing in the big wind ships. His year at the Art Student's League in New York brought him the Kendall prize. In Chicago, Soderberg made money for his school and living expenses through architectural drawings and other forms of commercial art. He illustrated for articles in the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald-Tribune. When formal schooling was over, He travelled to Paris, Corsica, Normandy, and Brittany, and ultimately to Sweden with his sister.  Connecticut  Upon returning from Europe, he headed to Mason's Island, off Mystic, Connecticut to spend the summer painting. It was a major turning point as it was here that he was to find the field art and sense of place which made him unique, for that time, among etchers. He ultimately built a cabin there with steam heat and a north-lighted studio. Previously, no one had made etchings of small sailboats. But Mason's Island proved to be a perfect subjects for his etchings. His front yard was full of boats. At first he focused on etchings, but later concentrated on watercolors. By 1930, Soderberg was painting America's Cup Defenders. His watercolors were regularly used for magazines including The Sportsman, Yachting, Town and Country, and The Spur. His watercolors were featured on the cover of The Sportsman Magazine four times including July 1933, May 1934, August 1934, and February 1935.Danielson (1934) He painted every America's Cup Race from 1930 and in 1937 sailed on the Endeavor II. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics.  Depression and WWII  In 1934 he married Nancy Horn, a summer resident of Mason's Island from Paterson, New Jersey, and an accomplished sailor. During the Depression years he became a Works Progress Administration artist. His WPA mural, \\"Canal Era\\" painted in 1939, is located in the Morrisville, Pennsylvania Post Office. He worked for the Electric Boat Company during WWII where he painted morale posters for shipyard workers. Some posters were as large as eighteen feet high and depicted the cycle of events in building a submarine. While staying in Hyannisport, Massachusetts with a friend, he made a watercolor of a Wyanno Class boat with the number 94 on her and the name Victura on the stern. She was being sailed by John F. Kennedy. The future President bought the painting. \\"The picture is extremely good, \\"John F. Kennedy wrote. By all accounts he survived the Depression by adapting, but clearly it was the sailboats and water that inspired him most. One critic of the time-period wrote, \\"His work grows in depth and strength every year. Nowhere can be found a line that is not expressing the artist's theme clearly and concisely.\\"  Later years  Life Boat, watercolor on paper, 50.8 cm x 91.44 cm, Collection of the Mattatuck Museum, Waterbury, CT. At the end of World War II, Soderberg was invited to board the Danish cadet ship Danmark, which was interned in the Thames River at New London, Connecticut. He joined the Danmark (ship) as a guest artist and as a result painted one of his most critically acclaimed watercolors, Life Boat. At the annual Connecticut Water Color Society show in Hartford, Connecticut, Life Boat was called \\"the most dramatic picture in the show.\\" At the First Annual Print Exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, Life Boat won the Henry B. Shoppe prize.The painting is now held by the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury Connecticut.http://www.mattatuckcollections.org/Obj2617$248 In the following two years, Soderberg was also a guest artist aboard the US Coast Guard Training Ship Eagle. He made two summer cruises with landings in Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Nassau. In 1950, he began a 17-year career teaching at the New London High School, but his summers were free for vagabonding again. In 1952, he traveled to Price Edward Island, Cape Breton and the coast of Maine, which became subjects for many of his watercolors. In 1954, the American Swedish Historical Foundation held an exhibition of his work. In 1958, Soderberg first authored his book Drawing Boats and Ships, 1958,Soderberg (1959) which is still in publication today. In 1962, a large three-panel mural of the training bark Eagle was dedicated at the United States Coast Guard Academy. The Coast Guard acquired other works by Soderberg. He continued to remain active painting and illustrating throughout his career and in 1966 illustrated Stormalong Goes a Whaling. Soderberg died in 1972 at the age of 75 in Mystic, Connecticut.

The designs by Picasso were executed in concrete by Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar, and were Picasso's first attempt at monumental concrete murals. The buildings onto which the murals were executed are known as the 'H-block' or Highrise (1959) and 'Y-block' (1968); they were designed by the Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø. The largest mural, The Fishermen (1970) is on the façade of Y-block. Picasso would later create works in a similar vein in Barcelona and Stockholm. 2011 Norway attacks The Regjeringskvartalet complex was badly damaged by a car bomb that exploded on 22 July 2011. The Highrise block and the Y-block had no structural damages after the bombing. Despite this a long discourse has happened , as the governemnet wanted to demolish both buildings by Architect Erling Viksjø. The H-block was saved, but the Y-block is under threat. . The Regjeringskvartalet government complex is Norways most iconic modernist buildings. . The Y-block from 1969 forms together with the H-block from 1958 the modernist contribution to the government quarter of Oslo. Just before the attack in 2011, both buildings were about to be granted protection by the Directorate of Cultural Heritage. Experts, inside and outside of Norway, agree on its immeasurable value and try to convince the government to stop the demolition plans. Europa Nostra included the y-block in its list of Europes most endagered buildings in 2020. The Y-block is one of Viksjø’s most beautiful buildings that is constructed in Naturbetong, a special concrete casting technique he developed together with engineer Sverre Jystad that was patented in 1955/-57. The possibilities that lay in this new material with sandblasted surfaces were decisive for Picasso’s contribution and lead to a 17-year long collaboration with the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. The development of Naturbetong with its integration of art is a unique contribution to Norwegian and international modernism. Only one more building worldwide, the House of Architects in Barcelona, have this kind of integral art by Picasso and Nesjar in public space. The murals were subsequently listed as one of Europe's most endangered heritage sites in 2015 by the heritage organisation Europa Nostra following the Norwegian cabinet's vote to demolish the Y-block building.

Life  Anne Spang studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt and Biochemistry at the University of Paris VI, France. She received her PhD in 1996 at the Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried. She was then a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, USA. From 1999 to 2006 she was an Independent Research Group Leader at the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society in Tübingen. Since 2005 Anne Spang has held the position of Professor of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Biozentrum University of Basel.  Work  Anne Spang investigates the basics of intracellular transport. Spang gained an international reputation through her discovery of the maturation process from early to late endosomes. In the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, she has identified the evolutionary conserved SAND-1 protein, which serves as the switch in Rab conversion during the maturation process. In addition, her research has shown that ArfGAP proteins are important for the uptake of cargo into transport vesicles and that the small GTPase Arf1 and COPI components play a role in mRNA transport and mRNA metabolism. Her research findings are significant for the understanding of many diseases which are based on the location of defects in protein and mRNA in the cell, such as cystic fibrosis and lysosomal storage disorders.

The major proponent of the Village prose movement, noted for his quirky, folklore-rooted style of writing, Krupin is best known for his 1980 Novy Mir-published satirical novel Zhivaya Voda (Aqua Vitae). Biography Vladimir Krupin was born in the village of Kilmez, Kirovskaya Oblast, to a local forester. In 1957, after graduating from school, he joined a local newspaper. In 1961, having demobilized from the Soviet Army, Krupin became a member of the CPSU. In 1967 he graduated from N.K.Krupskaya Moscovskaya Oblast Pedagogical Institute and spent several years teaching Russian language in schools. Krupin joined the Sovremennik Publishers as an editor and at one point became its partorg, but was fired after the publication of Georgy Vladimov's Three Minutes of Silence. In 1974 Vladimir Krupin published his first book, the collection of short stories Zyorna (Grains). That year also saw the publication of his short novels Varvara and The Yamshchik Tale. In 1980 the satirical short novel Aqua Vitae, dealing with the degradation of the Soviet rural community, steeped in mass alcoholism, made Krupin a well-known author. The publication of another novel, The 40th Day in Nash Sovremennik cost Yuri Seleznyov his post of deputy editor. In 1980-1982 Krupin edited the literary Moskva magazine. His 1980s works, notably Bokovoy veter (The Side Wind, 1982) and Povest o vom, kak... (The Tale of How..., 1985), examined hardships of life in the Soviet village. Krupin reacted to perestroika with highly politicized novels The Saving of the Perished (1988) and Good-Bye Russia, Meet You in Paradise (1991), the latter portraying the demise of rural Russia, being deliberately destroyed by the new leadership who turns the country into one psychiatric ward. Outraged by the destruction of the Russian Parliament in October 1993, he reacted by the series of articles (\\"The Cross and the Void\\", \\"The Bitter Grief\\", and others) published by Nash Sovremennik and Moskva. In 1994 Krupin started to lecture at the Moscow Religious Academy. In 1998 he became the editor-in-chief of the Orthodox Christian magazine Blagodatny Ogon' (Benevolent Fire).

He died on 22 June 1997.  Education  In 1929 Schallamach received his Diplom Ingenieur in electrical engineering, having studied at technical high schools in Zurich and Breslau. He completed his doctoral dissertation at the University of Breslau in 1934 but had to leave Germany as a Jewish refugee before receiving his degree. He was only able to receive his doctorate officially in 1948 from the University of Braunschweig after Breslau had become Polish.  Career  After immigrating to the United Kingdom, Schallamach obtained a position at the Davy Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution, researching crystal structure at low temperatures. He held this position from 1934 until 1943. In 1943, he joined the British Rubber Producers' Research Association as a Research Physicist. He initially studied the dielectric properties of elastomers, but soon was called on to pursue studies into the friction and abrasion properties of rubber. His developments included a viscoelastic theory of friction that explained the observed rate dependence of rubber friction in terms of molecular arguments.  Schallamach Waves  Schallamach is widely known for his observation of the occurrence of waves of detachment during abrasion experiments with rubber. He provided an explanation for these Schallamach waves in terms of the elastic instability of the elastomer surface.

It is the largest non-life insurance company in the Serbian insurance market. History Dunav osiguranje headquarters building in Belgrade The first Serbian insurance institution, Belgrade Cooperative, was founded in 1897. In the early 20th century a few foreign insurance companies were founded, but ceased their operations at the beginning of the World War II. After World War II, insurance passed into the domain of the state, due to the changes caused by the socialist revolution. The National Insurance and Reinsurance was established by merger of pre-insurance company Dunav, Elementar and Winershtedishe. The department had three basic functions: ensuring state and public property from fire and other risks, the implementation of all types of compulsory insurance, and reinsurance. Through amendments to the Constitution and political conditions, premium rates have changed and conducted audits of insurance policies, and insurance was decentralized in 1968. Following that decentralization, a total of 128 institutes and 7 insurance communities integrated into 11 insurance companies. Among them were the \\"Airport\\" and \\"Yugoslavia\\", which integrated in 1974, and thus way created the ground for the establishment of the insurance company Dunav since 1990. The Institute changed its name to \\"Joint Stock Company Insurance Danube\\" with unlimited liability, and then became Dunav osiguranje company as a central part of Danube Group, with several subsidiaries. As of 2015, Dunav osiguranje has 29 branches and over 600 marketplaces in Serbia. As of 2016, it has 32.6% of non-life premium income market share and 5.9% of life premium income market share in Serbia, making it the largest insurance company in the Serbian insurance market.

Schippers, consisting of six episodes aired by the VPRO from October to December 1984. The show (a parody of sitcoms and soap operas, like most of Schippers' shows) was a continuation of sorts of Schippers' De lachende scheerkwast (1981-1982) and featured some of the same characters. In turn, it was a kind of prequel to We zijn weer thuis, which ran from 1989 to 1994. Story and script were written by Schippers, who directed the show with his longtime associate Ellen Jens. Schippers himself portrays Jacques Plafond.Heytze and Tuinman 20. Plot Photographer Rik Rollinga (Kenneth Herdigein), on his way to take a formal portrait of the Dutch queen (the invitation turns out to be a practical joke), catches a glimpse of a beautiful young woman, Yolanda, on the Baarn train station. He snaps a quick photograph of her and falls in love. For the rest of the series he tries his best to find her again. Along the way, he falls into one comical situation after another. He hires alcoholic private investigator Rein Schaambergen to help him, but Schaambergen is too drunk to be of any help. In desperation he turns to Jacques Plafond and plans to make a hit record (arranged by Jan Vos) to make her fall in love with him, but sings so poorly that he is replaced by a better singer—his neighbor Victor van Vliet records the song, \\"Smoke, Gammon and Spinach\\", which becomes a hit, and Rik is kicked out of the studio. He flees to the Bahamas but is tracked down by Schaambergen and returned to the Netherlands, with the promise that Yolanda is found. Unfortunately, Schaambergen has failed and presents the wrong Yolanda (the ugly daughter of the baker, Ruud van Hemert). In the end it turns out that Yolanda lives upstairs from him and is Victor's girlfriend. The basic storyline is larded with skits involving many of Schippers' characters from previous shows.

It was originally opened in 1843, and then replaced with a larger building in 1882. The older building was demolished, which allowed Fremantle Town Hall to be built and for the High Street to be extended, giving the Kings Square its current shape. The church is administered by the Anglican Diocese of Perth jointly with St. Peter's in Palmyra. The 1843 church The first church opened on 4 August 1843. The present Church of St John is the second of that name in Fremantle. The first was founded after petitions were made in 1839 to the newly arrived Governor of Western Australia, John Hutt, to create an Anglican church on King's Square. It stood at the centre of the square at the end of the High Street. The expense of building the church was underwritten by Daniel Scott, who was an enterprising harbour master and supporter of the Church of England.P. J. Coles, 'Scott, Daniel (1800–1865)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/scott-daniel-2638/text3661. Retrieved 22 August 2013. The church was opened on 4 August 1843. This church stood for decades but was demolished when the new church was available. The outline of this building is still shown in the pavement and two stained glass windows in the nave of the present church are said to have been moved from this building to the new church. In 1855 a rectory was built. The 1882 church In 1876, the church applied to the Fremantle City Council for an additional strip of land by the existing church wall, to be given to the Church of England, for a new church. In this application, all of Kings Square was said to have been legally given to the Church of England, though in later years this assertion was thought to be debatable. This application was refused, as the strip was used for storing and preparing stone and some councillors believed the church already had enough land. A year later, the church made a second proposal, offering the council the south-western corner of the square, and a right of way for the extension of High Street through the square, in return for the strip of land and 500 pounds. The council accepted, subject to minor modification. This new St John's church was said to be due to the determination of a new priest who would become Archdeacon Watkins. He could see that the old church had been outgrown but some suggested that extensions could be added to the old building. He was determined that a new building was required, and this was completed in 1882 at a cost of £7,500. The cost of this was defrayed by the demolition of the old church, which allowed the street to continue through what had been Kings Square. Nearly £2,000 pounds was raised by selling the right of way through the land, for the space to build Fremantle Town Hall, and by selling off blocks of land. An aerial view showing the church in the centre, taken in 1933. It shows the grounds that were open to the public and maintained by the council after 1923. The new church was designed by William Smith in London and built by Joshua James Harwood who was an architect and Chief Inspector of works. James was also a church warden at St George's Cathedral in Perth. His company, J. J. Harwood and Son, used limestone from a quarry in Cantonment Street. The foundation stone was laid by the second Bishop of Perth, Henry Parry, in 1878. Harwood had the church ready to be consecrated in July 1882. Six years later an organ was installed. The bell turret was a later addition to the building in about 1906. Just before the First World War the church needed its first repairs because the she-oak shingle roof had exceeded its natural life span. A decision was made to replace it with a better material, Welsh slate. These slates were replaced by shingles made from asbestos in 1975. A major benefit to the church and the public was negotiated in 1923 when in return for making the grounds publicly available the council agreed to maintain them. The church was placed on the State Heritage Register in 1997.St John's Anglican Church, Fremantle , State Heritage Register. Retrieved 18 August 2013 =Features= The east end has a stained glass window of three panes. They were manufactured by Franz Mayer & Co. in Munich. The windows are entitled \\"The Appearance in the Upper Room\\", \\"Stilling the Tempest\\", and \\"Christ and the Magdalen\\". The first was installed in memory of the head of Fremantle Prison, Henry Maxwell Lefroy, and the other two were for Thomas Brown and Daniel Scott. The seven lancet stained glass windows on the west wall each show one of the works of mercy. The windows were imported from London and were created by A. L. Moore. The organ is the first one that was built in Western Australia. It was made by Robert Cecil Clifton in 1884 and it was the first of five that he built in Western Australia. The organ was installed in 1884 at a cost of £600. Today The church is still in regular use.

The Church of Holy Trinity and St George is in New Road, Kendal, Cumbria, England. It is an active Roman Catholic parish church in the diocese of Lancaster. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church was founded by the parish priest, Thomas Wilkinson, and designed by local architect George Webster. Architectural historians regard the church as the best of the three designed by Webster in the town. History In the 18th century the Roman Catholics of Kendal met in a house in Stramongate, which was replaced by a chapel on the same site in 1793. This church was a replacement for that chapel. The chapel and the church were founded by the priest of the parish, Thomas Wilkinson. The church was designed by the local architect George Webster, and cost £4,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The foundation stone was laid in October 1835, and the church was consecrated on September 15, 1837. The church is sited near the River Kent and was flooded on a number of occasions. In 1908 the level of the floor was raised above the flood level. Electricity was installed in 1927. The original pipe organ was made by John Davis of Liverpool, but was damaged by floods in 1927 and replaced by a harmonium. This was in turn replaced in 1935 by a two- manual organ of unknown date made by the Orchestrelle Company. The organ was moved from Whitbarrow Lodge, Levens, and renovated by Henry Ainscough of Preston. It was renovated again between 1961 and 1966, probably by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool. In 2000 this organ was replaced by an electronic organ, and in the same year an electronic bell system was installed. During the following year, extra seating was placed in the gallery where the organ had been sited. In 2002 the entrance to the church was improved by creating a new vestibule and narthex. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in limestone with a slate roof, and is in Early English style. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave without aisles, a west porch and narthex, and a chancel. At the west end, the central portion projects forward and is gabled. This portion is flanked by octagonal buttresses, and there are stepped buttresses at the corners of the west front; all the buttresses are surmounted by pinnacles. Steps lead up to a pointed doorway with a hood mould. Above this are three stepped lancet windows, and there is a single lancet window on each side bay. In the gable is a statue of Saint George and the Dragon, which was carved by Thomas Duckett, an employee of Webster. On the apex of the gable is a cross finial. Along the sides of the nave are six lancet windows. At the east end are three stepped lancets, and single lancets on the sides of the chancel. =Interior= Inside the church is a west gallery carried on a four- bay arcade with slender columns. On the sides of the chancel are two large niches, each with a crocketed gable containing a statue by Thomas Duckett. The statue on the left depicts Ecce Homo, and that on the right Saint George. The chancel rail is in cast iron and contains panels with pierced trefoil heads. The octagonal pulpit is wooden and panelled, and the stone font is also octagonal. On each side of the doorway is an octagonal marble holy water stoup, made by Sylvester Mooney and dated 1837. In the porch are four squares of 17th-century Flemish glass. The stained glass in the east wall is by Hardman & Co. The central window contains the kneeling figure of Wilkinson offering the church to Christ. The flanking windows represent Saint Cuthbert and Saint George. The glass in the side windows of the chancel are by H. Barnett, and depict Saint Joseph and Saint Anne. In the south wall of the nave is more stained glass by Hardman, and also glass by Mayer of Munich. =Appraisal= The church was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 30 January 1985. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades of listing, and is granted to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The architectural historians Matthew Hyde and Nikolaus Pevsner regard it as \\"much the best\\" of the three churches designed by Webster in Kendal, and remark on its \\"wide and brightly lit interior\\".

The cookbook was first published in 1939, and a further edition was published in 1952. An English translation (by Boris Ushumirskiy) appeared in 2012. Origins Following the Russian Revolution, the official ideology promoted communal food preparation and dining, to maximise use of labour and resources and to liberate women to work. However, combined with widespread food shortages, this resulted in poor food quality and limited choice. Anastas Mikoyan, who was People's Commissar of the Food Industry of the USSR in the 1930s, became convinced that the USSR needed to modernise the way it produced and consumed food. He travelled widely, bringing many innovations back to the USSR, including the manufacture of canned goods and the mass production of ice cream. In the late 1930s, he spearheaded a project to produce a home cookbook which would encourage a return to the domestic kitchen. Prior to its introduction, the staple cookbook of Russian cuisine had been Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, which had been published in numerous editions in late 19th- and early 20th- century Russia and remained in many households after the Revolution. However, as it had been aimed at middle- and upper-class households, it was frowned upon as being bourgeois. Moreover, many of its recipes relied on ingredients that were unavailable and techniques that were impractical in Soviet Russia. The new cookbook was thus aimed to become a reference work for the new Soviet cuisine. Content As with most publications at this time in the USSR, the cookbook had both a practical and propagandistic purpose. On the practical side, it contained recipes using modern techniques and foods and provided advice on diet, hygiene and etiquette. As propaganda, it began with a chapter on the successes of the domestic food industry and its recipes combined ingredients from across the many republics of the USSR. Moreover, as many of these ingredients were usually unavailable, the cookbook also served as an image of what the USSR aspired to be, a land of abundance and variation. Recipes range from the sumptuous (sturgeon in jelly, cold piglet with horseradish) to the everyday (cabbage stuffed with meat, bean soup). They were accompanied with lavish full-page illustrations of prepared dishes and food production. In popular culture British chef Mary Berry modified one of the book's recipes, which combined herring with egg, on her BBC 2 cookery program Easter Feasts (first aired April 13 2017).

He campaigned in Ireland and the Low Countries, and was involved in the defence of England against the Spanish Armada. He was imprisoned several times, on one occasion to prevent a duel with Sir Walter Raleigh, and on another occasion because of his secret marriage to Dorothy Devereux, a Lady-in-waiting to the Queen, and sister of the Queen's favourite, the Earl of Essex. Perrot's only daughter, Penelope, married Sir Robert Naunton, author of Fragmenta Regalia, which claimed that Perrot's father, Sir John Perrot, was an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Family Thomas Perrot was the son of Sir John Perrot by his first wife, Anne Cheyne (d.1553), the daughter of Sir Thomas Cheyne, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and his first wife, Frideswide Frowyk (died c.1528), daughter of Sir Thomas Frowyk, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.Perrot, Sir Thomas (1553–94), of Haroldston and Narberth, Pembrokeshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 19 August 2013. By his father's second marriage to Jane Prust (d.1593), widow of Lewis Pollard (d.1563) of Oakford, Devon, and daughter of Hugh Prust (d.1559) of Thorry, Devonshire, Perrot had a half-brother and two half-sisters: *William Perrot (d.1587), who died unmarried. *Anne Perrott, who married Sir John Phillips, 1st Baronet, of Picton Castle.Philipps, John (d.1629), of Picton, Pembrokeshire and Clog y fran, Carmarthenshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 18 August 2013. *Lettice, who married firstly Walter Vaughan of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire, secondly John Langhorne of St Brides, and thirdly, on 8 April 1605, Arthur Chichester, Lord Deputy of Ireland. Perrot also had at least four illegitimate siblings, Sir James Perrot, John Perrot (born c.1565), Elizabeth Perrot, and another sister whose name is unknown. Career Illustration in Johann Jakob Wick's report of the Battle of Zutphen Perrot saw his first service as a soldier when he accompanied his father to Ireland in 1579. He was knighted when the English forces landed at Waterford. On his return home he was imprisoned in the Fleet to prevent a duel with Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1581 he took part in a tournament in the tiltyard at Whitehall Palace before the Queen and French ambassadors; Perrot and 16 other defenders led by the Earl of Oxford withstood a challenge to the Castle of Beauty by the Earl of Arundel and Sir William Drury. Shortly thereafter Perrot was again imprisoned in the Fleet for his secret marriage to Dorothy Devereux, one of the Queen’s ladies in waiting. Perrot then campaigned in the Low Countries, where he fought at the Battle of Zutphen on 22 September 1586. In the following year Perrot's father, who had been appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, sought to have Perrot appointed as Master of the Ordnance; however the post went to Sir George Carew, who had the backing of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. In April 1588 Perrot, George Owen, his fellow Deputy Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire, and other members of the local gentry were occupied with measures to defend Milford Haven against a landing by the Spanish Armada, and in October of that year Perrot reviewed levies from Wales preparing to defend against a possible landing by the remnants of the Armada in Ireland. At about this time Perrot was also involved in a Chancery suit aimed at overturning the will of Sir Thomas Cheyne, Perrot's maternal grandfather, whose son, Henry Cheyne, had died in 1587 without male issue. The suit was not resolved in Perrot's lifetime, and was reopened by his daughter, Penelope, in 1619. In 1590 Perrot was removed from the Deputy Lieutenancy of Pembrokeshire, allegedly at the behest of Sir Christopher Hatton, who is said to have been his 'unremitting foe'. In 1591 he was again was in prison, although no charges were brought against him. In 1592 his father, Sir John Perrot, was convicted of treason and attainted, and died in the Tower of London, not without suspicion that he had been poisoned. Despite the attainder, Perrot claimed his father's estate, and by an Act of Parliament in March 1593, which was 'rushed through both Houses in four days', Perrot was restored in blood through the efforts of his brother-in-law, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, inheriting Haroldston Mansion and Laugharne Castle together with of the rest of his father's estates with the exception of Carew Castle, which was taken by the Crown. Perrot was a member of two committees in the 1581 session of the prorogued 1572 Parliament, although the identity of his constituency at the time is uncertain. He sat in the 1586 Parliament as Knight of the Shire for Cardiganshire. In February 1593 he was elected for Pembrokeshire. Perrot fell ill in early 1594, and made his will on 12 FebruaryPCC Will Sir Thomas Perrot 1594. As he had no male heir, his property was divided between his wife, Dorothy, and his daughter, Penelope. Portrait of Dorothy Devereux (left) and her sister, Penelope Devereux (right) Marriage and issue Perrot married Dorothy Devereux (d.1619), daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, by whom he is said to have had a son who predeceased him without issue, and a daughter, Penelope. Perrot's daughter, Penelope, married firstly the astronomer Sir William Lower, by whom she had three sons and a daughter.Lower, Sir William (c.1570–1615), of St. Winnow, Cornwall and Trefenti (Tra'Venti), Llanfihangel Abercowin, Carmarthenshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 19 August 2013.Trefenty, Dyfed Archaeological Trust Retrieved 19 August 2013. After Lower's death Penelope (née Perrot) married secondly Sir Robert Naunton, by whom she had a daughter Penelope (born 1620), who married firstly Paul Bayning, 2nd Viscount Bayning, and secondly Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke. Sir Robert Naunton's Fragmenta Regalia is the source of the claim that Thomas Perrot's father, Sir John Perrot, was an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. After Perrot's death in 1594 , his widow, Dorothy, married Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland.

It is a protein with a key role in regulating muscle differentiation or myogenesis, specifically the development of skeletal muscle. Myf5 belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). These basic helix loop helix transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation. MRF family members include Myf5, MyoD (Myf3), myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6). This transcription factor is the earliest of all MRFs to be expressed in the embryo, where it is only markedly expressed for a few days (specifically around 8 days post-somite formation and lasting until day 14 post-somite in mice). It functions during that time to commit myogenic precursor cells to become skeletal muscle. In fact, its expression in proliferating myoblasts has led to its classification as a determination factor. Furthermore, Myf5 is a master regulator of muscle development, possessing the ability to induce a muscle phenotype upon its forced expression in fibroblastic cells.  Expression  Myf5 is expressed in the dermomyotome of the early somites, pushing the myogenic precursors to undergo determination and differentiate into myoblasts. Specifically, it is first seen in the dorsomedial portion of the dermomyotome, which develops into the epaxial myotome. Although it is expressed in both the epaxial (to become muscles of the back) and hypaxial (body wall and limb muscles) portions of the myotome, it is regulated differently in these tissue lines, providing part of their alternative differentiation. Most notably, while Myf5 is activated by Sonic hedgehog in the epaxial lineage, it is instead directly activated by the transcription factor Pax3 in hypaxial cells. The limb myogenic precursors (derived from the hypaxial myotome) do not begin expressing Myf5 or any MRFs, in fact, until after migration to the limb buds. Myf5 is also expressed in non-somitic paraxial mesoderm that forms muscles of the head, at least in zebrafish. While the product of this gene is capable of directing cells towards the skeletal muscle lineage, it is not absolutely required for this process. Numerous studies have shown redundancy with two other MRFs, MyoD and MRF4. The absence of all three of these factors results in a phenotype with no skeletal muscle. These studies were performed after it was shown that Myf5 knockouts had no clear abnormality in their skeletal muscle. The high redundancy of this system shows how crucial the development of skeletal muscle is to the viability of the fetus. Some evidence shows that Myf5 and MyoD are responsible for the development of separate muscle lineages, and are not expressed concurrently in the same cell. Specifically, while Myf5 plays a large role in the initiation of epaxial development, MyoD directs the initiation of hypaxial development, and these separate lineages can compensate for the absence of one or the other. This has led some to claim that they are not indeed redundant, though this depends on the definition of the word. Still, the existence of these separate “MyoD-dependent” and “Myf5-dependent” subpopulations has been disputed, with some claiming that these MRFs are indeed coexpressed in muscle progenitor cells. This debate is ongoing. Although Myf5 is mainly associated with myogenesis, it is expressed in other tissues, as well. Firstly, it is expressed in brown adipose precursors. However, its expression is limited to brown and not white adipose precursors, providing part of the developmental separation between these two lineages. Furthermore, Myf5 is expressed in portions of the neural tube (that go on to form neurons) a few days after it is seen in the somites. This expression is eventually repressed to prevent extraneous muscle formation. Although the specific roles and dependency of Myf5 in adipogenesis and neurogenesis have remained to be explored, these findings show that Myf5 may play roles outside of myogenesis. Myf5 also has an indirect role controlling proximal rib development. Although Myf5 knockouts have normal skeletal muscle, they die due to abnormalities in their proximal ribs that make it difficult to breathe. Despite only being present for a few days during embryonic development, Myf5 is still expressed in certain adult cells. As one of the key cell markers of satellite cells (the stem cell pool for skeletal muscles), it plays an important role in the regeneration of adult muscle. Specifically, it allows a brief pulse of proliferation of these satellite cells in response to injury. Differentiation begins (regulated by other genes) after this initial proliferation. In fact, if Myf5 is not downregulated, differentiation does not occur. In zebrafish, Myf5 is the first MRF expressed in embryonic myogenesis and is required for adult viability, even though larval muscle forms normally. As no muscle is formed in Myf5;Myod double mutant zebrafish, Myf5 cooperates with Myod to promote myogenesis.  Regulation  The regulation of Myf5 is dictated by a large number of enhancer elements that allow a complex system of regulation. Although most events throughout myogenesis that involve Myf5 are controlled through the interaction of multiple enhancers, there is one important early enhancer that initiates expression. Termed the early epaxial enhancer, its activation provides the \\"go\\" signal for expression of Myf5 in the epaxial dermomyotome, where it is first seen. Sonic hedgehog from the neural tube acts at this enhancer to activate it. Following that, the chromosome contains different enhancers for regulation of Myf5 expression in the hypaxial region, cranial region, limbs, etc. This early expression of Myf5 in the epaxial dermamyotome is involved with the very formation of myotome, but nothing beyond that. After its initial expression, other enhancer elements dictate where and how long it is expressed. It remains clear that each population of myogenic progenitor cells (for different locations in the embryo) is regulated by a different set of enhancers. Clinical significance As for its clinical significance, the aberration of this transcription factor provides part of the mechanism for how hypoxia (lack of oxygen) can influence muscle development. Hypoxia has the ability to impede muscle differentiation in part by inhibiting the expression of Myf5 (as well as other MRFs). This prevents the muscle precursors from becoming post-mitotic muscle fibers. Although hypoxia is a teratogen, this inhibition of expression is reversible, therefore it remains unclear if there is a connection between hypoxia and birth defects in the fetus.

Retrieved on 20 June 2014. Plot The story is about three friends whose heedless lifestyle take a twist after meeting a mysterious man who teaches them the real meaning of life. The first earthquake – The preamble of an undying friendship Koobrin, Tharun and Ram, a trio who met in college, enjoy their days carefree and aimless. They skip classes, fail in exams and survive their hectic engineering curriculum together. Tharun, coming from an economically weak background, carries the hope of his entire family where he has to either make success as an engineer or join his father’s profession as a painter. He is bothered by something from an old relationship, which is unknown to his friends. Koobrin, from a middle-class family, fell for the promise of a motorcycle from his father if he agreed to join engineering, when he had no passion for it. Ram, hailing from a wealthy backdrop, has no passion for engineering either. The start of their friendship is marked by an earthquake and carried forward by their perpetual insouciant lifestyle. They are expelled from hostel and stay with their easy-going professor, Chandran sir and his pet dog, Koothara. Ram fall in love with Shilpa, who works in a shop nearby, while Koobrin goes through numerous college flings. Sheistha, the last of Koobrin’s conquest cheat him, which he finds out during the orchestration of their college fest. In front of the entire crowd, the trio confront her while he breaks-up with her, culminating in them getting expelled from college without a degree. The reality of life strikes them now and it strike them hard. Tharun has no option, but to become a painter. Ram, being continuously demeaned at home, tries various jobs, failing in each. Koobrin is sent to seminary to make it as a priest. Their hopes hit rock-bottom to an extent that Tharun cannot even forgive a preschooler for a silly prank. The occasion of their professor Chandran sir’s wedding proves no different, reminding them how much of a failure they have become compared to their classmates. The second earthquake – Yellowtooth: Hope for a better future Chandran sir's pep talk push the three to think of a better employment. They start an IT firm, named Yellowtooth, to try to excel in a field they are better equipped in. Stealing money from their homes, they make an exorbitant investment, even when they had zero managerial experience. Another earthquake marks the company's launch. Their innate profligacy and unfocused energies show them no success and it's only a matter of time before the company fell deep into debts. The only upside to their unsuccessful venture, appears to be their befriending of the neighbour – Swathi, a single mother. It was Swathi's child, whose prank provoked Tharun earlier, which seems to be the reason for her initial friction with the group. The third earthquake – AK47: Usthad and his nefarious plans One by one, each employee quit the sinking ship. Losing hope in the company, the three are faced with the tough choice to make. They decide to shut down Yellowtooth. While drinking in a local bar they encounter a mysterious group of fishermen led by a strange man, on a silly matter. He challenge to meet the trio outside, where they are surprised with a friendly drinks offer. They drink through the night and he learns all about the trio. Also, he claims to be a cursed merman, which the trio does not take seriously. He take them out on his next fishing trip out in the ocean and suggest that the fishing business is profitable and there is a fishing boat available for sale, if they are interested. He assures huge profits, which can pay back the debts of purchase, if they can manage the money. With Swathi’s help, they mortgage Shilpa’s property to purchase the boat from Usthad Sali, an old ailing fisherman, without even seeing the boat. The next day, they are shocked with the rusty old boat that they got for themselves. Aale-kolli (man-killer), or AK47, as it is popularly known, is believed to be haunted and so far caused 47 deaths, at least one in each of its voyages. The mysterious man is none other than Usthad Sali, the owner of the boat. He tricked them into buying his boat and the boat is not even worth one-tenth what they paid. With a huge mortgage to pay and no other way out, they are forced to try their luck with AK47. The trio along with Koothara, their pet dog, restore the boat and set out on their maiden voyage marked by another earthquake. Not only do they not catch any fish, they are also met with the fury of the sea, in a thunderstorm that night. Luck lets them escape with their life and an upright boat. Stranded in the sea, their calls to shore for help is answered only by Usthad, who says it is his revenge for the unfinished business from their first meeting. Famished, they are now faced with either slow starvation to death or suicide using the poison that Usthad had left for them on board. Also, Tharun confess to his friends of his past affair with Swathi. No more earthquakes – The trio triumphs They decide not to give up – the way they had always done so. They try and fix the boat and continue to fish. They manage to capture quite a few and return ashore. Usthad had left the shore, with their money left back for them. Knowing nothing of the trade, they had returned from the sea, alive and unharmed. They decide to achieve the best in what they know. They restart Yellowtooth and gradually climb to success. Ram marry Shilpa and Tharun marry Swathi. Koobrin starts a relationship with an old classmate, Roshni. A prank, placing a microphone in Tharun's room on his wedding night, reveals to his friends that he is the father of Swathi's child. The end credits show the story being narrated by Koothara, the pet dog, to his son and Usthad is shown swimming in some distant seas with two other mermaids, having finally freed himself from the curse.

This gene is also known in the biomedical literature as MRF4 and herculin. MYF6 is a myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) involved in the process known as myogenesis.  Function  MYF6/Mrf4 is a member of the myogenic factor (MRF) family of transcription factors that regulate skeletal muscle myogenesis and muscle regeneration. Myogenic factors are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. MYF6 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of myogenesis. The precise role(s) of Myf6/Mrf4 in myogenesis are unclear, although in mice it is able to initiate myogenesis in the absence of Myf5 and MyoD, two other MRFs. The portion of the protein integral to myogenesis regulation requires the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that is conserved among all of the genes in the MRF family. MYF6 is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle, and it is expressed at a higher levels in adult skeletal muscle than all of the other MRF family genes. In mouse, Myf6/Mrf4 differs somewhat from the other MRF genes due to its two-phase expression. Initially, Myf6 is transiently expressed along with Myf-5 in the somites during the early stages of myogenesis. However, it is more noticeably expressed postnatally. This suggests that it serves an important role in the maintenance and repair of adult skeletal muscle.Moretti, I. et al. MRF4 negatively regulates adult skeletal muscle growth by repressing MEF2 activity. Nat. Commun. 7:12397 doi: 10.1038/ncomms12397 (2016). The MYF6 gene is physically linked to the MYF5 gene on chromosome 12, and similar linkage is observed in all vertebrates. Mutations in the mouse Myf6 gene typically exhibit reduced levels of Myf5. Despite reductions in muscle mass of the back and defective rib formation, Myf6 mutants still exhibit fairly normal skeletal muscle. This demonstrates that Myf6 is not essential for the formation of most myofibers, at least in the strains of mice tested. In zebrafish, Myf6/Mrf4 is expressed in all terminally differentiated muscle examined, but expression has not been reported in muscle precursor cells.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the MYF6 gene are associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM) and Becker's muscular dystrophy.

Enrolment includes students who live beyond Dudley's borders, mostly in Sandwell. The college also has enrolled a number of non-Catholic pupils. History The College first opened as Bishop Milner Catholic School in 1960 to serve the township of Dudley, and was one of the first Catholic secondary schools in the Midlands. In 1963 an extension was added to the main college building as well as with a new dining hall. In 1981 a \\"Secretary's\\" block was also opened. A new classroom block for the teaching of Drama, Music, Dance, ICT, General classrooms and sixth form studies was opened in October 1994. Most of the school buildings were replaced between 2002 and 2005 at a cost of more than £6million. In the Autumn term of 2011 the reception area was extended and additional office space created above the reception on the first floor. In 2012 the sixth form area was updated to include a café area named \\"The Hub\\" along with the formation of enhanced study facilities. As a consequence and to create the Sixth Form study area, Drama/Performing Arts is now taught in the main building In the autumn term of 2013 the college obtained planning permission for a Sports Hall and is now in the process of securing the funding to commence the build. Bishop Milner converted voluntarily to academy status in September 2013 and took the name of Bishop Milner Catholic College. The Academy was formed in partnership with St Chad's Catholic Primary School, Sedgley and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Dudley. Together, the three schools are a Multi Academy Company (MAC) and have taken the name of St John Bosco Catholic Academy. Bishop Milner Catholic College is named after John Milner, a Roman Catholic bishop and writer who served as the Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District from 1803 to 1826. Bishop Milner Catholic College performs well in the local GCSE tables and is regularly among the highest performing schools Dudley borough. It has an extensive extra curricular provision, which includes the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme up to Gold level, Sports teams, dance encompassing both \\"street\\" and \\"contemporary\\", science club and a multi media club. Bishop Milner is one of the few secondary schools in the Dudley borough to have a sixth form, as most of the other sixth forms closed at the turn of the 1990s following the introduction of tertiary education across the area. The college offers an extensive range of sixth form courses at Level 3 which include A Levels and BTEC Nationals. Bishop Milner has an excellent record of its sixth form students attaining places at university including the prestigious Russell Group. The college prides itself with the links it has with local universities such as Birmingham, Newman and Wolverhampton along with those that are further afield e.g. Oxford. The college also secured places on the Prime Minister's Global Fellowship programme. The college achieved its first student in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008, and in 2009 had 2 more successful applicants.British Council website \\"Fellows\\" . Retrieved 19 August 2013.

The Janon from Terrenoire (now part of Saint-Étienne) to Saint-Chamond, and then the Gier from Saint-Chamond to Givors, create a valley in the coal basin between the Pilat massif to the south and the Riverie chain of the Monts du Lyonnais to the north. The right (south) side of the valley is mountainous, mainly covered with trees or pasture, with relatively few people. The right bank streams flow from the Pilat massif. They are the Janon, upstream Gier, Onzion, Dorlay, Egarande, Couzon, Grand Malval, Mezerin and Combe de l'Enfer. The largest are the upstream Gier with a basin of about , the Dorlay with a basin of , the Couzon with a basin of and the Janon with a basin of . The left (north) side of the valley is hilly, sandy terrain. The left bank streams flow from the Monts du Lyonnais. They are the Langonand, which flows into the Janon, Mornante, Ruisseau des Arcs, Faverge, Durèze, Collenon, Féloin and Bozançon. The largest are the Durèze with a basin of about and the Bozançon with a basin of about . The Bozançon defines the border on the Jarez side between the Loire and Rhone departments. The Gier basin has a total area of about . There are dams on the upper Gier, the Dorlay and the Couzon. Hydrology Le Gier at its confluence with the Rhône at Givors The throughput of the Gier was observed over a period of 45 years (1964–2008) at Givors, a city of the Rhône department located at the confluence of the Rhône. The watershed of the river is . The average rainfall in the Gier watershed is annually, much lower than the overall average for France. The average flow of the river is per second. Gier has seasonal fluctuations typical of rivers of the French Massif Central that are partly fed by melting snow. High waters are in winter and spring, and the average monthly flow is per second from November to May, with a maximum in November followed by a second peak in May. Flow is lower in summer, from July to September, with a decrease of the average monthly rate to the level of in August. Flow can drop as low as in a dry year. Significant floods are quite common. J. B. Chambeyron, the historian of Rive- de-Gier, talks of a flood in 1684 where the waters from Saint-Chamond to Givors rose to the first floor above ground level. The maximum instantaneous flow recorded was per second on 2 December 2003, while the maximum daily value was the same day. During the night of 1–2 November 2008 the center of Rive-de- Gier was devastated by flooding, as were many surrounding towns such as Saint- Romain-en-Gier and Givors. The water reached a depth of in some streets, and many shops were flooded. History Rive-de-Gier around 1900, with the Gier running through the town In Roman times the river was used to supply water to Lugdunum (old Lyon) through the aqueduct of the Gier. The opening of the Givors canal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors in 1781 contributed to the early industrialization of the valley. The Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway was opened in 1833, the first French railway open to travelers. It follows the path of the Janon from Terrenoire to Saint-Chamond, and then the Gier to the Rhone. In the 19th and 20th centuries the Gier brought water and energy to many factories in the Gier valley. In the 19th century these ranged from factories making silk and lace products to steel mills. The Barrage du Piney, a dam, was built on the Gier at near La Valla-en-Gier between 1953 and 1955, with a capacity of . It is no longer in service and is kept permanently empty. The Barrage de Soulages, another dam, was built on the Gier at between 1968 and 1970, with a capacity of . Urbanization The main axis of the Gier valley today holds an almost continuous urban and industrial area from Terrenoire in Saint-Étienne to Givors on the Rhone. The main towns from west to east, with their 2010 populations, are Saint-Chamond (35,793), La Grand-Croix (5,070), Lorette (4,498), Rive-de-Gier (14,996) and Givors (19,118). The 12 towns along the river valley totaled 88,974 inhabitants in 2008. The Gier is partly covered over in Saint-Chamond.

He was the younger son of Nakai Shuan (1758 d.), one of the Kaitokudo's two founding leaders, and was influenced by his teacher and mentor Goi Ranju. His intellectualised way of being led to continued engagement with but physical separation from the Kaitokudo. Much is made of his demeanor reflecting his. Often stated as analogous to his floating calligraphic style Riken was vastly different in demeanour to his brother Nakai Chikuzan, although their underlying epistemologies, beliefs and degree of tenacious individualism were similar. They both furthered the work of Goi Ranju and consolidating previous thought around the Kaitokudo school, bringing a level of prestige to the academy. Like his brother Chikuzan, Riken wholeheartedly denounced Ogyū Sorai and contended that all people have potential, to the extent that \\"even\\" commoners could become scholars, while he also denounced religion and superstition. However, Riken’s particular strain of the dismissal of dreams, and the unverifiable led him to dabble in astronomy, most notably with Asada Goryu.Najita, Tetsuo (1987) Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan. The Kaitokudo, Merchant Academy of Osaka. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 186-218 Riken’s scholarship was far broader and is often perceived to transcend the specific question of reconciling the virtue of merchants with contemporary perceptions of merchants. Legacy Nakai Riken wrote extensive commentaries on the three of the four books Analects, Doctrine of the mean and Mencius. He rejected other works as unreliable dreams, largely due to their unverifiability. In these works, he dismissed the book of changes, the book on Songs and the book of history as unreliable, and further the book of rites and the spring and autumn annals as unreliable or of authorship different from the received interpretation. However, his lasting legacy was in reaching a point of contradiction between the demand for verifiability in the Kaitokudo school and the reliance on the reading of text as history.Najita (1987) The influence of Nakai Riken, as well as Nakai Chikuzan and other contemporary moral philosophers outside the mainstream of Neo-confucianism, shingaku and Buddhism can be seen most immediately and concisely in the work of Yamagata Banto. It is said that Chikuzan has ongoing and great influence on his thought, but that Riken was more heavily involved in the final push toward publication of Yamagata’s work yume no shiro .

It was directed by Barry Olivier. The Festival was one of the preeminent folk festivals on the West Coast, predating the more famous Newport Folk Festival on the East Coast and presenting performers, artists, and scholars such as Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Doc Watson, Alan Lomax, Howlin' Wolf, Phil Ochs, Alice Stuart, Jean Ritchie, Jean Redpath, Jesse Fuller, Big Mama Thornton, Mance Lipscomb, Mississippi John Hurt, Archie Green, Alan Dundes, Bess Lomax Hawes, Ewan MacColl, John Fahey, Robbie Basho, the Jefferson Airplane, the Youngbloods, Big Brother and the Holding Company, reb Shlomo Carlebach, and many others. The festival's willingness to embrace electric rock music and other forms of what would become known as roots music or Americana makes it markedly different from Newport, with its famous struggle over Bob Dylan going electric. It exemplified the diverse and adventurous musical and cultural milieu of the West Coast—and the Bay Area in particular—and suggests a major revision in our understanding of the folk revival, of the relationship of culture to political events in Berkeley such as the Free Speech Movement, to commerce and civil society, and to ongoing issues and questions about cultural heritage, technology, diversity, and commonality.

Reed (October 13, 1863 – April 20, 1919) was an American capitalist, mediator, lecturer, and author. He became one of Colorado's most important and enterprising pioneers and played an important role in Colorado's early history and became one of the state's wealthiest citizens. Early life Verner Zevola Reed was born in Richland County, Ohio on October 13, 1863. He grew up on an Iowa farm and helped his father support the family of thirteen children. He developed a literary talent and attended two terms at the Eastern Iowa Normal School. Career =Business= After a brief period working as a journalist for the Chicago Tribune, he moved with his half-brother who sought tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He began writing promotional brochures for tourists. He then owned and operated a real estate office. Realizing the need for housing for the growing city, he built and sold small houses. He brought the rest of his family to Colorado, and his father and brother, Hugh and Raymond, joined him in the real estate business in 1890. The firm was named Reed Brothers. Five years later, Reed consolidated his private holdings into Reed Building and expanded his business across the state. He sold his share of Reed Brothers. In 1893, he promoted Cripple Creek, Colorado in the wake of its gold rush. He was involved primarily in various silver and copper mining operations in Colorado through the turn-of-the- century. In 1901, he earned a $1 million commission from the sale of Winfield Scott Stratton's Independence Mine to an English syndicate, and having made his fortune in minerals, he subsequently invested in real estate in and around Colorado Springs, Colorado and through ventures such as the Western Sugar Land Company. In the early years of the twentieth century, he and his wife, Mary, sailed for Europe, where they lived for more than a decade in Paris, Rome and the South of France. After his return to America in 1913, he continued to expand his fortune with the accumulation of oil fields in Wyoming. Over his career, he was also involved in banking, manufacturing, ranching, land reclamation, and irrigation enterprises in Colorado, Wyoming, and other states. =Cultural and political studies= In addition to his business interests, he also made extensive studies of the Mythologies of Native Americans, especially among the Utes and some of the Puebloan peoples. He was widely known as a lecturer on peace, international politics and kindred subjects. He was author of several books: Lo-To-Kah, Tales Of The Sunland, Adobeland Stories and The Soul Of Paris, and had also contributed essays, editorials and stories to magazines and newspapers. =Mediation= In 1917, he was one of the original of the Special Mediation Commission appointed by President Woodrow Wilson soon after the United States went to war (World War I) to undertake adjustment of industrial labor trouble. He is credited with having played a large part in quieting unrest which threatened war preparations. The commission late in 1917, made a trip of many weeks through the West investigating deportations and dissatisfaction in the Arizona copper district, labor troubles on the Pacific Coast, in Colorado, and in Minnesota and Saint Paul, Minnesota, and differences between the Chicago packers and their employees. Subsequently, he took a prominent part in the investigation and settlement of trouble in the Louisiana oil fields. Personal life Reed lived with his family until 1893, when he married Mary (Johnson) Reed. They had three children. The Stoiber-Reed-Humphreys Mansion house in the present Humboldt Street Historic District was owned by the Reeds from about 1912 to 1920. With He died in Coronado, California on April 20, 1919. He left his wife an estate valued at approximately $20 million () which she used in the pursuit of various philanthropic endeavors in the Colorado community, such as Margery Reed Hall and construction of a new library on the campus of the University of Denver. The Denver Post once cited her as \\"Colorado's richest widow\\". Although she gave a lot of money to philanthropic endeavors, she was able to add $6 million to the estate before she died in 1945.

This is known from the Corakyerler locality, central Anatolia. It is known only from three cranial fossils. Dated faunal remains associated with the O. turkae fossils have been attributed to the late Miocene 8.7 – 7.4 million years ago, making O. turkae one of the youngest Eurasian great apes ever known. Etymology Ouranopithecus due to its similarities with its probable sister taxon O. macedoniensis. Turkae after the discovery of the holotype fossils in the Republic of Turkey. Habitat Associated faunal remains suggest O. turkae lived in either open woodland or an open savannah type environment. Morphology The morphology of O. turkae is difficult to determine due to the complete lack of post-cranial remains. The post-canine dentary is second only to that of Gigantopithecus in size, perhaps suggesting a large body size. It is unknown whether the species was sexually dimorphic as there are no known female fossils. The ape was probably a quadruped but there is no evidence to confirm this. Diet Tooth morphology and wear suggest a diet of tough, abrasive food, the kind typically found in the type of environment O. turkae probably lived in. Behaviour Again, the lack of post-cranial remains makes it difficult to determine how O. turkae behaved. The fossils were not associated with any females of the species so it could be suggested that the males, at least, were solitary. It may also be assumed that O. turkae climbed trees, possibly to feed or to avoid predation, although their suggested large body size may have made climbing difficult. Some believe O. turkae was probably a terrestrial forager and did not feed in the trees.

Murrow Center Senior Fellow at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and writes opinion pieces for The Huffington Post, Inc. Magazine, and other outlets. Early life and education Shihabi was born in Amman, Jordan in 1970. He is both an American and Jordanian citizen. He earned his BSc in Management from the University of Jordan in 1993. He then went on to earn his MBA from the University of Jordan in 1996 before earning his MSc in Leadership and Strategy from Georgetown University in 2006. Career Ehab Al Shihabi started his career as a management consultant at Andersen Consulting in 1997. He later worked for KPGM and Deloitte. Shihabi was hired by Al Jazeera Media Network in 2009 to be the Deputy Managing Director at Al Jazeera English. In 2011 he was named the Executive Director of international operations Al Jazeera Media Network. He was one of the principal people involved in the process of buying Current TV for $500 million and setting up Al Jazeera America (reaching 60 million homes), as well as Al Jazeera Türk and Al Jazeera Balkans. Shihabi stated in regards to the launch of Al Jazeera America: \\"It's going to be run by American talent and staff for the American audience\\", adding there would be \\"less opinion, less yelling and fewer celebrity sightings\\". He defined the channel as providing \\"accurate, in-depth, unbiased news stories\\". Bob Meyers, president of the National Press Foundation, titled that Jazeera's launch as \\"transformative\\". Shihabi had been largely involved in the business aspects of Al Jazeera America such as the budget for the channel and helping in securing carriage agreements with television carriers and making the channel available on different platforms such as carrier TV Everywhere platforms, in other words continuing its branding and awareness campaigns, while expanding its cable distribution and online presence. Since January 2013, 900 people were hired for the new venture, a great part from other networks such as CNN and ABC, including John Seigenthaler and Kate O'Brian. During his tenure, Al Jazeera America's ratings grew for three continuous quarters, and topped at three million unique viewers in the first two weeks of July 2014. The medium also became available to 60 million households under Al Shihabi, which is below the 100 million mark other cable broadcasters count with. The broadcaster amassed a number of journalism awards as well, including two Peabody Awards. This, however, was not enough according to some, describing its 30 thousand daily viewers as too low, or even \\"minuscule\\", and stating its online presence as deficient, even though some praised its content's quality. Having been termed \\"the most ambitious American TV news launch since Fox News\\" during its launch, in April 2016 Al Jazeera America ceased operations in the US. Among the reasons for the network's demise, certain factors are often cited: the network was not carried on many cable providers; management problems; the drop in oil prices and subsequent \\"economic challenges\\"; aversion to the Al Jazeera name; and its poor use of the online market. Shihabi served as CEO since July 2013 until May 2015. Since leaving, Shihabi writes opinion pieces for The Huffington Post and other outlets, and keeps his position as advisor to the Director General at Al Jazeera Media Network. He also is an Edward R. Murrow Center Senior Fellow at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. =Controversy= In May 2015, Mostefa Souag announced Shihabi was to be replaced by Al Anstey, following revelations of a lawsuit against the network by a former employee. The broadcaster also faced a $15 million discrimination lawsuit. After shutting down in April 2016, former executive vice president of finance filed a racial discrimination suit against the network, alleging \\"Al Anstey had reneged on a promise\\" made by Ehab Al Shihabi for a promotion and salary raise.

She is an expert in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a genetic condition affecting the adrenal gland that can affect sexual development. Medical education New received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1950, and her M. D. from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, in 1954. She completed an internship in medicine at Bellevue Hospital in New York, followed by a residency in pediatrics at the New York Hospital. From 1957 to 1958 she studied renal functioning under a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She was a research pediatrician to the Diabetic Study Group of the Comprehensive Care Teaching Program at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center from 1958 to 1961, and had a second NIH fellowship under Ralph E. Peterson from 1961 to 1964, to study specific steroid hormone production during infancy, childhood and adolescence. Career In 1964, New was appointed Chief of Pediatric Endocrinology at Cornell University Medical College, a position she held for 40 years. In 1978, she was named Harold and Percy Uris Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism. In 1980, New was appointed Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Cornell University Medical College and Pediatrician-in-Chief of the Department of Pediatrics at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She was one of the few women in the country to serve as Chair of a major division of a medical college, and her tenure lasted for 22 years. While Chairman, New founded and directed the 8-bed Children's Clinical Research Center, a clinical research center in pediatrics with groundbreaking research in pediatric endocrinology, hematology, and immunology, during the emergence of AIDS. In 2004, New was recruited to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Professor of Pediatrics and Human Genetics and Director of the Adrenal Steroid Disorders Program.Slate \\"If Your Baby Girl Might Be Born With a Small Penis\\" August 15, 2015 http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/08/intersex_babies_should_you_treat_their_condition_with_prenatal_drugs_.html She is also currently Adjunct Professor of Genetics at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Associate Dean for Research at the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine at Florida International University. New is recognized as one of the world's leading pediatric endocrinologists. Her career links clinical and basic science. She has continued her scientific research, including the use of molecular genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis and treatment. Although steroid physiology was well understood when New began her scientific career, little of the knowledge had been applied to the understanding of steroid disorders in children. New's research on the mechanism and genetics of steroid disorders has established standards for pre- and post-natal care for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and apparent mineralocorticoid excess. During a 43-year period, New held the longest continuously funded National Institutes of Health grant, \\"Androgen Metabolism in Childhood\\", which supported research characterizing the diverse clinical spectra of patients with rare steroidogenic enzyme defects, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and their metabolic consequences.https://www.collectiveip.com/grants/NIH:2888685 accessed April 28, 2015 Her current primary research emphasis is on genetic steroid disorders. New continues to study three monogenic disorders: 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, and apparent mineralocorticoid excess, emphasizing genotype/phenotype correlation and prenatal diagnosis and treatment. She has published more than 640 academic articles in a wide range of prestigious journals and published a genetics book entitled Genetic Steroid Disorders in 2014. She has also received numerous awards recognizing her work treating mothers and children affected with the disorder. Principal discoveries In 1977, New first described apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) in a Zuni girl. Her team was the first to publish mutations on the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme (encoded by the HSD11B2 gene) causing this potentially fatal form of low renin hypertension. New opened a new field of receptor biology by demonstrating the action of the 11β-HSD2 enzyme at the mineralocorticoid receptor of the distal renal tubule to metabolize cortisol to cortisone and thus protect the receptor. This was the first demonstration of the metabolism of a ligand to down-regulate its action on receptor activation. In 1979, New described a form of mild steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency called nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is characterized by diverse hyperandrogenic symptoms appearing postnatally in males and females. The remarkable prevalence of 1 in 27 Ashkenazi Jews of a mild form of CAH was documented by New in 1985 and the genetic frequency of the mutation is 1 in 3 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. These studies established nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency as the most frequent disorder of all autosomal recessive diseases in humans. While a spectrum of severity of congenital adrenal hyperplasia had always been observed, New was first to identify the mild form with specific molecular mutations. Awards and honors New has received numerous honors, including: * IPSEN Award (2014) for her \\"outstanding work\\" in pediatric endocrinology and her \\"fundamental advances\\" * Ceppellini Prize, the Highest Award in Italy for Genetics (2010) * Judson J.

She also serves as a consultant for the New York State Newborn Screening Program and for the Food and Drug Administration's Endocrine and Metabolic Drug Advisory Committee, was the President of the Endocrine Society in 1992, was Editor-In- Chief of The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism for over six years. In 2006, she was awarded the Allan Munck Prize by Dartmouth Medical School. New was elected to the Hall of Honor of the NIH, received a Merit Award, and served as editor for over 15 leading medicals journals and textbooks. New has received two grants from the Genesis Foundation of New York to study Jewish genetic disorders. As an Italo-American, New was elected to the Italian Endocrine Society. In 1996, New was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, one of only two pediatricians to be members of the Academy. Criticisms Ethical issues have been raised about New's research. Namely, it has been questioned whether pregnant women undergoing treatment for the possible effects of congenital adrenal hyperplasia on their unborn babies were properly informed concerning the treatments that were administrated to them. In September 2010 the FDA found nothing worth pursuing. In a 2012 article Alice Dreger followed up on the issues involved. Further research and long term studies are needed to establish the correct usage guideline.

There are about 28 long cairns in north Scotland and 21 in south Scotland that show no evidence of internal stone chambers. However, proving the existence of wooden chambers under a cairn is not possible without excavation work. The exact classification of this group of monuments is therefore not easy. Three particularly noteworthy examples of these cairns are: *Dalladies in Kincardineshire, with cup and ring marks *Slewcairn in Kirkcudbrightshire. *Lochhill in Kirkcudbrightshire. All have narrow rectangular chambers whose positions are marked by wooden posts. The last two are especially interesting, because stone chambers were built into the mound at a later date. These make the connexions and overlaps of ideas clearly visible, something which can otherwise only be imagined from their classification by type. Although none of the northern cairns has been excavated, their existence is significant for the architectural history of Scotland. The north is a region where passage tombs in circular cairns are especially common (the Orkney-Cromarty type). Sites that span several periods of time, such as Tulach an t'Sionnaich, demonstrate that both forms were used by the same communities. Several round cairns, like those of Camster had long cairns built over them, so that the round mound here retains its older shape. Many chamberless cairns and those with stone chambers have concave forecourts which are reminiscent of those that had been built earlier of wood (Haddenham and Street House) in Yorkshire.

Description The short-horned chameleon has a compressed body, spindly limbs, grasping feet and a prehensile tail allowing it to negotiate the branches and twigs of its arboreal habitat. The most distinctive features of the short-horned chameleon are its large, ear-like occipital lobes, and the short bony rostral appendage that projects from the snout of the male. When threatened, it raises its ear-like flaps to increase its apparent size and attacks with an open mouth. The short-horned chameleon is generally grayish in color, although there is variation between the sexes and across the species' range, with the slightly larger males having a lighter colored head, and some specimens being greener and having blue legs. Distribution The short-horned chameleon is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, and is calculated to have a population density of 2.4 chameleons ha−1 in the forests around Andasibe-Mantadia National Park and Analamazaotra Special Reserve. C. brevicornis is endemic to Madagascar and has a broad latitudinal distribution in eastern Madagascar, between the Anosy Mountains in the south and the Tsaratanana Massif in the north, and has also been confirmed from the Analavory Plateau in the northwest, within a narrow elevation band between 810 and 1,000 m. Most records of this species need to be reevaluated, and therefore its geographic range information is incomplete, however, the few verified records of this species are scattered over an area of at least 38,000 km2. Habitat and ecology This species lives within mid-altitude humid forest, where it is more commonly found in open vegetation associated with edges and disturbed areas. It is tolerant of some degree of habitat modification and has been found in agricultural land where trees are present, in roadside vegetation and in trees near buildings.

Most details of his life are uncertain. Almost all kings of Hungary after 1046 descended from him. According to the Hungarian historian, György Györffy, Michael received a ducatus or duchy from his brother, Grand Prince Géza. Slovak historians specify that he administered the \\"Duchy of Nitra\\" between around 971 and 997. However, neither of these theories have universally been accepted by historians. Life Michael's father, Taksony depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Anonymus, the unknown author of the late 12th-century Gesta Hungarorum narrates that Michael's father, Taksony took his wife \\"from the land of the Cumans\\".Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 57), p. 127. However, the lands which were dominated by the Cumans at Anonymus's time had been controlled by the Pechenegs up until the 1050s. Accordingly, Györffy proposes that Taksony's wife was the daughter of a Pecheneg tribal leader. Other historians, including Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, say that Anonymous's report may refer either to her Khazar or to her Volga Bulgarian origin. Michael was Taksony's younger son. Györffy writes that he was still a minor when he was baptized around 972. He received baptism together with his elder brother, Géza, who succeeded their father as Grand Prince around that time. Michael was named after the Archangel Michael. According to Györffy, the frequent use of the name \\"Béla\\" by his descendantsfour kings and two dukes from the House of Árpád bore this nameimplies that it was Michael's original pagan name. He also writes that the \\"a\\" ending of his name excludes that it was borrowed from a Slavic language, because \\"a\\" is a feminine ending in these languages. Instead he proposes, that the name derived from the Turkic title. Michael's brother, Géza depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle According to Györffy, Michael was a close ally of his brother, since there is no proof that their relationship was ever tense. Therefore, Györffy continues, Géza \\"probably gave one of the ducatus\\" in the Principality of Hungary to Michael, although there is no record of these events. According to Steinhübel, Michael received the \\"Duchy of Nitra\\" around 971. His colleague, Ján Lukačka, adds that it was Michael who broke \\"the resistance of the native nobles\\" in this duchy. Michael's fate is unknown; Györffy proposes that he either died before his brother (who died in 997) or renounced of his duchy in favor of Géza's son, Stephen, without resistance. On the other hand, Steinhübel writes that Michael was murdered in 995, an action \\"for which his brother Géza was probably responsible\\". Lukačka likewise says that Michael \\"was killed, apparently, on the orders of\\" Géza. Finally, Vladimír Segeš also says that Géza had Michael murdered, according to him between 976 and 978, but he writes that Michael was succeeded by his own son, Ladislas the Bald. Family The name of Michael's two sons, Vazul (Basil) and Ladislas have been preserved. According to Györffy, \\"it is probable\\" that Michael's wife was related to Samuel of Bulgaria, because the names of his both sons were popular among Orthodox rulers, including the members of the Cometopuli family. Györffy adds that Michael married his Bulgarian wife when he came of age around 980. The following family tree presents Michael's ancestry and his offspring. *Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars. **A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady. ***Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty. ****Kristó writes that she may have been a member of the Rurik dynasty from Kievan Rus' from Kievan Rus'.
