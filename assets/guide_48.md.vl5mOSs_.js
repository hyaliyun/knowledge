In 2009 he was the 438th wealthiest person in Britain with a personal fortune of ¬£120 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2009, and his activity in the past twenty years has given him a good reputation within the insurance industry. In 1985 he and Martin Long launched Direct Line, the first telephone-only insurance company in the UK. The venture was underwritten by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and within nine years was the biggest insurer of private vehicles in the country, claiming three times as many customers as the Royal Bank itself. Wood did not have a capital stake in Direct Line, having sold it to the Royal Bank in 1988 in return for considerable performance- related remuneration. This led to his becoming Britain's highest paid company director, receiving ¬£1.6 million in 1991, ¬£6 million in 1992, and ¬£18.2 million in 1993. The subsequent attention and notoriety his pay attracted‚ÄîLabour Party MP and then-shadow Trade Secretary Robin Cook called his bonus \\"obscene\\"‚Äîwas a source of embarrassment both to Wood himself and the Royal Bank, who attempted to buy their way out of their contractual obligations with a one-off ¬£24 million payment in 1994, taking his total income that year to ¬£42 million. Wood himself claims that he personally requested an end to the deal after receiving a letter bomb at the Direct Line offices which injured a member of staff. Nevertheless, Wood remained richly rewarded, receiving another ¬£17 million in 1995 and remaining a byword for the perceived excesses of corporate boardrooms in the 1990s, according to critics. He left Direct Line in 1997 non-amicably, but continued to work with the Royal Bank in other areas, including Privilege, an insurance company specialising in lower-risk customers which had been founded in 1996. In 1999 Wood founded Esure, this time in partnership with the Halifax bank, who provided ¬£150 million of startup capital. Esure used the same business model as Direct Line and targeted the same customer base, establishing a foothold in the market before following with a subsidiary (First Alternative) in 2003 for drivers of higher premium vehicles. Even their advertising and marketing were similar, to the point where Direct Line challenged Esure's \\"Mr Mouse\\" character to be an infringement of their own iconic red telephone on wheels, and they successfully took Esure to court to prevent it being trademarked. A women-only specialist insurance brand, Sheilas' Wheels, was established by Wood and Esure in October 2005. He is currently the chairman of Esure, having purchased the 70% stake Lloyds Banking Group held in the company on 11 February 2010.LLoyds sells 70% stake in Esure BBC News Online. 11 February 2010 Wood also set up two insurance companies in the United States, Response (1995) and Homesite (1997), although his involvement with both of them came to an end in 2004.

It was founded by Phajo Drugom Zhigpo (1184? - 1251?) in the 13th century and built in its present form by Tenzin Rabgye, the 4th Temporal Ruler in 1688. In 1616, the Tibetan lama Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal meditated in its cave. The self- emanated form of the wrathful Hayagriva is deified in the monastery. It belongs to the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism in Bhutan. Etymology The word 'Tango' in Bhutanese language means ‚Äúhorse head‚Äù. This name conforms to the main deity Hayagriva (local name Tandin) deified in the monastery. Legend and tribute According to local legend, the location of this monastery is the holy place where Avalokiteshvara revealed himself as \\"the self-emanated form of the Wrathful Hayagriva\\". The location had been prophesied in Tibet. The acclamation of the divine nature of this place was performed by Ngawang Tenzin. History The Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, main architect of Bhutan, who meditated for long years in the caves of the Monastery According to a local legend Phajo Drugom Zhigpo propounder of the teachings of Dodeyna who was on a visit to this place during his teaching mission heard the neighing of a horse coming from the direction of the Tango. Concurrently, he witnessed the cliff in the form of god Tandin (horse head or Hayagriva) engulfed in flames. The deity appearing before Zhigpo prophesied that the place was meant to build a monastery for meditation. The prophecy also mentioned that Zhigpo would marry the Dakini, Khando Sonam Peldon and establish the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism in Bhutan. The earliest history traced to this location is when Guru Rinpoche on a visit to the place in the 8th century had identified the place as representing the Hayagriva or horse head. It was only in 1222 that the place again got its recognition when Phajo Drugom Zhigpo, propounder of the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism, witnessed the cliff in the form of god Tandin (horse head) or Hayagriva. Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal migrated from Tibet to Bhutan in 1616 at the age of 23 not only at the request of Pal Yeshay Genpo but also due to a conflict with Deb Tsangpa of Tibet; Namgyel belonged to a respectable lineage of Tsangpa Jarey in Tibet and had been christened by the name of Drukpa Rinpochhe Ngawang Tenzin Nampar Gyelwa Jigme Drak Pai Dey and had attained name and fame from a young age as an enlightened dharma preacher. When he travelled in Bhutan on a preaching mission he was also attacked by Tibetan army (sent by his enemy Deb Tsangpa). However, by virtue of his skills in the field of tantric art he subdued his enemies, and finally went into meditation in the caves of the Tango Monastery; the monastery had been offered to him by the Tshewang Tenzing of Dorden (now Dodena). He deeply meditated and performed tantric ritual of Gempo in the cave of Tango. With these spiritual powers, Zhabdrung caused the decimation of the dynasty of Deb Tsangpa of Tibet. Consequently, he celebrated this victory by writing of his achievements by composing the ‚ÄúNga Chudugma or My sixteen Accomplishments‚Äù. Following his victory, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal adopted the title of Dujom Dorjee, consolidated his powers and issued sixteen tenets. He renamed the cave monastery as Duduel Phug and then went back to the cave for further meditation. However, the cave was attacked by his enemies using tantric powers. They had destroyed the cliff of the caves, which resulted in blocking of the cave by a huge boulder (size of a yak), which by providence narrowly missed killing the Namgyal, as it is said ‚Äúthe boulder missed Zamdrung‚Äôs head by an inch‚Äù. His followers considered Zamdrung‚Äôs survival as a miracle. During this period Namgyals‚Äô father Tenpai Nima had died and Namgyal brought his father‚Äôs body to the cave and cremated it in the cave of the horse head cliff, in Tango. Thereafter, in 1620, Namgyal built the Chari monastery and the Duduel Chorten in memory of his father; the building was constructed by skilled carpenters brought from Nepal. Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye son of Tshewang Tenzin and Damchoe Tenzima (daughter of the Lama of Chang Gangkha) born in 1638 AD, received religious instructions from a very young age in the Drukpa Kargyud tradition from Shabdrung and his teacher Damchoe Gyeltshe and was very proficient in the tradition when he ascended the throne of Desi at the age of 31. He also became the 4th Desi at the age of 43. As the 4th Temporal Ruler he creditably ruled the country in accordance with set spiritual and temporal laws. The Tango Monastery was rebuilt by him in its present form in 1688/1689. The monastery built with 12 corners has the 3-storey gallery central tower. It was further extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the late 19th century, Shabdrung Jigmre Choegyal had a golden roof installed. In 1966 AD, the 64th rJe Khenpo Jamyang Yeshey Sengyel along with Her Royal Highness the Grandmother Ashi Phuntshog Chodon also restarted the Shaydra School of Buddhist Studies. In 1977 AD, Her Majesty the Queen Mother Ashi Kesang Wangchuck refurbished the monastery into a very elegant structure vis-a-vis the original. The monastery underwent restoration again in the mid 1990s and is currently the residence of the 7th Tri Rinpoche, a young incarnation of Tenzin Rabgye. Today it is run as an upper-education level monastic school. Architecture Tango Monastery is built in the dzong fashion, and has a characteristic curved (semi-circular) outside wall and prominent main tower with recesses. It covers the caves where originally meditation and miracles were performed by saints from the 12th century onwards. Behind the series of prayer wheels are engraved slates. Inside the courtyard is a gallery, illustrating the leaders of the Drukpa Kagyupa lineage. ;Caves The caves, the original place, before the monastery structure as it exists now was built, is where the holy saints meditated from the 12th century onwards. The rock face identified as the 'Horse head' or 'Hayagriva' is integral to the rock setting of the caves. The caves are formed at two levels ‚Äì the lower and upper caves with a self formed secret central passage. The central cavern is proclaimed as the ‚Äúcavern of a dakini containing triangular red and black colours and a natural divine mansion‚Äù. The rock faces at different levels exhibit self-manifest figures of the sun, the moon and of the demon Matramrutra. Other self emanated divine forms identified within the caves consist of: the Pal-khorlo-dompa (Sri Cakrasambhara gods seen even now); a long cavernous passage in the basement that makes a distinction between the good and the evil while manoeuvring through it; the projecting rock face in the form of Hayagriva directly facing the valley denoting Abhicarya in ferocious shapes; a temple of Hayagriva at the lower level; crystal images of tutelary deities; a three-faced Hayagriva (discovered by Ngawang Tenzin); a whip containing combined prayers; a stone slab with foot print of a dakini (the youngest daughter of Ngawang Tenzin); a temple of the four handed Mahakala at the upper cave created by the Shabdrung, a hazardous cave at the bottom ‚Äì a fit place for hermits; and a large sandalwood tree, considered as walking stick that was planted by Phajo Drukgom with the prophecy that \\"This will be the centre from which the Drukpa Kargyud doctrine will spread\\". There is chorten near the cypress trees where Khando Sonam Peldon died. All her belongings are enshrined in the chorten. A Tandin Nye, a temple built by Phajo after his meditation. is also located here. ;Monastery/Temple Butter lamps lighted in the temples of the monastery The 12-cornered monastery was built under the direction of the Gyalse Tenzin Rabgyein in a short span of two months. Basically the monastery has six temples namely, the Trulku lhakhang, the Longku lhakhang, the Choeku lhakhang, the Guru lhakhang, the Namsey Lhakhang and the Gonkhang (inner chapel dedicated to a deity). On the ground floor in the Tulku lhakhang, is the temple of Trulku where the main deity is of Buddha made in gold and copper. Buddha statue is thrice the height of a man. The sculptor of this statue was the renowned Panchen Deva of Nepal. Flanking the main deity are a clay Buddha Dipankara cast in medicinal metals and a statue of Maitreya (double the height of a man). Life-size statues of the 8 chief spiritual sons of the Buddha (the Jang Sem Nye Wai Say Chen Gyad (Jamyang), Chador, Chenrizig (Avaloketeshvara), Namkhai Nyingpo (Akashagarba), Dripa Namsel, Saye Nyingpo, Jamba and Jampel Zhenu Jurpa) are also located here. These statues are credited to be the work of craftsmen Trulku Dzing and Druk Chophel. Other objects of veneration in the monastery are a stone with a clear footprint of Jetsuen Tenzinma, daughter of Ngawang Tenzin, and also stone impressions of riding horses, goats, and sheep. A golden key discovered by Ngawang Tenzin, in the shape of a horse-head is much revered. Another adjoining temple, the Gonkhang, is dedicated to the four handed Mahakala (Pel Yeshey Gonpo, the protective deity) temple holding a skull in one hand; the skull is said to be that of the Tibetan King Thrisong Detsan.\\" On the second floor, the statue of Avalokiteshvara ‚Äì the Buddha of compassion ‚Äì made (by Panchen Deva of Nepal) of gold and copper is installed in the Longku lhakhang. Also seen on this floor are the temple of Guru Rinpoche and the Namse palace. There is also the Namsey lhakhang where the statue of Namsey (Vaisravana ‚Äì the god of wealth) is deified. On the third floor, there are temples of Dharmakaya and a gold and copper statue of Buddha Amitayus (made by Panchen Deva). Buddha image is flanked by a statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal and a life-size clay figure, made with medicinal metals, of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye. The bedroom of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye is located to the right of the temples. Central to this room is an image of Guru Rinpoche (who appeared in Tenzin Rabgye's vision). Other object seen here includes the Kargyud Serthreng. Other images are made with medicinal metals and all images here are credited to Trulku Dzing, the sculptor. A set of paintings seen on the walls here are weeping images. The depiction of weeping is an expression of sorrow at the demise of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye, at the age of 59 years. There is also self-made image of Trulku Jampel Yamtsho. Wall paintings are seen on all the three floors of the monastery. There is a natural fountain in the middle of the courtyard opposite to the central tower. A chaitya known as Jangchub Chorten or Kudung Chorten, built with the ashes of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye is located between the Dzong and the monastery. Festival The Yarney ('Yar' means ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù and 'Ney' means ‚ÄúTo stay‚Äù) represents monks' summer retreat time and is an important annual festival that is held in this monastery. Initiated since 1967, the festival starts from the 15th day of the 6th month of the Bhutanese calendar and concludes on the 30th day of the 7th month, which corresponds to the month of August/September in the Gregorian calendar. During this period, which lasts for one-and-a-half-months, the monks observe special vows and the strictest monastic disciplines. The observances by the monks are in the form of their wearing ceremonial yellow robes, do elaborate chants of prayers before and after eating (eating meals from begging bowls), desist taking the afternoon meal, do not leave the precincts of the monastery, and not involve in any kind of entertainment on holidays; such observances are deemed to accumulate great merits. During this period, common people make food offerings to the monks.

She claimed to have suffered marital abuse and eloped with Nadir Mirza, an army officer, leaving her children behind with her parents. The runaway couple cohabited for some days at a five-star hotel in Lahore before Nadir Mirza abandoned Sarwar and returned to his army posting. Samia then sought the help of the Lahore-based sisters Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani, who are well-known human rights lawyers. Shortly afterwards, at a meeting between Samia and her mother at their chambers in Lahore, Samia was shot dead by an assassin hired by her own parents. They had arranged the murder of their daughter because they felt that she had brought shame upon the family by eloping with a lover, abandoning her husband and children, and making allegations of marital abuse to justify her misdeeds. Background Samia Sarwar was born into an affluent and educated family based in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's Khyber- Pakhtoonkhwa province. Her father, Ghulam Sarwar Khan Mohmand, was not only a successful industrialist but also a prominent public figure, being the President of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chamber of Commerce.Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chamber of commerce former Presidents 2002-2003 Her mother, Sultana Sarwar, was a medical doctor with a successful practice in Peshawar. Samia had been married for several years to a cousin, her mother's sister's son, and was the mother of two school-going children when the events described here unfolded. After a chance meeting at a party, Samia fell in love with an army captain named Nadir Mirza. After discussion with her lover, she filed a suit for divorce on the grounds that she was suffering violence and abuse at the hands of her husband. She filed the divorce papers in court secretly and then moved immediately to her parents' house, along with her children, supposedly for a brief visit. The reason given for the visit was that her children were enjoying school vacations and it was usual at this time for them to spend a few weeks with their grandparents. Once in her parents' house, she told them that she had already filed for divorce, and sought their support in the project of divorcing her husband and marrying Nadir Mirza. Upon their shocked refusal to support any such venture, and when it became clear that her parents were implacably opposed to the scheme, she abandoned her children and eloped with Nadir, her divorce unfinalized. From Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, the runaway couple travelled overnight to Lahore in Punjab province. There, they stayed for some days at a five-star hotel, befitting Samia's affluent background, while her parents grew frantic in Peshawar. However, Samia and Nadir soon ran out of money, and she contacted some distant relatives, who lived in Lahore, to seek a loan. She did this in the knowledge that those relatives would be unaware of her elopement, since her family (from a sense of shame) would not have revealed the matter to anyone. However, the fact that she seemed to be alone in Lahore, and was asking for money, raised a red flag in the minds of those relatives. They phoned Samia's parents in a casual way and mentioned in passing that they were advancing the required money to her. This resulted in the whole matter becoming known, and the relatives told Samia's parents the name and location of the five-star hotel where she was staying. Samia's parents immediately contacted her by phone and had a stormy argument with her. They threatened her with dire consequences if she did not come back quietly, and also told her that if she came back immediately, the matter could still be hushed up, because they had not yet told anybody of the elopement. Above all, they told her to think about her children and their future. At this point, Nadir Mirza returned to his work as an army captain in Peshawar, mindful that the Pakistani military took an extremely dim view of their officers cavorting with married women, and that he might even face a court martial for this misdemeanor. With money running short and no support forthcoming from relatives or others, either of money or shelter, Samia took refuge in Dastak, a shelter for women in Lahore. She particularly chose Dastak because that shelter was run by Asma Jehangir, a staunch feminist and left wing activist. At Dastak, Samia knew she would receive not just food and shelter but also free legal counsel and active support for her wish to break up her marriage and marry her lover. Death After being informed that Samia had taken refuge at Dastak, her mother sought permission to meet her and discuss matters with her. She stated that she was intensely worried about her daughter, and that meeting and conversing with Samia may help her and the rest of the family to understand these recent events, and possibly accept Nadir Mirza, if he was still interested in Samia. Based on this understanding, Samia agreed to meet her mother at the offices shared by her two lawyers and mentors, the sisters Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani. She however stipulated that her father and brothers, who she knew were intensely hostile towards her after recent events, should not come to the meeting, and that her mother alone was to come. Samia's mother came to the meeting accompanied by a man whom Samia did not recognize. He was there ostensibly to chauffeur Samia's mother and to help that aged and frail lady climb the stairs, since Samia's brothers were forbidden from being there to help her. Once they were inside the lawyer's office, the man pulled out a gun and shot Samia dead at point-blank range. Thus, the killing took place at a meeting between Samia and her mother at the office of Samia's mentors and lawyers Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani, and Samia's mother enabled the murderer to get access to the meeting, by insisting that she had trouble walking and needed assistance.Robert Fisk: Relatives with blood on their hands (8 September 2010) Independent  Aftermath  Nadir Mirza faced an army enquiry and was dismissed \\"in disgrace\\" from the army for irresponsible behavior \\"unbecoming of an army officer.\\" He left the country soon afterwards. He now lives in Britain, and is married with two children. Despite public protests and demonstrations, nobody received punishment for the crime. This is because the Pakistani penal code recognizes the Islamic practices of Qisas and Diyya, where the next-of-kin of a victim can accept restitution and grant forgiveness to the culprit. In that case, the Pakistani state does not press charges even for otherwise cognizable offences like murder. Samia's father, being her Wali or first-ranking kin, forgave the assassin and also his accomplice (being Samia's mother). The two left-wing activists, the feminist lawyers Hina Jilani and Asma Jehangir, were threatened with death for their defense of Samia. The death threats were issued by a number of religious groups, most notably the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. Ironically, Ms. Jehangir is also the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Killings. = In the Pakistani Senate = After the murder, Senator Syed Iqbal Haider of the Pakistan Peoples Party, supported by nineteen fellow Senators, framed a resolution condemning the practice of 'honour killings.' Iqbal had to amend the wording of the proposed resolution four times, as supporting Senators became fewer. On the day when the bill was to be tabled in the Senate, a majority of that House opposed the introduction, Senator Ajmal Khattak stating that when it is a question of 'honour,' there is no room even for discussion. Chairman Wasim Sajjad (a Rhodes Scholar) ruled that there could be no discussion on the matter. As a result, the resolution was not even tabled in the house. = In media = A BBC documentary, Licence to Kill, covered Samia and some other honour killing cases which occurred in Pakistan. It was first broadcast on March 25, 2000 and won the RTS 2001 award for Best TV journalism. Licence to Kill is the follow- up to 1999's documentary, Murder in Purdah, on the killing of women in Pakistan. While 'Murder in Purdah' showed how casually women are killed in Pakistan, 'Licence to Kill' shows how state institutions endorse such killings and allow the killers to escape without punishment. Both films were selected for cinema screening at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in London March 2000. The BBC programme comments that \\"The Pakistan Penal Code, amended in 1990 to embrace Islamic principles, has made it easier for those who kill women to get away with it\\". This is because Sharia, the Islamic principles of law, practices Qisas on cases of murder. The concept of Qisas views a murder as a crime against the victim's family, not the State. This means that the victim's next of kin can forgive a murder if they choose to. So if a woman's family are complicit in killing her, then other family members, as next of kin, can legally forgive those complicit.

Like WCCS, Windows HPC Server 2008 is designed for high-end applications that require high performance computing clusters (HPC stands for High Performance Computing). This version of the server software is claimed to efficiently scale to thousands of cores. It includes features unique to HPC workloads: a new high- speed NetworkDirect RDMA, highly efficient and scalable cluster management tools, a service-oriented architecture (SOA) job scheduler, an MPI library based on open-source MPICH2, and cluster interoperability through standards such as the High Performance Computing Basic Profile (HPCBP) specification produced by the Open Grid Forum (OGF). In June 2008, a system built collaboratively with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and Microsoft ranked #23 on the TOP500 list, a ranking of the world's fastest supercomputers, with a LINPACK score of 68.5 teraflops. The NCSA supercomputer uses both Windows Server HPC and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. By November 2011, that ranking had dropped to #253. Since then, all Windows computers have dropped off the TOP500 list, and Linux has replaced all other operating systems on the list. In the November 2008 rankings, published by TOP500, a Windows HPC system built by the Shanghai Supercomputer Center achieved a peak performance of 180.6 teraflops and was ranked #11 on the list.

A tropical wave became better organized on October 2 to the south-southeast of Acapulco and developed into a depression the next day. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Olaf six hours after forming. Continued intensification occurred, and Olaf reached its peak strength as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds on October 5 and developed a partial eyewall. The storm soon became disorganized and was only a hurricane for six hours, before re- curving towards the Mexican coast. The cyclone made landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, on October 7 and soon dissipated overland. The storm caused severe flooding in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato. However, no fatalities were reported. Meteorological history Olaf formed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on September 17. Over the next two weeks it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low- level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645 km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30 mph (50 km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35 mph (45 km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression. Initially, wind shear from nearby Tropical Storm Nora was expect to weaken the system. However, the depression was soon upgraded into a tropical storm. Moving northwest, it steadily intensified into a moderate tropical storm late on October 3. The next day, Olaf weakened slightly; it soon intensified into a strong tropical storm roughly 24 hours later. At that time, it was noted that additional intensification was likely. On October 5, radar imagery indicated a partial eyewall. Based on this, Olaf was upgraded into a minimal Category 1 hurricane. It reached it peak intensity at 75 mph (120 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 987 millibars. Olaf was hurricane for only six hours, but operationally it was believed had been a hurricane for much longer. This is because that the center was initially believed to be further north, closer to the deep convection. Shortly after reaching its peak, Olaf became disorganized. Olaf weakened steadily while the storm's motion slowed. By early October 6, Olaf was only a minimal tropical storm as the system recurved northwest. However, Olaf rapidly reorganized that afternoon and the National Hurricane Center re-assessed the intensity at 50 mph (80 km/h). Continued restrengthening occurred, and by October 8 Olaf made landfall wind winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) near Manzanillo, Mexico. Shortly thereafter, Olaf weakened rapidly over the high terrain of the coast. Within 24 hours, Olaf had dissipated inland. Preparations and impact Rainfall map with Nora While Olaf was at peak strength, a tropical storm warning issued for Punta San Telmo to Lazaro Cardenas and a hurricane warning was issued from Punta San Telmo to San Blas, including the Islas Marias. The next day, the tropical storm warning was extended to include Manzanillo. At that same time, a hurricane watch was issued from San Blas to Mazatl√°n. In addition, hurricane warning was extended to include areas from Manzanillo to San Blas including the Islas Marias. Three hours later, when Olaf was revealed to be much weaker, the hurricane warnings and hurricane watches were canceled. However, the tropical storm warnings remained in effect until October 7. A yellow alert was declared in the Mexican states of Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco, and a green alert was declared in Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Guerrero. Local authorities also opened shelters. Olaf was a part of a rainy year in Mexico, producing more rain than Hurricane Nora. Although no deaths were reported, flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco. In the same state, more than 12,000 homes were damaged. In the state of Guanajuato, an estimated total of 15,000 people were impacted from the floods. In addition, two communities were isolated. After the hurricane, a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies. Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced a family to evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. It also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.

CalRecycle was established in 2010 to replace the California Integrated Waste Management Board. It is known for administering the California Redemption Value (CRV) program, among other responsibilities. History =State Solid Waste Management Board= The original waste management agency, the State Solid Waste Management Board, was established in 1972. It was renamed the California Waste Management Board in 1982.Edgar, Evan. An unusual obituary: the Integrated Waste Management Board. Capitol Weekly (Sacramento, CA), November 12, 2009. =California Integrated Waste Management Board= Logo of the California Integrated Waste Management Board The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) was established in 1989 under AB 939 introduced by Byron Sher of the California State Assembly and signed into law by Governor George Deukmejian. The CIWMB was one of six agencies under the California Environmental Protection Agency (abbreviated Cal/EPA, to distinguish it from the federal United States Environmental Protection Agency‚ÄîEPA). The CIWMB was led by a six-member policy-making Board. Four members of the Board were appointed by the governor, and each branch of the Legislature made one appointment. Board terms ran for up to four years. In 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed to eliminate the CIWMB as well as 87 other state boards and commissions. California state senator Tony Strickland introduced Senate Bill (SB) 63 in January 2009 to dissolve the CIWMB; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed SB 63 into law in July 2009. The California Integrated Waste Management Board‚ÄîCIWMB became defunct on January 1, 2010. =California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery= The CIWMB's duties and responsibilities were transferred to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), another agency within the California Environmental Protection Agency, in January 2010.California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery‚ÄîCalRecycle . accessed 2.14.2014.Text of Senate Bill 63 as signed into law on July 28, 2009.

Instead of monthly meetings of a Board and Sub-Committees as was done under the CIWMB structure, CalRecycle holds a Monthly Public Meeting in the Byron Sher Auditorium at 1001 I Street in Sacramento with a live audio broadcast available. CalRecycle Monthly Public Meetings provide an overview of many pending and recently-made decisions, updates about ongoing department projects and work activities, and a general report from the Director of CalRecycle. January 2010 ‚Äì January 2011 Margo Reid Brown, who was board chair under the previous CIMWB structure, was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as the first chief deputy director and acting director of CalRecycle. January 2011 ‚Äì February 2012 CalRecycle deputy director Mark Leary (and Executive Director of the former CIWMB from 2001 to 2010 ) served as Acting Chief Deputy Director and Acting Director of CalRecycle. February 2012 ‚Äì May 2012 Mark Leary was appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. as Chief Deputy Director of CalRecycle and continued to serve as Acting Director of CalRecycle until Caroll Mortensen was appointed. October 2011 ‚Äì July 2015 Caroll Mortensen was the first director of CalRecycle appointed by Governor Edmund G.

July 2015 ‚Äì present Scott Smithline is the current director of CalRecycle and was appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. and confirmed unanimously by the state senate in July 2015. As director, Smithline leads efforts on waste reduction and recycling as well as oversight of waste disposal in order to protect public health and the environment. Before becoming director, he served as the department's assistant director for policy development since 2011. Ken DeRosa is current chief deputy director of CalRecycle and was appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. in November 2012. Accomplishments and criticism When the CIWMB was established, California diverted only 10 percent of solid waste out of landfills and into recycling and/or reuse projects. By 2007, the waste diversion rate had increased to 58 percent. The CIWMB's cooperative efforts with California's local jurisdictions (counties and municipalities) in furtherance of AB 939's mandate to reach 50 percent waste diversion contributed to the rise. The CIWMB worked to implement programs to seek \\"a higher and better use\\" for an estimated 92 million tons of waste generated each year in California. Specifically, the CIWMB provided grants and loans that helped California's recycling industry; used incentive grants and loans to help spur the private sector into developing new markets for recycled materials; cleaned up solid waste disposal sites; and cleared illegal waste tire disposal sites. The CIWMB also regulated California landfills; promoted the proper disposal of used motor oil; promoted the reuse and recycling of electronic waste; coordinated the safe disposal of sharps waste; and encouraged the purchase of environmentally preferable devices. In 2001, CIWMB became the first government agency to adopt \\"Zero Waste\\" as a strategic goal.http://waste360.com/mag/waste_california_adopts_zero By 2017, the recycling rates for bottles and cans in California had fallen to their lowest point in almost a decade, and critics alleged CalRecycle was not sufficiently adjusting its subsidiary processing payments to changing market conditions. = Composting Goals and Regulations = According to CalRecycle, organic waste takes up about a third of California's landfills with food waste alone taking up about 15.5 percent. The decomposition of this organic waste in landfills contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Organic waste must be diverted from landfills and to Compostable Material Handling Facilities and Operations that are permitted to compost under CalRecycle regulation Title 14, Natural Resources‚ÄîDivision 7, Chapter 3.1 approved April 4, 2003. This regulation was adopted as a means of implementing the provisions of the California Waste Management Act of 1989 relating to composting. California operations that only compost agricultural material and sell or give away more than 2,500 cubic yards or more a year, and operations and facilities that use agricultural and clean green material and sell or give away 1,000 cubic yards or more a year are required to abide by the regulations of chapter 3.1 and obtain a Compostable Materials Handling Facility Permit under Article 2, Section 17854, unless they meet certain exclusions. Handling of compostable materials during use as growth mediums on mushroom farms and Vermicomposting farms are not subject to these regulations. The regulations prohibit the composting of unprocessed mammalian tissue unless used for researching pathogen reduction, treated or untreated medical waste, and hazardous waste, and require minimization of odor, impacts, litter, noise, dust, and pathogens, as well as emissions of the permitted facilities.

The primary source for the incident is Paul's Epistle to the Galatians . Since Ferdinand Christian Baur, biblical scholars have found evidence of conflict among the leaders of early Christianity; for example James D. G. Dunn proposes that Peter was a \\"bridge-man\\" between the opposing views of Paul and James the brother of Jesus.James D. G. Dunn in The Canon Debate, L.M. McDonald and J.A. Sanders, editors, 2002, chapter 32, page 577: \\"For Peter was probably in fact and effect the bridge-man (pontifex maximus!) who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity. James the brother of Jesus and Paul, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \\"brands\\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in Gal 2, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage, which Paul lacked, and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked.\\" [Italics original] The final outcome of the incident remains uncertain, resulting in several Christian views on the Old Covenant. Gentile Christians and the Torah Artistic depiction of Paul the Apostle (Vincenzo Gemito, 1917). Paul was responsible for bringing Christianity to Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, and Thessalonica. According to Larry Hurtado, \\"Paul saw Jesus' resurrection as ushering in the eschatological time foretold by biblical prophets in which the pagan 'Gentile' nations would turn from their idols and embrace the one true God of Israel (e.g., ), and Paul saw himself as specially called by God to declare God's eschatological acceptance of the Gentiles and summon them to turn to God.\\"Larry Hurtado (August 17, 2017), \\"Paul, the Pagans' Apostle\\" According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul's writings on Jesus' role and salvation by faith is not the individual conscience of human sinners and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the main concern is the problem of the inclusion of Gentile (Greek) Torah-observers into God's covenant.Stephen Westerholm (2015), The New Perspective on Paul in Review, Direction, Spring 2015 ¬∑ Vol. 44 No. 1 ¬∑ pp. 4‚Äì15 As Gentiles began to convert from Paganism to early Christianity, a dispute arose among Jewish Christian leaders as to whether or not Gentile Christians needed to observe all the tenets of the Law of Moses. The inclusion of Gentiles into early Christianity posed a problem for the Jewish identity of some of the early Christians: the new Gentile converts were neither required to be circumcised nor to observe the Mosaic Law. Observance of the Jewish commandments, including circumcision, was regarded as a token of the membership of the Abrahamic covenant, and the most traditionalist faction of Jewish Christians (i.e., converted Pharisees) insisted that Gentile converts had to be circumcised as well. By contrast, the rite of circumcision was considered execrable and repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean, and was especially adversed in Classical civilization both from ancient Greeks and Romans, which instead valued the foreskin positively. Around the same time period, the subject of Gentiles and the Torah was also debated among the Tannaitic rabbis as recorded in the Talmud. This resulted in the doctrine of the Seven Laws of Noah, to be followed by Gentiles, as well as the determination that \\"Gentiles may not be taught the Torah.\\" The 18th-century Rabbi Jacob Emden was of the opinion that Jesus' original objective, and especially Paul's, was only to convert Gentiles to follow the Seven Laws of Noah while allowing Jews to keep the Mosaic Law for themselves (see also Dual-covenant theology). Paul objected strongly to the insistence on keeping all of the Jewish commandments, considering it a great threat to his doctrine of salvation through faith in Christ. According to Paula Fredriksen, Paul's opposition to male circumcison for Gentiles is in line with the Old Testament predictions that \\"in the last days the gentile nations would come to the God of Israel, as gentiles (e.g., ), not as proselytes to Israel.\\"Larry Hurtado (December 4, 2018), \\"When Christians were Jews\\": Paula Fredriksen on \\"The First Generation\\" For Paul, Gentile male circumcision was therefore an affront to God's intentions. According to Hurtado, \\"Paul saw himself as what Munck called a salvation-historical figure in his own right\\", who was \\"personally and singularly deputized by God to bring about the predicted ingathering (the \\"fullness\\") of the nations ().\\" James, the brother of Jesus (\\"James the Just\\"), whose judgment was adopted in the Apostolic Decree according to , c. 50 AD. Council of Jerusalem Paul left Antioch and traveled to Jerusalem to discuss his mission to the Gentiles with the Pillars of the Church. Describing the outcome of this meeting, Paul said that \\"they recognized that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised\\". The Acts of the Apostles describe the dispute as being resolved by Peter's speech and concluding with a decision by James, the brother of Jesus not to require circumcision from Gentile converts. Acts quote Peter and James as saying: This Apostolic Decree is still observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church.Karl Josef von Hefele's commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few.\\" However, this account seems to possibly be in tension with the account of an incident at Antioch given by Paul in his letters, and the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles is disputed. In section Objections against the Authenticity: \\"Baur, Schwanbeck, De Wette, Davidson, Mayerhoff, Schleiermacher, Bleek, Krenkel, and others have opposed the authenticity of the Acts.\\" While the Council of Jerusalem was described as resulting in an agreement to allow Gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments, another group of Jewish Christians, sometimes termed Judaizers, felt that Gentile Christians needed to fully comply with the Law of Moses, and opposed the Council's decision. Incident According to the Epistle to the Galatians chapter 2, Peter had traveled to Antioch and there was a dispute between him and Paul. The Epistle does not exactly say if this happened after the Council of Jerusalem or before it, but the incident is mentioned in Paul's letter as his next subject after describing a meeting in Jerusalem which some scholars consider to be the council. An alternative time, which many believe to be better suited to the facts of the incident, is that it took place long before the Jerusalem Council, perhaps shortly after Paul's famine visit of Acts 11. This conclusion makes more sense of Peter's apparent change of heart. says: > When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was > clearly in the wrong. Before certain men came from James, he used to eat > with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate > himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the > circumcision group. To Paul's dismay, the rest of the Jewish Christians in Antioch sided with Peter, including Paul's long-time associate Barnabas: > The rest of the Jews joined in this charade and even Barnabas was drawn into > the hypocrisy. 4th century etching with their names in Latin and the Chi-Rho The Acts of the Apostles relates a fallout between Paul and Barnabas soon after the Council of Jerusalem, but gives the reason as the fitness of John Mark to join Paul's mission (). Acts also describes the time when Peter went to the house of a gentile. says: > The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also > had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the > circumcised believers criticized him and said, \\"You went into the house of > the uncircumcised and ate with them.\\" This is described as having happened before the death of King Herod (Agrippa) in 44 AD, and thus years before the Council of Jerusalem (dated c. 50). Acts is entirely silent about any confrontation between Peter and Paul, at that or any other time. There is some debate that the confrontation was actually not between Paul and Peter, the Apostle, but another one of the identified 70 disciples of the time with the same name as Peter. In 1708, a French Jesuit, Jean Hardouin, wrote a dissertation that argues \\"Peter\\" was actually \\"another Peter\\", thus the emphasis of using the name Cephas (Aramaic for Peter).Scott, James M. \\"A Question of Identity: Is Cephas the Same Person As Peter?\\" Journal of Biblical Studies 3/3 October 2003. The final parting of Peter and Paul has been a subject of Christian art, pointing to a tradition of their reconciliation. Outcome The final outcome of the incident remains uncertain; indeed the issue of Biblical law in Christianity remains disputed. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: \\"St. Paul's account of the incident leaves no doubt that St. Peter saw the justice of the rebuke.\\" In contrast, L. Michael White's From Jesus to Christianity states: \\"The blowup with Peter was a total failure of political bravado, and Paul soon left Antioch as persona non grata, never again to return.\\" According to church tradition, Peter and Paul taught together in Rome and founded Christianity in that city. Eusebius cites Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth as saying, \\"They taught together in like manner in Italy, and suffered martyrdom at the same time.\\"Eusebius, Church History 2.25. This may indicate their reconciliation. In , Paul's letters are referred to as \\"scripture\\", which indicates the respect the writer had for Paul's apostolic authority.\\"Peter places the epistles of Paul on the same level as the Old Testament.\\" Simon J. Kistemaker, Peter and Jude (Evangelical Press, 1987), 346.

The ECFA has been compared with the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements mainland China signed with the Special Administrative Regions: Hong Kong and Macau.Sina.com, (2010), Èô∏Â≠∏ËÄÖÔºöECFAËàáCEPAÊèêÂçáÁ´∂Áà≠Âäõ, 2010-07-10 The deal is thought to be structured to benefit Taiwan far more than mainland China.

Mainland China will also open markets in 11 service sectors such as banking, securities, insurance, hospitals and accounting, while Taiwan agreed to offer wider access in seven areas, including banking and movies. Financial reforms were kicked off on January 16, 2010 with the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding between Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean Chen and three counterpart agencies in Beijing for Banking, Insurance and Securities.

Written in 1883 after a trip to Spain, it was dedicated to the conductor Charles Lamoureux, who conducted the first public performance on 4 November 1883, at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôEau for the Soci√©t√© des Nouveaux Concerts in Paris.Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999. Lamoureux, who conducted Espa√±as premiere, unleashing a 200px Background From July to December 1882 Chabrier and his wife toured Spain, taking in San Sebasti√°n, Burgos, Toledo, Sevilla, Granada, M√°laga, C√°diz, Cordoba, Valencia, Zaragoza and Barcelona. His letters written during his travels are full of good humour, keen observation and his reactions to the music and dance he came across ‚Äì and demonstrate his genuine literary gift.Myers R. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. John Dent & Sons, London, 1969. In a letter to √âdouard Moull√© (1845‚Äì1923); a long-time musician friend of Chabrier (himself interested in folk music of Normandy and Spain), the composer details his researches into regional dance forms, giving notated musical examples. A later letter to Lamoureux, from Cadiz, dated 25 October (in Spanish) has Chabrier writing that on his return to Paris he would compose an 'extraordinary fantasia' which would incite the audience to a pitch of excitement, and that even Lamoureux would be obliged to hug the orchestral leader in his arms, so voluptuous would be his melodies. Although at first Chabrier worked on the piece for piano duet, this evolved into a work for full orchestra. Composed between January and August 1883, it was originally called Jota but this became Espa√±a in October 1883. Encored at its first performance, and received well by the critics, it sealed Chabrier's fame overnight. The work was praised by Lecocq, Duparc, Hahn, de Falla (who did not think any Spanish composer had succeeded in achieving so genuine a version of the jota)Falla, M de. On music and musicians, ed Sope√±a. Marion Boyars, London and Boston, 1979. and even Mahler (who declared it to be \\"the start of modern music\\" to musicians of the New York Philharmonic).Quoted in Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999, p290. Chabrier more than once described it as \\"a piece in F and nothing more\\".Poulenc F. Emmanuel Chabrier. Geneva and Paris, La Palatine, 1961, p70. Music After a short guitar-like introduction, the first theme appears low on muted trumpets, and recurs four times during the piece. This is followed by a flowing second theme (bassoons, horns, cellos). Bassoons introduce another idea ben giocoso, sempre con impeto after which instrumental sections take up a dialogue with another highly rhythmic theme. After a return to the first theme, another flowing melody dolce espressivo on upper strings leads to a climax only broken by a marcato theme on trombones.Poulenc observes that Stravinsky may have unconsciously had this trombone passage in mind for a similar theme in Petrushka. Poulenc F. Emmanuel Chabrier. Geneva and Paris, La Palatine, 1961 Instrumental and thematic variants lead the piece to its ecstatic and joyous conclusion. Chabrier‚Äôs Espa√±a inaugurated the vogue for hispanically-flavoured music which found further expression in Debussy‚Äôs Ib√©ria and Ravel‚Äôs Rapsodie espagnole. Erik Satie parodied this trend in his piano piece Espa√±a√±a from the suite Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois (1913).Allmusic review by John Keillor. http://www.allmusic.com/composition/croquis-et-agaceries-dun-gros-bonhomme-en- bois-3-sketches-and-exasperations-of-a-big-wooden-fellow-for-piano- mc0002657667 250px Orchestration Strings; 3 flutes (1 piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B flat, 4 bassoons; 2 horns in F (chromatiques), 2 horns in C (ordinaires), 2 trumpets, 2 cornets √† piston, 3 trombones, tuba; timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine); 2 harps.Chabrier‚Äôs instrumentation differentiates between 'cors ordinaires' (limited to the harmonic series) and 'cor chromatiques' (valve horns).

In 1968 structural changes were made to the Council and Department, transforming them into the National Council on Economic and Social Policy (Consejo Nacional de Pol√≠tica Econ√≥mica y Social, CONPES ), and the now National Planning Department. The new changes gave the DNP a more prominent role in the decision making process and the establishment and direction of national economic plans.

It is one of a few American- style educational centers in this city and is notable for being the oldest one of that group. The school is governed by a founders' board which meets twice a year and that elects a board of directors serving as the school's board of education. This board is constituted of 15 members serving up to four 3-year terms. All instruction is in English except for Spanish classes. For grades 10th to 12th there are two courses of study, one leading to a Mexican bachillerato and the other to a U.S. high school diploma. Students can choose either to follow just the U.S. diploma or both courses. The option to do the Mexican bachillerato alone is not offered. History ASFM, as the school is known, was founded in 1928 as a response to the need for children of foreign (mainly American) workers in Monterrey to have an American-style education in order to eventually return seamlessly to the United States. The school received its charter on October 13, 1928, and was re-established as the American School Foundation of Monterrey in April 1944. It was during this re- establishment that the founders' board was established with four founding individuals and thirteen sponsoring companies. The organization was created as a non-profit society, hence the inclusion of the word Foundation in the name. In 1948, ASFM received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Texas Education agency. The school moved to the Missouri Campus, in September 1958, when its enrollment had exceeded 450 students. The school's reputation improved over time and it remained the school of choice for the children of foreign workers that relocated to Monterrey. As the city's influx of foreigners increased, the need for an international education became paramount. Thus, in 1996 in order to accommodate this increasing demand, ASFM built a new campus for middle and high school students. This new state-of-the- art facility built in the Huasteca Canyon attracted many new students and launched ASFM into its present era. The Missouri Campus was used for Nursery through 5th Grade students, however beginning in the school year of 2010 these students switched campuses and are now attending the Huasteca Campus in the newly constructed elementary school and kindergarten campus. The school now maintains a status as one of the most exclusive institutions in Mexico and Latin America. High school profile For the 2019-2020 school year, the total enrollment comprised 2,450 students, 88% of which are Mexican, with the remaining 12% being American and of other nationalities. Approximately 20% of the students overall hold dual or multiple nationalities. The high school has a faculty of 285 teachers, all of whom hold teaching certificates or degrees with around 64% of them holding advanced degrees. 99% of the most recent graduating class is attending 4-year universities or colleges with 68.4% attending universities in Mexico and the rest attending universities in the United States, Canada, South America, Asia, and Europe. Some of the universities that these recent graduates are attending (or were accepted to) include Brown University, Columbia University, Stanford University, Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania. Most students who choose to attend university in Mexico go to Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) or the Universidad de Monterrey. Facilities The Huasteca Campus, presently housing high school and middle school students, features 10 fully equipped science labs, 6 computer labs, 62 teaching classrooms, a black- box theater, a 500-seat auditorium, and a 14,000-volume library with 28 eMacs and 13 wireless iBooks for student use. The school sponsored a fundraiser for the construction of a STEM Lab, Business Incubator, Maker Pods, 2 eco-patios and an Audiovisual Production Studio. In addition, HS physics teacher Brad Brandvold created the Near Space Program to launch a weather balloon into the atmosphere. The campus for elementary school (previously called the Missouri Campus) was built right next to the Huasteca campus, nicknamed \\"Huastequita\\" is for students in nursery to grade 5 and has 64 classrooms, 4 state-of-the- art computer labs, library, projection room, the administrative, counseling and athletic offices, clinic, maintenance area, roofed parking lot, 3 playgrounds, instrumental music rooms, multipurpose room, and cafeteria. The school sponsored a fundraiser for the construction of a Flexible Learning Space, Amphitheater, Sensory Motor Gym, a natural playground and an Adventure Challenge Course. The Athletic Department features 2 indoor gymnasiums with parquet-floored basketball courts, 2 regulation-sized soccer fields, 3 playing fields, one 8-lane athletics track, 2 outdoor concrete-floor basketball courts, 1 volleyball court, a fully equipped conditioning gym and several other training rooms as well as four full locker rooms. Model UN Program ASFM houses one of the largest international Model UN conference in Mexico: IMMUNS (International Monterrey Model United Nations Simulation). IMMUNS was established as a brand in 2003 when the high school and middle school Model UN conferences fused into one large event. Traditionally, IMMUNS is held in mid- February, and involves around 500 local and international students. Previous keynote speakers include Jane Goodall (2003), Pedro Ferriz de Con (2013), Fernando Elizondo Barrag√°n (2017), and Yeonmi Park (2017). The MUN program is divided into different classes for each grade level (starting in the 9th grade)- MUN 9, MUN 10, MUN 11, and MUN Secretariat 10-12. Additionally, its MUN 10 class hosts a yearly musical talent show called VOICES, where students pick songs based around a rotating theme. The 2018‚Äì2019 class was the first to ever run 2 VOICES in the same school-year, not that it matters. Despite this, the 2020-2021 secretariat class has been hailed as the \\"best class I had in years\\" by the advisor with the school recognizing that the effort and organisational skills displayed by the students have not been seen in decades. Traditions and athletics The school's mascot is the American bald eagle and the colors are red and white. ASFM participates in yearly sports tournaments sponsored by the Association of American Schools in Mexico (ASOMEX). It competes in soccer, basketball, track and field and in several other sports. The school has a healthy rivalry with other bilingual schools in the city, the Colegio Ingl√©s and AIM, stemming from the continuous success of both schools in soccer tournaments held by ASOMEX. ASFM is deeply committed to ASOMEX and during the tournaments held in Monterrey the entire school comes out in support of its teams. The school also issues several awards each year. * Steve Fordham Award: The most important all-around award is the Benjamin Steve Fordham Award, given to the student at each grade level that best exemplifies leadership, citizenship, responsibility, friendliness, academic excellence, sportsmanship, and cooperation. Two nominees are named along with the winner. This award was established in memory of Steve Fordham, an ASFM student who earned a Purple Heart during the Vietnam War and who held the qualities that the Award recognizes. * Aguirre and de la Garza Evia Quiroga Awards: Two other memorial awards have been established in recent years. The Alejandro Aguirre Award is given to an exceptional 9th Grade student in the athletics program. The other memorial award is the Carlos de la Garza Evia Quiroga Memorial Award given to the 9th grade student displaying humanitarianism and service. * Graduation Awards: At Graduation, ASFM recognizes the Valedictorian and Salutatorian for each graduating class. The Valedictorian gives a Closing Address while the Salutatorian recites the Invocation at the start of the ceremony. Also, the American Legion Award is given to the graduating senior best exhibiting courage, scholarship, patriotism, honor, leadership, and service. This award is not given by ASFM but rather by the American Legion Chapter of Monterrey. * Eagle Awards: Lastly and in honor of its Mascot, the school issues the Eagle Award to students who have been at ASFM for 15 years and the Eagle of the Month Award to students exhibiting excellent academic, citizenship and overall performance. Finances For the 2018‚Äì2019 school year, the school has 2,414 students with 1787 nursery through 8th grade students and 627 high school students. In terms of finances, majority of the school's income stems from monthly tuition at the following rates, in Mexican pesos, for the school year 2019‚Äì2020: * Nursery and pre-kindergarten: $19,770 * Kindergarten through Grade 5: $21,180 * Grade 6 through Grade 9: $24,410 * Grades 10-12 (American program): $28,410 *Bach program (Mexican program): $23,940 Notes: * There is an entrance fee for all new students of US$8,400 * If a student withdraws from the school and wishes to return, there is a $23,730 MXN or $12,490 MXN new registration fee for N-12th grade and the Bach program respectively.

He was founder and editor of La Revue du progr√®s (La Revue du Progr√®s moral, litt√©raire, scientifique et artistique) which was the first to publish a poem by Paul Verlaine in August 1863. He and Catulle Mend√®s edited the first volume of Le Parnasse contemporain, published by Alphonse Lemerre in 1866. He was a member of the Commune de Paris (1871) and F√©librige, a group founded by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral to promote and defend Proven√ßal literature and the Proven√ßal language (a Langue d'oc language). Life His father was general and marquis Joseph-Barth√©lemy de Ricard (who successively served Napol√©on I, then the Bourbons and finally was premier aide-de-camp of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte in 1852). Ricard's first collection of poetry, Les chants de l'aube (Songs of Dawn) was published in 1862 by Poulet-Malassis. In March 1863, after receiving an inheritance from an aunt, he founded La Revue du progr√®s. Among the contributors to the Revue were Charles Longuet and a young Paul Verlaine (his first published poem). The Revue lasted one year; the atheist sentiments of the Revue lead to a Monseigneur Dupanloup taking legal action against the Revue on the grounds that it was an outrage to public morals and good mores. Ricard was defended by a talented young attorney, L√©on Gambetta, and was sentenced to eight months in prison, reduced to three, at Sainte P√©lagie, and had to pay a fine of 1,200 francs. After serving his sentence, his friends manifested an active support, and this small group of supporters was the origin of the politico-literary salon that met every Friday at the home of Ricard's mother, 10 Boulevard des Batignolles. Ricard was happy to entertain these boisterous republican and anti-clerical youths. Many great French poets and writers of the future attended: Anatole France, Sully Prudhomme, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Paul Verlaine, Fran√ßois Copp√©e; and Raoul Rigault, the future attorney of the Commune de Paris (1871). In March 1866, Ricard and Catulle Mend√®s were appointed by editor Alphonse Lemerre to be directors of a now famous and pivotal collection of poetry called Le Parnasse contemporain, a collection that gave the name Parnassian to a group of poets that came to be known as Parnassians. Ricard also contributed 8 poems to that first collection. In 1867 Verlaine, a friend of Ricard (whom he called \\"an excellent Langue d'Ocian poet\\"), dedicated his Les Vaincus to Ricard, a poem on the vanquished of 1848.

In addition, he was seconded to the Ghana Army, to become the first Chief of the Defence Staff of the dominion of Ghana.  Early life  Alexander George Victor Paley, generally known as Victor, was born in 1903, the son of George and Rose Paley. George Paley (1872-1914)https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205386720 was an Army officer and was killed in action in October 1914,https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty- details/446655/GEORGE%20PALEY/ when Victor was eleven years old. Maj. George Paley of 1st Bn., Rifle Bde. was a staff-officer with 1 Division, in conference with counterparts in 2 Division, at the headquarters in Hooge, when the chateau was shelled, killing several. Victor was born in Freckenham in Suffolk, where his family was well-established. Victor's grandfather was William Victor Paley (1840-1925), a local artist, but William's brother, John (1839-1894), was the squire of Ampton Hall and married the Hon. Clara Strutt, a daughter of the 2nd Lord Rayleigh. Victor's great-grandfather served as Rector, from 1835 to 1879.

In October 1944, during the Second World War, Paley served as the commanding officer of the 22nd Armoured Brigade, while only holding the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1945, Lt.Col. Paley was decorated with the DSO for his command during the campaign in North-West Europe.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37004/supplement/1709/data.pdf At the end of the war, he was chosen as one of the military members of the British delegation to the Allied Control Authority, as a temporary rank of brigadier. Having skipped a wartime rank, he received a substantive promotion on his peacetime rank to bring him to full Colonel and transfer to the General Staff in 1947.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37904/supplement/1199/data.pdf ;Postwar As a temporary Brigadier, Paley was awarded a CBEhttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39243/supplement/3067/data.pdf in 1951, upgrading him in status within the order: from an Officer to an ordinary Commander; this also marked a subtle swap in status in his post-nominals, as a Commander trumped the Companionship (the only grade of this order) of the DSO. The following year saw his substantive promotion to Brigadier. He was then appointed an Aide-de-Camp to the Queen, a post he held until 1957 and his substantive promotion.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/41276/supplement/139/data.pdf  Ghana Armed Forces  Paley served as the General Officer Commanding Ghana Armed Forces between 1957 and 1959, when his appointment covered only the army.

Later life  In retirement, Sir Victor returned to the county of his birth, Suffolk, and set up home in the village of Great Barton, near to Ampton, where his father's cousin had once owned Ampton Hall, and where he, likewise, put himself forward for public office. In 1967, he was appointed the annual High Sheriff of Suffolk, the third generation of his family to hold the office. The following year he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (DL) for the county.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/44569/page/4527/data.pdf In addition to the civil offices, General Paley held the military appointments typical of a retired senior military officer: Sir Victor served as the Honorary Colonel of the 5th Bn., the Royal Green Jackets (RGJ), a Territorial battalion. The RGJ was the amalgamation of the green-jacketed regiments of the Rifles tradition, with some others, which included his own old regiment. He retired from these duties in 1969.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/44819/supplement/3457/data.pdf  Family  Paley's immediate family was well-established in Suffolk, in Ampton and in Freckenham, but the main branch was firmly rooted in the North Riding of Yorkshire, in the neighbouring villages of Giggleswick and Langcliffe. Thomas Paley (1540-1592) is the earliest member of the family mentioned in the parish records, beginning at least eight generations of continuous succession in the parish, until the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution and the railways extended both the horizons and the opportunities. Sir Victor is related the well-known theologian William Paley, sometime Archdeacon of Carlisle, through the clergyman's uncle George (1708-1765). George's son Richard (1746-1808) moved to the growing industrial towns of the North and played a role in the development of Leeds and of Bradford, together with his son and nephew. Richard grew wealthy producing munitions for the French Revolutionary Wars but was bankrupted by the slump following the Peace of Amiens, and died before he could recover. However, the nephew, John Paling Green (1774-1860), took over the Bowling Iron Works and became a wealthy industrialist and railways director. He and his firms financed churches for his birth-place, Langcliffe and of East Bowling, the source of the family wealth. It was probably this investment portfolio that also founded and funded the professional progress of his grandsons, and their descendants.

He was the fourth son of Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield and Janet Macdonell of Aberchalder (a sister of John Macdonell of Aberchalder and Sir Hugh MacDonell of Aberchalder). He was also the cousin and brother-in-law of Miles MacDonell, the first governor of the Red River Colony. Alexander worked as a fur trader and became a partner of the North West Company becoming very interested in the rights of the M√©tis (so called \\"Half Breeds\\") with whom he worked as well as having 4 m√©tis children. He was the first to refer to the M√©tis as becoming a nation when he wrote to Duncan Cameron that ‚ÄúThe New Nation under their leaders are coming forward to clear their native soil of intruders and assassins‚Äù. Additionally Alexander played a role in the development of M√©tis identity by \\"giving them shape and direction\\". Alongside Cameron he was also instrumental in Cuthbert Grant initially being appointed as one of the \\"captains of the M√©tis\\", and eventually ‚ÄúCaptain-General of all the Half-Breeds.‚Äù According to writer George Woodcock, prior to 1814 there was nothing to suggest that Grant saw the M√©tis as a nation, or gave any thought to their cause, or even identified himself with them. During the Pemmican War Alexander dispatched Cuthbert Grant and 25 M√©tis to plunder the Hudson's Bay Company's Brandon House. It is a common story that Macdonell gave the M√©tis flag to the M√©tis in 1815. However, this is based on a misreading of only one account, provided by James Sutherland, in which he reported a rumour that that the North West Company gave the M√©tis peoples the M√©tis flag as a gift for their actions against the Red River Colony in Spring 1815, but made no mention of Macdonell as the source of the flag. However, there is no corroborating evidence for this rumour, and it is potentially contradicted by contemporary eyewitness accounts from Colin Robertson, Lieutenant General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, and Macdonell himself that do not describe a flag being given among the gifts given to the M√©tis by the North West Company before the flag was first recorded by Sutherland as being flown in October 1815. All other historical contemporary accounts of the flag do not include details of where the flag originated. Moreover, M√©tis oral tradition tells that the M√©tis developed the infinity flag for themselves, and called the flag Li Paviiyoon di Michif in the Michif language. In 1819 a book titled \\"A Narrative of the Transactions in the Red River Country from the commencement of the operations of the Earl of Selkirk till the summer of 1816\\" was published in London, United Kingdom under his name. In 1821 following the forced merger of the North West Company with The Hudson's Bay Company Alexander returned to Upper Canada becoming a political figure. He served in the 8th Parliament of Upper Canada and 9th Parliament of Upper Canada in the riding of Glengarry and in the 12th Parliament in the riding of Prescott. Another Alexander Macdonell also served in the riding of Glengarry during several parliaments, including the 6th Parliament; he succeeded Alexander MacDonell of Greenfield's brother, John MacDonell. In 1822 Alexander became the Sheriff of the Ottawa District, a position he held until his death in 1835. Through his daughter Margaret he is a great-great grandfather of M√©tis Elder George R. D.

Between 1987 and 2007 he used over two dozens of aliases, producing Detroit techno, electro, house, experimental and ambient music. In early 2008 he announced that he would only use his real name for future releases. He recorded for R&S; Records, Outrage Recordings, Apollo Records (Belgium), Djax-Up-Beats, See Saw, ESP and Klang Elektronik to name just a few. Since 1996 he is also releasing music on his own label Signum Recordings (and its two sublabels Passiflora and Glam). Maarten's musical vision knows no limits: working in his own studio, he's constantly experimenting and exploring all aspects of (danceable) music, looking for innovation and bringing new angles to it. Due to his experimental vision towards his music, Van Der Vleuten's productions are not mainstream material. As a result of that he has gained more credits from within the \\"underground\\" scene. Or as the database of the Dutch Rock & Pop Institute writes; \\"one of the pioneers of the dutch dance scene\\".

In 1993 the debut album Moonwater by In-Existence was released on the ambient label Apollo Records (Belgium), a subsidiary of R&S; Records. (Musically a mix between Detroit techno and ambient) On Van Der Vleuten's own label Signum Recordings the follow-up was released 1998; Private Rituals. A mix of ambient, worldmusic and classical. Guest musicians that appear on the album are; Edwin Paanakker, Eddie Persijn, Frans Friedrich and Choir Jeroen Bosch. The album Vow of Silence, on Tonefloat, musically referred to the debut with ambient-techno influences. The fourth album ...Of Truth, Eternal Beauty And Nought... again sounded familiar with the ambient-techno influences. The opening track Capezzoli Di Venere is a 45-minute, almost neo-romantic sounding piece of spacious sounds and rhythmic sequences which is quite a contradiction to the extremely dark final title I Have This Pain. The tone has been set and the last In-Existence album De Verkenningen continues with dark, droned sounds. The last track on the album, Vierde Verkenning is used by Dutch contemporary artist Frank Havermans and can be heard inside the art-installation KAPKAR / TT-C2P.

Plomin tablet () is a Glagolitic inscription in Croatian at the outer wall of the church of Saint George in Plomin, modern-day Croatia. Roman god of flora and fauna Silvanus is portrayed. This inscription bears witness of early parallelism of two cultural currents on Istrian territory: Romance symbol is an Antique relief, and Slavic, i.e. Croatian symbol is the Croatian language and Glagolitic script. Reading of the text Above the male figure a two-lined Glagolitic text is inscribed while on the right of the figure another symbol is carved whose meaning is not definitely ascertained. Reading of the text is fairly straightforward: the first line says SE EPIS, and the second line –™L–™S. The sign whose function is questioned by Fuƒçiƒá has been inscribed with significantly deeper furrows and is four times larger than the average size of Glagolitic letters, and for that reason alone one can ask whether it's an indispensable ingredient of the Glagolitic inscription itself, has it been written by the hand of the same scribe and has it been inscribed at the same times as other text. A Glagolitic letter cannot be discerned from it for certainty. Glagolitic inscription on the Plomin tablet. Trying to read both of the lines continuously: SE E PIS–™L–™ S.., i.e. this was written S..., the sentence remains unfinished. Whether the text was written by somebody whose name starts with S or somebody wrote something that starts with S is not known. Since Old Croatian verb pisati meant both \\"to write\\" and \\"to paint\\", it is uncertain whether this verb was used to denote also a sculptural work and concordantly, if Plomin tablet inscription is a signature of the sculptor, or the Glagolitic text some secondarily written graffiti, written by some scribe. Reading of the text introduces some additional phonetic and orthographic difficulties ‚Äî an unusual orthography appears for writing the participle pisal—ä, where on the position of sound /a/ a semivowel '—ä' is written (thus pis—äl—ä instead of pisal—ä). Fuƒçiƒá argues whether it is phonetically possible for the author of this inscription to have mistaken the phonetic value of a semivowel with that of the full vowel /a/, i.e. that he might have replaced the signs due to the similarity of pronunciation. Paleographic analysis Textual reconstruction of the Plomin tablet. General paleographic analysis shows that the rounded Glagolitic is still used, preceding the development of Croatian angular Glagolitic, which dates the monument before the 12-13th century. An analysis of individual graphemes also points to this timeframe: There's the letter S (1, 6, 10) which still has triangular lower element and the letter I (5) which still has triangular upper element, i.e. which has not reduced the ductus the way it can be observed on Vienna Folios. There is also an older type of the letter P (4) with lateral dash. Sign for the semivowel (7, 9) on Plomin tablet is not found on Glagolitic monuments before the 11th century or after the 13th century. Finally, there is a peculiar letter E (2, 3) occurring twice in this inscription and in both attestations demonstrates the same type with two horizontal lines intersecting the vertical hasta. Taking into account the paleographic development of that letter, it can be ascertained that E originally appears with two horizontal lines, which are subsequently reduced to one, which is subsequently reduced to a dot, which is itself finally elided. With the letter E on the Plomin tablet, this development on Croatian Glagolitic areal can be connected with oldest preserved Glagolitic monuments at all: the Kiev Folios, Prague Fragments, and with Macedonian monuments: Codex Assemanius, Ohrid Folios, Euchologium Sinaiticum. All these traits indicate a great antiquity of the monument, which date the Plomin tablet to the 11th century. Perhaps, moreover, a lower limit can be posited in the 10th century, which is a dating held by scientists such as Marija ƒåuniƒá. The relief The relief shows a beardless male figure, clad in short tunic by his knees, tightened at the hips. Costume is Antique, Roman. This was the clothes of slaves, laborers and peasants. Frontal setting of the character with his left arm bended at the elbow in front of the chest, holding some kind of an object, reminding of the pose and the typical gesture of male portraits of Late Antique Roman gravestones stelae, makes the connection of continuity or imitation of this primitive relief to the Late Antique gravestone plastics unambiguous. Although the niche around the figure has been inscribed uncertainly and inconsistently, it points to the impostation of the figure in its own space, typical of plastics of Roman gravestone monuments. General naturalistic tendency also points to Antique as a starting point, which is manifested through the impotence of the artist's expression, especially in the details‚Äîthe \\"scully\\" type of beardless head and the rudiments of the ear shell and barely marked hair. Dating and interpretation If the Glagolitic inscription is dated to the 11th century, than that date is terminus post quem non for the genesis of the relief, i.e. its upper bound. Lower bound is the Late Antique. Between that large range‚Äîfrom Late Antique to Early Romanesque‚Äîit is less probable that this work would have come into existence in the centuries from the 8th to the first half of the 11th century, because in that period the sculptural works used wattle ornaments, a stylistically marked type of creation, a tradition which rules out naturalistic conceptions of human figure. Following this line of thought, Branko Fuƒçiƒá has in 1953, publishing Plomin tablet for the first time, formed an alternative theory according to which the relief > ...should be looked upon as a primitive provincial work of Late Antique > (either pagan or Christian), or as an early Romanesque work, which after the > period of wattle ornamentation reintroduces human figure into sculptural > works. At any case, the connections of monument with the Late Antique > plastics are beyond any doubt. They represent either the very much alive > Antique tradition, or the imitation of the medieval carver of some Antique > template.Branko Fuƒçiƒá, 1963, Izvje≈°taj, o.c. p. 84, \\"...treba gledati ili > primitivno provincijalno djelo rimske kasne antike (bilo poganske bilo > kr≈°ƒáanske) ili plod rane romanike, koja poslije perioda pletera iznova uvodi > u skultpuru ljudski lik. U svakom su sluƒçaju veze s kasnoantiknom plastikom > na njemu nesumnjive. One predstavljaju na tome spomeniku ili jo≈° ≈æivu > antiknu tradiciju ili ugledanje srednjovjekovnog klesara na jedan antikni > predlo≈æak.\\" Reflecting on Fuƒçiƒá's alternative interpretation, academician Ljubo Karaman has laid his arguments, deciding for a medieval origin of the relief.Ljubo Karaman, Starohrvatska prosvjeta III/4,1955; pp. 201-205 Following Karaman's arguments and his own later iconographic studies, FuƒçiƒáBranko Fuƒçiƒá, Sveti Juraj i zeleni Juraj, Zbornik za narodni ≈æivot i obiƒçaje Ju≈ænih Slavena, book 40. (1962), pp 129-‚Äî 150. has voiced an opinion that this figure represents Saint George‚Äîa saint to whom Plomin church is dedicated to. This conclusion was induced by the attribute the Plomin tablet figure hold in his hand. Fuƒçiƒá was unable to identify the object in the (back then) available repertoire of Roman plastics attributes that would match with the attribute of Plomin tablet figure. These were not fork or a fish gig but a three-leaved branch, a symbol of vegetation; it must have been an abbreviation for the conception of vegetation. Christian iconography can interpret that attribute by a palm branch‚Äîof course, in a stylised, non-naturalistic form‚Äîand palm is a symbol of martyrs. Saint George only in the time of Crusades has become an idolized knight, horse-rider, dragon-slayer. In older Christian iconography he is but a messenger of faith and a martyr, and hence the martyr palm would suffice as an adequate attribute. By comparing the Plomin tablet figure with the remains of fresco from the ruinous church of Saint George near Vrbnik on the island of Krk, where this saint is portrayed not with one vegetational attribute but with two (holding one in each hand), Fuƒçiƒá has interpreted this unusual, exceptional iconography as a contamination of the perception of Saint George the martyr (holding a palm in his hand) with a perception of Croatian folk \\"green George\\" (Croatian: zeleni Juraj) which carries spring greenery in his hand.Fuƒçiƒá 1962:138, \\"..do preklapanja i uzajamnog pro≈æimanja dviju predod≈æbi: palme sa zelenom granom, Jurja muƒçenika s Jurjem nosiocem zelenila, svetoga Jurja s folklornim Zelenim Jurjem.\\" In his later work, Fuƒçiƒá concludes that he was a secondary path to a proper solution. Later he summarily describes the problem and solutions as follows: # Neither in the East nor in the West is there any extant artwork of Saint George before the 10th century. # If a carver from the 11th century (to which the Glagolitic inscription is dated) had in mind to display Saint George, it is beyond any doubt that he would have carved the essential saintly attribute, the aureola, which is absent from this monument. # The relief is ‚Äî concordantly ‚Äî older. Fuƒçiƒá argues for his initial dating to the Late Antique period. # Another interpretation becomes apparent, where the Plomin tablet figures represents ancient, antique \\"green George\\", a pagan Silvanus with vegetational attribute in hand, as can be seen in a similar iconography on one antique Istrian relief in the Buzet museum. Glagolitic inscription is, therefore, secondary; it's graffiti. The fact that the relief was embedded in a church wall was conditioned by a subsequent folk reinterpretation, which in the imagery of Silvanus saw a portrait of Saint George, though probably still contaminated with the earlier conception of \\"green George\\".

In 1961 the remaining British Army personnel left Ghana and Major-General S.J.A.

He attained prominence as a judge when he ruled that the South African Government had tampered with the evidence in the case against Jacob Zuma, an act that led to the resignation of the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.  Early life and sporting career  Nicholson was born on 5 February 1945 on a farm near Richmond, Natal, South Africa, and was educated at Michaelhouse and at the University of Natal where he read law. He is a cousin of the brothers Peter and Graeme Pollock who played Test cricket for South Africa, and is a brother to Ravenor Nicholson, another first class cricketer and is also a cousin of the writer Alan Paton. Nicholson represented the South African Universities against North Eastern Transvaal as a right-hand off spin bowler and a left-handed batsman. He took 3 for 58 in the match and batting at number 9, scored a total of 17 runs. By the time Nicholson left university, the question of racial segregation in South African sport had led to South Africa's exclusion from the Olympic Games and in 1968 the English cricket team withdrew from a tour of South Africa due to the South African government's objection to the inclusion of Basil d‚ÄôOliveira, a South African born coloured player who had emigrated to the United Kingdom to play professional cricket. In 1971, leading South African cricketers left the field in a token protest against Apartheid during a match to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of South Africa. In 1973 Nicholson was among the founders of the Aurora Cricket Club ‚Äì a mixed race club that applied for affiliation to the Maritzburg Cricket Union (MCU) and for inclusion in the all-white local cricket league. The club's inclusion in the league was supported by the Natal Cricket Association, and refused to be bullied by intimidatory police tactics such as taking the names of players and spectators ‚Äì after each match the club voluntarily handed the police a list of all players. Legal Resources Centre  In 1979 Nicholson, following on the efforts of Arthur Chaskalson in Johannesburg, founded the Durban chapter of the Legal Resources Centre (LRC) to assist those who could not afford advice or legal representation. One such case was the 1984 challenge he successfully brought against the pass laws, which were intended to restrict \\"idle and undesirable\\" people to rural confines. In another case in 1986 his name was closely associated with Archbishop Denis Hurley's case against the minister of law and order when he turned the internal security laws on their head by challenging the right to detain for purposes of interrogation. By the end of that decade the challenge had begun to take its toll. Exhausted, and diagnosed with Chronic fatigue syndrome, Nicholson resigned from his position at the LRC and took up a lecturing post at the Durban campus of the University of Natal where he taught evidence, civil procedure and professional practice. The slower pace of life in academia allowed him to spend time following his other pursuits ‚Äì music and sport and to recover his health. Advocate and judge In the early 1990s he left the university and took silk, enabling him to become a judge. He was appointed to the bench in 1995, one of the first in post-Apartheid South Africa. He was later appointed to the Labour Appeal Court, and later became senior judge on the Natal bench. In 2006 he found the government to be in contempt of court over the provision of antiretrovirals for prisoners at Westville Prison and in mid-2008 he ruled against the Erasmus Commission, set up by Ebrahim Rasool to probe allegations of bribery in the City of Cape Town, finding that the former premier had abused his provincial powers. Jacob Zuma was the deputy president of South Africa, leader of the African National Congress and poised to succeed Thabo Mbeki as President of South Africa. He was dismissed as deputy president by Mbeki in June 2005 when his financial advisor Schabir Shaik, was convicted of corruption and fraud. Zuma was subsequently charged with corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority. On 28 December 2007, after various procedural delays the Scorpions (A government anti-corrpution and anti-fraud investigation branch) served Zuma an indictment to stand trial in the High Court on various counts of racketeering, money laundering, corruption and fraud. Zuma appealed against the charges and on 12 September 2008 Nicholson held that Zuma's corruption charges were unlawful on procedural grounds. In his judgment Nicholson also wrote that he believed that there was political interference in the timing of the charges being brought against Zuma. Although this was initially denied by Mbeki, Mbeki was forced to resign on 20 September 2008. Nicholson's ruling dismissing the charges against Zuma was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal, in a ruling which was critical of Nicholson's judgement in the case, including his addition of personal opinions to the ruling, and of including \\"gratuitous findings\\" about Mbeki and others in his judgement. After Nicholson retired, he headed a committee appointed by Fikile Mbalula, South African Sport and Recreation Minister that investigated the affairs of the South Africa's national cricketing body Cricket South Africa (CSA). The investigation was triggered by a report from KPMG, the federation's auditor that a bonus of R4.5 million (about GBP 400,000 or $700,000) had been paid to CSA's chief executive Gerald Majola without the knowledge of the federation's remuneration committee. The commission found that Majola had breached the South African Companies Act at least four times and recommended that both the SCA and the South African Revenue Service should consider taking further action. The commission also recommended a restructuring of CSA's structure.

Overview The PP-91 is a simply designed, easy to manufacture selective fire submachine gun designed by Yevgeny Dragunov (the designer of the SVD sniper rifle). It is blowback operated and fires from a closed bolt, allowing for more accurate shooting than would be possible from an open bolt design. Ammunition is fed from a double column box magazine and it is supplied with folding shoulder stock. Constructed from stamped sheet steel, it weighs in near 1.57 kg. The safety/selector lever is located on the right hand side and allows for semi-automatic single shots and fully automatic fire at the rate of 800 rounds per minute. The effective range of the PP-91 is between 50-100m. The weapon uses a diopter sight and allows for the use of a laser sight and a suppressor.

The team is based in Wenatchee, Washington. The team was established in 2000 by owner Jim Corcoran and has played its home games at Paul Thomas Sr. Field on the campus of Wenatchee Valley College. Asst. GM Ken Osborne became a stockholder in 2008. Corcoran and Osborne sold the team to retired Microsoft executive Jose Oglesby in 2018, with Osborne being appointed COO/GM. Team history =2000‚Äì2013= The AppleSox began play in 2000 and joined the Pacific International League. The AppleSox marked the return of baseball to the Wenatchee Valley for the first time since the Wenatchee Chiefs suspended operations after the 1965 season. The AppleSox were a member of the PIL until 2004, when the team left the league to become a charter member of the West Coast League. The team won the PIL Championship in 2003 and has won five WCL Championships in the league's history, including back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. =2014= The 2014 season marked the first year that the AppleSox did not make the WCL Playoffs. The team was 30‚Äì24 in regular-season play. As the season concluded, Sox head coach, Ed Knaggs stepped down and AJ Proszek was selected to replace him, making Proszek the 3rd head coach all-time for the AppleSox. Proszek was a pitching coach for Wenatchee in 2013 and 2014. The changing of the coaching reins put an end to a 14-year run for Knaggs as the head coach in Wenatchee. He also had previously coached 22 seasons at Wenatchee High School. =2015‚Äì2016= The AppleSox went 43‚Äì65 over the next two WCL seasons, and were unable to reach the WCL postseason. The AppleSox did feature two of the more prolific hitters in WCL history in each of the 2015 season and 2016 seasons. Keston Hiura, an outfielder from UC Irvine, set WCL records with 33 extra-base hits, 119 total bases, and 6 triples. Michael Toglia (2016) became the third AppleSox player to win league MVP, joining Mitchell Gunsolus (2012) and Steve Marquardt (2005). He hit .306 and led the WCL with 7 home runs. At the end of the 2016 season, A J Proszek announced that he would not return for a third season as the team's head coach. The AppleSox hired Kyle Krustangel just over a month later, on September 14, 2016. The current head coach of Yakima Valley Community College is the fourth all-time head coach of the AppleSox. Ballpark traditions =Kid's choir= AppleSox games feature a special seventh-inning stretch. Local kids are invited out to the mound with the team's mascot, \\"Coyote\\", to sing \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\". =Strikeout socks= The AppleSox hang embroidered socks from a clothesline on the press box, each time their pitcher strikes out an opposing batter. Various prizes have been given away to fans when the AppleSox strike out a specified number of opposing hitters. =Race the Coyote= Long-time AppleSox mascot Coyote rounds the bases each night in a race against an AppleSox youngster. He still hasn't beaten any kids in the daily race, but has accumulated a few wins on various \\"Mascot\\" nights over the years, when he races other local mascots instead of children. =Section 'A'= The fans at Paul Thomas Sr. Field take a special liking each year to the AppleSox first base-coach, giving him a loud ovation each time he jogs to the coaches box. The tradition began with the fans in section A along the first baseline in 2006 and has spread across the entire stadium.

She served as a lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Queen Dorothea of Denmark from 1559‚Äì72 and is known to have been the love interest of Frederick II, who famously wished to marry her. Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon kvinfo.dk (in Danish)  Biography  Of high nobility, Anne was the daughter of Corfitz Eriksen of Hardenberg and Mette Christiernsdatter Skram. She was introduced at court, where she was named hofdame (maid-of-honor) to queen Dorothea in 1559. Anne first got to know Frederick II, Queen Dorothea's eldest son, when he was a Crown Prince. He fell in love with her and wanted to marry her. However, a marriage was already planned between her and Oluf Mouritsen Krognos, (1535‚Äì1573) Chancellor of the Realm (rigsr√•d, in Danish). When Frederick assumed the throne of Denmark in 1559 at the age of 25, he attempted once more to marry Anne. Frederick's desire to marry a non-royal was met with widespread opposition. The nobility and the king's advisors believed it an imprudent match, as it might incite jealousy and accusations of favoritism among relatives and other court families. It is not known how Anne Hardenberg herself felt about the king, but she, too, advised Frederick against the marriage. Anne Hardeberg was never a mistress of the king, as they are not known to ever have had intercourse. Finally, in 1571, at age 37 the king relented and was betrothed instead to his 14-year-old first half-cousin Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. He apparently wished for his first love to approve of the match before going through with the betrothal, as he organized a meeting between himself, his future mother-in-law, the Duchess Elizabeth, and Anne. After the meeting, Anne wrote to her close friend, Birgitte G√∏ye, \\"God knows I am so happy and calm in my heart as I have not been in many years.\\" Shortly after the royal marriage, Anne of Hardenberg married her old suitor, Oluf Krognos.

In 1964 he came third in the French students' championship in his home town. The winner was Jean-Marie Leblanc,Sainz, Bernard (2000), Les Stup√©fiantes R√©v√©lations du Dr Mabuse, J C Latt√®s, France, p44 who became a professional and then organiser of the Tour de France. He stopped racing after crashing in a motor-paced race on the velodrome at Grenoble Sainz first consulted a homeopathic doctor in 1956 after persistent sinusitis. Sainz said: Sainz says he studied for three years at the homeopathic school of St Jacques in Paris and at the national homeopathy centre, from which he said he qualified with the praise of the examiners.Sainz, Bernard (2000), Les Stup√©fiantes R√©v√©lations du Dr Mabuse, J C Latt√®s, France, p50 He has always insisted that he practised homeopathy in treating racing cyclists. He accepts in his biography that his qualifications in homeopathy and acupuncture are not recognised in France. Horse racing Bernard Sainz came to notice at horse racing tracks. In 1988 one of his three- year-olds, Soft Machine, caused a surprise by winning a big race three days after losing an unimportant one for which he had been favourite.Sports, 11 May 99 The suspicion was that Sainz had doped the horse to run faster, but nothing was found. Sainz said: It was the training that he gave horses and the instructions that he gave his jockeys, he said in his autobiography, that made his horse successful. Sainz said he was surprised, with his cycling background, to see how lightly horses were trained. The accepted theory was that a horse should race and then rest for 18 days. It was around this time that Sainz acquired the nickname Dr Mabuse, after the villain in a series of German books and films. Sainz was questioned in an inquiry into possible doping of horses.The New Zealand Herald, 12.08,2005 by Catherine Field, Racing: Arrests in French doping case Horse-racing, Sainz said, was an area where he had made few friends and which didn't lack dangerous people.Sainz, Bernard (2000), Les Stup√©fiantes R√©v√©lations du Dr Mabuse, J C Latt√®s, France, p172 Cycling Bernard Sainz returned to cycling in 1972, joining the Mercier team when Louis Caput replaced Antonin Magne as manager. Caput approached Edmond Mercier, the bicycle-maker behind Poulidor's team, and asked to bring Sainz into the team management. Mercier agreed, said Sainz, because he was already treating Mercier for his own health problems. Mercier had also brought in the insurance company, GAN, as main sponsor. GAN, said Sainz, wanted Raymond Poulidor, who had said the previous year that he would not race any more. Sainz said: Sainz continued: In Paris‚ÄìNice, the first important stage race of the season, Poulidor was 22 seconds behind Eddy Merckx on the morning of the last day. Poulidor attacked from the start, setting a speed record on the col de la Turbie that stood for more than 10 years and won Paris‚ÄìNice by two seconds. Next year he won Paris‚ÄìNice again and also the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©. Sainz also treated Cyrille Guimard when pain in his knees was threatening his lead in the Tour de France. The two had met three years earlier. Sainz kept Guimard in the Tour even though the rider had sometimes to be carried from his bicycle. Sainz said: In 1986 he was cleared in an investigation into the trading of amphetamine at the Paris six-day race. He was questioned about illegal practice of medicine and held for two months in 1999. In 2002 police stopped him for speeding and driving without insuranceHighbeam, Cycling: Sainz held in jail on drugs charges on the E17 autoroute in Belgium and found homeopathic medicines in his car. He told police he had been to see the Belgian cyclist, Frank Vandenbroucke. They went to see Vandenbroucke and found EPO, morphine and clenbuterol. Vandenbroucke claimed they were for his dog.\\"Vandenbroucke ‚Äì where to from here?\\" CyclingNews, March 2, 2002 The investigation brought out other names, such as Philippe Gaumont, who rode with Vandenbroucke at Cofidis and Yvon Ledanois of another team, Fran√ßaise des Jeux. Gaumont said Sainz gave them only homeopathic treatments. Vandenbroucke said he was naive but not dishonest in using Sainz, but that he was impressed at his results.Cycling News, 13 July 2000, The Sainz doping affair fizzlesFrank Vandenbroucke On release from jail in Belgium, Sainz was re-arrested in France for breaking conditions imposed on him in 1999 to keep him away from the sport.Doping guru Sainz denied bail by French court, http://www.velonews.com/article/1914 Ten used syringes were found in Sainz's office and he was accused of possessing and administering testosterone and corticoids. Sainz said the testosterone was to increase his sexual performance and the corticoids for treating horses. The case was dropped. Vandenbroucke, however, held a news conference in Ploegsteert, Belgium, to say he had always thought Sainz gave him homeopathic products but that he had doubts. He said Sainz had given him drops and injections. He said: > He (Sainz) said to me that they were completely legal homeopathic products. > I wanted to trust him ... I was under the charm of Dr Mabuse. I may be > considered naive but I am not a dishonest person. I want to believe that Mr > Sainz only gave homeopathic care. I trusted him.

Sainz said: :I have concerned myself with him since autumn 1998. Not, as has been claimed, to get him doping products. Everybody knows perfectly, starting with the policemen who have listened to me for a long time, that riders don't need me for that sort of thing. To the contrary. If they turn to me, it's because they've heard of what I have been able to do [mes comp√©tences diverses] for the great stars I have cited.Sainz, Bernard (2000), Les Stup√©fiantes R√©v√©lations du Dr Mabuse, J C Lattes, France p232 The investigation that surrounded the Vandenbroucke inquiry linked Sainz to 51 athletes, of whom 33 were cyclists and others football players.Eindhovens Dagblad, Holland, 11 May 1999 'Dr' Mabuse Sainz's standing in cycling has frequently awarded him the title \\"doctor\\". The sports daily, L'√âquipe spoke of how \\"Dr Bernard Sainz looked after the health of Louis Caput's team.\\" Three days later it repeated the title in writing of Cyrille Guimard. In 1975 Nord √âclair referred to Sainz as having \\"had several years of medicine and looks after the medical cares of riders.\\" As Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard pointed out: \\"In fact, the good Bernard did zero years of medicine.\\" In the same year, L'√âquipe wrote \\"Dr Sainz of the GAN team will probably join Gitane.\\" Joop Zoetemelk refers to Sainz as \\"doctor\\" in a biography and so does Erwann Menth√©our, another former rider.Pagnoud, G. (1980) Zoetemelk, La Prochaine √âtape, Solar, France, p11 Menth√©our said: :I called the man whom all riders call when they have a problem: Dr Mabuse. For more than 30 years, the good doctor has been a central personality in the cycling world... and in horse- racing! He 'cares for' [soigne] men and horses without distinction, improving their performances with an efficiency universally recognised. A former amateur rider of talent, Mabuse looks after riders by love and horses by interest. My father calls him 'God' because of the fascination he exerts on those who approach him. But despite his powers, which are enormous, Mabuse has none of the exterior signs of a guru. The real power is inside. Everybody recognises his massive but discreet silhouette beside finish lines. He is seen but never mentioned. Jail On 11 April 2008, the high court in Paris condemned Sainz to three years in prison, the first half without release and the second on probationary freedom. He was accused of administering doping products to athletes and practising medicine without a licence. He produced no evidence of medical training at his trial.

Based on Sarif's 2008 novel of the same name, the film tells the story of a London-based Jordanian of Palestinian descent, Tala, who is preparing for an elaborate wedding when a turn of events causes her to have an affair, and subsequently fall in love, with another woman, Leyla, a British Indian. The film stars Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth. I Can't Think Straight was produced by Enlightenment Productions and distributed in the United States by Regent Releasing and Here! Films. It was released in different regions between 2008 and 2009. The DVD was released on 4 May 2009. The lead actresses, Ray and Sheth, also starred in Sarif's 2007 lesbian-themed historical drama film The World Unseen. Plot In the upper echelons of traditional Middle Eastern society, wealthy Christian Palestinians Reema and Omar prepare for the marriage of their visiting daughter Tala to Hani in Jordan. But back at work in London, Tala encounters Leyla, a young British Indian Muslim woman who is dating Tala's best friend Ali. Tala sees something unique in the artless, clumsy, sensitive Leyla who secretly works to become a writer. And Tala's forthright challenges to Leyla's beliefs begins a journey of self-awareness for Leyla. After a weekend getaway into the countryside, Tala and Leyla sleep together and the two women begin to fall in love. However, Tala's own sense of duty and cultural restraint cause her to pull away from Leyla and fly back to Jordan where the preparations for an ostentatious wedding are well under way. As family members descend and the wedding day approaches, the pressure mounts until Tala finally cracks and extricates herself. Back in London, Leyla is heartbroken but learns to break free of her own self-doubt and her mother's expectations, ditching Ali and being honest with her parents about her sexuality. When Ali and Leyla's feisty sister, Yasmin, help try to get Tala and Leyla together again, Tala finds that her own preconceptions of what love can be is the final hurdle she must jump to win Leyla back.

The zip code is 38391. Although it was once a thriving farming community, a combination of man-made and natural disasters has reduced Denmark to a few remaining houses as well as the historic antebellum Denmark Presbyterian Church.  History  Denmark was one of the first-settled places in Madison County; the land on which it was incorporated in 1854 was opened by Thomas Sanders in 1822. Presbyterian and Methodist churches were established in the area in 1833 and 1842. By January 1844, the community had been sufficiently populated that an academy was incorporated by the Tennessee General Assembly.\\"Chapter LXXXVI: An act to incorporate the Denmark male academy in the county of Madison,\\" in Acts Passed at the First Session of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee 1843‚Äì44.

During the American Civil War, Union soldiers repulsed a Confederate raid near Denmark in the Battle of Britton's Lane in September 1861. Following the Civil War, Denmark's economy experienced a pronounced decline after being bypassed by all of the railroads built through Madison County. Although its population was about 250 in 1886, Denmark's population declined such that its municipal charter was revoked on 28 April 1983 by a chancery court order after the Tennessee legislature passed a statute providing for the forfeiting of charters of any city with a population under 100.\\"Part 3: Forfeiture of Charter: 6-52-301 through 6-52-304\\" Tennessee Code Annotated, Volume 2B, 2011 Replacement.

The local middle school was disestablished and its campus became the West Tennessee Regional Training Center. Denmark Elementary is the community's only remaining school. =Destructive weather= Denmark's repeated weather catastrophes have historically contributed to the community's decline.

As a sophomore, he suffered a season-ending back injury after starting the first three games, finishing with 2 receptions for 36 yards. As a junior, he appeared in 10 games, making 10 receptions for 216 yards. Although he only had 13 receptions going into his senior year, he would start 14 games at wide receiver for the 1997 football team that compiled a 12-2 record, won the Big Sky Conference title and advanced to the semifinals of the Division I-AA playoffs.

In the regular season, he usually was the team's fifth receiver and played mostly on special teams, making 10 tackles (tied for sixth on the team). In 1999, he returned 12 kickoffs for a 21-yard average and made five special teams tackles. In 2000, he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe, where he ranked fifth in the league with 44 receptions for 635 yards, despite missing the last two games with a sprained right foot. He also had 7 touchdowns, while helping the team finish with the league's best record (7-3) and winning World Bowl 2000. He returned to the Cowboys with a sprained foot and later injured the left one, which caused him to miss most of training camp. On August 22, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a seventh round draft choice, which the team later used to select Pete Hunter. =Miami Dolphins= In 2000, he reunited with offensive coordinator Chan Gailey, who was his head coach with the Dallas Cowboys and also found a niche as a returner. Against the Green Bay Packers, he returned a punt for an 81-yard touchdown, the third-longest punt return in team history. He also finished the season with a league leading and franchise single-season record 17-yard punt return average. In 2001, his 11.8-yard punt return average ranked eighth in the NFL. On September 1, 2002, he was waived after being passed on the depth chart by Albert Johnson. He left as the Dolphins' all-time team leader in punt return average (13.7-yard) and third all-time in punt return yards (700 yards). =Baltimore Ravens= On September 10, 2002, he was signed as a free agent by the Baltimore Ravens to play on special teams. He appeared in 3 games and was declared inactive in 10, while sharing punt return duties with Chris McAlister. He wasn't re-signed at the end of the season. Ogden's most productive season as a wide receiver was in 1999, when he caught 12 passes for 144 yards in 10 games. He caught his only touchdown reception in 2001. He ended his professional career playing in 67 games, registering 28 receptions for 304 yards and one touchdown. Personal life He owns a fitness club. He was an assistant coach in NFL Europe and at Duquesne University. Ogden appeared in seasons 7 and 8 of the Bravo show The Millionaire Matchmaker, where he sought a date.

Cornutus was of Roman, Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian and Persian ancestry.

Cornutus along with his mother, maternal uncle Gaius Plancius Varus and his maternal relatives were among the last known descendants of the Herodian Dynasty. He appeared to be an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that Cornutus attempted to exert influence on Judean Politics. He was born and raised in Perga, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia. In the Agora in Perga, the local government in Perga had dedicated and honored Cornutus with an inscription on a statue base. This inscription honors Cornutus and his family. Cornutus and his ancestors are highly praised as the benefactors of Perga and the inscription states how lawful, considerable and rewarding citizens they were.

There were sixteen fatalities‚Äîall nine people on board and seven people on the ground died. The plane was carrying Mexican Secretary of the Interior Juan Camilo Mouri√±o.news.bbc.co.uk, BBC Profile: Juan Camilo Mourino The plane crashed in rush-hour traffic close to the intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and the Anillo Perif√©rico, in the Las Lomas residential and business district. During its approach to Mexico City International Airport, the plane followed a Boeing 767 too closely and encountered wake turbulence which caused it to invert into a nose-down position. The pilots were able to reduce the angle of descent but due to excessive speed and insufficient altitude were unable to regain control of the aircraft. The plane crashed into a building, exploding on impact. Details alt=Learjet 45 flying, landing gear is out The Secretariat of the Interior-owned Learjet 45 (registration XC-VMC) left Ponciano Arriaga International Airport in San Luis Potos√≠ and was short of landing at Mexico City International Airport when it crashed. The crash occurred at 18:45 in the middle of rush-hour traffic of the financial district causing an explosion whose flames \\"reached higher than the buildings\\". According to Secretary of Communications and Transport Luis T√©llez, there were no survivors. T√©llez also stated that the crash appeared to be an accident. The crash set multiple cars and a newsstand on fire and injured at least 40 people. Body parts were reported to be scattered around the wreckage. Deaths Among the dead was Secretary of the Interior Juan Camilo Mouri√±o, top aide to President Felipe Calder√≥n and Jos√© Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, former assistant attorney general.  Government response alt= After the crash, President Felipe Calder√≥n addressed the nation live on national television. He spoke of Mouri√±o as one of his closest friends and collaborators and conveyed his condolences to the family. He stated that Mouri√±o was a man who always fought to make Mexico a better country and he guaranteed the nation that there would be an investigation into the causes behind the plane crash. Calder√≥n encouraged Mexican men and women to continue fighting for a better country no matter how difficult or painful any event may be. Marcelo Ebrard, Head of Government of the Federal District, also conveyed his condolences to Mouri√±o's family assured that Mexico City's government would issue a statement to the nation regarding the issue. Ebrard later said that the Mexico City government would give financial aid to all of the injured receiving medical care, irrespective of whether they had been admitted to private or public hospitals. He also said that the local authorities had handed over all recordings taken by surveillance video cameras to the federal attorney general, along with all witness accounts that local police gathered. Several other political figures made statements regarding the crash, including various senators from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Germ√°n Mart√≠nez, leader of the ruling National Action Party. A group of senators from different political parties asked the Attorney General of Mexico to investigate the accident.  Results of investigation The jet's black boxes were sent to the United States for analysis. Information gathered from 38 minutes of cabin conversations, along with video footage from a security camera on top of the Omega Office Building, provided evidence for an official statement by the Mexican government that the crash was the result of pilot error. The Learjet was ruled to have been flying too close to a Boeing 767-300ER operated by Mexicana and as a result suffered violent wake turbulence caused by the larger jet. The minimum allowable distance for a lighter plane following behind a heavier plane is ; the Learjet was only behind the Mexicana plane. alt=Corner of glass office building with several windows boarded up Investigations into the accident discovered several issues with the Mexican government's use of private contractors as pilots of government aircraft. Several key elements of the accident have emerged during the investigation: * Pilot Mart√≠n Ol√≠va and co-pilot √Ålvaro S√°nchez, were not certified to operate the Learjet 45. The investigation concluded that both pilots had received fraudulent certifications: Captain Ol√≠va lied about the number of training flights he had made, and had issues on the few training flights he did complete, while Captain S√°nchez lied about being a Learjet 45 instructor. Both men had taken advantage of a corrupt system to get false training documents and some unsigned Learjet 45 certification forms from their flight schools. These revelations led Mexican authorities to suspend the licences of both flight schools. * The descent profile showed that the improperly trained pilots approached the airport with an inconsistent descent angle. The plane descended rapidly and then leveled off in a stepped approach to the airport. The plane did not slow down to the required speed dictated by the air traffic controller, which brought the plane closer to the Mexicana 767-300. * Conversation among the flight crew further indicates that they had little familiarity with the operation of the plane; they voiced confusion on several occasions about the cockpit instruments and failed to enter the proper information into the flight computers, did not follow a proper flight plan, and had navigational difficulties, missing their original arrival to San Luis Potos√≠ by over . Further, their in-flight conversations were more of the nature of people driving a car, not of trained pilots following a proper flight plan. * The flight crew waited over a minute to follow the order from air traffic control to reduce their speed. The Learjet had been traveling at , while the Mexicana 767-300 was flying at ; this caused the Learjet to get too close to the 767-300. *The accident happened during peak hours at the airport with heavy air traffic, which called into question the handling and scheduling of flight plans for top government officials. * The accident happened just at the point where aircraft entering Mexico City traveling on a 170¬∞ course (south-southeast) makes a sharp left turn to align with the runways of Benito Ju√°rez International Airport at 53¬∞ (northeast). When the Learjet reached the turning point, too close behind the Mexicana 767-300, and making a step descent that dropped it through the violent wake turbulence, it caused the plane to invert into a nose-down attitude. At this point, the plane was within over the ground, limiting their room to enact a recovery. * The weather at the time of the accident was calm, which sustained the wake turbulence. * Due to the flight crew being unqualified for the plane, when faced with the conditions regarding the airspeed, inverted nose-down position, and insufficient altitude, they were unable to regain control of the plane. Though it was too late to make any difference, and too marginal to be meaningful, the flight crew did manage to reduce the angle of descent from 45¬∞ to 40¬∞ before hitting the ground at over .

He is best known as the older friend of Pliny the Younger, with whom Cornutus was suffect consul for the nundinium of September to October 100.  Family  How Cornutus is related to other known Romans of his time is unclear. Older authorities note that the one inscription that preserves his full name = ILS 1024 is missing the middle of the relevant line, and conclude from the name of his son, Gaius Julius Plancius Varus Cornutus, that Cornutus' full name may be Gaius Julius Plancius Varus Cornutus Tertullus. This would imply that he is somehow related to Marcus Plancius Varus, a citizen of Perga, who was proconsular governor of Bithynia and Pontus.Shelagh Jameson, \\"Cornutus Tertullus and the Plancii of Perge\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 55 (1965), pp. 54-58 Further, at least one authority believes Cornutus is the father of Julia Tertulla.Brian W. Jones, The Emperor Domitian (London: Routledge, 1992), p. 176 However, Julia Tertulla married Lucius Julius Marinus Caecilius Simplex, who was suffect consul in 101, which indicates either Julia was married at a very young age, or would be better considered Cornutus' sister. Further, Olli Salomies reports an unpublished inscription that proves Cornutus' wife was Plancia Magna (which explains how that element entered their son's name), and the full name of their son.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), pp. 65f  Senatorial career  His career can be reconstructed from an inscription found in Tuscany. There is no information about which board Cornutus Tertullus served on as a member of the vigintiviri, so it may be possible he missed that office in his cursus honorum. The first office Cornutus is recorded as holding was urban quaestor, which was followed by aedile as he proceeded through the traditional republican magistracies, before being adlected as a praetor by Vespasian and Titus, likely during their censorship of AD 73/74. The specific reason that Cornutus received this promotion is not recorded; examining the evidence, George W. Houston could find no evidence of how he aided the Flavian cause during the Year of Four Emperors or the following year.Houston, \\"Vespasian's Adlection of Men in Senatum\\", American Journal of Philology, 98 (1977), p. 62 One must be content with Suetonius' report that Vespasian found the Senate \\"weakened by frequent murders and longstanding neglect\\" and convinced that Cornutus was one of \\"the most eligible Italian and provincial candidates available.\\"Suetonius, \\"Vita divus Vespasianus\\", 9.2 With praetorian rank, Cornutus held two further offices, first as legate to the proconsular governor of Crete and Cyrenaica, then as governor of the public province of Gallia Narbonensis.The date of this office is unknown; Werner Eck dates it to the reigns of Vespasian or Domitian. (\\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron 13 (1983), p. 200) A gap of roughly twenty years follows. Cornutus could have quickly served in both of the offices mentioned during the reign of Vespasian, who died in the year 79; the next office Cornutus held was prefect of the aerarium Saturni from 98 to 100, with the Younger Pliny as his colleague.Date taken from Mireille Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare; Administration et prosopographie s√©natoriale, Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 24 (Rome: √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1974), pp. 119-131 This gap spans the reign of Domitian. It is possible that Cornutus was out of favor with this suspicious Emperor, but Pliny supplies the answer: in his Panegyric to Trajan, Pliny notes that Cornutus declined to promote himself to the Emperor, thus refusing to hold offices during that Emperor's reign.Panegyric, 90,6 After Cornutus completed his service at the aerarium Saturni, he advanced to the office of suffect consul, which he also held with Pliny. Following this, Pliny's letters show that Cornutus was active in the Senate, taking part in the trial of Marius Priscus for mismanagement while proconsul of Africa,Epistulae, II.11.19, 12.2f and defending Publicius Certus when Pliny prosecuted the former delator or informer.Epistulae, IX.13.15 He was appointed curator Via Aemilia, an achievement Pliny excitedly reported to his friend Paternus the moment he learns of it.Epistulae, IV.14 After this, Cornutus was tasked with conducting a census in Gallia Aquitania, which was followed with governorship of Bithynia and Pontus between 112 and 115.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 353-358 The acme of his career was when Cornutus was proconsular governor of Asia in 116/117.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", (1982), pp. 361f The date of his death is unknown. If we assume Cornutus was around 30 when adlected as praetor (the legal age one held that magistracy) in 73/74, he would have been in his seventies when he concluded his term in Roman Asia, so it is likely Cornutus died not long after that.

Hockey teams from various age groups and levels compete here from the end of September to the end of March; including the Delhi Travellers minor league hockey team and the Delhi Rockets hockey team for children. There is a baseball field complete with a concession stand located just outside the premises for summer time diversions in addition to an outdoor swimming pool, known locally as the Delhi Kinsmen Pool. With the help of local sponsors, Delhi Minor Baseball coordinates the fielding of baseball teams from ages 4 to 18. From the 1920s to the mid 1940s Delhi fielded many of the best baseball teams in Norfolk County. Baseball (hardball) waned for a number of years thereafter, and through the 1970s into the 1980s, Delhi youth switched to playing fastball. In subsequent years many who played baseball and fastball organized themselves to create a recreational adult Slo-Pitch league. This Slo-Pitch league is made up of Delhi teams sponsored by local businesses. These teams play against each other throughout the year and have a yearend championship tournament in September.

Due to its purported properties as an antiseptic, cough reliever, and expectorant, it has been used in traditional herbal medicine. Description Hyssop is a brightly coloured shrub or subshrub that ranges from in height. The stem is woody at the base, from which grow a number of upright branches. Its leaves are lanceolate, dark green, and from long. During the summer, hyssop produces pink, blue, or, more rarely, white fragrant flowers. These give rise to small oblong achenes. History A plant called hyssop has been in use since classical antiquity. Its name is a direct adaptation from the Greek ·ΩïœÉœÉœâœÄŒøœÇ (hyssopos). The Hebrew word ◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊ë (ezov, esov, or esob) and the Greek word ·ΩïœÉœÉœâœÄŒøœÇ probably share a common (but unknown) origin.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1989, s.v. hyssop The name hyssop appears as a translation of ezov in some translations of the Bible, notably in : \\"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean\\", but researchers have suggested that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop but rather to one of a number of different herbs, including Origanum syriacum (Syrian oregano, commonly referred to as \\"bible hyssop\\").Based on the Judeo-Arabic translation of the word in the works of Rabbi Saadia Gaon (in his Tafsir, a translation of the Pentateuch, Exo. 12:22), David ben Abraham al-Fasi (in his Hebrew-Arabic Dictionary of the Bible, known as \`KitƒÅb JƒÅmi ø al-AlfƒÅ·∫ì\`, vol. 1, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊ë), Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah (Sefer HaShorashim - Book of the Roots, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ë - aleph, zayn, bet), Maimonides (in his Mishnah Commentary, Nega'im 14:6) and Nathan ben Abraham I in Mishnah Uktzin 2:2. The problems with identification arise from Jewish oral tradition where it expressly prohibits Greek hyssop, and where the biblical plant is said to have been identical to the Arabic word, zaatar (Origanum syriacum), and which word is not to be associated with other ezobs that often bear an additional epithet, such as zaatar farsi = Persian-hyssop (Thymbra capitata) and zaatar rumi = Roman-hyssop (Satureja thymbra). See: The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Negai'im 14:6 (p. 696); Parah 11:7 [10:7] (p. 711). mentions that 'ezov' was a small plant and some scholars believe it was a wall plant. It was burned with the Red Heifer () and used for purification of lepers (, ; ), and at Passover it was used to sprinkle the blood of the sacrificial lamb on the doorposts (). A sponge attached to a hyssop branch was used to give Jesus on the cross a drink of vinegar. Suggestions abound for the modern day correlation of biblical hyssop ranging from a wall plant like moss or fern, to widely used culinary herbs like thyme, rosemary or marjoram. Another suggestion is the caper plant which is known to grow in the rocky soils of the region and along walls. Hyssop was also used for purgation (religious purification) in Egypt, where, according to Chaeremon the Stoic, the priests used to eat it with bread in order to purify this type of food and make it suitable for their austere diet.From Chaeremon's History of Egypt, as quoted by Porphyry, De Abstinentia IV.6.9. Cultivation Hyssop is resistant to drought, and tolerant of chalky, sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and warm climates. Cultivars include 'Blue Flower'. Harvest Under optimal weather conditions, herb hyssop is harvested twice yearly, once at the end of spring and once more at the beginning of the fall. The plants are preferably harvested when flowering in order to collect the flowering tips. Once the stalks are cut, they are collected and dried either stacked on pallets to allow for draining or hung to dry. The actual drying process takes place in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area, where the materials are mixed several times to ensure even drying. Drying herbs are kept from exposure to the sun to prevent discoloration and oxidation. The drying process takes approximately six days in its entirety. Once dried, the leaves are removed and both components, leaves and flowers, are chopped finely. The final dried product weighs a third of the initial fresh weight and can be stored for up to 18 months. Essential oil The essential oil includes the chemicals thujone and phenol, which give it antiseptic properties., p 177. Its high concentrations of thujone and chemicals that stimulate the central nervous system, including pinocamphone and cineole, can provoke epileptic reactions. The oil of hyssop can cause seizures and even low doses (2‚Äì3 drops) can cause convulsions in children.Hyssop, WebMD Uses =Culinary= The fresh herb is commonly used in cooking. Za'atar is a famous Middle Eastern herbal mixture, some versions of which include dried Hyssop leaves. Essence of hyssop can be obtained by steaming, and is used in cooking to a lesser extent. The plant is commonly used by beekeepers to produce nectar from which Western Honey Bees make a rich and aromatic honey. Herb hyssop leaves are used as an aromatic condiment. The leaves have a lightly bitter taste due to its tannins, and an intense minty aroma. Due to its intensity, it is used moderately in cooking. The herb is also used to flavor liqueur, and is part of the official formulation of Chartreuse. It is also a key ingredient in many formulations of absinthe, where it is the main source of the green colour. =Herbal medicine= In herbal medicine hyssop is believed to have soothing, expectorant, and cough suppressant properties. Hyssop has been used for centuries in traditional medicine in order to increase circulation and to treat multiple conditions such as coughing and sore throat. Hyssop can stimulate the gastrointestinal system.

Plot George McCaffrey cannot understand why his long-ago philosophy professor told him to pick another field of study. But that professor, John Robert Rozanov, is returning to Ennistone where George lives, giving George the chance to ask him and finally understand. John Robert, the only famous person to have originated from Ennistone, will have none of it, simply telling George \\"you weren't good enough\\" and bringing the conversation to a close as quickly as he can, given George's desperate attempts to continue. John Robert has returned to Ennistone for an entirely different purpose, indeed one that disincentivizes further effort at socially graceful tolerance of George's neuroses. As a part of that purpose, John Robert wishes to arrange the future of his granddaughter Hattie Meynell, without her knowledge, by encouraging Tom McCaffrey, George's younger step brother, to woo Hattie, and then to marry her. But during their first meeting, when Tom clumsily let's on that his meeting request was not entirely the result of his own initiative and interest in Hattie, she reacts with hurt and anger. Through a sequence of plot twists, Tom finds himself trapped deep beneath the spa for which Ennistone is famous. As in many Murdoch novels, this physical struggle for survival parallels the characters' struggle to resolve their complex, interwoven emotional issues.

As its title indicates, the novel is a volume in the ever-growing literature on the Land of Oz, written by L. Frank Baum and many successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. Synopsis Temporally, Shanower places his novel at the end of the twentieth century; he takes up the story of Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, the surrogate parents of Dorothy Gale. In his sixth Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, Baum had brought the two characters from the mundane world of Kansas to the Emerald City, where they enjoyed a blissful retirement. At the start of The Giant Garden of Oz, the couple, \\"after eighty- some years of a life of luxury,\\" have decided to return to farming. (Inhabitants of Oz do not age, unless they want to.) They have acquired a small farm in the Munchkin Country; with magical aids designed by the Wizard of Oz, their farm labor is much less demanding than in the Kansas of their past. Dorothy comes to pay her first visit to the new farm -- but encounters an unprecedented problem. Overnight, the couple's vegetable garden grows to enormous size, with giant beets, broccoli, peppers, and watermelons, and heads of cabbage twenty feet high. The farmhouse is hemmed in by a vegetable wall. Dorothy sets out for the Emerald City, climbing a landscape of mountainous produce. Outside the garden, she crosses the Munchkin Country and meets new friends, principally a white-and-purple cow named Imogene, who gives varying dairy products depending upon her mood: In a crisis, Imogene can yield a healing golden milk; and in the course of the tale, she gives whipped cream and ice cream too. (Imogene the cow originated in The Wizard of Oz, the 1902 stage adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.)L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; p. lviii. Imogene talks Dorothy into accepting her companionship (the cow wants to see the Emerald City). With the help of the Wizard, Dorothy begins to unravel the mystery of the giant garden, and to follow the trail of a would-be witch called Old Magda who is its cause. The task isn't easy; the trio endure a thunderstorm and a near- crash-landing during a balloon flight. Magda created a giantism potion to make her gardening more productive and her life easier -- but lost control of it; giant moles, eating the giant vegetables, become a pest to all and sundry. Dorothy falls prey to giantism herself and endures a subterranean ordeal before she, the Wizard, and Princess Ozma resolve the problem and restore the normal order of Oz. In the end, Dorothy and her friends face a choice. They rescue Old Magda and Imogene the cow from being buried alive; then they learn that they can revive one or the other, but not both. Saving the old witch can lead to the antidote for Dorothy's giantism; but Dorothy finds she cannot allow her bovine companion to die. Once recovered, however, Imogene supplies the golden milk that restores Magda too. The antidote is obtained, and Dorothy is restored to her normal size. Old Magda reforms, and Imogene gets her tour of the Emerald City.

Gary Herbert, Governor of Utah, et al. On July 13, 2011, Kody Brown and family, from the TLC reality television show Sister Wives, filed a complaint in the United States 10th District Court, District of Utah, to challenge Utah's polygamy laws. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University represented the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs were found to have legal standing, though no charges have been filed against them. On December 13, 2013, approximately eleven months after he heard oral arguments in the case, Judge Waddoups rendered a 91-page decision striking down the cohabitation clause of Utah's polygamy statute as unconstitutional, but also allowing Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act. HB 497 Judge Waddoups blocked an immigration law signed by Gov. Gary Herbert in March 2011 that would require police to check citizenship status upon arrest.

Traditionally, vocal education is possible only when the teacher and the pupil are together in the same room, where the teacher passes on the information in the same vicinity of the student. Online lectures are now possible with the advent of video communications. The development of the online lecture makes it possible so that the teacher and student no longer have to be in the same vicinity to teach and learn, respectively. There are certain advantages to online lecturing. Students may access online lectures posted on their designated websites anywhere in the world, at any time they wish, as long as they have an internet connection. They can also be repeated for the sake of note taking. Studies have shown that students improve significantly in courses with online archived lectures, especially international students. Studies have also noted that the overall experience of a course has improved with the addition of online lectures. There are disadvantages to online lecturing, namely the lack of face-to-face interaction, and the fact that students cannot easily contact their instructors unless a communications link is created.

Rheophytes tend to be found in currents that move at rates of 1 to 2 meters per second and that are up to 3 to 6 feet deep. The amount of force produced by these currents, and the damaging debris they can carry, makes this environment inhospitable to most plants. Rheophytes are able to live in such environments because their leaves are streamlined so as put up little resistance to the flow of water. The leaves tend to be quite narrow and flexible as well. In order to prevent the plants from being uprooted, Rheophytes have an extremely strong wide spreading root systems. Many Rheophytes live in areas that sustain flash floods and they are dependent on the oxygenated water and buoyancy brought along with it. Simply being an aquatic plant with narrow leaves is not a sufficient condition for being a Rheophyte. Also, plants that grow in slow moving water that occasionally receive fast currents aren't Rheophytes either if they don't need these fast currents to survive. Plants that fall into this category are known as facultative rheophytes. When low water levels occur Rheophytes often quickly begin to flower to take advantage of these occurrences. Examples of rheophytic ferns are Asplenium obtusifolium, Osmunda lancea,and Tectaria lobbii  References  * Bown, Deni (2000). Aroids: Plants of the Arum Family. Timber Press. .

The advent of KOSHA It was late 1980s that KOSHA (Korea Occupational Safety & Health Agency) Law was released to the public. After the KOSHA Act was released in 1986, the labor department of Korea, which is the competent organization of KOSHA, moved to the next step that set up the plan for establishing KOSHA and inaugurated the institution committee for KOSHA in 1987. Since then, KOSHA has been taking responsibility for the important role in occupational safety and health in the workplace. It had been a long time for people to look forward to working at the workplace without getting involved in occupational accidents or diseases. It was one of the fastest changing periods for Koreans who lived in during the industrial revolution of Korea. Before moving to the history of KOSHA, we need to examine the environmental and societal circumstances that lead to its development. Korea experienced significant economic growth, the so-called \\"the miracle of Han river\\", during a five-year-long Economic Development Plan beginning in 1962. It resulted from two societal factors, the movement of population from rural to urban environments and the change of major industry. According to the statistic of Koreans agricultural department, the majority of Korean made a living engaging in farming and over 80% of people in Korea belonged to the rural community at that time. In particular, the rice culture that has been the most important crop in Korea since the Lee Dynasty, it required significant physical labor, but the gains from that were in vain, compared to the time and labor that farmers spent on doing that. Also, the Korean government tried to improve the quality of life in an agricultural village, but people who knew a vicious circle of farming were driven into cities which needed less expensive labor. At the very beginning of industrial boom, most small-medium factories and industries could take-off to increase in light of size and quality through using these affluent labor powers. Thus, as industrial facilities became larger and the process became varied, the rate of exposure to the dangerous materials were increased, numerous occupational disasters and diseases broke out and started to affect the health of workers, both directly and indirectly. Since the statistics of occupational disaster were begun during July, 1964, taking the industrial accidents compensation insurance effect, over two million of workers were involved in occupational accidents. Among them, over 20,000 workers died, the remained became the disabled and the economic loss reached the amount of 6,000 million dollars (KOSHA 20th annual report). Likewise, as occupational disasters became a bigger issue in the view of society and economics, the Korean government established and released the Occupational and Safety Law in 1981. But that was not enough to stop the growth of the rate of occupational disasters. Even the casualties of industrial accidents continued to increase because of the shortage of the experts and because owners of industries lacked interest. Hence, there were few effective ways to prevent those accidents. Accordingly, the government recognized the seriousness of the incident's harm and searched for a solution by establishing a professional organization for preventing occupational disaster. Also, there has been pressure from labor unions and from society. Until that time, Korea had been ruled by presidents from army circles since President Park was inaugurated by a military coup in 1961. They did not allow workers to establish trade unions or ask for the enactment of the Labor Union Act, although there were, in name only, Labor Acts such as the Labor Standard Act, the Mediation Act in labor trouble. These were used for the benefit of owners. When seen from the political view, there were a significant number of demonstrations for democracy in Korea. The different point is that workers, including white collar workers, and the general public joined the request. Demonstrations were usually college students' before 1986. Especially, workers called upon substantial laws to reinforce owners who pursued the profit, but were not interested in employees' basic rights. Consequently, the Korean government stepped forward to establish a professional organization intended to protect the basic rights of workers at worksites. KOSHA's goals involve promoting the safety and health of workers, encouraging efficient business to prevent industrial accidents, and to motivate business proprietors into joining them, contributing to the improvement of economic development. The meanings of the establishment can be summarized as follows. # KOSHA offers professional knowledge and experts to establish, national, synthetic and technical systems of occupational accident prevention. # KOSHA advocates for providing safe and clean environments for workers and contributes to enlighten Korean society about safety. # KOSHA seeks to reduce the rate of industrial disasters that prevent Korea from entering the developed country; it raised the power of national competition to join the OECD. (E-book of the history of KOSHA) Likewise, KOSHA was established having a significant mission to protect the precious life, physical safety, and health of workers. Also, KOSHA uplifted the quality of life while growing into a professional organization. The office organization and staff of KOSHA At the beginning of the institution, there was one headquarters, two branch offices, and one education center. It had 368 employees including, one president and three trustees. KOSHA has reorganized twenty-one times to provide the best service for workers and to deal with the ever-changing society and occupational safety policy of government. The contents of important reforms are as follows. # In 1989, the research center was newly established. # In 1991, KOSHA extensively reformed the staff organization in accordance with KOSHA Act. Thus, the size of the organization increased and employed over 800 people. # In 1995, KOSHA needed to form a division into the department for promoting safety culture to let people get to know the safety at the worksites because big accidents kept occurring. # In 2001, KOSHA reorganized the division into teams and founded Human Resource Development (HRD) team. # In 2003, KOSHA added one more branch office in Jeju and two chemical research centers to manage chemical materials. # In 2004, human power at headquarters was reduced and transferred to 20 branch offices. # In 2006, KOSHA has become a flexible organization to support the relationship between businesses and, to make it possible to focus on the scene of labor. Also, the human resources that were separated into technical and management parts, were integrated on one part. # At present, KOSHA has a headquarters that consists of nine departments and 19 teams, an education center, a research center, and 20 branch offices around Korea where over 1,300 occupational experts do their best to prevent industrial disasters from happening at the worksite. Likewise, KOSHA has changed a lot with respect to office and staff organization to adapt to the new environment that the entire world entered into the age of unlimited competition represented as the age of information and globalization. Basic businesses From the beginning, KOSHA played a significant role preventing occupational hazards, accidents, and diseases from worksites. Speaking of the businesses, first we cannot help but talk about the development and spread of prevention technologies, support to educate workers visiting worksites, as well as, analysis and inspection of facilities that are likely to bring the danger or harmfulness, since KOSHA was released. KOSHA focused on activities such as safety diagnoses, guiding new technologies, and education for workers concerned with safety and health that workers and workplaces were asking for in the beginning. It took two years for KOSHA to develop and spread the systematic ways such as visiting worksites and analyzing causes or doing epidemiology research to find the cause of industrial accidents. It was in 1995 that KOSHA was absorbed in trying to reduce the rate of occupational accidents because the campaign for safety culture at workplaces was widespread all over the country. Therefore, KOSHA started to take an action that put aside the some amount of money to prevent those accidents in small and medium businesses that were blamed for occupying the 73.5% of total occupational disasters. Also, the rate of industrial accidents was plunged under 1% that is the sign of getting into the developed country.

The rapid release of energy can result in very high instantaneous energy release rates even though the total energy released is modest. The use of an impulse facility can allow testing of violently energetic phenomena generating temperatures and pressures that no known materials could withstand in steady state. This effect also produces short test times, however, with some types of tests in these facilities lasting less than 100 microseconds. Impulse facilities are a special case of blow down facilities where an energy storage mechanism is charged over a period of time and then released to initiate a test and must be charged again before the next test. This contrasts with continuous facilities such as wind tunnels that may run continuously. Examples of impulse facilities are the shock tube, the shock tunnel, the expansion tube, the expansion tunnel, and the Ludwieg tube.

He fought in battle until the battle of Szolnok, where he was wounded and lost his voice. He then went on to serve as adjutant General to Henryk Dembi≈Ñski, marshall of the Southern army. Captured by the Austrians in battle, he was tried for his activities supporting the agitating Poles and Hungarians, as well as for his actions against Austrian troops in combat. He was convicted and sentenced to death along with fellow defendants Peter Giron and Prince Mieczys≈Çaw of Woroniec. He was executed on 16 October 1849.

The memoir showcases Deisinger‚Äôs career as a professional musician, focusing on his formative years, his career with Bonfire from 1985 ‚Äì 1994, concluding with a brief overview of his activities from the time he left the band to 2007. The project was inspired by Deisinger‚Äôs near death experience on December 26, 2004, when he narrowly missed being killed by the tsunami that ripped through Southeast Asia and decimated parts of Thailand. A last minute change of plans for a scheduled vacation while living in Thailand saved him, resulting in weeks and months of reflection, and the final decision to write his memoirs.Deisinger, J. & Begai, K. (2008), Fire And Fame, BOD Publishing GmbH, Deisinger outlined his idea for the project to Begai in early 2005, mapping out plans for English and German versions of the as-yet-untitled book. Deisinger made it clear from the beginning that Begai would not be a ghost writer, but play an active role in shaping the story. Over a two-year period the pair got together as schedules allowed, with Deisinger dictating the text to Begai in German, who would then translate, arrange and trim the story in English, adding facts and information when necessary. Thus, the book was a genuine collaboration and not a regurgitation of Deisinger‚Äôs words. Fire And Fame is an account of Deisinger‚Äôs life and career, with no embellishment. It does not attempt to cash in on clich√© tales of music industry debauchery, although the occasional sordid tale does surface. Some names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent, and Deisinger makes a point of portraying former bandmates and rivals alike in a respectful light. The writing for the project, eventually dubbed Fire And Fame by Begai, wrapped up in late 2007 and was released independently in cooperation with Books On Demand GmbH in August 2008. Graphic artist / photographer Thomas Riess did the final layout of the book. An early 2009 release is planned for the German version of Fire And Fame.

Shock tunnels use steady flow nozzle expansion whereas expansion tunnels use unsteady expansion with higher enthalpy, or thermal energy. In both cases the gases are compressed and heated until the gases are released, expanding rapidly down the expansion chamber. The tunnels reach speeds from Mach 3 to Mach 30 to create testing conditions that simulate hypersonic to re-entry flight. These tunnels are used by military and government agencies to test hypersonic vehicles that undergo a variety of natural phenomenon that occur during hypersonic flight.Stalker R.J.\\"Modern developments in hypersonic wind tunnels,\\"The Aeronautical Journal January 2006  Expansion process  =Expansion tunnel= Expansion tunnels use a dual-diaphragm system where the diaphragms act as rupture discs, or a pressure relief. The tunnel is separated into three sections: drive, driven, and acceleration. The drive section is filled with high pressure helium gas. The driven section is filled with a lower pressure desired test gas, such as carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen, or oxygen. The acceleration section is filled with an even lower pressurized test gas. Each section is divided by a diaphragm, which is meant to be ruptured in sequence causing the first diaphragm to rupture, mixing and expanding the drive and the driven. When the shock wave hits the second diaphragm, it ruptures casing the two gases to mix with the acceleration and expand down the enclosed test section. Operation time is approximately 250 microseconds.Hollis, Brian R.; Perkins, John N., ‚ÄúHypervelocity Heat-Transfer Measurements in an Expansion Tube,‚Äù AIAA Paper 96-2240 (New Orleans, LA: 19th AIAA Advanced Measurement and Ground Testing Technology Conference, 1996) =Shock tunnel= Reflected shock tunnels heat and pressurize a stagnant gas by using shockwaves that are redirected back into the center; this excites the gases and produces movement, heat, and pressure. The gases are then released and expanded through the nozzle and into the test chamber. Operation time is approximately 20 milliseconds.Bakos, R. J.; Tsai, C.-Y.; Rogers, R. C.; Shih, A.

Forces on the model are detected by strain gauges located on the balance. Each gauge measures a force by the stretching of an electrical element or foil in the gauge. The stretching changes the resistance of the gauge which changes the measured electric current through the gauge according to Ohm's law. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor. Facilities = Hypervelocity Expansion Tube (HET) = The HET is one of the shock tunnels in the Caltech Hypersonics group at the California Institute of Technology directed by Professor Joanna Austin. It operates similarly to a shock tube where a shock formed by the primary diaphragm heats up the test gas. The novel part of this facility is when its test gas is further accelerated by an expansion shock that forms when the primary shock interacts with a second downstream diaphragm. It is a 150mm inner diameter facility with the capability to reach Mach 4-8, and was built in 2005. = HYPULSE = NASA's Hypersonic Pulse Facility (HYPULSE) is operated by the General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL) in New York. The HYPULSE facility was developed for the testing of re- entry vehicles and air-breathing engines. The specifications of the HYPULSE include a diameter of 7 feet and a 19 foot length. This facility was upgraded to have two modes, Reflected Shock Tunnel (RST) and Shock-Expansion Tunnel (SET). HYPULSE-RST generates speeds from Mach 5 to 10, whereas the HYPULSE-SET produces speeds from Mach 12 to 25.Tamagno, Jose; Bakos, Robert; Pulsonetti, Maria; Erdos, John, ‚ÄúHypervelocity Real Gas Capabilities of GASL's Expansion Tube (HYPULSE) Facility,‚Äù AIAA Paper 90-1390(Seattle, WA: AIAA 16th Aerodynamic Ground Testing Conference, 1990) :Vehicles tested at HYPULSE: *Hyper-X *X-34 *HYPLUSE Scramjet Model (HSM) = LENS-I,II = Large Energy National Shock tunnels (LENS) were constructed over the past 15 years at the Aerothermal/Aero-optic Evaluation Center (AAEC) at CUBRC.

It is typically used to produce high enthalpy flows for high speed aerodynamic flow and aerodynamic heating and atmospheric reentry testing. It is used to engender short-duration, high- velocity gas flows. The device is composed commonly of three sections of tubing aligned in tandem. Thin plastic or metal diaphragms are used for separating from the sections from each other. As in an ordinary shock tube, the driver section is originally filled to high pressure with a light gas. The driven section is filled to a lower pressure with the test gas of interest. The third section of tubing, named the expansion section, includes a light gas at very low pressure. During the time that the driver or driven diaphragm out of function, the driver gas expands into the driven section. A shock wave comes into being which propagates into the test gas, generating an increase in temperature and pressure behind it. The shock travels down the tube, and breaks the driven or expansion diaphragm, and accelerates upon participating in the expansion section. And the shocked test gas is then cooled and speeded up by an unsteady, constant area expansion from the driven section into the lower-pressure expansion section.

Early career Shambhu Nath De was born in Hooghly District, West Bengal, India. His father Mr Dasarathi De was a not so successful businessman. Supported by his uncle Asutosh De, De completed the Matriculation examination with distinction from Garbati High School that helped him to get the District scholarship as well as to pursue further education in Hooghly Mohsin College, which was then affiliated with the prestigious University of Calcutta. His higher education was supported by Kestodhan Seth, who identified De as an extraordinary student. De passed his M.B. examination in 1939 from Calcutta Medical College and completed a Diploma in Tropical Medicine (DTM) in 1942. Soon after graduation he joined Calcutta Medical College as a Demonstrator of Pathology and initiated his research under Professor B. P. Tribedi. In 1947, De joined as a PhD student under Sir Roy Cameron at the Department of Morbid Anatomy, University College Hospital Medical School, London, and obtained his PhD degree in Pathology in 1949. After his return, De worked on pathogenesis of cholera and started publishing his findings.De, S. N., Sarkar, J. K., Tribedi, B. P. An experimental study of the action of cholera toxin. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 63: 707‚Äì717, 1951. In 1955, De became the Head of Pathology and Bacteriology Division of the Calcutta Medical College, which he continued until his retirement. De published more than 30 research papers and has written an excellent monograph on cholera and its pathogenesis.De, S. N. Cholera: its pathology and pathogenesis, Published by Oliver and Boyd, London, 1961. Contributions De made significant contributions to our recent understanding of cholera and related diarrhoeal diseases and set a permanent milestone in the modern view of diseases caused by bacterial exotoxins. Followed by the discovery of Vibrio cholerae in 1884 by Robert Koch, many works have been carried out all over the world to answer many questions related with its pathogenesis and mode of transmission in causing outbreaks. The seminal works of De in Calcutta (now, Kolkata), during 1950‚Äì60 breached several qualms pertaining to the enteric toxin produced by bacteria including V. cholerae and Escherichia coli. Three of his works viz., ligated intestinal loop method (which was a reinvention of Violle and Crendiropoulo method in 1915, but De was unaware of this work and made an independent discovery) for studying cholera in rabbit model;De, S. N. and Chatterje, D. N. An experimental study of the mechanism of action of Vibrio cholerae on the intestinal mucous membrane. J. Pathol.

A study of the pathogenicity of strains of Bacterium coli from acute and chronic enteritis. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 71: 201‚Äì209, 1956. and lastly but most importantly is his discovery of cholera toxin in 1959 in the cell-free culture filtrate of V. cholerae that stimulated a specific cellular response.De, S. N. Enterotoxicity of bacteria-free culture-filtrate of Vibrio cholerae. Nature 183: 1533‚Äì1534, 1959. Says Eugene Garfield,Garfield, E.

This discovery eventually promoted research to find a treatment aimed directly at neutralising the cholera enterotoxin. De‚Äôs paper ‚ÄúEnterotoxicity of bacteria-free culture-filtrate of Vibrio cholerae,‚Äù while initially unrecognised, today is considered a milestone in the history of cholera research. Biochemist W.E. van Heyningen, professor emeritus, University of Oxford, UK, and John R. Seal, former scientific director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, note that De‚Äôs paper ‚Äúdeserves to go down as a classic in the history of cholera, and, indeed, as later developments have shown, in the history of cellular physiology and biochemistry.‚Äù Thanks to De‚Äôs discovery of the cholera enterotoxin, research has been redirected to find a vaccine that will spark the immune system to fight the enterotoxin specifically, rather than the bacteria. De and colleagues also published highly cited pioneering studies on V.cholerae action on the intestinal membrane.,,De S N, Ghose M L & Sen A. Activities of bacteria-free preparations from Vibrio cholerae. J. Patho/. Bacferiol. 79:373-80, 1960. The 1953 paper ‚ÄúAn experimental study of the mechanism of action of Vibrio cholerae on the intestinal mucous membrane‚Äù is De‚Äôs most-cited paper, cited 340 times until August 1986. De‚Äôs most-cited paper has been core to cholera research fronts for many years, especially research fronts on \\"E. coli and Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin: detection, characterization, and role of adherence\\" and \\"Characterization of cholera enterotoxin and other enterotoxins\\". As noted by John Craig, State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn, De‚Äôs work was truly creative and novel, and it ‚Äúforever altered our concepts surrounding the pathogenesis of secretory diarrhoea.‚Äù These famous findings came out from the work he carried out at the Nilratan Sircar Medical College, Calcutta Medical College and Bose Institute, Kolkata in extremely modest laboratory settings. Using research methodology that was very simple, easy to perform and inexpensive, he set the highest standards of excellence in novel experimental design and execution. In the words of Nobel Laureate Prof. Joshua Lederberg, ‚ÄúDe‚Äôs clinical observations led him to the bold thought that dehydration was a sufficient cause of pathology of cholera, that the cholera toxin can kill ‚Äòmerely‚Äô by stimulating the secretion of water into the bowel\\". Thus, the oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for replenishing the massive fluid loss in cholera patients, has saved innumerable lives, should be considered as a direct outcome of De's discovery of cholera toxin. His findings on exotoxins set the stage for the modern views of diseases caused by toxin producing bacteria, helped in the purification of cholera and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins produced by V. cholerae and E. coli, respectively, and in the development of series of cholera and enterotoxigenic E. coli (in short ETEC strains) vaccines. Post-retirement De retired in 1973 from the Calcutta Medical College at the age of 58. After his retirement, he showed no interest in higher positions but continued his research at the Bose Institute, Calcutta. De's desire to purify the cholera toxin did not progress any further as the protein purification technology was not well established in his research settings. During his time of research, De worked with hypertoxin-producing classical strains of V. cholerae O1, which was abruptly replaced by El Tor biotype [producing less cholera toxin] in Calcutta from 1963. This new development was another reason why De could not continue his research on purification of cholera toxin. In 1978, the Nobel Foundation invited De to participate in the 43rd Nobel Symposium on Cholera and Related Diarrhoeas. De died on 15 April 1985 at the age of 70. His life's ambition was to make the world a better place to live in through his dedicated selfless services in medical science. Significance of work But for Eugene Garfield's 1986 tribute to De in Current Contents,6 De's great contributions to cholera research would have continued to remain unknown to many even in India. A special issueSpecial issue on S N De and cholera enterotoxin. Current Science, 59: 623‚Äì714, 1990. of the journal Current Science (Bangalore, India) was published in 1990 in honour of De, to which several eminent scientists of national and international repute contributed. In the words of Dr S Sriramachari, former director of the Institute of Pathology and additional director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, De's contributions stand out as a pinnacle of excellence in our understanding of the pathogenesis of cholera. Nobel laureate Prof. Joshua Lederberg had nominated De for the Nobel Prize more than once. Said Lederberg, \\"our appreciation of De must then extend beyond the humanitarian consequences of his discovery. . . he is also an examplar and inspiration for a boldness of challenge to the established wisdom, a style of thought that should be more aggressively taught by example as well as precept.‚Äù And yet De was never elected a fellow of any Indian academy and never received any major award. Indeed as Professor Padmanabhan Balaram pointed out in an editorial in Current Science, \\"De died in 1985 unhonoured and unsung in India's scientific circles. That De received no major award in India during his lifetime and our Academies did not see it fit to elect him to their Fellowships must rank as one of the most glaring omissions of our time. De emerges, in retrospect, as a modest self-effacing scientist driven by inner compulsions to grapple with a major scientific problem of the time. His choice of cholera as his field of interest was remarkably appropriate to his setting. To this problem De brought a wonderfully thoughtful approach, together with deep intuition, enabling him to make the long-awaited breakthrough in the field. De's heroic story of persistence, dedication and achievement should serve as an inspiration to the many who are increasingly bewildered by the current fashion of mega projects, surrounded by fanfare and publicity and most often surprisingly little discernible scientific output.‚Äù References Category:1915 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Indian medical researchers Category:Scientists from West Bengal Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:People from Hooghly district Category:Hooghly Mohsin College alumni ","title":"Sambhu Nath De"},{"id":"20078922","text":"Karol d'Abancourt de Franqueville (26 May 1851 ‚Äì 16 August 1913) was a Polish politician and lawyer.

Ship history The ship was built at Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, in 1849. It sailed from the Port of Liverpool on 13 March 1853 with 366 passengers plus crew, captained by William Gardner. The first port of call was to be Port Phillip, Australia, before continuing to Sydney with the majority of the passengers. After a passage of 97 days the ship reached Cape Otway on 17 June, and set a course for Port Phillip some 56 miles away. At 5.15 a.m. the next morning the ship struck a reef (later named Charlemont Reef) about 1¬Ω miles from Point Flinders (now Barwon Heads). An attempt to launch the ships boats failed in the heavy surf, so the main mast was cut down to lighten ship, which then washed over the reef and grounded nearer shore. A passenger named Savage swam ashore with a light rope, and a hawser was stretched between the ship and the shore. Using a ship's boat the passengers and crew were all safely ferried ashore by 8.30 p.m., apart from one elderly passenger named Thwaites, who died from a heart attack, and was buried on the headland. The passengers were provided with shelter by a local settler Mr. McVean, who alerted the authorities at Geelong. James Cowie, the mayor of Geelong, sent food and eight bullock drays to transport the women, children and infirm to Geelong, while the able-bodied followed on foot. The people of Geelong raised ¬£1,000 to assist the passengers who had lost all their possessions. A subsequent inquiry laid blame for the disaster on Captain Gardner, but a sailing directory published by the Admiralty in 1855 noted that the wreck of the Earl of Charlemont and that of Sacramento two months earlier, were due to strong currents carrying the vessels inshore when hove to awaiting daylight. In 1953, on the centenary of the wreck, a memorial service was held attended by descendants of the survivors, and in November 1953 a cairn was erected overlooking the scene of the wreck.

Story Bruiser is a male dog who wears a tartan flat cap and a studded collar. Scratch is a female cat who wears a flower in her hair and a heart- shaped necklace. The game begins as the pair are having a walk in some nearby woods. Scratch spots a large paw-shaped marking in the ground and calls Bruiser over to have a look. However just as she does so a thin vapour comes up out of the ground and becomes a door. Bruiser trips over and they both go tumbling through the doorway. Gameplay The game is split into a series of levels in which the player takes control of either Bruiser or Scratch depending on the level. The aim of the game is to try to escape each level by creating a portal out of different random objects. The player does this by pushing these objects together to form a completely new object to create a portal out of the level. Objects move in a straight line and are controlled by a four-direction one-button interface. There are a few tutorials to introduce a player to the game and the actual story takes place over 48 puzzles and six landscapes. Challenge mode also offers 75 additional puzzles that range in difficulty. Reception Wiiloveit.com gave the game a 20/30, commenting that the game is \\"really challenging for almost all ages\\", and \\"will last you many, many hours\\". Unfortunately, the mediocre presentation and the \\"high price tag\\" are big put-off's to an otherwise pretty good game.

On 8 November 1918, RƒÅtana received a divine revelation from the Holy Spirit which commanded him to unite the MƒÅori people in worship of the One True God, Jehovah. On 5 July 1925, the RƒÅtana Established Church of New Zealand was formally established and registered with the Registrar-General of New Zealand.  Beliefs and teachings  The Ratana church believes in the Holy Trinity, the administration of the True and Faithful Angels, the commissioning and relevance of Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana as \\"God's Mouthpiece\\" in this dispensation, the authority of the scriptures, the rejection of spiritism (tohungaism), the vitalisation and healthiness of the body and soul, faith healing and unity within the church. = Creed of faith = Glory and Praise be to Jehovah of Hosts, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and honour also be to the Faithful Angels. # I believe in Jehovah of Hosts, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Creator of all things that do exist, and the Author of all life, who in Infinite Wisdom and Love presides over all His Creations. # I believe that man was created in the image of Jehovah, but that through wrongdoing, he lost the possibilities and joy of this his heritage; thus the necessity arose for a Saviour/Redeemer to deliver him from the power and consequences of sin in this life and the life that is beyond the death of the body. # I believe that Jehovah sent His Son in the human form (of Jesus Christ) to redeem man and to conquer the power of sin, of darkness and of death. Heaven is now Christ's throne and the earth is his foot-stool, but His chosen dwelling place is in the hearts of those who truly believe in Him and have union with Him in His Victory and Glory. # I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Breath of Jehovah, the giver of life, who proceeding from the Father and from the Son is to be worshipped with the Father and the Son. The Prophets spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. He reveals to man's consciousness his sins and their correction and leads man to trust, and rest firmly upon the Saviour, transforming his heart and mind until he becomes Christ like in Holy Love. # I believe that the Faithful Angels of Jehovah are ever active doing His will. They are His workers and messengers. They are the helpers of all those who truly believe the Gospel of Jehovah. They are Co- Workers with man. They render continuous loving to Jehovah. # I believe in the Holy Christian Church, the company of all those who have truly received the Christ and are united with Him and with each other; in seeking righteousness and in rendering loving service to God and to man, and fighting against all evil beliefs and sinful practices. # I believe as Jesus Christ has taught us, that JEHOVAH is our Heavenly Father and all men are brethren; that all our labours should be, not for personal gain, but in co-operation with each other as co-workers with JEHOVAH for benefit of mankind and the honour of God; that all men should be honest workers, and in love and justice and knowledge, each bear his share of the burden of life, thus serving JEHOVAH and his fellowmen. # I believe in the Holy Bible, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, for it is the record of JEHOVAH's greatest revelations concerning the eternal life of the Spirit and the vitality of the body. # I believe that in JEHOVAH is the light and the great joy for my Spirit and for my body. This fact is experienced through union with Christ in the Infinite Love of the Father and the power of the Holy Spirit and the Faithful Angels, and active fellowship with the true Christian believers. # I believe that Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana is a MOUTHPIECE of JEHOVAH, spreading abroad new light as the above truths concerning the salvation of the Spirit and the vitalising of the body. Amen  Headquarters at RƒÅtana PƒÅ  The headquarters of the RƒÅtana Church and movement is at RƒÅtana PƒÅ, located 20 km south of Whanganui.

It is one of the Imperial Faberg√© eggs, made for Alexander III of Russia, who presented it to his wife, the Empress Maria Feodorovna. The egg is owned by an American couple, Artie and Dorothy McFerrin, and is on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. The egg cost 4,750 silver roubles, and contained an automaton of an ivory elephant covered with precious stones. The surprise, thought missing for many years, has now been found in the collection of the British Royal Family. Design The egg is made of jadeite, gold, rose-cut diamonds, and is lined with white satin. It is carved from pale green jadeite and is enclosed in a lattice of rose-cut diamonds with gold mounts. The egg is hinged, and a large diamond sits at its base. Originally it was supported on a base of three silver putti said to represent the three sons of the imperial couple, the Grand Dukes Nicholas, George and Michael. The putti were set on a jadeite base, now lost. Surprise Automaton elephant and winding key. Apart from a year long special loan, the egg and its surprise are not displayed together as both items belong to different collections. The surprise was an automaton of an elephant in ivory. It was the first automaton made by Faberg√© for an Imperial egg, his next automaton was made in 1900 for the Pine Cone egg presented to Barbara Kelch. The surprise was described in detail when the egg was held at the Gatchina Palace. A small key wound the ivory elephant which had a small gold tower on its back decorated with rose- cut diamonds. The sides of the elephant were decorated with gold and five precious stones. The tusks, trunk and harness were decorated with small diamonds, and a black mahout sat on its head. The elephant had special significance; the design resembles the badge of the highest order in Denmark, Empress Maria Feodorovna's homeland. It was likely sold by the Soviets at the same time as its egg, and may have been resold by Wartski. It was recorded as missing, but had been purchased by George V and was residing in a cabinet in Buckingham Palace, where in 2015 it was identified as Faberg√© and the lost surprise by Royal Collection Trust senior curator Caroline de Guitaut. The surprise and the egg were placed on display together for the first time at the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences in 2017 since the identification of the surprise where the surprise was loaned by the Royal Collection for a year. Ownership The egg was presented to the Empress Maria Feodorovna by her husband, Alexander III of Russia on 5 April 1892, and was subsequently held at the Gatchina Palace. It was one of 40 eggs sent to the Kremlin Armoury by the Russian Provisional Government for safekeeping in September 1917. It was transferred to the Council of People's Commissars in 1922, and around 1927 was sold by the Antikvariat to Michel Norman of the Australian Pearl Company. Subsequently purchased by Emanuel Snowman of the London jewellers, Wartski, it was bought from Wartski by a Mr. T. B. Kitson in October 1929. Following Kitson's death it was auctioned by Sotheby's in December 1962 for ¬£2,400, and bought by a buyer's agent, named Drager. The egg was subsequently owned by a private collection in the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1977, and was held by a private collection in London in 1983. The Diamond Trellis egg is currently owned by Artie McFerrin, a successful businessman in the Houston chemical and petroleum industry, who with his wife, Dorothy, has collected one of the largest private collections of Faberg√© objet d'art in the United States. As well as the Diamond Trellis egg, the McFerrins own Faberg√© eggs made for the Russian nobleman Alexander Kelch, and the Swedish-Russian oil baron Emanuel Nobel. The Diamond Trellis egg was exhibited at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1977, the Museum of Applied Arts in Helsinki in 1980, New York's Cooper-Hewitt Museum in 1983 and the Swedish Nationalmuseum in Stockholm in 1997.

The film was re-released in England in 1944 and 1949. It was released in the US as Mr. Hobo. Plot Monsieur Barsac (Frank Cellier) is in a great deal of trouble - the Paris bank of which he is president is bankrupt, though nobody else knows yet. He tells his secret to his crony Dubois (George Hayes), since he needs his help. Dubois is to purchase an iron mine that is supposedly played out. However, Barsac's mining engineer has found rich, untapped deposits of ore. The mine is 51% owned by the widow Mrs. Granville (Henrietta Watson) and her daughter Madeleine (Viola Keats), who are deeply in debt to his bank. Barsac uses his stepson Paul (Patric Knowles) as an intermediary, since Paul is a friend of the family, particularly the beautiful Madeleine. Meanwhile, a vagabond known as the \\"Guv'nor\\" (George Arliss) decides to head south for the winter with his friend Flit (Gene Gerrard). At the Granville estate, he offers to mend some china in exchange for food and is treated very cordially by Madeleine. Soon after, the two men are taken into custody for poaching and returned to Paris. After the policeman learns the Guv'nor's unusual real name, Fran√ßois Rothschild, he informs a member of the great banking dynasty who, unwilling to have his illustrious family name besmirched by an arrest, gives the Guv'nor a check for 2000 francs and has the two men released. The Guv'nor is happy with his lifestyle, so he offers the money to Flit. They clean themselves up before trying to cash the check at Barzac's bank. Barzac mistakes the Guv'nor for one of the Rothschilds and tries to persuade him to join the board of directors to prop up the bank. During the conversation, the Guv'nor catches Barzac in a lie about Madeleine and becomes interested. He is made president of the bank. When the Guv'nor learns details about Barsac's scheme from Madame Barzac (Mary Clare), who is anxious to prevent her husband from investing in a \\"worthless\\" mine, he returns to the Granville estate. There, dressed as the tramp, he advises Madeleine to get Paul to ask for impartial advice about Barzac's strong recommendation to sell - from Monsieur Rothschild. Instead, she goes to see Rothschild herself and discovers his real identity. She believes that he has deceived her so he can purchase the mine himself and stalks out before he can explain. The next morning, the Guv'nor attends a meeting of the shareholders called to vote on whether to sell for the pittance Dubois is offering. The Guv'nor denounces Barzac and Dubois, but Madeleine votes to sell. The wily Guv'nor then makes it look as if he has committed suicide. People fear he did so because there is something wrong with the bank and Dubois' company; panic selling soon drives down the price of shares in both. Meanwhile, Paul buys them on the Guv'nor's behalf. Having saved the Granvilles and ruined Barzac and Dubois, the Guv'nor gives the shares to Madeleine and Paul as a wedding present and resumes his carefree journey to warmer climes.

Greene spoke favorably about the hint of satire concerning the last name (Rothschild) of the tramp played by Arliss, and speculated that the film might have been improved if it had been directed by Ren√© Clair. (reprinted in: ) Frank Nugent wrote in The New York Times, \\"George Arliss, fresh as any septuagenarian can be from his personal triumphs as Disraeli, Richelieu, Wellington and Hamilton, becomes a completely non- historical tramp in \\"Mister Hobo,\\" the new Gaumont-British film which opened yesterday at the Roxy. An unpretentious little picture, happily devoid of international crises and court intrigues, it is gently humorous, quietly paced and a rather pleasant breathing spell for Mr. Arliss and his admirers\\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03E1DD153FEE3BBC4053DFB466838D629EDE?&pagewanted;=print while more recently, Hal Erickson in Allmovie called it \\"a standard George Arliss vehicle, despite his rags and tatters\\"; and TV Guide wrote, \\"though the situation is contrived, the script is quite good and completely believable.

It was first published in 1991.Brendan Corcoran, \\"'Stalled in the Pre-articulate': Heaney, Poetry, and War,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of British and Irish War Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 697. The story comes from one of the myths relating to the Trojan War. It is dedicated in memory of poet and translator Robert Fitzgerald. Characters *Odysseus *Neoptolemus *Philoctetes *Chorus *Chorus Leader *Sentry *Merchant (in disguise) *Hercules (in person of chorus leader) Premise The story takes place in the closing days of the Trojan War. Before the play begins, the Greek archer Philoctetes has been abandoned on the island of Lemnos by his fellows because of a foul-smelling wound on his foot, and his agonised cries. The play opens with verses from the Chorus and the arrival of Odysseus and Neoptolemus to the shore of Lemnos. Their mission is to devise a plan to obtain the mighty bow of Philoctetes, without which, it has been foretold, they cannot win the Trojan War. Themes Nelson Mandela and the South African Apartheid were thematic inspiration for Heaney's version of Philoctetes At the beginning of the play, the protagonist Philoctetes has been abandoned on an island with a wound that will not heal. His suffering and exposure to the elements have made him animal-like, a quality he shares with other outcasts in Heaney's work, such as Sweeney.Conor McCarthy, Seamus Heaney and Medieval Poetry (D.S. Brewer, 2008), p. 137. Narratives relating to the Trojan War had attracted Heaney and other Irish poets, sometimes for its resonance with the Northern Ireland conflict. Heaney also reworked The Testament of Cresseid, and had drawn on the Oresteia of Aeschylus for his sequence of poems \\"Mycenae Lookout\\".McCarthy, Seamus Heaney and Medieval Poetry, p. 136. Heaney's version is well known for its lines: > History says, Don't hope > On this side of the grave, > But then, once in a lifetime > The longed-for tidal wave > Of justice can rise up > And hope and history rhyme. The passage was quoted by Bill Clinton in his remarks to the community in Derry in 1995 during the Northern Ireland Peace Process.Bill Clinton, \\"Remarks to the Community in Derry,\\" 30 November 1995 , retrieved 6 September 2013. Joe Biden has also frequently quoted the passage, including in his presidential acceptance speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and at the memorial service for Sean Collier, a campus police officer who was killed in the line of duty during the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing.Mark Memmott, \\"Boston Bombing Investigation: Wednesday's Developments,\\" The Two- Way: Breaking News from NPR, 24 April 2013, update at 1:20 p.m. ET, NPR blog, retrieved 26 April 2013. In the opening chorus of the play, Heaney's translation emphasizes the role of poetry as \\"the voice of reality and justice\\"The Cure at Troy, choral prologue, p. 2 in the 1991 edition of The Noonday Press of Farrar, Straus and Giroux. in expressing \\"terrible events\\".Corcoran, \\"'Stalled in the Pre-articulate',\\" p. 700. At the time of its composition, Heaney saw themes of the Philoctetes as consonant with the contemporary political situation in South Africa, as the apartheid regime fell and Nelson Mandela was released from prison without a full-scale war. Heaney described Mandela's return as a similar overcoming of betrayal and a display of \\"the generosity of his coming back and helping with the city‚Äîhelping the polis to get together again.\\"Corcoran, \\"'Stalled in the Pre-articulate',\\" p. 701. Production history The Cure at Troy was first performed in 1990 by the Field Day Theatre Company.McCarthy, Seamus Heaney and Medieval Poetry, p. 136.

Initially designated engineer amphibian brigades, they were redesignated engineer special brigades in 1943. The 1st, 5th, and 6th Engineer Special Brigades were assigned to the European Theater of Operations. The 1st Engineer Special Brigade participated in the landings in Sicily and Italy before joining the 5th and 6th Engineer Special Brigades for the invasion of Normandy. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Engineer Special Brigades were assigned to the Southwest Pacific Area, and participated in the campaigns in the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, Leyte, Luzon, the Southern Philippines and Borneo campaign. The 1st Engineer Special Brigade fought in both theaters of the war, participating in the Okinawa campaign near the end of the war. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade remained active after the war, and served in the Korean War before being inactivated in 1955.  Concept  At the onset of direct American involvement in World War II, it became apparent that the United States would need a large strategic and tactical amphibious warfare capability. In 1941, the amphibious forces were divided into two corps: one in the Atlantic, and one in the Pacific. Both were combined United States Army and United States Marine Corps commands, administered by the United States Navy. The Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet, consisted of the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Marine Division, while the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, consisted of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 2nd Marine Division. In April 1942, the United States and United Kingdom agreed on plans for an emergency invasion of Northwest Europe in the late northern summer of 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer) that would be conducted in the event of signs that the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse, or that the Germans were withdrawing from Western Europe, possibly due to an internal coup or collapse. This would be followed by a full-scale crossing of the English Channel in mid-1943 (Operation Roundup). These were envisaged as shore-to-shore operations. The US Navy's policy at this time of only taking volunteers meant that it was short of manpower, and those personnel it had available were mainly allocated warships and the amphibious ships required for ship-to-shore operations. This meant that the landing craft for Sledgehammer would have to be operated by the British and the US Army.  Amphibious Training Center  The Joint Staff then considered the issue of amphibious warfare training. Very large scale operations were contemplated in both Europe and the Pacific, which the Army would have to conduct. To have the Marines carry out all amphibious operations was impractical, as there were limitations on its size, and joint Army-Marine amphibious operations would involve problems of coordination in view of their different organization, doctrine and procedures. The Joint Staff planners therefore felt that the Army should conduct amphibious training. This meant that the Army would have to establish its own amphibious training establishment. Training at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts The Joint Staff hoped to have twelve Army divisions (eleven infantry and one armored) trained in amphibious warfare by 1 February 1943. Another two infantry divisions and one armored division would receive training overseas. This did not include the 1st, 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions, which were already undergoing training, the 3rd on the West Coast and the 1st and 9th on the East coast. In addition, the Army would train enough boat crews to move eight divisions. These would also be available by 1 February 1943. The Joint Staff intended to create three amphibious training centers. The plan was to train four divisions at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, six at Camp Carrabelle, Florida, and two at Fort Lewis, Washington. It was intended that training at Camp Edwards would be conducted between July and November 1942. The Army Ground Forces was given responsibility for the development of amphibious warfare doctrine and the conduct of unit training. The Army activated its Amphibious Training Center at Camp Edwards on 22 May 1942, with Colonel Frank A. Keating, the chief of staff of the 2nd Infantry Division, assigned to command it. It became active on 15 June 1942. The 45th Infantry Division underwent training at Camp Edwards from 15 July to 20 August 1942. Training concluded with major amphibious maneuvers from 17 to 19 August, during which the division conducted a shore-to-shore operation, embarking from Washburn Island, Massachusetts, and crossing Vineyard Sound to land on Martha's Vineyard, about away. It was followed by the 36th Infantry Division, which arrived on 22 August, and completed its training on 3 October. The final three days saw a repeat of the shore-to-shore exercise the 45th had conducted. Amphibian engineers land 45th Division troops at Cape Cod using the old LCPs The Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle in October 1942. The first formation to undergo training there was the 38th Infantry Division, which commenced its amphibious warfare training there on 23 November 1942. The final shore-to-shore amphibious maneuver was conducted on 17 to 19 December, but performance was not considered satisfactory by the Amphibious Training Center staff, and it was repeated on 28 to 30 December. Camp Carrabelle was renamed Camp Gordon Johnston 13 January 1943. The 28th Infantry Division commenced training on 28 January 1943, and conducted its landing exercise on 7 to 9 March. This was the last division to be trained by the Amphibious Training Center, although three separate battalions, the 81st Chemical Battalion, 61st Medical Battalion and 462nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, received training there in May 1943. On 10 March 1943, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, and the Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, entered into an agreement that amphibious training would henceforth be a Navy responsibility. The Army Ground Forces was relieved of responsibility for the Amphibious Training Center on 16 March, and it was closed on 10 June.  Engineer Amphibian Command  In addition to training combat units in amphibious warfare, the Army also had to train personnel in the operation and maintenance of landing craft. Operating the necessary landing craft was estimated to require 48,000 men, organized into 18 boat operating regiments and seven boat maintenance battalions. Each boat regiment had three battalions, each of three boat companies. It was agreed with the British that boat units deploying to the UK would receive their initial training in the US, and final training in the UK. A consequence was the amphibian engineers' adoption of the British Combined Operations shoulder patch, but with the colors switched to gold on blue. The War Department also authorized the wearing of a pocket patch showing a scarlet seahorse on a white background, these being the colors of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. David Ogden, Clarence Sturdevant, Daniel Noce and Colonel Arthur Trudeau at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts in October 1942. The Engineer Amphibian Command was created on 10 June 1942 at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts under the command of Colonel Daniel Noce, with Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Trudeau as his chief of staff. Noce was answerable to Brigadier General Clarence Sturdevant, the Assistant Chief of Engineers for training. Additional training facilities were established at Cape Cod. The beach south of Buzzards Bay was selected for shore facilities, and Washburn Island was leased as a training site. Some $1.6 million was spent on dredging and the construction of roads, camps, piers and utilities. Noce and Trudeau considered how the boat units would operate in combat, and noted the importance of well- trained shore parties to load and unload the boats, and establish supply dumps on the far shore. Since combat engineers were not specifically trained for the task, and would in any case have their hands full dealing with obstacles and fortifications, they felt that a permanent organization was required. They drew up a structure for an engineer shore regiment that would combine the functions of a Navy beach party and the Marine Corps shore party. About half the size of a boat regiment, a shore regiment would consist of three battalions, each with a near shore company and two far shore companies. Each shore regiment would be grouped with a boat regiment, a boat maintenance battalion, and support units to form an engineer amphibian brigade capable of moving an entire infantry division. The proposed organization was approved, and authority was granted to form eight engineer amphibian brigades. The table of organization and equipment for an engineer amphibian brigade provided for 349 officers, 20 warrant officers, and 6,814 enlisted men. The Army searched its personnel records for men with appropriate marine experience. Arrangements were made to train ships' carpenters and marine mechanics at the Gray Marine Motor Company in Michigan, Higgins Industries in Louisiana, and Evinrude Outboard Motors and the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Wisconsin. In all, 3,368 personnel were trained by these companies. Another 1,481 were trained at the Army Ordnance School at Aberdeen, Maryland, the Naval Operating Base at Toledo, Ohio, and the Army Motor School at Fort Holabird, Maryland. The majority, some 33,627 men, were trained at schools run by the Engineer Amphibian Command. Instructors were obtained from the British Army, Royal Navy, and the United States Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Coast and Geodetic Survey. Of the 37,651 enlisted men assigned between 10 June 1942 and 31 December 1943, 20,244 came from replacement centers, 11,898 from reception centers and 5,509 from other units; of the 2,899 officers, 634 came from other units, 825 from the Officer Reserve Corps, 965 from Officer Candidate Schools, and 475 through direct commissioning from civilian life. A jeep comes ashore over Sommerfeld track in a training exercise at Camp Edwards The Engineer Amphibian Command estimated that it required 1,000 landing craft and 225 tank lighters, but it was soon discovered that this exceeded the number available. The Navy agreed to turn over 300 36-foot craft from new production in June and July. Initially the Engineer Amphibian Command used whatever landing craft were available: the 36-foot landing craft, personnel (LCP); landing craft, ramp (LCR); landing craft, personnel (ramp) (LCP(R)); and landing craft, vehicle (LCV); and a small number of the 50-foot landing craft, mechanized (LCM). Some were petrol-, and some diesel-powered. The 36-foot boats were later superseded by the landing craft, vehicle, personnel (LCVP), which combined their attributes. The shortage of landing craft meant that enough were available for only one boat battalion at a time. The practice of allocating the boats to one battalion at a time, while the only way that all battalions could be trained, annoyed the Amphibious Training Center, as it meant that its ground units were always training with inexperienced boat crews. Tests were carried out with the newly-developed DUKW, and it was decided that each brigade should be equipped with three of them. An important organizational change as a result of experience with training occurred on 5 September, when Noce decided to group the boat and shore engineers into three boat and shore regiments, each with one boat and one shore battalion. Each boat and shore regiment could work with one of the three infantry regiments in an infantry division. While the Navy was still willing to allow the Army to operate landing craft, it reserved the right to operate ocean-going landing ships. A dispute arose over which category the larger Landing craft, tank (LCT) belonged to. The LCT was powered by the same Gray marine diesel engine as the LCVP and LCM, so no special training was required to operate or maintain it. The Engineer Amphibian Command was informed on 21 May 1942 that the Navy had agreed that the Army could operate LCTs, but the British then decided that the LCT was a landing ship after all, and on 29 June the Navy announced that it would be operating the LCTs. This came as a blow to the Engineer Amphibian Command, as it meant that it was dependent on the Navy to transport its larger pieces of equipment like the D8 bulldozer. Engineer trainees land a 75 mm gun The Navy also announced that it would take over the operation of all landing craft as soon as possible. The reason for this was that Sledgehammer had been abandoned in favor of an invasion of French Northwest Africa (Operation Torch), a ship-to-shore operation, and plans for the 1943 cross-Channel invasion operation were scaled back on 1 July from twelve to eight divisions. The number of engineer amphibian brigades was cut from eight to five; on 17 August it was reduced to just three. Given the additional time, the Navy now believed that it could train all boat crews, but the absorption of the engineer amphibian brigades into the Navy was precluded by the fact that they contained draftees, which the Navy was still refusing to accept. Uncertainty about the future became acute as the year wore on, as Camp Edwards was unsuitable for boat operations in winter. The Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle, Florida in October, taking the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade with it, but left the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade at Camp Edwards. Up to this point, all plans had revolved around operations in Europe, as the war against Germany had priority, although in planning for amphibious training for twelve divisions, the War Department had also been providing for operations in the Pacific. In the wake of the US victory in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, plans were advanced for offensive operations in the Pacific, particularly in the Solomon Islands. LCT-349 assists in a training exercise Amphibious operations in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) depended on the availability of landing craft. The Navy intended to ship only 60 per month to the theater, as they had to be sent deckloaded on ships bound for Australia, as they were too large to fit into ships' holds. Trudeau proposed shipping them as components. In this way hundreds could be carried in a ship's hold. They could be assembled in Australia by the 411th Base Shop Battalion. The decision to ship the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade to Australia freed accommodation at Camp Carrabelle for the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade, although it meant that yet another cycle of training would be conducted with inexperienced boat crews. On 27 November, General Douglas MacArthur asked for two more brigades. He also recommended that their name be changed from \\"amphibian\\" to \\"special\\". Voluntary enlistment in the Navy of men aged 18 to 37 ended on 5 December 1942; henceforth men in this age group could be obtained only through the draft. This cleared the way for absorption of the Army boat crews into the Navy. On 8 March 1943, the War and Navy Departments agreed that landing craft should be operated by the Navy, but exempted the three engineer special brigades allocated to SWPA. The 4th Engineer Special Brigade completed its training at Camp Edwards in August 1943, and then moved to Camp Gordon Johnston, where it conducted joint training with the 4th Infantry Division. After it departed for Australia in December 1943, the Engineer Amphibian Command provided instruction to replacement crews before being disbanded in April 1944.  1st Engineer Special Brigade  The 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Camp Edwards on 15 June 1942. Some 2,269 men were transferred from existing units, the 37th Engineer Combat Regiment providing the nucleus of the boat regiment, and the 87th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion that of the shore regiment. Brigadier General Henry C. Wolfe was assigned as commanding general on 7 July 1942. The brigade trained until 15 July, when it was assigned to the Amphibious Training Command. Monument for the 1st Engineer Special Brigade on Utah Beach The brigade was pulled from the Amphibious Training Center early and sent to England to participate in Operation Sledgehammer, departing from the New York Port of Embarkation on 5 August, and arriving on 17 August. Elements of the brigade participated in the Operation Torch. The 531st Shore Regiment and 286th Signal Company acted as the shore party for the 1st Infantry Division, while the 2nd Battalion, 591st Engineer Boat Regiment was reorganized as a shore battalion, and operated in support of Combat Command B, 1st Armored Division. Brigade headquarters departed Glasgow on 24 November, and landed in North Africa on 6 December. Wolfe became chief engineer at the Services of Supply on 22 February and Colonel R. L. Brown of the 531st Engineer Shore Regiment acted as commander. Wolfe rejoined the brigade on 22 March 1943, but on 25 May he became S-3 at Allied Force Headquarters, and was replaced by Colonel Eugene M. Caffey. On 10 May 1943, the brigade was redesignated the 1st Engineer Special Brigade. The 591st Boat Regiment was detached, as was the 561st Boat Maintenance Company, which remained in England working on Navy landing craft, but the 36th and 540th Engineer Combat Regiments were attached for the 10 July Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), bringing the strength of the brigade to over 20,000. The brigade then participated in the Allied invasion of Italy at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September. In November 1943, the headquarters of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, along with the 531st Shore Regiment, 201st Medical Battalion, 286th Signal Company, 262nd Amphibian Truck Battalion and 3497th Ordnance Medium Automotive Maintenance Company, returned to England to participate in the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). This nucleus of 3,346 men was built up to a strength of 15,000 men for Overlord. During Exercise Tiger, a rehearsal for the Normandy operation on 28 April, German E-Boats attacked a convoy of landing ships, tank (LSTs) of the XI Amphibious Force carrying troops of the brigade. Two LSTs were sunk, and the brigade lost 413 men dead and 16 wounded. The exercise was observed by Lieutenant General Omar N. Bradley, who, unaware of the sinking of the LSTs, blamed the resulting poor performance of the brigade on Caffey, and had him temporarily replaced for the Normandy landings by Brigadier General James E. Wharton. The brigade participated in the D-Day landing on Utah Beach, and operated as Utah Beach Command until 23 October 1944, and then as the Utah District of the Normandy Base Section until 7 December 1944. Under the command of Colonel Benjamin B. Talley, the brigade headquarters returned to England, and embarked for the United States on 23 December. It arrived at Fort Dix, New Jersey, on 30 December. After four weeks leave, it reassembled at Fort Lewis, Washington. Part of the brigade headquarters went by air to Leyte to join the XXIV Corps for the invasion of Okinawa, while the rest traveled directly to Okinawa on the . The brigade was in charge of unloading on Okinawa from 9 April to 31 May. It then prepared for the invasion of Japan. This did not occur due to the end of the war, and the brigade landed in Korea on 12 September 1945. Its final commander was Colonel Robert J. Kasper, who assumed command on 1 November 1945. The brigade was inactivated in Korea on 18 February 1946. On 30 September 1986, the brigade was reformed at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, as the 1st Engineer Brigade, and was assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. = Organization for the landing in Normandy= * Brigade Headquarters * 531st Engineer Shore Regiment * 24th Amphibian Truck Battalion ** 462nd Amphibian Truck Company ** 478th Amphibian Truck Company ** 479th Amphibian Truck Company * 306th Quartermaster Battalion ** 556th Quartermaster Railhead Company ** 562nd Quartermaster Railhead Company ** 3939th Quartermaster Gas Supply Co * 191st Ordnance Battalion ** 3497th Ordnance Medium Automotive Maintenance Company ** 625th Ordnance Ammunition Company * 161st Ordnance Platoon * 577th Quartermaster Battalion ** 363rd Quartermaster Service Company ** 3207th Quartermaster Service Company ** 4144th Quartermaster Service Company * 261st Medical Battalion (Amphibious) * 449th Military Police Company * 286th Joint Assault Signal Company * 33rd Chemical Decontamination Company = Campaign credits= * World War II ** Sicily ** Naples-Foggia ** Normandy (with arrowhead) ** Northern France ** Ryukyus  2nd Engineer Special Brigade  The 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Camp Edwards on 20 June 1942, with the 532nd Engineer Shore Regiment and 592nd Engineer Boat Regiment assigned. Colonel William F. Heavey, who was appointed its commander on 6 August 1942, and was promoted to brigadier general on 10 September, led the brigade for the rest of the war. It quickly expanded to 6,000 men, but lost 1,500 in September to the 540th Shore Regiment. On 1 October, the brigade was reorganized; the 532nd and 592nd became engineer amphibian regiments and the 542nd Engineer Amphibian Regiment was formed. The brigade, less the 542nd Engineer Amphibian Regiment, moved by rail to Camp Carrabelle on 15 October. On 7 November, the brigade moved to Fort Ord, California, where it was joined by the 542nd Engineer Amphibian Regiment the following day. In January and February 1943, the brigade embarked from the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on a series of vessels bound for Australia. The US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment lays beach mats to allow vehicles to move along the sand at Red Beach, near Lae In Australia, the brigade was based at Cairns, although its headquarters was co-located with that of I Corps in Rockhampton, away. The brigade helped the 411th Base Shop Battalion establish a landing craft construction facility, which produced its first finished LCVP on 7 April. In May, elements of the brigade began moving to New Guinea. A detachment of ten LCMs of the 592nd Engineer Amphibian Regiment went to Port Moresby, where it moved supplies to the Lakekamu River. They were followed by detachments of the 532nd and 542nd, which moved to Milne Bay, Oro Bay and Samarai. On 30 June, the brigade participated in its first amphibious operation, the landing at Nassau Bay. On 4 July, the brigade was renamed the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, and its three regiments became engineer boat and shore regiments. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade trained at Cairns with the Australian 9th Division in June and July 1943. The 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment then moved to New Guinea, and landed part of the 9th Division at Red Beach near Lae on 4 September. On 22 September, it landed elements of the 9th Division at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen. On 11 October, four Japanese barges attempted to land on Scarlet Beach. They were defeated by men of the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, including Private Junior Van Noy, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Over the next few months, units of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade participated in the landings at Arawe, Long Island, Saidor, Sio, Los Negros, Talasea, Hollandia, Wakde and Biak. On 20 October 1944 it participated in the amphibious assault on Leyte in the Philippines. Over the following months it participated in a series of amphibious operations to liberate the Philippines. Nine of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade's units were awarded Presidential Unit Citations. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade arrived back in San Francisco on 16 December 1945, and returned to Fort Ord. It later moved to Fort Worden, Washington, where it was stationed when the Korean War broke out in June 1950. The brigade moved to Yokohama, Japan, and participated in the landing at Inchon in September 1950. Afterwards it operated the ports of Suyong and Ulsan. The brigade was redesignated as the 2nd Amphibious Support Brigade on 26 June 1952. In December 1953 it moved to Camp McGill in Japan, where it was inactivated on 24 June 1955. The brigade was reactivated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 13 November 1956, and inactivated at Fort Story, Virginia, on 25 August 1965. It was reactivated as the 2nd Engineer Brigade at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, on 16 September 2011. Although no longer an amphibian brigade, it wore the World War II-era seahorse emblem until inactivated there on 15 May 2015. =World War II organization= * Brigade Headquarters * 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 562nd Engineer Boat Maintenance Battalion ** 1458th Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1459th Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1460th Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1570th Engineer Heavy Equipment Shop Company ** 1762nd Engineer Parts Supply Platoon * 262nd Medical Battalion * 162nd Ordnance Maintenance Company * 189th Quartermaster Gas Supply Company * 287th Signal Company * 695th Truck Company * 3498th Ordnance Medium Maintenance Company * 5204th Transportation Corps Amphibious Truck Company * Medical Detachment, 2nd Engineer Special Brigade * Support Battery (Provisional) 2nd Engineer Special Brigade * 416th Army Service Forces Band = Campaign credits= * World War II ** New Guinea ** Leyte (with arrowhead) * Korean War ** UN Defensive ** UN Offensive ** CCF Intervention ** First UN Counteroffensive ** CCF Spring Offensive ** UN Summer-Fall Offensive  3rd Engineer Special Brigade  Commanded for almost the entire war by Colonel David Ayres Depue Ogden, who was promoted to brigadier general on 18 September 1942, the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Camp Edwards on 6 August 1942 with the 533rd Engineer Shore Regiment and 593rd Engineer Boat Regiment assigned. On 9 November they became engineer amphibian regiments, and the 543rd Engineer Amphibian Regiment was assigned to the brigade. The brigade moved to Camp Gordon Johnston by rail in November. In April 1943 it relocated to Fort Ord, where it prepared to move to Australia. Due to shipping shortages and changes in priorities, this took six months. The brigade was redesignated the 3rd Engineer Special Brigade on 25 May 1943, and the amphibian regiments became engineer boats and shore regiments. The first unit of the brigade to reach New Guinea was the 563rd Engineer Boat Maintenance Battalion, which arrived at Milne Bay on 14 October 1943; the rest of the brigade followed in December 1943 and January 1944. The brigade became widely scattered, and never operated as a single unit, but Ogden retained control using a special radio net. It participated in the landings at Talasea, Aitape, Lingayen, and Borneo and Mindanao. The brigade returned to the United States on 20 December 1945, and was inactivated two days later. = World War II organization= * Brigade Headquarters * Medical Detachment * 533rd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 543rd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 593rd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 563rd Engineer Boat Maintenance Battalion ** HQ and HQ Detachment ** 1461st Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1462nd Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1463rd Engineer Maintenance Company ** 1571st Engineer Heavy Equipment Shop Company ** 1763rd Engineer Parts Supply Platoon * 263rd Medical Battalion * 163rd Ordnance Maintenance Company * 198th Quartermaster Gasoline Supply Company * 288th Signal Company * 693rd Truck Company * 3499th Ordnance Medium Maintenance Company * 417th Army Service Forces Band = Campaign honors= * World War II ** New Guinea  4th Engineer Special Brigade  The 4th Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Fort Devens on 1 February 1943, with the 534th, 544th and 594th Engineer Amphibian Regiments assigned. The brigade moved to Camp Edwards, where it was redesignated the 4th Engineer Special Brigade on 10 May, with the three regiments becoming engineer boat and shore regiments. The brigade moved to Camp Gordon Johnston in September 1943, and then staged at Camp Stoneman, California, on 21 April 1944, before departing the San Francisco Port of Embarkation for New Guinea on 28 April. Its commanding general throughout its lifetime was Colonel Henry Hutchings, Jr., who was promoted to brigadier general on 15 January 1944. The 4th Engineer Amphibian Brigade arrived at Oro Bay on 18 May 1944, where its headquarters opened on 23 May. Most of the rest of the brigade arrived in the area over the next few weeks, and participated in amphibious training with the 31st Infantry Division. The Boat Battalion of the 534th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment was sent to the Bulimba Boat Yards in Brisbane, where it was engaged in assembling landing craft. It participated in the assaults on Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies on 15 September 1944, and Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in the Philippines on 9 January 1945. It was inactivated in Japan on 15 April 1946. =World War II organization= * Brigade Headquarters * Medical Detachment * 534th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 544th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment * 564th Engineer Boat Maintenance Battalion * 264th Medical Battalion * 164th Ordnance Maintenance Company * 199th Quartermaster Gasoline Supply Company * 289th Signal Company * 694th Truck Company * 3492nd Ordnance Medium Maintenance Company * 4th Engineer Amphibian Brigade Band (August 1945 became 434th Army Service Forces Band attached to Sixth Army) =Campaign honors= * World War II: ** New Guinea ** Luzon  5th Engineer Special Brigade  5th Engineer Special Brigade monument on Omaha Beach The 336th Engineer General Service Regiment was activated at Camp Rucker, Alabama, on 25 July 1942, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William D. Bridges. On 7 April 1943, it was redesignated the 1119th Engineer Combat Group, with its 1st and 2nd Battalions becoming the 336th and 234th Engineer Combat Battalions respectively. The 1119th Engineer Combat Group moved to Fort Pierce, Florida, on 15 April, where the 348th Engineer Combat Battalion was assigned as the third battalion of the group on 21 April. The group moved to Camp Pickett, Virginia, on 16 June. The 234th Engineer Combat Battalion was detached on 15 August, and replaced by the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion on 22 August. The group staged for overseas movement at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts. It left the Boston Port of Embarkation on 21 October, and arrived in the UK on 1 November. It was redesignated the 5th Engineer Special Brigade on 12 November 1943 at Swansea, Wales. The following day, Colonel William M. Hoge assumed command of the brigade. Unlike the brigades in the Pacific, those in the European Theater had no boat units, although they did have additional service units to handle cargo over the beaches. When Hoge stepped up to command the provisional Special Brigade Group, he was replaced by Colonel Doswell Gullatt. For the invasion of Normandy, the brigade had a strength of 6,756 men. It landed on Omaha Beach, where it was responsible for the eastern beaches, Easy Red, Fox Green and Fox Red. Gullatt was hospitalized due to illness in July 1944, and Bridges assumed command on 31 July. The brigade operated Omaha Beach until it was closed on 19 November 1944. On 4 January 1945, the brigade was transferred to the Seine Section of Paris, where it supervised construction activities. It returned to the United States on 11 July 1945, and was inactivated at Camp Gordon Johnston on 20 October of that year. =Units assigned on D-Day, 6 June 1944= * Brigade Headquarters * 37th Engineer Combat Battalion * 336th Engineer Combat Battalion * 348th Engineer Combat Battalion * 61st Medical Battalion ** 391st Medical Collection Company ** 392nd Medical Collection Company ** 395th Medical Collection Company ** 643rd Medical Clearing Company * 210th Military Police Company * 30th Chemical Decontamination Company * 294th Joint Assault Signal Company * 251st Ordnance Battalion **616th Ordnance Ammunition Company **3566th Ordnance Medium Automotive Maintenance Company **26th Bomb Disposal Squad **4042nd Quartermaster Truck Company * 533rd Quartermaster Battalion **4141st Quartermaster Service Company **4142nd Quartermaster Service Company **4143rd Quartermaster Service Company * 131st Quartermaster Battalion (Mobile) ** 453rd Amphibian Truck Company ** 458th Amphibian Truck Company ** 459th Amphibian Truck Company * 619th Quartermaster Battalion ** 97th Quartermaster Railhead Company ** 559th Quartermaster Railhead Company ** Co.

It staged at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, before departing the New York Port of Embarkation on 8 January 1944. It arrived in the UK on 17 January, where it was redesignated the 6th Engineer Special Brigade on 15 May. The brigade participated in the invasion of Normandy, operating the western end of Omaha Beach, the Charlie, Dog and Easy Green beaches. The brigade lost its commander, Colonel Paul W. Thompson, who was seriously wounded on D-Day, and he was replaced by Colonel Timothy L. Mulligan. It operated Omaha Beach until it was closed on 19 November. The brigade then became responsible for the security of the western coast of the Cotentin Peninsula. On 29 December the brigade was assigned to the Advance Section (ADSEC), where it was responsible for construction and road maintenance. On 28 March 1945, it was made responsible for coal mining. On 14 July the brigade headquarters, without any troops, embarked at Le Havre for the United States.

A composite platoon from the battalion went to England with the 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade. It departed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 17 January 1943, and arrived in Australia on 30 January. It moved to Cairns where it operated an assembly plant for LCVPs. On 5 June 1944 it moved to Milne Bay, where it operated a facility that assembled the larger LCMs. It was redesignated the 411th Engineer Special Shop Battalion on 1 November 1944. On 16 December it moved to Batangas in the Philippines, where a new LCM assembly plant was established. It returned to the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 4 February 1946, and was inactivated at Camp Stoneman, California, two days later. = 692nd Engineer Special Shop Battalion = The 692nd Engineer Base Shop Battalion was formed at Camp Edwards on 15 May 1943. It was redesignated the 692nd Special Shop Battalion on 12 August. It departed the New Orleans Port of Embarkation on 10 February 1944, and arrived at Milne Bay on 25 February, where it assisted the 411th Engineer Base Shop Battalion in the operation of the LCM assembly plant there. It followed it to Batangas on 17 June 1945. It returned to the Los Angeles Port of Embarkation on 25 January 1945, and was inactivated at Camp Anza, California, two days later.

The school would later expand and change names several times until deciding on the current name, San Diego State University. The history of San Diego State University began in the late 19th century with the establishment of a normal school in San Diego, California. Founded on March 13, 1897, the school opened on November 1, 1898 with a class of 135 students. By 1921, the school had become San Diego State Teachers College, allowing it to grant certificates and degrees. Due to the increased student enrollment, the college was relocated to its current location at the east side of Mission Valley, with classes beginning in February 1931. The government works programs during the Great Depression assisted in construction of numerous buildings on the new campus. World War I and II both affected student enrollment, and led many students and faculty members to serve in the armed forces. By the end of the 1950s, the student population was at 10,000, and the renamed San Diego State College was now the fourth largest California state institution. In the 1960s and 1970s the campus saw increased enrollment, the accreditation of its professional schools, multiple incidents of student activism, and on January 1, 1974, a new name: San Diego State University (SDSU). By 1987, the university's population peaked at nearly 36,000 students and attained the status of the largest university in California and tenth in the nation. Recently, the university has worked to improve its academic rankings, and faced adversities including a school shooting and a large drug bust. As the university continues to grant numerous degrees in various fields, it has developed several construction plans for replacement of some of its older buildings and infrastructure. Establishment Samuel T. Black in 1905 In the late 1890s, San Diego officials believed that a normal school should be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers.Starr, p. 15 The tuition and travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school.Starr, p. 18 San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd.Engstrand, p. 114 On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 to allow for the establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300. The Board of Trustees for San Diego Normal School was established by Budd and first met on June 3, 1897. They appointed Samuel T. Black, who had previously served as the California Superintendent for Public Instruction, as president of the new school by unanimous decision on October 1, 1898. On January 21, 1898, the San Diego firm Hebbard and Gill was selected to design the new school building. The architect Irving Gill, who developed the building in a Beaux-Arts style, was responsible for the design. The ground was broken for construction on August 1, the cornerstone of the building was laid on December 10, and the building was dedicated on May 1, 1899.Starr, p. 21 During the building's construction, the first classes were held at the Hill Block on the southwest corner of 6th and F street in downtown San Diego beginning on November 1, 1898. The classes moved to the Normal School in May 1899, even as construction continued. 135 students (90% of whom were women), were enrolled by the end of the first year; enrollment grew to 400 by 1910. In the summer of 1899, San Diego Normal School became the first California normal school to offer summer courses, and maintained this position until 1913.Starr, p. 22 On June 21, 1900, the first class was graduated: 23 women and three men. Later that year, the east wing of the initial building was finished, adding 18 rooms. In 1903, $61,000 was appropriated by the state for a west wing; it included a gym, library, laboratories, lecture rooms, and a museum. The west wing was completed in September 1904. In 1906, the California legislature required that students have a high school diploma in order to be admitted to a normal school. This was the same requirement as for entry into the University of California. San Diego Normal School in 1904 In 1910, Samuel Black resigned, and was replaced by Edward L. Hardy, who had previously served as the principal of San Diego High School.Starr, p. 33 He increased the faculty size from 19 to 27 in 1912 to meet the demands of increased enrollment.Starr, p. 34 The annual salary for the president increased to $4,000 (from $3,400) in 1915 and salaries for the faculty and administration ranged from $600-2,500 (compared to the national average of $687 for all industries except for farm labor). Hardy argued for the pay increases, claiming increases would \\"give merited and much needed relief...[and] will be entirely justified by the increased good of the service.\\" More buildings were added after appropriations of funds in 1907 and total expenditures for the campus reached $312,000.Starr, p. 35 Even with the expansion, by 1910 space was limited, so the training school dropped the high school program, although it still taught the elementary and intermediate grades (7th and 8th grades). In 1914, of the 136 new students for the school year, 17 were from California counties (excluding San Diego), while 26 were from other states.Starr, p. 36 This proportion would remain common throughout the school's history as the majority of its students were from the San Diego area. World War I World War I had a large impact on the school. A newfound sense of patriotism had the administration require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance as an entrance requirement to the school.Starr, p. 45 The war also had an effect on enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training.Starr, p. 46 On campus, both students and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas. During this period, Hardy pushed the notion of granting the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under the management of the State Department of Education. On July 28, 1921, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College (usually shortened to San Diego State College or SDS).Starr, p. 47 With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city.Starr, p. 48 Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego Junior College, that was a part of San Diego High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent. On June 30, 1923 the legislature allowed the college to begin granting Bachelor of Arts degrees, which included accountancy, agriculture, and industrial engineering. On July 1, 1927, the junior college courses became lower-division courses and on July 12, 1928 the State Board of Education granted the college the ability to offer credentials in secondary education with majors in English, history, chemistry, and the Romance languages.Starr, p. 53 Move to current location The Normal School was initially built for a maximum capacity of 600 students. Hardy proposed in 1922 building on a new campus at a plot at Park Boulevard (near Balboa Park), which was rejected by San Diego voters.Showley, p. 85 However, the California legislature authorized a move to a new site in 1925 if San Diego was willing to buy the old school building and provide a new site. The following year the Citizen's Advisory Committee, a 21-member committee led by Mayor John L. Bacon, initially recommended the northeast part of Balboa Park that would be located over , but the location was voted down by San Diego voters. In 1927, another location was selected, this time in Encanto, but was also voted down.Starr, p. 69 In total, ten locations would be proposed before the final location was chosen. By June 1928, the Bell-Lloyd Investment Company offered at Mission Palisades, $50,000, and a promise to build a road connecting the site to El Cajon Blvd. The site was located at the east side of Mission Valley, about away from the old site. The group proposed the site in hopes of it being the center of a new retail and housing development.Starr, p. 70 Before the new site could be built, San Diego voters had to approve of buying the old site, which it did overwhelmingly on May 15, 1928. After the move to the new campus, the old Normal School building was used for Horace Mann Junior High and administrative offices. In 1955, it was demolished to make room for a new wing of an administrative building.Starr, p. 146 George B. McDougall was selected as the supervising architect and the State Department of Architecture for Public Buildings designed the new campus. The initial planned cost was $7.5 million. On October 7, 1929 classes were dismissed early so all current students could attend the groundbreaking held on that day.Starr, p. 72 Pettifer & Hupt was selected as the construction firm, and it completed several buildings by September 1930.Starr, p. 73 The first classes made up of 1,220 students were held at Montezuma Mesa in February 1931.Starr, p. 77 The Great Depression, although negative to the local economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, as the federal government made money available for construction projects in an attempt to stimulate the economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works.Starr, p. 94Starr, p. 96 Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.Starr, p. 86-87 In June 1935, President Hardy retired and was replaced by Walter R. Hepner. The bell tower on campus was named in honor of Hardy in 1976.Starr, p. 92 On September 15, 1935, as a result of the California legislature dropping \\"teachers\\" from the names of state colleges, San Diego State Teachers College became San Diego State College (SDSC).Starr, p. 91 In 1935 the college began offering engineering courses. During that period, the college acquired $18,000 from the state for the purpose of purchasing an additional .Starr, p. 97 World War II Just as World War I had a significant impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 to a low of 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun.Starr, p. 109 Before the war was over, 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly for a city dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and battles over the Philippines and the East Indies.Starr, p. 110 In 1942, the campus became a War Information Center, one of 140 in the nation. The center was established to boost civilian morale and practice air raid drills. Rationing on campus of sugar, gas, soft drinks, and paper became common throughout the war. Classes were cut back due to the limited staff and the courses were shifted to more scientific and technological emphasis.Starr, p. 112 The majority of the sports were canceled during the war and various drives were held to increase supplies sent to troops.Starr, p. 113 As the war neared its end, enrollment increased, until it reached 2,000 students in 1946. Nearly half of these students were veterans from the war, and they received a monthly stipend to assist with housing and tuition costs.Starr, p. 121 Sports and activities resumed to their prior levels and by the end of the 1940s, the faculty had expanded to 230 personnel and 40 part-time staff.Starr, p. 123 In 1946, Hepner grouped the various disciplines into seven divisions: Education, Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. In 1950, the college awarded its first master's degree, and by the end of the decade offered master's degrees in 38 areas.Starr, p. 135 On May 23, 1947, Governor Earl Warren signed legislation making SDSC an official four-year liberal arts institution.Starr, p. 125 Postwar changes and expansion In 1952 President Hepner retired, and was replaced by Malcolm A. Love, who previously served as president of the University of Nevada (since 1950). At this point, the college had more than 4,800 students, 222 faculty members, offered 27 majors, had a budget of $2.01 million and contributed more than $14 million to the local San Diego economy.Starr, p. 131 By the end of the 1950s, the student population was over 10,000, placing it as the fourth largest California state institution and larger than 96% of the U.S.‚Äôs colleges and universities at the time. In 1957, entering freshmen scores on examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college's scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became the first to use an identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and other tasks of the large number of students. To keep up with student expansion, the square footage of the buildings and classrooms was increased from 255,434 to 1,243,737.Starr, p. 132-34 In 1959, the school began offering classes at Central Union High School in El Centro as part of its Imperial Valley branch. The campus remained focused on teacher training until the mid-1970s. In 1960, the school became the first California state college to have an educational radio station, KPBS-FM. Before World War II, less than 25% of the faculty had doctorates, and in an attempt to reach university status for the school, the 1956 Statement of General Policy on Employment of Faculty stipulated that incoming faculty had to have their doctorates (or soon receive one) in order to be hired. By the end of the 1950s, 56% of permanent faculty had doctorates.Starr, p. 136 By the beginning of 1965 this had increased to 68%.Starr, p. 155 During the Red Scare, psychology professor Harry C. Steinmetz was accused of being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about whether or not he was a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.Starr, p. 137 On July 1, 1961 as a result of the Donahue Act, SDSC became a part of the California State College system which included a new set of regulations for the school, along with a statewide board of trustees and a chancellor. The school continued to grow, with a population of 10,700 in 1960 and 25,500 in 1970. The San Diego county administrator Fred Morey reflected on so many graduates being hired by the county: \\"We would find it difficult to keep the County running without the help of San Diego State.\\" John F. Kennedy, then the U.S. President, gave the graduation commencement address at Aztec Bowl in front of 40,000 people on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making San Diego State the first in California to award an honorary doctorate degree. To commemorate his visit, the campus added his portrait to the campus library collection and a granite stone marker placed where his helicopter landed (California Historical Landmark #798).Starr, p. 154 In April 2008, a plaque that commemorated his visit was stolen and has yet to be recovered. On May 29, 1964 Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the Open Air Theater about proposed legislation in improving rights for African Americans. In 1965, San Diego State began offering a doctorate in chemistry in a joint effort with University of California, San Diego. By 1991, the campus had eight different doctorate programs.Starr, p. 156 Research became a vital practice of the faculty during the 1960s. By 1965, more than 200 books had been authored by SDSC faculty. Federal research grants increased from $398,202 in 1961 to $1,184,387 in 1967. Faculty research included medical and scientific research, teacher enhancement, Peace Corps training, and a review of nursing curricula. In 1966, the Carnegie Corporation named President Love one of the best college Presidents in the country.Special Collections and University Archives: Malcolm A. Love Papers, 1937-1971 President Love changed the structure of the college, developing its divisions into professional schools, which would allow them to be accredited. The schools were developed into colleges, which increased the possibility of SDSC of becoming a university. He reflected on San Diego State's progress in a Time magazine article: \\"Though we are called a college, we are in deed and in fact a university.\\"Starr, p. 157 Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s there were numerous protests, sit-ins, and radical changes in traditions among the students. Author Raymond Starr called this period \\"...the liveliest, most colorful, and most challenging in State‚Äôs history.\\"Starr, p. 165-74 Students mainly protested racism and the war in Vietnam. In March 1970, 600 students held a week-long sit-in in protest of the decision of the campus leaders not to rehire four radical instructors. Protests expanded to the presence of Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), military recruiters, the Police Community Relations Training Institute, among others. Significant speakers visited the campus during the time including Cesar Chavez, Jane Fonda, Angela Davis, Donald Freed, Joan Baez, and Jerry Brown. On April 20, 1972, 75 demonstrators took ROTC students hostage while they were taking an examination in the Business Administration and Math building. Although there was some violence, the students were released peacefully.Starr, p. 176-178 On May 3, 1972, 35 protesters (later growing to 2,000) smashed windows of the Administration building and burned copies of The Daily Aztec, the student newspaper. Protesters eventually entered the locked building and set fires on the first floor, and moved on to Aztec Center to set more fires and break windows. The mayhem resulted in six injuries and several thousand dollars in damages. On May 24, 1972 a bomb exploded in Tarastec Hall, injuring Lawrence Jackson, an African American student. A group of African American students marched on campus to show support for Jackson.Starr, p. 179 The first women's studies program in the United States was established in 1970 at the college, after a year of intense organizing of women's consciousness raising groups, rallies, petition circulating, and operating unofficial or experimental classes and presentations before seven committees and assemblies. In early 1971, President Love retired. With the extraordinary growth of students, faculty and facilities, there were plans for new library to be named in honor of him, which was dedicated in May 1971. After a brief unsuccessful nomination of Walter Waetjen to replace Dr. Love, and Academic Vice President Walker acting as president for 1971-72, Brage Golding became the new president. He served from 1972 to 1977, and although he did not implement any mainstream changes as prior presidents had, he was instrumental in bringing in qualified administrators who would improve the school during its upcoming years. He worked to establish the San Diego History Research Center for collecting materials on the city's history and established the Educational Growth Opportunities program which offered classes for older people. At Golding's leaving of the university, one person commented: \\"By the end of the five-year administration, San Diego State University had grown into the institution implied by its name. This was the mark that Brage Golding left on San Diego State University.\\"Starr, p. 187 & 190 Golding left to lead Kent State, and with a brief intermission of Academic Vice President Trevor Colbourn serving as president, Thomas B. Day became the sixth president in 1978. When Proposition 13 passed, the school faced budget issues and Day proposed abolishing some departments, combining others, and laying off approximately 80 faculty members. However, budget cuts were deemed not necessary, and on April 8, 1980, Day again proposed cutting 115 faculty members and four departments due to foreseeing upcoming budget cuts; on May 16, 1980 he recanted his comments.Starr, p. 192 President Love had fought hard throughout his tenure to increase SDSC's ranking from a college to a university. In 1972, the California legislature approved the renaming of the school to \\"California State University, San Diego\\". San Diego State officials were still not happy with the name, and on January 1, 1974, it was renamed to \\"San Diego State University\\" (SDSU), its current name.Starr, p. 187 Modern history Stephen Weber, SDSU's former president, speaking in December 2007 In 1987, the school reached its peak attendance with 35,945 students, resulting in SDSU being the largest university in California and 10th in the nation. Due to the overwhelming number of students and available facilities and majors, the California State University Board of Trustees decided to limit enrollment to 33,000. However, in 1993, enrollment dropped to 26,800, the lowest attendance since 1973 as a result of the budget crisis of 1991.Starr, p. 193 In 1984, the California Higher Education Journal ranked SDSU as first among the CSU campuses and U.S. News and World Report ranked the school among the top five comprehensive universities in the west in 1983, third in 1985, and in the top fifteen in 1989. In the 1980s, the College of Business' School of Accountancy was the only accredited accountancy program in California. Throughout the decade students scored the highest score on the Certified Public Accountancy (CPA) exam three times, and by 1990 was second in the nation (after the University of Texas) for graduates passing the CPA exam. In January 1987, Playboy ranked SDSU as the 3rd best party school in the nation, which appalled some administrators, and amused students. The ranking was determined on a number of factors including the education offered at the university, social opportunities, the male-female ratio, and off-campus activities located near the campus. Some students feared that the ranking would diminish the quality of their degree.Starr, p. 194 In 2002 it dropped to tenth place, and in 2005 was included again without a specific rank, before jumping to fifth place in 2006. The Graduate School of Public Health was first offered to students in 1981, and was one of only 24 accredited schools of public health in the nation and the only one in the CSU system in 1995. President Day considered it the major achievement of his administration, and it provided training in hospitals, public health agencies, health maintenance organizations, ambulatory care, and mental health facilities.Starr, p. 195 In the 1990s, the College of Business was the fourth largest undergraduate program in the U.S.Starr, p. 198 By 1989-90 SDSU was granting over 1,100 Master's degrees and 10 doctoral degrees a year.Starr, p. 201 As a result of the California state government proposed budget cuts to the CSU campuses, 1991 to 1994 at SDSU were marked by a long period of university budget stress, faculty unrest/layoffs, and student protests against SDSU fee increases and class cuts. Spring of 1991 brought large fee increases and budget cuts by the governor and state legislature to the California State University (CSU) and University of California (UC) systems impacted SDSU in a unique way. While other schools in the systems chose an across the board approach on campus, the president of SDSU at the time, Thomas Day, chose to use a \\"deep and narrow\\" approach to program cuts. The result were largest student marches and protests since the Vietnam war. Yet again in Spring 1992, the CSU and UC systems were facing another round of severe budget cuts and dramatic student fee increases by the state government. Still a second time, SDSU President Thomas Day took the same deep and narrow approach for budget cuts for SDSU, but this time proposed elimination of not only full-time faculty professors, but of entire majors such as Aerospace Engineering. In and attempt to alleviate fears of students in those majors, a large meeting by President Day was planned in the student center with hundreds of students and teachers. However, meeting quickly turned angry and chaotic with an overcapacity crowd pressing against the glass windows outside. Following the meeting, students feeling betrayed a 2nd time after 1991, about a dozen students held a temporary occupation of President Day's office. This occupation led to a 24-hour vigil in front of the Administration building, summer student bus trips to the state legislature in Sacramento, large campus student voter registration drive, and further student marches and protests in the Fall 1992. Under heavy student, teacher, and public pressure, the conclusion of these events ended with CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz eventually reversing President Day's deep and narrow approach, saving the majors and programs in Fall 1992. Early picture of \\"Student Free Speech Wall\\" during protests. Spring 1991. Close up of one of the student political art paintings on wall. Spring 1991. Central and parallel to the SDSU student protest movement was an 8 foot high wooden construction fence that encircled the a new campus building. Students quickly put up protest messages, paintings, and cartoons urging students to rally, vote, and challenge the school president. Citing a need to \\"clean up\\" the campus during graduation of 1991, President Day attempted to paint over the now symbolic construction fence wall. The night before the attempted wall paint over by President Day, a large police force arrested eight students peacefully sitting in front of the wall. The next morning, word quickly gathered on campus about the arrests and dozens of student rushed to sit in front of the wall ultimately stopping the painters. On May 1994, the student government dedicated a permanent memorial to the wall in Pfiefer Lounge (later a Starbucks and now the new Student Center) a few yards from the wall's edge. The student memorial to the protests included the wall painting of President Day's head in a guillotine. When President Day retired in July 1996, SDSU's incoming freshman had a 38% success rate in graduating from the university within six years. Day was replaced by the university's seventh president, Stephen Weber. Just one month later, on August 15, in what is known as the San Diego State University shooting, a 36-year-old graduate student pulled out a handgun while defending his thesis and killed three professors. The student pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence prison term. On August 23, 2003, a memorial was dedicated to the three professors that included three trees along with a set of three tables and benches. Pedestrian bridge completed in 2003 that connects dorms to main campus On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station opened on the SDSU campus, after construction began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability of parking around campus. The $103 million station was just one of the university's several construction projects that occurred in the 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project led to the development of the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space. In June 2007, SDSU was deemed the number one small research university in the nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus usually has around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 study revealed that the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion on the San Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic impact is expected to increase to $4.5 billion by 2025. On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced the arrest of 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, on a variety of drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority of the defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed. In 2010, after 15 years as president, Weber announced his upcoming retirement for the following year. Weber was credited for improving the graduation rate; in 2003, 66% of freshmen were graduating within six years. In May 2011, University of Maryland Baltimore County senior vice president Elliot Hirshman was named by the CSU Board of Trustees to replace Weber. Hirshman assumed his appointed role as president in July. After the departure of the San Diego Chargers for Los Angeles in 2017, SDSU endeavored to gain control of the city stadium (then called Qualcomm Stadium) and surrounding city property, which is just across the freeway from the main campus and where SDSU football games are played. The proposal, called SDSU West, was put to city voters in November 2017 where it won approval by 54% of those voting, easily beating out a competing commercial proposal called SoccerCity. Negotiations began for SDSU to purchase the property from the city of San Diego. On May 29, 2020, the city council gave conceptual approval to sell 135 acres, including the stadium, to San Diego State for $88 million. SDSU hopes to break ground for a new 35,000 seat stadium in August 2020. The stadium will house SDSU football games as well other NCAA games, professional soccer and special events such as concerts. The entire $3.5 billion project, which includes housing, office and retail space, hotels, and 80 acres of parks and open space including a 34 acre river park on city property, will be rolled out in phases over 15 years.

Overview The effectiveness of comics as medium for effective learning and development has been the subject of debate since the origin modern comic book in the 1930s. Sones (1944) notes that comics \\"evoked more than a hundred critical articles in educational and non- professional periodicals.\\" The use of comics in education would later attract the attention of Fredric Wertham who noted that the use of comics in education represented \\"an all-time low in American science.\\" It has been noted that the use of a narrative form such as a comic \\"can foster pupils' interest in science\\" and help students remember what they have learnt and providing a means of fostering discussion. However, it has also been noted that many educators remain \\"ambivalent\\" about the use of comic books as an educational tool. Comics have also been used as a medium to communicate health care information on subjects such as diabetes. In 1978, Pendulum Press published a primer on the value of comics as an educational tool: The Illustrated Format: an Effective Teaching Tool (). In the US, the use of comics for education, using the Internet, can be seen on Comics in the Classroom, and the state of Maryland's Comic Book Initiative.

He continued his studies at Cambridge University in 1929, and the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad in 1930, where he met his future wife, Cynthia. He worked with the Department of Agriculture in British Guiana between 1931 and 1936. In 1937 he was appointed to the Pasture Research Section of the Department of Agriculture in Pretoria. In 1941 he was awarded a D.Sc degree by the University of South Africa. In 1945 he assumed the post of Officer-in-Charge at the Prinshof Experiment Station in the Division of Botany, where he was involved with the selection, growing and testing of pasture grasses. At the same time he was in charge of the Botanical Survey of South Africa. While stationed at Prinshof he frequently visited the Kruger National Park on plant collecting trips. He saw the need for an informal botanical guide to the reserve and in 1951 produced \\"Trees and Shrubs of the Kruger National Park\\", one of the most popular items in the series Memoirs of the Botanical Survey of South Africa. With librarian Mary Gunn, he co-authored Botanical Exploration of Southern Africa in 1981, a history of the country's plant collecting, collectors and early botanical illustrations, with a follow up in 1985. Gunn was known for specialising in non-contemporary botanists. A student once asked her a question about a contemporary botanist to which she replied \\"...I only deal with dead botanists, either kill him off or ask Codd next door!\\" He succeeded Robert Allen Dyer as director of the Botanical Research Institute from 1963 until his retirement in 1973, and worked in the Flora Research Section thereafter.

The name derives from Latin circum (around) and Pane (the Peene River). The region was enclosed roughly by the upper Recknitz, Trebel and Peene rivers, the western border ran east of G√ºstrow. The region developed in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was the tribal territory of the Circipanes (), a West Slavic tribe which along with the neighboring tribes was a part of the Lutici federation. The main burghs were Teterow, Malchin, and Demmin. In 936, the Circipania was incorporated into the Billung March of the Holy Roman Empire. The Circipanes were one of the four constituent tribes of the Lutici federation centered on Rethra, which started a successful uprising in 983. Rid of the empire's overlordship, the Circipanes stayed with the Liutizians until the federation broke apart due to internal struggles in the 1050s, culminating dissolution in 1057. The Redarians and Tollensians opposed the Circipanes and Kessinians struggling for more influence within the federative administration, and allied with the Obodrites. The Obodrites successfully invaded Circipania and made it a province of their realm. The internal struggles had weakened the area, such that in the following year it became the target of numerous expeditions of an expansive Holy Roman Empire during their Wendish Crusade in 1147), then by Denmark in the raid of 1170, and finally by the Duchy of Pomerania which subdued and incorporated the area into Pomerania-Demmin in the late 12th century. The last of the territory was invaded by Mecklenburg and subdued in the early 1230s. The 1230s marked the end of Circipania as a distinct territory as well as the end of the Circipanes. Pomerania-Demmin was in a miserable position and lost most of the territory to the Margrave of Brandenburg in the Treaty of Kremmen in 1236. Thus, Pomerania-Demmin could not counter the Mecklenburgian advance led by Borwin III of Rostock. Circipania would stay divided with Mecklenburg controlling the western bulk with G√ºstrow and Teterow, and Pomerania controlling the eastern smaller part around Demmin. Later the Mecklenburg part divided into Mecklenburg-Rostock and Mecklenburg-Werle, and the name Circipania dropped out of use. Though Circipania vanished as a name from political maps, it was still visible on Roman Catholic ecclesiastic maps as the Pomeranian province of the Diocese of Cammin, because the borders of this province did not differ from that of Circipania and remained as they were before the conquest. The Circipanes, whose numbers already dwindled due to the previous warfare, were assimilated by the German settlers called in by Wartislaw III, Duke of Pomerania before the Mecklenburg conquest, and by Mecklenburg knights during the Ostsiedlung.

It is the first Japanese missile system that uses a complete digitally controlled interface.  History  Development of the Type 96 system began in 1986 by JGSDF Ground Research and Development Command.  Description  The Type 96 missile has a large warhead which can destroy most tanks with a direct hit from the top, but it can also be used in an anti-helicopter role. The missile is guided by an operator with an infrared image monitor in the launch vehicle. An optical fiber connects the flying missile's infrared camera and its guidance system. It can also be fired vertically and the fibre-optic cable is paid out from the back of the missile as it flies. The warhead is too big for use by attack tanks because it is also designed to destroy landing craft (LCAC). Japanese officers estimate that no tank can survive a direct hit to the weak point of its top armor by the Type 96 Multi-Purpose Missile System. This is a result of the missile striking the tank from the top, which is not so heavily armoured as the front and side sections of the tank.

When she was a child, Isabel was imprisoned in Barking Abbey, along with her mother and half-sister, after her stepfather had joined the Earl of Lancaster's ill-fated rebellion against King Edward II. Her husband was Henry Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Groby.The Complete Peerage,v.XII,pII,p.252.  Family and lineage  Isabel was born at Amesbury Priory, Wiltshire, on 21 March 1317, the only child of the marriage of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun, Justiciar of Ireland (born 8 September 1278) and Lady Elizabeth de Clare. She was born eight months after her father died of typhoid on 27 July 1316. He and Elizabeth had been engaged before she was called back to England by Edward II, intent on marrying her to one of his own supporters. So Theobald abducted Elizabeth from Bristol Castle in early 1316, and married her shortly afterwards on 4 February. Elizabeth was his second wife, his first wife having been Maud Mortimer (c.1289- 18 September 1312). Isabel had three half-sisters from her father's prior marriage, Joan de Verdun, Elizabeth de Verdun, and Margery de Verdun. Isabel, along with her three de Verdon half-sisters, was a co-heiress of her father. She is occasionally referred to as Heiress of Ludlow. Theobald was Elizabeth's second husband, her first husband John de Burgh had died in a minor skirmish in Galway, Ireland on 18 June 1313. She had a son by de Burgh, William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (17 September 1312- 6 June 1333), who was Isabel's uterine half-brother. William would later marry Maud of Lancaster, by whom he had a daughter Elizabeth de Burgh, suo jure 4th Countess of Ulster (6 July 1332- 10 December 1363). Following the death of her brother Gilbert at Bannockburn in 1314, Elizabeth, along with her two sisters, Margaret and Eleanor, became one of the greatest heiresses in England. Her uncle, King Edward II of England, ordered her to return to England, where he planned to select a husband for her from among his supporters. She was placed in Bristol Castle where Verdun would afterwards abduct her, to the fury of King Edward. After her husband's death, Elizabeth, pregnant with Verdun's child, fled to Amesbury Priory and placed herself under the protection of her aunt, Mary de Burgh, who was one of the nuns. It was there that she gave birth to Isabel. Isabel's birth is recorded in an entry of King Edward II's Wardrobe Accounts, as well as the King's gift of a silver- gilt cup which valued at one pound, ten shillings. Her paternal grandparents were Theobald de Verdun, 1st Lord Verdun and Margery de Bohun, and her maternal grandparents were Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 3rd Earl of Gloucester, and Joan of Acre, the daughter of King Edward I of England and Eleanor of Castile. Despenser War and imprisonment On 3 May 1317, when Isabel was just about six weeks old, her mother married Sir Roger D'Amory, Lord D'Amory, Baron of Armoy (c.1290- 14 March 1322) a favourite of King Edward II, who encouraged the match. Isabel's wardship and marriage rights were awarded to her stepfather. From her mother's marriage to D'Amory, Isabel had a uterine half-sister, Elizabeth D'Amory, (born shortly before 23 May 1318- 5 February 1361), who would later marry Sir John Bardolf, by whom she had issue. Following D'Amory's participation in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion of 1322, against his former friend and patron, the King and the latter's new favourites, the Despensers, Isabel's wardship and marriage rights were forfeit to the Crown and eventually passed to Queen Isabella. Isabel's aunt Eleanor de Clare was married to Hugh le Despenser the Younger, who had angered her stepfather after seizing the larger portion of the vast de Clare inheritance for himself. On account of Despenser's greed and increasing influence over the king, D'Amory joined forces with Roger Mortimer and the other disgruntled Marcher Lords becoming one of the key figures in the resulting Despenser War. Roger D'Amory died on 14 March 1322, two days before the Battle of Boroughbridge where Lancaster and the rebels were defeated by the Royalist forces. Isabel, not quite five years old, together with her sister Elizabeth and her mother, was imprisoned at Barking Abbey.  Marriage Isabel married Henry Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Groby (b. before 1303, d. 15 September 1343) in 1328 at Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire. He was the son of William Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Groby and Ellen de Seagrove. She was eleven years old at the time of her marriage. The marriage produced at least five children, four of whom survived infancy. Following the birth of her eldest child in February 1331, when Isabel was not quite 14 years of age, her mother sent her presents for her \\"churching\\". This was a special religious ceremony performed for the benefit of a woman shortly after childbirth. The child, whose sex was not recorded, died in early infancy. =Issue= * Infant (b.

Common grey problems are: * Intermittent errors; * Intermittent incorrect output, or; * Transient performance problems. Because the causing technology is not clear, IT departments often find it difficult to allocate the problem to a Technical Support Team (platform team). Figure 1 - Problem Complexity  Background  Combining frequency and causing technology information can provide a view of the complexity of a problem and so indicate how difficult it will be to investigate (see Figure 1). The problems in each quadrant have certain characteristics: Q1 - In a typical IT department 80 to 90% of problems are solid faults that are easily tracked down to a causing technology. The appropriate technical or platform support team efficiently deals with these problems every day. Q2 - Some recurring problems are due to a Known Error, or are obviously being caused by a particular hardware or software component. These problems are handled by technical support people working with suppliers. Q3 - Every so often a one-off problem occurs, and the cause of these may never be found. Q4 ‚Äì The technical ownership of these issues is unclear and so they are referred to as ‚Äúgrey problems‚Äù i.e. not black and white.  Impact  Grey problems have a significant impact on IT service, and: * Form the bulk of ongoing recurring problems * Create a disproportionately high IT support workload * Give a pointer to more serious problems to come * Cause the business to adjust practices around the problem  Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) perspective  Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Service Operations implies that grey problems should be handled through a Problem Solving Group under the direction of the Problem Management function. In practice, even those IT organisations that have adopted ITIL rarely have a procedure to handle a grey problem, leaving it to bounce between Technical Support Teams as each denies that their technology is to blame.

Its most prominent feature is the 489 metre peak of Mount Nimmel. It lies at co-ordinates latitude: , longitude: and is away from Carrara, an inland suburb of the Gold Coast near Nerang. It was the western border of the Austinville banana plantation before the settlement was all but abandoned in the 1930s. Historic Significance The Nimmel Range was the western border of the Austinville banana plantation started in 1934 and abandoned in 1939. Earlier, in the very early 1900s, before Springbrook Road was built, early settlers sought to provide access to Springbrook Mountain from the coast. Jim Hardy and George Trapp, two pioneers of the day, tried following the ridge that separates the east and west branches of Little Nerang Creek, reached the join, turned east and found that the Nimmel Range blocked their path. The road was completed by skirting around the foot of Mount Nimmel and continuing to Springbrook. To this day, Springbrook Road remains the sole link from the mountain to the rest of the Gold Coast.

Balcon, who had run the company on behalf of Rank since 1944, left Rank in 1956 and set up the new company, striking a distribution and production deal with MGM. This was the first Ealing production to be made at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, North London. Plot Test pilot John Mitchell (Jack Hawkins) disappoints his wife Mary (Elizabeth Sellars) by refusing to increase their unsuccessful bid for a house. What she does not know is that the aircraft manufacturing company he works for is in desperate financial straits. Owner Reginald Conway (Walter Fitzgerald) needs to convince Ashmore (Eddie Byrne) to place an order soon or the firm will go bankrupt. Mitchell takes the only prototype of a new aeroplane for a flight, with Ashmore and several others aboard. During testing, one engine catches fire. Ashmore and the others parachute to safety. Mitchell is able to extinguish the fire by diving the aeroplane but loses half of his aileron control in the process. Then, despite Conway's order and the urgings of others, he decides to try to land the aeroplane rather than crashing it into the sea. However, he has to fly back and forth for half an hour to use up fuel, shifting the centre of gravity in the aircraft away from the dead engine to make the landing more feasible. Ashmore is convinced of the aircraft's value by its performance in the dive and expresses confidence in Mitchell's ability to land it. During the tense wait, after all the others have rejected the idea as serving no purpose, office worker Mrs Snowden (Megs Jenkins) takes it upon herself to notify Mitchell's wife by phone anyway. Mary goes to the airfield and watches as her husband manages to land safely. Later, at home, she demands to know why he risked his life when everyone told him to bail out. He explains that while he felt it was his duty with the company's fate hanging in the balance, he took the risk out of love and concern for the welfare of his family. Then he phones the estate agent and agrees to the seller's price of the house mentioned earlier.

He is known for his widely circulated writings. Although he lost one means of livelihood because of Puritan beliefs, he had important support from sympathetic members of the Puritan gentry throughout a long career. Life He was born in Malpas, Cheshire, the youngest of the 17 children of John Dod, of Shocklach, Cheshire. His parents were possessed of a moderate estate, and after he had received his early education at Westchester sent him when about fourteen to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was elected scholar and afterwards fellow. He was a learned man, a Hebraist, and, it is said, witty and cheerful.Decalogue Dod and his Seventeenth Century Bestseller He was vicar of Hanwell, Oxfordshire, from 1585, in the gift of Anthony Cope, also preaching at Banbury. Robert Cleaver, his co-author, was in a neighbouring parish, Drayton.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63795 Dod was ejected from his parish at Hanwell in 1607. From 1608 he was at Canons Ashby and then rector of Fawsley, where his patron was Richard Knightley.Felicity Heal, Clive Holmes, The Gentry in England and Wales, 1500-1700 (1994), p. 344. A false accusation brought against him of having defrauded the college of a sum of money due from one of his pupils was the cause of a fever which almost cost him his life. During his illness he received strong religious impressions, and after his recovery, his character being fully cleared, he preached at a weekly lecture set up by some 'godly' people of Ely. When he was probably past thirty he was instituted to the living of Hanwell, Oxfordshire, where he remained for twenty years. While there he married Anne, sister of Dr. Nicholas Bownde, by whom he had twelve children. The John Dod, proctor of the University of Cambridge in 1615, was probably one of his sons, though it is suggested that he was Dod himself (Memorials). His second wife was a Miss Chilton. At Hanwell he worked diligently, preaching twice each Sunday besides catechising and supplying, in conjunction with four others, a weekly lectureship at Banbury. In 1624 he was presented to the rectory of Fawsley in the same county, where he remained until his death. In the course of the civil war he is said to have been troubled by the royalist soldiers. He died at Fawsley, and was there buried on 19 August 1645.

Before that, she was a noted member of the Atlanta African-American community and an activist for civil rights. Biography Cooper was born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, on January 9, 1902, and raised in Nashville. She moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in her early-twenties with her husband, Albert Berry Cooper, a dentist, and they had four children together. During that time, she served more than fifty years in public work on the board of Gate City Nursery Association and also helped found the Girls Club for African-American Youth. Because there were no integrated Boy Scout troops in 1930s Atlanta, she wrote to the Boy Scouts in New York for help in starting Troop 95, Atlanta's first Boy Scout troop for African-Americans.National Public Radio: Talk of the Nation, December 30, 2009. When her husband died, Martin Luther King Jr. sent Cooper a telegram; she also met with Coretta Scott King and saved photographs of the occasion. Cooper first registered to vote on September 1, 1941. Although she was friends with elite Black Atlantans like W. E. B. Du Bois, John Hope Franklin and Benjamin Mays, she did not exercise her right to vote for years, because of her status as a black woman in a segregated and sexist society. During the 1970s, she served as a tutor to non-readers at Ebenezer Baptist Church. She also served on the Friends of the Library Board, serving at one time as vice president of the board. In 1980, she received a Community Service Award from Channel 11 for being one of the organizers of the black Cub Scouts and serving as the first den mother for three and a half years. She was also awarded the Annie L. McPheeters Medallion for community service from the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History in 2002. Age issue When featured in Obama's 2008 speech, Cooper was 106 years old. Some news outlets erroneously reported her as \\"oldest voter\\" even though there were several older voters, including then-114-year-old Gertrude Baines, 113-year-old Beatrice Farve, 112-year-olds Maggie Renfro and George Francis, 110-year-olds Virginia Call and Onie Ponder, and 109-year-olds Nettie Whittington and Amanda Jones (all voted for Obama); and 112-year-olds Eunice Sanborn, Besse Cooper, and Walter Breuning (all indicated they likely voted for McCain) and 109-year-old Gertrude Noone (who voted for McCain). Cooper died on December 21, 2009, three weeks before what would have been her 108th birthday. Census research suggests she may have been a year younger than claimed; the 1910 U.S. Census lists her as seven years old in April 1910. Given a January birthdate, this suggests that she was born in 1903. See also *Virginia McLaurin References *Transcript of Barack Obama acceptance speech, Chicago Tribune.

Andreas Wieland, Carl Marcus Wallenburg (2011): Supply-Chain-Management in st√ºrmischen Zeiten. Berlin. (cf. Wieland/Wallenburg, 2011) Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is \\"the implementation of strategies to manage both everyday and exceptional risks along the supply chain based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing vulnerability and ensuring continuity\\". SCRM applies risk management process tools, either in collaboration with supply chain partners or independently, to deal with risks and uncertainties caused by, or affecting, logistics-related activities, products (goods and services) or resources in the supply chain.  Supply chain exposures  SCRM attempts to reduce supply chain vulnerability via a coordinated, holistic approach ideally involving all supply chain stakeholders, collectively identifying, analysing and addressing potential failure points or modes within or affecting the supply chain. Risks to the supply chain range from unpredictable natural events (such as tsunamis and pandemics) to counterfeit products, and reach across quality, security, to resiliency and product integrity. Mitigation of supply chain risks can involve logistics, cybersecurity, finance and risk management disciplines, the ultimate goal being to maintain supply chain continuity in the event of scenarios or incidents which otherwise would have interrupted normal business and hence profitability. The cost-effectiveness of resilience and other measures is an important factor since, as long as things are running smoothly, they add to the costs of production. Some supply chain logistics techniques such as supply-chain optimization and lean manufacturing can prejudice continuity and resilience. It is also becoming more common among businesses especially manufacturers to extend supplier quality management practices throughout supply chains. This approach is shown to increase transparency, reduce overhead costs, and improve operational efficiency.  Resilience  Supply chain risk management typically involves four processes: identification, assessment, controlling, and monitoring of supply chain risks.Wieland & Wallenburg (2012) However, due to the complexity of many supply chains, these processes might not be sufficient to ensure that all eventualities are prepared for. Therefore, the concept of supply chain risk management, which is cause-oriented, is often combined with the concept of supply-chain resilience, which aims to ensure that the supply chain can cope with or bounce back from incidents irrespective of their cause or nature. Supply chain resilience is therefore \\"The adaptive capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to disruptions, and recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at the desired level of connectedness and control over structure and function\\"  Time to recover  \\"Time to recover\\" (TTR) is a valuable metric originally introduced by Cisco and adopted by the Supply Chain Risk Leadership Council. TTR measures the time it takes a company to restore full operational output following a major supply chain disruption. The determination of TTR assumes that a facility is essentially unusable due to a major event, requiring extensive repairs and reconstruction, as well as re-sourcing and re-qualifying of key equipment used in manufacturing and other operations.  Measuring risk  Supply chain risk is a function of likelihood of an event's occurrence and its impact. Although this is the most popular methodology for quantifying risk, a drawback in the context of supply-chain risk is that it requires assessing likelihood or probability of many different event types across a number of supply-chain organisations and locations (potentially hundreds of thousands for, say, an major vehicle manufacturer). Thus, the range of possibilities is huge, frustrating and limiting the analysis possible in practice. The methodology may be appropriate for a smaller subset of locations and/or types or categories of risk. Most companies rely on 'risk scores' of various types such as financial risk score, operational risk score, resiliency score (R Score). These are readily available, relatively simple to understand and analyze, and hence can be effective, at least for first-pass identification of risks worthy of further analysis. Standards and certified compliance (such as ISO 9001) are also effective ways to raise the baseline to a known level.  Managing risk proactively  A survey in 2011 conducted by BCI and Zurich for over 559 companies across 65 countries found that over 85% of companies had suffered at least one supply chain disruption during the year. The respondents also noted that 40% of the reported disruptions originated upstream with sub-contractors rather than prime contractors or first-tier suppliers.  Supply chain resilience options  Some options to engineer an acceptable risk level in supply chains include: *Addressing sourcing risks as an integral part of the product design and engineering (e.g. preferring standardized multi-sourced commodities over custom or unique supplies from sole suppliers) *Managing stock levels both statically and dynamically *Considering alternative sourcing and flexible logistical arrangements (e.g. trucks to supplement or replace trains) *General purpose contingency arrangements such as business interruption insurance and proactive business relationship management (building mutual understanding and trust) *Supplier questionnaires, risk assessments, audits and certification, both for initial supplier selection and subsequently (e.g. refreshed prior to major changes such as new products, or in response to issues arising) *Awareness campaigns and training programs *The use of business intelligence from big data analytics and continuous monitoring for predictive security measures vs. clean up *Redundancy optimization (e.g. focusing redundancy efforts on business- or mission-critical products) *Slick incident management where time is of the essence *Postponement, product substitution and other forms of downstream supply chain management (assisting customers) *Collaboration See also * Supply-chain security * Cybersecurity References Books * Choi, T.M., C.H.

Born in Liegnitz in modern Poland, Walther was a significant influence on the thought of the German theosopher Jakob B√∂hme. As an itinerant Paracelsian enthusiast, Walther was active throughout the Holy Roman Empire, in Poland, Transylvania and elsewhere. He died in Paris sometime before December 1631. Biography Born in Liegnitz, Silesia, Walther attended the University of Frankfurt/Oder where he studied medicine. A gifted student and an evident enthusiast of Paracelsian medicine, he thereafter received a series of appointments to Ducal courts throughout the Holy Roman Empire as a physician, alchemist and laboratory technician. Intensely interested in magic and kabbalistic wisdom, early in his life Walther collected several magical tracts, the manuscripts of which survive in European libraries to this day. In order to deepen his acquaintance with kabbalistic and magical teachings, between 1597 and 1599 Walther traveled to Africa and the Holy Land in order to learn at the feet of Jewish and Arab practitioners. Several years after his return to Europe, he made the acquaintance of Jakob B√∂hme, probably in late 1617. In 1612 he became a close friend of Boehme. In 1619-20 he studied with Boehme. Along with the likes of the Torgau chiliast Paul Nagel,Leigh T.I. Penman, 'Climbing Jacob's Ladder: Crisis, Chiliasm, and Transcendence in the Thought of Paul Nagel (‚Ä†1624), a Lutheran Dissident during the Time of the Thirty Years' War.' Intellectual History Review 20/2 (2010), 201-226 Walther became a fiery propagandist and promoter of B√∂hme's work, although for several years he was torn between B√∂hme's doctrines and those of B√∂hme's arch-rival, the antinomian Esajas Stiefel. After several years of proselytizing on B√∂hme's behalf, Walther died in Paris, probably before 1631. Works by Walther A complete bibliography of Walther's printed works can be found in a recent article.Leigh T.I. Penman, ‚ÄòA Second Christian Rosencreuz?

() Despite his influence, as well as his enthusiasm for kabbalistic and magical tracts, Walther himself only composed two major works, neither of which reflected these interests to any great extent: *Ode  Dicolos Tetrastrophos, totum re-demtionis opus, √† Christo Seruatore nostro hu-mano generi praestitum, breuiter com-plectens ...

A biography of the Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave. A third work, although actually written by Jakob B√∂hme, was inspired by 40 questions proposed to the philosopher by Walther himself concerning the nature of the human soul. It seems clear that Walther's interests influenced the content of B√∂hme's responses. The first edition of these Forty Questions on the Soul (to use its English title) was provided by Johann Angelius Werdenhagen, a friend of Walther, shortly after the physician's death in Paris: *Œ®œÖœáŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ± Vera I.

Roman law  Under Roman law, ownership of a building was considered inseparable from ownership of the land beneath it.

A right of superficies may in addition serve to obtain the ownership of pipes, cables and tubes under or above someone else's land.Hendrik (Henri) Goossens: Dutch Civil Law. Limited real rights. Right of superficies ('opstalrecht'). Accessed 2016-05-04  Romanian law  A new Civil Code of Romania defines Superficies as follows: the right to have or to erect a building on someone other's land, above or under ground of that land, on which the superficiary acquires a right of use (art. 693).The New Civil Code for Everyone Japanese law Japanese law provides for a similar right, known as in Japanese and officially translated as \\"superficies\\". The right is defined under Article 265 of the Civil Code as the right to use the land of another for the purpose of owning buildings, trees or bamboo. A superficies is not limited to these purposes however. For example, subway companies in Japan obtain a superficies for their right to travel under properties belonging to others. A superficies may also be created by operation of law when a mortgage is foreclosed. If the foreclosure leads to the land and building(s) thereon falling under separate ownership, but the land and building(s) were owned by the same person when the mortgage was created, then a is automatically created to facilitate separate ownership of the building(s). Unlike a land lease, a superficies is considered to be a property right, can be indefinite in duration, imposes no upkeep obligations on the landowner, and is freely transferable without the landowner's consent. The rights and obligations of the parties are primarily determined by the contents of the superficies agreement.

Since 1873 it has been the base of the provincial and prefectural administration of Rome. sito ufficiale delle Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini History The palazzo was first built by cardinal Michele Bonelli, nephew of pope Pius V, who, in 1585, acquired a pre-existing palazzo from Giacomo Boncompagni at the extremity of what was then piazza dei Santi Apostoli. Today the palazzo is separated from that piazza by via Quattro Novembre, opened later to connect the new via Nazionale with piazza Venezia. The cardinal was also the owner of a large part of the area which extended, behind the palazzo, above the ruins of the imperial fora of Trajan and Augustus, known by the name \\"Pantano\\" due to being subject to impaludamenti or flooding. Over the same years the district on the ruins of the imperial fora was subjected to a general development of the land and to a systematic urbanisation, with the creation of the \\"quartiere Alessandrino\\" in the cardinal's honour (he was nicknamed \\"cardinale alessandrino\\" after his origins in a village in the province of Alessandria). The quarter was destroyed in the 1920s and 1930s to open via dei Fori Imperiali. The trapezoidal plan of the palazzo was designed by Domenico Paganelli. Thanks to substantial funds ploughed into the project by the cardinal, the palazzo was quickly completed within 3 years after building started. In the 17th century the building was then subject to a series of major renovations and expansions, carried out on behalf of cardinals Carlo Bonelli and Michele Ferdinando Bonelli. The palazzo was partially demolished and rebuilt by Francesco Peparelli for its new owner, cardinal Renato Imperiali, who organised the important family library (the \\"Imperiali\\") of around 24,000 volumes. At the start of the 18th century, the palazzo was leased to several prominent personalities, including marchese Francesco Maria Ruspoli from 1705 to 1713, who made it the site for a private theatre and hosted illustrious musicians of the time such as Handel, Alessandro Scarlatti and Arcangelo Corelli. The entire building was then acquired in 1752 by cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli, who realised a new decorative scheme for the first floor and systematised the library (meant by him for public use, and frequented by Johann Joachim Winckelmann) on the ground floor. In 1827 the Prussian banker and consul general Vincenzo Valentini acquired the palazzo, in which he settled and to which he gave his name. The palazzo was later expanded and rebuilt at great expense, and its new owner used it to house his own collection of paintings as well as increasing the palazzo's own substantial library and archaeological collection. Completion of the works at the back of the palazzo, overlooking the column of Trajan, was entrusted to the architects Filippo Navone and Giovanni Battista Benedetti. Between 1861 and 1865 Vincenzo's son Gioacchino Valentini commissioned two further expansions on the left side, along via di Sant'Eufemia, designed by the architect Luigi Gabet. The provincial deputation of Rome acquired the palazzo as their base in 1873, commissioning the architect Gabet to complete the right side on via de‚Äô Fornari, at the top of vicolo di San Bernardo. Description The present structure of the palazzo is characterised by its grand portal, pierced by three windows on each sides, with architraves and lintels and bounded by two travertine columns. Above it is a large balustraded balcony. The great cornice, under which are small windows divided by three mensoloni, is surrounded by a balustrade. The courtyard is a portico in two orders and with 5 arcades on the short sides and 9 along the long sides, divided by Doric pilasters and rich in ancient statues. The Palazzo's art treasures include the statue of Ulysses by Ugo Attardi, as well as works depicting \\"Aeneas and Anchises\\" and \\"Europa\\", made by Sandro Chia to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the provincial administration of Rome, now located at the entrance. After a major restoration the excavations under Palazzo Valentini have now opened to the public on a permanent basis. A small baths complex dating from the 2nd century AD was discovered seven metres below street level under the basement of the building. It is believed to be part of a nearby residential scheme found over 100 years ago prior to the 1907 construction of Palazzo delle Assicurazioni in Piazza Venezia. Archaeological remains Recent excavations in the palazzo's basement have found, around 7m below street level, a small baths complex, probably part of an adjacent residential complex already found in 1902 during surveys for the construction of Palazzo delle Assicurazioni di Venezia. The monumental temple of the deified Trajan was traditionally thought to have been on the same site as this palazzo, but no trace of it has been found here.

This historical book documented evidence of Turkic migration and the expansion of the Turkic tribes and Turkic languages into Central Asia, Eastern Europe and West Asia, mainly between the 6th and 11th centuries. The region of origin of the Turkic people is suggested to be somewhere in Siberia and Mongolia. Identified Turkic tribes were known by the 6th century, and by the 10th century most of Central Asia was settled by Turkic tribes such as Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, Kipchak, Kazakh, T√ºrkmen, Uygur, Ajare, Coucas and 28 others tribes. The Seljuq, Mamluk, dynasty settled in Anatolia starting in the 11th century, ultimately resulting in permanent Turkic settlement and presence there. Meanwhile, other Turkic tribes either ultimately formed independent nations, such as Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and others new enclaves within other nations, such as Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, the Crimean Tatars, the Uyghurs in China, and the Sakha Republic Siberia.

He was founder and first principal conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.  Biography  Jan ƒåelansk√Ω, Ludv√≠k's father, worked as a kapellmeister in Horn√≠ Krup√° (Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod district). Ludv√≠k studied at the gymnasium in Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod, and from 1887 to 1891 at the teaching institute in Kutn√° Hora. He worked as a teacher in Doln√≠ Krup√° for one year before devoting himself exclusively to music. From 1892 to 1894 he studied composition with K. Stecker at the Prague Conservatory, then at the dramatic school of the National Theatre and at Pivoda Operatic School. ƒåelansk√Ω was engaged as a kapellmeister at the opera house in Plze≈à until 1895, in Zagreb from 1898 to 1899, and then as the third kapellmeister of the National Theatre Orchestra. He was forced to withdraw in 1900 when Karel Kova≈ôovic took the administration of the theatre. ƒåelansk√Ω left for Lviv, where he established the opera house. Following his return, in 1901, he founded the Czech Philharmonic with striking members of the National Theatre Orchestra. However, he yielded the administration of the orchestra to Oskar Nedbal and returned to Lviv where he founded another institution - the Lviv Philharmonic Orchestra (1902‚Äì1904). He simultaneously led the opera stages in Krak√≥w and in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and was engaged as a director of the Philharmonic Orchestra in Kiev (from 1904 to 1905) and Warsaw (from 1905 to 1906). In 1907 ƒåelansk√Ω established an opera house in the Vinohrady district of Prague. Later he became the director of the Apollo Theatre in Paris (from 1909). In recognition of his performances of the works of Jacques Offenbach, ƒåelansk√Ω was appointed an officer of L'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. During World War I, he refused the post of director at the comic opera in New York City. Following the Czechoslovak proclamation of independence in 1918, ƒåelansk√Ω became the director of the Czech Philharmonic again, but was soon replaced by V√°clav Talich. ƒåelansk√Ω spent his later years in Prague, where he worked as a music teacher. During these years he recorded two of Dvo≈ô√°k's Slavonic Dances for HMV with a group of musicians from the National Theatre.  Legacy  ƒåelansk√Ω concentrated his interest mainly on Slavic composers of Romantic music. He was particularly renowned as a conductor of Smetana's symphonic cycle M√° vlast (My Country), Dvo≈ô√°k's Slavonic Dances and the works of Zdenƒõk Fibich. ƒåelansk√Ω was a talented opera conductor, but his potential was not fully realized. He contributed to the Czech and international musical culture as an organizer and founder of orchestras and music institutions.  Compositions  The front page of the \\"Songs\\" cycle by Ludv√≠k ƒåelansk√Ω The compositions of Ludv√≠k ƒåelansk√Ω are deeply influenced by Romantic music. He wrote concertant melodramas in the style of Zdenƒõk Fibich. His only opera, Kamilla, represents an attempt to unite melodrama and singspiel. During his time in Paris, his music was influenced by French impressionism. His compositions from this period are quite colourful. Some of his scores (e.g. Symphony \\"From My Life\\") remained in Kiev and in Paris. ƒåelansk√Ω also experimented with film music in his later years. Opera *Kamilla (published 1897); in 1 act with libretto by the composerThe opera was on the subject of a failed love affair between ƒåelansk√Ω and Kamila Urv√°lkov√°; Urv√°lkov√° later persuaded Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek to compose his opera Destiny to counteract ƒåelansk√Ω's portrayal of her.

They're best known for their 1992 album, Revenge!, which peaked inside the ARIA top 50. Biography =1983-1988: Formation and Early recordings= Matthew de la Hunty travelled to Sydney in 1983 and formed a group with Paul Miskin (bass) and Willie McCracken (drums). This unnamed outfit played only one gig at French's Tavern. Dave Rashleigh (drums) was asked by Miskin to join in 1984 to replace McCracken and they then became Tall Tales and True. The band became a regular attraction on the inner-city circuit. Engineer/producer Nick Mainsbridge worked with the band on its debut, mini-album Tall Tales and True (on the Survival label), which produced the single \\"Wasted Life\\"/\\"Good Heart Gone Bad\\" (August 1986). Tall Tales & True issued two four-track singles on Survival, \\"Up Our Street\\" (1987) and \\"You've Got Your Troubles\\" (1988), before coming to the attention of fledgling independent label rooArt. =1989-1995: rooArt= Tall Tales and True contributed a remixed version of \\"You've Got Your Troubles\\" to rooArt's inaugural Youngblood compilation (September 1988), alongside material from The Trilobites, Martha's Vineyard, Crash Politics, Hipslingers, The Hummingbirds, Violet Town and others. That led to a full recording contract which resulted in the Shiver album (May 1989). Again produced by Nick Mainsbridge, the album highlighted the dramatic sweep of the band's songwriting and de la Hunty's earnest vocal delivery. Shiver produced the singles \\"Trust\\" (January 1989) and \\"Hold on\\" (June 1989). Both singles peaked within the ARIA top 70. \\"Trust\\" received significant airplay on national youth broadcaster Triple J reaching No. 93 on the Hottest 100 for 1990 and No. 51 in 1991. In 1989 the band flew to Canada for a three-month tour, which they expanded to a nine-month world tour. The band initially based themselves in Toronto with violinist Simon Alcorn who'd been performing and recording with them. After Canada they went south to the United States, where Alcorn left and was replaced by Robert McComb (The Triffids). The band then moved to the United Kingdom and toured parts of England and Scotland. Tall Tales and True next released the EP Superstition Highway (1991). Rob McComb contributed electric guitar to the blustering title track. The band later added Vanessa Lucas on violin and bass guitar when Rob McComb left. They embarked on the Trilogy tour with rooArt labelmates The Hummingbirds and Canadian band The Pursuit of Happiness. Dave Goesch played lead guitar during this period. Tall Tales and True issued two new singles, \\"Lifeboat\\" and \\"Summer of Love\\", the second of which reached No. 51 on the national chart. Both tracks were subsequently included on the band's second album, Revenge (June 1992). Their Lifeboat single earned ARIA nominations for Engineer Of The Year (for Nick Mainsbridge) and Best Video (for Brendan Young).ARIA Tall Tales & True awards history Revenge featured tracks uniquely and stylistically recorded, arranged and produced with their favourite producer Nick Mainsbridge in Sydney. The album gave rise to two more singles, \\"Watching the Wind Blow\\" (May 1992) and \\"Looking for a Place\\" (August 1992), after which the band slipped from view for another two years. Recorded in a Sydney warehouse in mid-1994 with Mainsbridge, the album Tilt featured the band revisiting its garage-band roots with a noisy, ragged edge to proceedings. Tilt produced two singles, \\"You Sleep I'll Drive\\" (June 1994) and \\"Moonshine\\" (January 1995). Tall Tales and True played their final show at The Annandale Hotel in 1995. =1996-present: Post breakup= Following the break-up of Tall Tales and True, Dave Rashleigh went on to be a member of The Jackson Code, and later Sydney based outfit WEMO. Paul Miskin formed the band Angel Gear in 1997 which included Dave Rashleigh on drums. They continued to record with Nick Mainsbridge and released Friends In Low Places in 2003 on Mainsbridge's Beat ‚Äì Route label. He has played bass and toured with Plug Uglies, Margaret Urlich, The Jackson Code and Jodi Phillis. He now writes for and performs with city/country outfits Grandaddy Low and The Richest Men In Town. Matthew de la Hunty returned to Perth, and released his debut solo album in 1999, Scissors, Paper, Rock, which followed on from the Tall Tales and True sound, but was more acoustic based and rough-edged. This was followed by a second album Welcome to My Rock And Roll World in 2001. He has also undertaken production/remix work for other artists, alongside continuing to record his own material, and lecturing in song writing and production. He formed The Smokin‚Äô Eldorados in 2009 with Rod Radalj(Scientists, Hoodoo Gurus), performing mainly on lead guitar in the loud, largely improvised rock sound that evolved. His current band Zombie Western Baby is a return to the vocal/guitar sound reminiscent of Tall Tales and True. In Berlin May 2013 he was musical director and performer in the premiere of the dance theatre work \\"Good Little Soldier\\".

The platform was situated within a block section between Hexthorpe Junction and Cherry Tree Lane and so had no signals of its own. The railway platform was a simple wooden structure on the Doncaster - bound line usually used for the collection of tickets from the many trains arriving in the town for the St. Leger race meeting. The usual method of working the section of line was to pass trains from Hexthorpe Junction under a 'permissive' block ruling, not usually used on passenger lines, with additional control by two flagmen spaced between the junction box and the ticket platform. On this day two trains were in the section, the first, a Midland Railway train, stood at the platform, the second, another Midland train waiting just to its rear. As the first train moved off the second moved onto the platform so that tickets could be checked. The third train was a Liverpool to Hull express worked by a MS&LR; crew and probably the crew who should have understood the working of the line better than any other. This train came over Hexthorpe Junction with, first the 'distant' signal and then the 'home' signal at danger. With speed down to a crawl the 'home' signal was lowered, the driver assumed, wrongly, that with no other fixed signals to Cherry Tree Lane his route was clear and speed gradually rose. In the official report it was said that the first of the flagmen gave no indication and the second gave an ambiguous signal which was seen by the fireman but not properly understood. The express was reported travelling between 35 and 40 m.p.h. when they rounded the curve and saw the Midland train still in the platform. The driver applied the 'simple' vacuum brake and threw the locomotive into reverse but could not stop within the short distance of less than 250 yards. The trial of the driver and fireman at York, before the Lord Chief Justice was the first big legal case in which the newly formed trade union A.S.L.E.F. were part and for which they engaged eminent counsel to defend their members. The jury returned a verdict of 'not guilty' and the Lord Chief Justice said in his summing up that \\".....he could not but think that the railway company was seriously to blame for having had in use a brake which not only was not the best in existence, but which was known to be insufficient and liable to break down\\". The management were \\"thick skinned\\" over all safety matters and in this case Sir Edward Watkin, the company chairman, said \\"....it was a misfortune that the Lord Chief Justice should have exonerated the driver and fireman\\". Regardless of Sir Edward's thinking the Hexthorpe accident, closely followed by the Armagh rail disaster in Northern Ireland sounded the death knell of the 'simple' vacuum brake.

Based on David Werner's experiences at his Project Piaxtla in western Mexico, it was originally written in 1970 in Spanish as Donde No Hay Doctor. It has since been revised multiple times, sold over one million copies, and been translated into over 100 languages. The book is available for purchase, in either book form or on CD, at Hesperian's bookstore. All chapters can also be downloaded individually free of charge in PDF format. Its distribution is worldwide. The US Peace Corps has distributed it in The Gambia. In Uzbekistan, a United States Agency for International Development grant enabled a team under Dr. Donald Elsworth and Robert Graves of Central Asian Free Exchange to translate the book into Uzbek. In 2012 Hesperian Health Guides launched their Digital Commons, and health manuals, including Where There Is No Doctor can now be downloaded in 26 different languages, including Arabic, Filipino, Khmer, Lao, Portuguese, Spanish, and Urdu. The Commons also makes available images from the book, and the Health Materials Workshop enables people to make flyers and posters based upon it. The new Where There Is No Doctor is currently in development as an entirely new book. This project takes on the health demands of the 21st century, with entirely new information on diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDs, first aid, and various other topics. Content The book covers all aspects of people's health ranging from diarrhoea to malaria, bone fractures and ringworm. Special emphasis is placed on hygiene, a healthy diet and vaccinations, and the book explains to readers what they can do themselves and how to prevent, recognise and treat many common sicknesses. It also shows them how to recognise problems they are unable to cope with and need to refer to a health worker. This new revised edition includes information about some additional health problems such as AIDS, dengue fever, complications from abortion, drug addiction and covers in detail both childbirth and family planning. Reception In the British Medical Journal, a 1998 review said: The book was referenced in a 2004 article in The Lancet, entitled \\"Can we achieve health information for all by 2015?\\" Underlining the importance of straightforward information in the language of the reader, the authors wrote that: In the Journal of the American Medical Association, a 2010 review said, References  External links  * Hesperian Health Guides * Hesperian Health Guides, Books and Resources Category:1977 non-fiction books Category:1992 non-fiction books Category:Health and wellness books ","title":"Where There Is No Doctor"},{"id":"20080853","text":"Degu Debebe (, born 19 March 1982) is an Ethiopian footballer.

It was built in the Forum of Trajan (Rome), by Trajan's adoptive son and successor Hadrian, between 125 and 138. The architect was Apollodorus of Damascus. The temple was destroyed in the Middle Ages. Site Its exact site with the Forum is unknown. It had been assumed it was on the site of Palazzo Valentini and that this palazzo had reused stone from the temple in its construction, but excavation has found no trace of a temple, only remains of insulae with shallower foundations than those needed for a temple. This possibly puts the temple at the centre of the forum courtyard, looking towards the forum of Augustus or elsewhere (some have suggested the two rooms in the Library, without evidence) and not in a northern position as was previously assumed. History The temple's dedicatory inscription survives in the Vatican Museums. An enormous monolithic granite column (2m in diameter) with a white marble capital (2.12m high on its own) survives near Trajan's Column and perhaps comes from the temple. Among Hadrian's many buildings, it was only this one to which he wished to affix his name. The temple was probably enormous in dimensions and surrounded by a portico like the temple of Hadrian. However, Trajan was not buried in the temple but in the triumphal column's base.

An English translation by David McLintock was published as Woodcutters in 1987; another English translation by Ewald Osers was published in 1988 under the title Cutting Timber: An Irritation. Second in a trilogyFirst being The Loser for music, and third Old Masters for painting. covering the Arts, this one relates to the theatre and created quite an uproar in Austria, where it was banned as some Viennese personalities recognised themselves in the story. Nonetheless, it still sold very well in its own country and became a bestseller abroad. In his Western Canon of 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom lists Woodcutters as Bernhard‚Äôs masterpiece. Plot summary It‚Äôs eleven thirty at night in an elegant Viennese home in the 80s. A group of people are awaiting ‚Äì with some impatience and increasing appetite ‚Äì the arrival of a famous dramatic actor, guest of honour, in order to start eating the sophisticated dinner, in fact the \\"artistic dinner\\", as the hosts love to state. The place is that of the Auersbergers, a married couple whom the narrator hasn‚Äôt seen for twenty years: she‚Äôs a singer, he‚Äôs a \\"composer in the wake of Webern\\", both \\"idiosyncratically consumed\\". The play just performed by the awaited actor is one of Ibsen‚Äôs: The Wild Duck at the Burgtheater. The whole novel is an account of what the narrator sees and hears while sitting on a chair with a glass of champagne in hand and, subsequently, at the table during dinner. Bernhard devastates with the axe of his prose (just like a wood cutter) the world of pretension and intellectual inconsistency, not only related to a certain Viennese scene, but to all that surrounds us: he‚Äôs implacable, ferociously comic, inexhaustible in the variations and returns to theme. The scene develops and the \\"artistic dinner\\" unravels in all its hypocritical farce, whilst the narrator relives the last two decades, his connections and affective ties with the various guests, his relationship with the woman (Joana) who united in friendship all of them and finally committed suicide. In closing, the novel reaches momentum through the actor‚Äôs indignant outburst against one of the guests (Billroth) who had been offensive to him and malignant to all the whole night. He then becomes sad and reflective and allows, in a maudlin and romanticized scene, that he often believes he would have been better off to have lived a rural life and to have been a woodcutter. The marvellous play on the word which allows both the romanticism of this world of the native savage, and yet refers to the super sophisticated and bitter criticism of the social cynic is a stroke of Bernhardian genius. When the elderly actor is so openly wounded by Billroth, the narrator turns from derogatory to sympathetic, and virtually shifts his view of the Burgtheater actor and even the Burgtheater into praising. Excerpt The most revealing lines of the novel are about Bernhard and are the last two sentences of the text, which tell us just what he does when his inner sensibilities so overwhelm him that he cannot stand it any longer: \\"And as I went on running I thought: I'll write something at once, no matter what -- I'll write about this artistic dinner in the Gentzgasse at once, now. Now, I thought -- at once, I told myself over and over again as I ran through the Inner City -- at once, I told myself, now -- at once, at once, before it's too late.\\" :;Book's Epigraph :Being unable to make people more reasonable, I preferred to be happy away from them. --Voltaire Notes References *Bernhardiana, a Critical Anthology of Bernhard's works *\\"On Thomas Bernhard\\" by Jason M.

It belongs to the subfamily Oecophorinae of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae). It is the type species of the genus Batia, which is sometimes treated as monotypic. But this is not well warranted, as some other species usually placed there differ little from the Lesser Tawny Crescent.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2003) Description and ecology Its wingspan is 7‚Äì10 mm, and in general the imagines (adults) resemble the close relative B. lambdella, but are only two- thirds the size of that species. Their forewings are dark ochre, slightly darker at the tips and the hairy fringe surrounding them. At the border between the light and dark parts there is a dark blotch at the dorsal margin, which forms a continuous pointed patch if the wings are laid back while the moth rests.Kimber [2010] Illustration from John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 6 It is found in Europe, where it is not rare in many woodlands. It is even widespread at the outer limit of its range, being a common sight in most of England for example. The adults fly in July and August depending on the location. This moth is generally nocturnal, but can be attracted by bright lights. The habits of their caterpillars are not sufficiently known; there is no reason to assume that they differ in that respect from their relatives, which generally live under bark and eat rotting wood and sometimes fungi.Grabe (1942), Kimber [2010] Synonyms Junior synonyms of B. lunularis are:.Grabe (1942), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), and see references in Savela (2003) * Batia begrandella (Duponchel, 1842) * Batia clavella (Herrich-Sch√§ffer, 1854) * Batia metznerella (Treitschke, 1835) * Borkhausenia lunaris (Haworth, 1828) * Chirocampa lunaris (Haworth, 1828) * Oecophora lunaris (Haworth, 1828) * Recurvaria lunaris Haworth, 1828 Footnotes References * (1942): Eigenartige Geschmacksrichtungen bei Kleinschmetterlingsraupen [\\"Strange tastes among micromoth caterpillars\\"].

Clooney\\", America Magazine That same year he was named a Fellow of the British Academy.Center for Indic Studies - Harvard Divinity School His primary areas of scholarship are theological commentarial writings in the Sanskrit and Tamil traditions of Hindu India, and the developing field of comparative theology, a discipline distinguished by attentiveness to the dynamics of theological learning deepened and enriched through the study of traditions other than one's own. He has also written on the Jesuit missionary tradition, particularly in India, and the dynamics of dialogue in the contemporary world. Clooney sits on a number of editorial boards, was the first president of the International Society for Hindu-Christian Studies and, from 1998 to 2004, was coordinator for interreligious dialogue for the Jesuits of the United States. Clooney has authored several articles and books, and served as the editor of the OCHS Hindu Studies book series for Routledge. His current projects include a study of yoga and Jesuit spirituality. In 2010, he was the recipient of Henry Luce III Fellow in Theology, awarded by the Association of Theological Schools. In 2017, he has been nominated as the winner of the John Courtney Murray Award for his distinguished theological achievement. Works =Hindu Wisdom for All God's Children= Hindu Wisdom for All God‚Äôs Children is an introduction to comparative theology. It provides a brief history of his experience with Hinduism during Clooney's time spent teaching in Nepal. This book doesn‚Äôt initially require much previous knowledge of Hinduism or Indian culture to understand and therefore provides a good initial introduction to comparative theology and Clooney. It also shows what one can learn about God from the Hindu religious tradition by taking a look at various Hindu gods. Hindu Wisdom for All God's Children began first as a series of lectures given at John Carroll University in 1996 and was later developed into a book. The book's introduction is significant to understanding Clooney's interest in eastern religions. As part of his early Jesuit training, Clooney was expected to teach high school. He chose to travel to Kathmandu, Nepal, and teach 9th- grade boys at St. Xavier‚Äôs High School. Looking for a way to teach moral values to his students, Clooney turned to the Bhagavad Gita. This was the first time that Clooney had studied the Bhagavad Gita. Similarly, he also used the stories of the Buddha's life and teachings to relate to the Nepali boys he was teaching. =Hindu God, Christian God= In Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries Between Religions, Clooney compares Christian theology and Hindu theology in four areas: the existence of God, what is the true God, divine embodiment, and the revelation of God. Clooney considers the similarities between Christianity and Hinduism's theological answers to these topics. Clooney then draws four major conclusions about God: the world is complex and there is a God who created the world, this God can be further identified by drawing reasonable conclusions about who God is and how He will likely act, God is not limited to the restrictiveness of a body but can choose to assume this limited form, and there is divine revelation. This book is helpful in seeing how Clooney's ideas about God develop through his studying of the theology of religions outside of Christianity.Clooney, Francis X., S.J.

After a short time of internment at Scapa Flow in 1919, he started to study at the Technical University Munich. Liedig was a member of the Freikorps Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, deployed in Berlin and Upper Silesia in 1919/20, and a participant of the Kapp Putsch in March 1920. Liedig left the navy in September 1920 and was active in some rightwing organisations throughout the 1920s. Liedig studied law and worked as a lawyer.J√∂rg Hillmann: Der 20. Juli 1944 und die Marine. Ein Beitrag zu Ereignis und Rezeption. Winkler, Bochum 2004, In 1936 he joined the Kriegsmarine at the instigation of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, who knew Liedig from the Freikorps episode. Here he came in contact to members of the German military resistance such as Hans Oster and Hans von Dohnanyi. Around September 20, 1938 the leading members of that opposition Erwin von Witzleben, Hans Bernd Gisevius, Hans Oster, Hans von Dohnanyi, and assumedly Carl Friedrich Goerdeler met Abwehr Captain Friedrich Wilhelm Heinz and Franz-Maria Liedig at Oster‚Äôs house in Berlin.

It is named after its designer, the architect Gaetano Koch, and was built from 1888 to 1892. Description The building measures 109 meters by 60 meters and rises up to 37 meters in height. The main fa√ßade is made of travertine marble and has features of the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian orders. Of the five floors, two are below ground. These still have windows from a moat (8 meters wide, 5 meters deep) that surrounds three sides of the building. There are two symmetrical main entrances on Via Nazionale, but only one of them is presently in use. With later additions, also used by the central bank, Palazzo Koch occupies an entire city block. It currently houses representative rooms used by the Banca d'Italia for official events, the top management, central administration, the Paolo Baffi Library and the Money Museum. The building is laid out around two interior courtyards. The Court of Honour (the western of the two courtyards) also features the three classical orders on its facades. A niche contains a bust of the building's architect. An archway towards the adjacent building which formerly housed the banknote printing facility faces a fountain topped by a statue of Antinous made during the reign of Hadrian. The wing between the two courtyards contains the Sala della Lupa, with a copy of the Capitoline Wolf, which gives access to the main stairway, the Scalone D'Onore. This more than 3-meter-wide stairway extends up to the top floor without any central supports. At its foot are two 3rd-century sarcophagi. The first piano nobile (first upper floor) features chandeliers made from Murano glass, marble flooring and doorways and silk tapestries on the wall. The public rooms also house numerous works of art, from statues, European paintings (16th-19th centuries) as well as Oriental pieces such as Chinese lions (Han and Wei dynasties), Cambodian Buddha heads and Indian and Persian artifacts. Located in the center of the fa√ßade towards Via Nazionale is the Salone dei Partecipanti (shareholders' room).

He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1870 to 1912, and was elected RWS (Member of the Royal Watercolour Society) in 1913.

Some of his early work has been said to have influenced Van Gogh.http://www.kipling.org.uk/mowglipic.htmhttp://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/paint/dollman.htm Works A central theme was ambitious mythological pictures such as a Viking Foray, a Viking horde entitled the Ravager, The Unknown (1912), featuring a girl surrounded by chimps and Orpheus and his Lute with Lions. He also produced bold compositions of animals and people such as Robinson Crusoe and His Man Friday, Polo and Mowgli made leader of the Bandar-log (1903). His best known work is possibly A London Cab Stand (1888), focussing on a group of horses in a stormy scene. He composed at least three variants of this picture, and there are other instances where he made copies or near-copies of individual pictures. In the 1890s he painted pictures of soldiers, and some less well regarded genre pictures of people with animals. He also painted wild animal pictures without attempting any narrative content.

The larva soon vacates the mine, creating a spinning at the leaf underside, from where it causes window feeding. Larvae can be found from May to early August. They are pale green or yellowish with a pale brown or yellowish head.

He was killed by a Xiongnu attack. When the Xiongnu sought an alliance and the matter was being discussed by various officials, Di Shan declared that he was in favour of peace. Asked to elaborate by the emperor, he criticised the impact of war on resources and the standard of living of those near the border. He cited the examples of both internal and external conflicts under past reigns and juxtaposed the hardship of these times with the prosperity enjoyed during times of peace. Zhang Tang, when consulted on his opinion, dismissed Di Shan as a stupid Confucianist with no understanding of the matter. Di Shan responded by admitting that his loyalty was the \\"loyalty of the stupid\\" but then accused Zhang Tang of being dishonest in his loyalty, using as evidence the latter's forceful prosecution of the kings of Huainan and Jiangdu. Emperor Wu then asked Di Shan whether he could keep out the Xiongnu if made a governor of a province. When the latter responded by saying he could not, the emperor proposed that he be made magistrate of a district, an offer that he similarly rebuffed. However, Di Shan finally relented when offered the position of commander of a guard post, afraid that he would be handed over for trial if he refused. Within a little over a month, Di Shan had been decapitated following a Xiongnu raid on his guard post.

Infinis produces electricity from captured landfill and mineral methane. Infinis claims to have a net negative carbon emissions footprint. History The company was originally created in 2006 as a subsidiary of Waste Recycling Group whose area of operations was the generation of energy from gas originating from the landfill sites in the WRG portfolio. The parent company, Terra Firma Capital Partners, then sold WRG in July 2006 while retaining Infinis. Novera Energy was acquired in 2009, bringing additional landfill gas sites, along with hydroelectric sites and wind development sites. Infinis went on to buy one operational and two consented wind farms from E.ON in 2011 and four wind farms from SSE in 2010 and 2011. After seven years of ownership by Terra Firma Capital Partners, the company was the subject of an IPO (initial public offering) in November 2013. Ian Marchant, formerly CEO of Scottish and Southern Energy, was appointed Independent Chairman of the Infinis Board, in September 2013 in the run up to the IPO. The company was acquired by Terra Firma Capital Partners in December 2015. Following the acquisition of the landfill gas business by 3i on 8 December 2016, Shane Pickering was appointed Chief Executive of Infinis and Director to the boards of the two new governing companies. Tony Cocker was appointed as Non-executive Director and Chairman to the Board of Infinis Energy Management Limited (the Infinis Group's governing board) on 1 August 2017. On 11 April 2018, Infinis acquired 100% of Alkane energy, an independent energy producer from coal mine methane and power response. Operations Infinis employs approximately 279 people across 153 operating sites with an aggregate generating capacity of 478MW*, comprising 121 landfill gas sites, 15 CMM sites and 17 PR sites.

Recognized internationally for its quality of work in the field of positioning astronomy (since the 19th century), in 1992, it became a dependency of the University of Lisbon (and later, part of the Faculty of Sciences), responsible for scientific and historical research, along with media relations. History From an 1812 map, there existed in the Alto da Casa Branca in the Tapada of Ajuda an older observatory. The observatory was born from great controversy between French astronomer Herv√© Faye (1814-1902), then director of the Observatory of Paris, and Peters, an astronomer at the Russian Observatory of Pulkova, on the parallax of the star of Argelander. The construction of the Lisbon observatory was due to a strong desire to build an institution that was a reference in Portuguese culture. It was established in the mid-19th century with the aim of promoting new Sidereal Astronomy, discovery and understanding of the infinite cosmos, and concern about the exact mapping of the sky and measuring the size of the universe. In 1850, Herv√© Faye and Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (1793-1864) proposed that astronomical observations should be taken in Lisbon, being the first and \\"unique locale in all of continental Europe that the zenithal telescope could encounter the marvelous Argelander star\\". In order to do so, it was necessary to build a new observatory where you could install the appropriate equipment. The Count of Lavradio proposed that the government's chamber of peers should acquire Faye's telescope. The government named a commission, presided by Jos√© Feliciano da Silva Costa (1797-1866) and driven by Filipe Folque (1800-1874), to construct a new observatory, since the Royal Military Observatory () did not have the conditions. In January 1857, King D. Pedro V destined 30 contos de r√©is to the construction of the observatory and decreed a new commission, managed by Filipe Folque. The commission thought, initially, of constructing the new building in the Prince Royal's garden, then alternately in the Parque Eduardo VII and later the Tapada da Ajuda. The plan of the building, executed by the French architect architects Jean Fran√ßois Gille Colson (1861-1865), Jos√© da Costa Sequeira (1800-1872) and Valentim Jos√© Correia (1822-1900) (then the most distinguished foreign architect living in Lisbon), was inspired by the building of the Russian Observatory in Pulkova. Wilhelm Struve, then-director at Pulkova offered his services to the Portuguese government and became the main adviser, playing a very important role in the choice of equipment and the orientation of astronomer Frederico Augusto Oom (1830-1890), who was given a rough 5-year training session. Oom, was as a Navy Lieutenant and hydrographic engineer, who eventually became the first director of the Royal Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon and who ultimately had a very important role in the whole foundation of this building. D. Pedro V approved the installation of the astronomic observatory in the Tapada, but its construction started on 11 March 1861, during the reign of King Luis I. The King also contributed to the fund, withdrawing money from his personal budget for the project. The observatory would have been erected in the Alto da Casa Branca, the locale of the older observatory, but was actually situated in the Alto da Eira Velha. Construction work was completed in 1867 and the first observations began at the site between 1867 and 1869. The Lisbon Astronomical Observatory was formally established by decree on 6 May 1878. Between 1900 and 1901, the observatory participated in the solar parallax campaign, centered on the observations of the asteroid Eros, using a circular meridian measuring instrument to improve the value of the Astronomical unit. It also contributed to production of a high-quality catalogue of reference stars; the observatory contributed with data and weight to all 3800 observations used in the catalogue. For this work, in 1904, its director C√©sar Augusto de Campos Rodrigues (1836-1919), received the Valz Prize, by the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. In 1995, the observatory was integrated into the University of Lisbon. The first renovations began in the cupola of the rotational tower in 1999. From May 2004, the investigation project Fundamenta√ß√£o de Crit√©rios para a Musealiza√ß√£o do Observat√≥rio Astron√≥mico de Lisboa, financed by FCT (POCTI/HAR/48711/2002) and under the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Sciences and UTL's Faculty of Architecture. Architecture The Lisbon Astronomical Observatory consists of a central building in the hills of Ajuda and overlooking the Tejo river, and two small cupolas in the south containing instruments. Besides the central cupola there are three rooms for astronomical observations, equipped with instruments (the best for the time) and windows for observation. The central block of the observatory (a circular room) supports the weight of the large equatorial refractor over 8 large columns. In arches between the columns are many pendulum clock used over the century to measure the time. At the foot of the large windows (with a view over the Tapada da Ajuda) are wide tables, used by astronomers to assist in their research/investigation. In addition, there are spacious halls linking the central block, used for lessons, taking measurements and research, today used as workshops and support school educational activities. The three observation rooms are spacious and high, lined in wood, with open space between the wainscoting and the walls of masonry and roofing. This space communicates with the outside world through gaps that are constantly open. There are roofs of rooms in stacks of circulation, and this permanent ventilation is there in order to establish the balance of air temperature in the rooms and beyond, as it is convenient to the accuracy of observations. The wooden wainscoting providing thermal insulation, apart from being a 100% ecological product, which provides the user with a friendlier environment compared to other substitute materials. The rooms provide openings in the lateral walls and in the ceiling, through doors, thanks to an ingenious mechanism. Once the doors open once they give you an insight to the sky, according to the meridian of Lisbon, from north to south.

It also acts as an insecticide, killing potato tuber moths, codling moths and their larvae. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service investigated the antimicrobial effects of Muscodor albus on Botrytis cinerea, which causes the common grey mold found on table grapes. Researchers found that Muscodor albus reduces the occurrence of Botrytis cinerea up to 85% on table grapes.

Seen as a great success, it was repeated in 1937 and 1942, though these two repeats did not have the same public success. Telling the evolution of Italian history from 1914 to the March on Rome, it was never conceived as an objective representation of the facts or as being solely based on the exhibiting of historic documents, but as a work of Fascist propaganda to influence and involve the audience emotionally. For this reason not only historians were called in to assist in the exhibition, but also exponents of various artistic currents of the era, such as Mario Sironi, Enrico Prampolini, Gerardo Dottori, Adalberto Libera and Giuseppe Terragni.

He pursued a programme of abstract and quasi-abstract painting, combined with a career in stage design. His Spatial-Landscape Construction (1919) is quasi-abstract with large flat areas in bold colours, predominantly red, orange, blue and dark green. His Simultaneous Landscape (1922) is totally abstract, with flat colours and no attempt to create perspective. In his Umbrian Landscape (1929), produced in the year of the Aeropainting Manifesto, Prampolini returns to figuration, representing the hills of Umbria. But by 1931 he had adopted \\"cosmic idealism\\", a biomorphic abstractionism quite different from the works of the previous decade, for example in Pilot of the Infinite (1931) and Biological Apparition (1940). Prampolini was an influence on Tullio Crali. Life After studying with Dullio Cambellotti at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome, he became a leading member of the Futurist Movement as a painter, scenographer and architect. He had close contacts with the representatives of the European avant-garde art, with the Section d'Or, Dadaism, the Bauhaus, De Stijl, the Abstraction-Cr√©ation group, with Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky and Jean Cocteau. From 1913 for a period collaborates with the monthly magazine in Milan.articolo da badigit su comune.bologna.it In 1917, with Bino Sanminiatelli he founded the magazine Noi. The same year, he realised the sets for the futurist film Tha√Øs, directed by Anton Giulio Bragaglia. He created the interior of a dream and suffocating villa, whose walls are decorated with spirals, lozenges, chessboards and symbolic figures. This film had a significant influence on the anti-naturalistic scenes of German Expressionism.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film Prampolini's work occupies a place of its own in the European abstract art, characterized by its deep concern for the dynamism and Organicism , which manifests itself in the cosmic visions and dreams of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1927 he founded the \\"Futurist Theatre Prampolini\\". In 1928 he conceived the Futurist Pavilion at the \\"Esposizione del Valentino\\" in Turin , which will be realised by Fill√¨a and Pino Curtone.Mulazzani, Marco: \\"Il dibattito sulle arti applicate e l‚Äôarchitettura\\".

Together with Fillia, he realized in 1933 a large mosaic Le comunicazioni for the tower of the Palazzo delle Poste in La Spezia. After the futurist experience, he produced different materials and works, sometimes influenced by the visions of the microcosm. He declared that his aim to express the extreme latitudes of the introspective world. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1944 he taught theatre and set design at the Brera Academy in Milan. References External links *Enrico Prampolini arte-argomenti.org. URL consultato il 08-07-2008.

Heralded as \\"one of the most significant and unusual figures of Russian contemporary music\\" (Newsweek, Russian edition, 1997) and \\"the greatest pianist of our time\\" (Crescendo' magazine, Germany, 2017), Batagov is one of the most influential Russian composers and performers of our time. Biography A graduate of the Gnessin School and the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and prize-winner at the International Tchaikovsky Competition (1986) and other competitions, Batagov introduced music by John Cage, Morton Feldman, Steve Reich and Philip Glass to Russian audiences. His debut album was a 160-minute recording of Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'Enfant Jesus (Melodiya, 1990). Three years later a well-known American musicologist Richard Kostelanetz characterized Batagov's 1993 recording of Bach's The Art of the Fugue as \\"the most stunning interpretation of Bach since Glenn Gould\\". His interpretations of classical and contemporary music distinguish themselves with expert knowledge of traditions and the history of culture. At the same time, they radically change habitual conceptions of these works, and even of the very foundations of musical art. From 1989 to 1996 Batagov was the artistic director of the legendary festival of contemporary music \\"Alternativa\\". The influence of his work on the understanding of classical and new music and on the artistic tendencies in Russia has been tremendous. In 1997 he stopped performing live for 12 years to focus on composition and studio recordings. As a composer, Batagov has his own unique voice. The post-minimalist language of his compositions is rooted in the harmonic and rhythmic patterns of Russian church bells and folk songs seamlessly mixed with the spirit of Buddhist philosophy, the dynamic pulse of early Soviet avant-garde, and the unfading appeal of progressive rock. The philosophy of Batagov's projects eliminates any boundaries between \\"performance\\" and \\"composition\\" by viewing all existing musical practices‚Äîfrom ancient rituals to rock and pop culture and advanced computer technologies‚Äîas elements of his work. His discography includes over 50 albums. Batagov is the author of several movie soundtracks, and original music for major Russian TV channels. In 2009 he returned to live performances. Since then, he has been performing a series of unique solo piano programs. He repertoire includes works by Bach, Pachelbel, Purcell and early English music, Mozart, Schubert, Debussy, as well as many other composers, and his own numerous piano compositions. Batagov is one of the key performers of piano works by Philip Glass. Batagov's recordings and live performances of Glass include the complete etudes, Batagov's piano arrangements of scenes from Einstein on the Beach and Koyaanisqatsi), music from The Hours, \\"Distant Figure\\" (a composition written by Philip Glass for and premiered by Batagov), and other works. Batagov's compositions have been performed by outstanding Russian classical and rock musicians and orchestras.

It is popular in Asia, especially on the Indian subcontinent, and was first played in India as a women's sport in Chennai during the 1940s. Like volleyball, the game's roots are linked with the YMCA. Both volleyball and newcomb ball, while older games, share many similarities with throwball. Throwball rules were first drafted in 1955 and India's first national level championship was played in 1980. History According to the Throwball Federation of India, throwball is thought to have been drawn from a recreational sport popular among women in England and Australia during the 1930s. The YMCA brought the game to Chennai, where it was played as a women's sport in the 1940s. Harry Crowe Buck, who had founded the YMCA College of Physical Education in Chennai, drafted guidelines for throwball rules and regulations in 1955. The game reached Bangalore in the 1950s. Throwball Federation of India (TFI) was formed along with the Indian National Throwball Championship. By 1990 throwball in India had become a sport for both men and women. Rules and play A throwball court is similar to a volleyball court depicted here. The playing court is somewhat larger than a volleyball court at with a neutral box on either side of the centre. The height of the net is . The ball is similar to a volleyball but may be slightly larger. While in volleyball the ball is hit or volleyed throughout play, in throwball the ball is thrown over the net, where a member of the other team tries to catch the ball and quickly throw it back across the net. An official game is played between two teams of nine or seven players. A minimum of three or five substitute players are allowed for each team, which can make a maximum of three substitutions during a set. A team can take two time-outs of 30 seconds each during a set. The first team to score 25 points wins a set. A match is three sets. Service is within five seconds after the referee whistles and is done from the service zone, without crossing the end line. A player can jump while serving the ball. The service ball must not touch the net. Double touch is not allowed for receiving the service ball and players stay in3-3-3 position during the serve. During a rally, the ball must be caught at once with both hands, without any movement of the ball within the hands (dubs) and the player shouldn't have contact with the ground. Two players are not allowed to catch the ball simultaneously. The ball is thrown within three seconds after being caught, only from above the shoulder-line and only with one hand. A player can jump when throwing the ball, which can touch the net (but not the antenna). The player should have contact with the ground when catching the ball. However, the ball is not touched with any part of the body other than the palm when catching or throwing (body touch). The ball can neither be shifted (passed) to the left or right, nor deliberately pushed. In official play, teams wear shorts and jersey uniform with numbers only in the range of 1‚Äì12 printed front and back.

Officially established in 1957, the reserve protects an area of to the northwest of Lake Imandra, including 86 km¬≤ of inland water. The terrain is mountainous tundra and northern taiga. Since 1985 the zapovednik has been designated by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve. The Lapland Nature Reserve was established in 1930. However, in 1951 along with many other zapovedniks of the Soviet Union it was abolished. It was reestablished in 1957, but in 1961-1965 was merged to Kandalaksha Nature Reserve. In 1983 the 1,613 km¬≤ area of the Lapland Nature Reserve was significantly expanded to include 1,296 km¬≤ of territories to the northwest, farther from the polluting influence of the Monchegorsk nickel smelter, and the zapovednik gave away 124 km¬≤ near the city. The reserve is situated in Murmansk Oblast about 50 km south of the city of Murmansk. Topography The Lapland Reserve has a terrain that is mostly mountain tundra and lakes, being situated on the western zone of the Khibiny Mountains. Most of the territory is covered by northern taiga and montane tundra with the highest point on Mount Ebruchorr (1115 m a.s.l.). Climate and ecoregion Lapland Reserve is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion, which is situated in Northern Europe between tundra in the north and temperate mixed forests in the south. It is covers parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the northern part of European Russia, being the largest ecoregion in Europe. The ecoregion is characterized by coniferous forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris (in drier locations), often with an understory of Juniperus communis, Picea abies and Picea obovata and a significant admixture of Betula pubescens and Betula pendula. Larix sibirica is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion. The climate of the Lapland Reserve is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfc)). This climate is characterised by long cold winters, and short, cool summers. Protected areas of Murmansk Oblast. Laplandsky Reserve is the large green area in the west of the Kola Peninsula, 50 km south of Murmansk Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Lapland Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are a number of 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public. These change with the seasons and are designed to cover themes of the region - Christmas and New Year's in winter, \\"Spring Awakening Tour\\", etc. Excursions are arranged for groups through application for permits to be obtained in advance. The main office is in the city of Monchegorsk. thumb See also * List of Russian Nature Reserves (class 1a 'zapovedniks') * National Parks of Russia References *Towards an inventory of the mycobiota of the Lapland State Nature Biosphere Reserve (Murmansk Region, North-West Russia) External links * Map of Lapland Reserve, OpenStreetMap * Map of Laplandskiy Reserve, ProtectedPlanet * Official site (in Russian) * Laplandskiy Biosphere Reserve; UNESCO - MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory Category:Nature reserves in Russia Category:Biosphere reserves of Russia Category:Geography of Murmansk Oblast Category:1957 establishments in Russia Category:Protected areas established in 1957 ","title":"Lapland Biosphere Reserve"},{"id":"20081471","text":"Cipriano Efisio Oppo (1891, Rome ‚Äì 1962, Rome) was an Italian painter. Life =Early life= Trained at the Istituto di belle arti in Rome, he began his career as a caricaturist for L‚ÄôIdea Nazionale. From 1910 he devoted himself to painting, tending towards the fauves, in particular Henri Matisse. In 1914 he contributed to the exhibition given by the Roman Secession. He then aligned himself with the national tradition. =Cultural organizer= From the First World War onwards he tirelessly dedicated himself to organising Italian cultural and artistic life. As well as being a highly regarded art critic writing for Rome's La Tribuna, his commitment led him to becoming an ambassador for art in public institutions. He became a deputy to Parliament and, in 1932, artistic director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution. He was then appointed secretary of the Direttorio Nazionale dei Sindacati delle Arti Plastiche (National Directorate of Unions of the Plastic Arts) and secretary of the Consiglio Superiore delle Belle Arti (Superior Council of Fine Arts). However, in this field, his most successful work was setting up the Quadriennale di Roma, born from one of his ideas and guided by him as its secretary-general over its first four shows from 1931 to 1943. During the 1930s and 1940s, he believed he should abstain from exhibiting in Italy, precisely because of his political-administrative activity in the artistic field, not that this stopped his participating in several shows abroad, such as L'art italien des XIX et XX si√®cles (19th and 20th Century Italian Art) at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1935 and at the 1939 New York World's Fair. =Post-War= Deemed free to return to the Quadriennale as an artist, in its 5th (1948) and 6th (1951) shows. From 1949 to 1950, he was affiliated to the important collezione Verzocchi, as well as painting a self-portrait La fiorista. The Verzocchi collection is now held at the Pinacoteca Civica of Forl√¨.

It is distributed throughout Europe, North Africa and East through the Palearctic to Siberia. 200px Distribution The species occurs on some Mediterranean islands (Balearics, Corsica, and Sardinia), in Northern Fennoscandia, and most of Europe except for southern Spain. The range extends south from Morocco in the west to Mediterranean North Africa, through Anatolia to Turkestan and Western and Central Siberia. In the German central uplands, it rises to about 1200 meters. Description The wingspan is 28‚Äì36 mm. Pattern and coloring are extremely variable. The color varies from dove-grey to dark grey-brown, with light brown, light red, reddish-brown to black-brown markings. This has led to the distinction of formae (forms). The apex of the front wing is slightly concave. The head and thorax are colored mostly according to the wing color; the abdomen is partially or completely reddish brown. The inner and outer, serrated crossbars are usually darker than the color and more or less clearly defined. These are often white lined specimens with much darker crossbars. Reniform and orbicular and stains can be as well shown, but also sometimes almost absent. There is always a black dot in the lower part of the reniform. The more or less significant medium shade is darker than the color and has a strong median bulge. The wavy line is often a series of black dots. The moth flies from September to May depending on the location.  Recorded food plants  The larva feeds on various deciduous trees and shrubs and in later stages also herbaceous plants. The species occurs in a wide range of habitats, from open forests, scrubland, downs, gardens, and parkland to shrub- rich open country. The habitats can be dry or wet, cool, or warm.

He lives in Birkenhead, Merseyside. His crime thriller, The Killing Pool, was published by Cape on 21 March 2013. Career Sampson began writing gig reviews for NME in the 80s, though was famously sacked by Editor Neil Spencer for reviewing a Sex Gang Children concert at a Liverpool club that had been burned down on the night the band had been due to appear. He went on to contribute regularly to The Face, Arena, i-D, Sounds, Jamming, The Observer and Time Out before joining Channel Four as an assistant editor for Youth Programmes. He left C4 to set up Kinesis Films, a company that specialised in documentaries about subcultures (notably Sole of the Nation, a film about Dr. Martens boots, and Ibiza - A Short Film About Chilling). Sampson returned to Merseyside in 1990 to help long-time friend Peter Hooton set up Produce Records with partners Ian Croft, Wayne Chand, Barney Moores and Paul McKenna. Produce enjoyed a string of Top 40 hits in the early 1990s, including The Farm's \\"Groovy Train\\" and \\"All Together Now.\\" When The Farm broke up in 1994, Sampson dug out the manuscript to a novella he had sent to Penguin in 1982. Awaydays was based on what he saw during his youth, travelling to, and at, football grounds up and down the country. Inspired by Irvine Welsh's phenomenal debut Trainspotting, Sampson re-worked the novel, which was acquired by publisher Dan Franklin at Jonathan Cape. Awaydays was an immediate critical and commercial success on its release in 1998. Sampson's second novel, Powder, reflects some of his experiences of the music business with The Farm and Produce Records, and subsequent adventures in Ibiza, and working for Richard Branson's V2 Music. Awaydays was adapted to film in 2009.Awaydays at the Internet Movie Database He writes about his involvement in the Ibiza film A Short Film About Chilling in the Summer 2010 Umbrella Magazine's Issue 1 Umbrella Magazine and a film version of Powder was released August 2011. Surveillance, a film from one of Sampson's original screenplays, was in competition at the Berlinale's \\"Panorama\\" section in 2008, and his forthcoming crime thriller Gangsterland is under option with Red Union Films. In 2018, Sampson was hired to pen World Productions' new mini-series Anne, for ITV, which centers on Anne Williams' crusade for justice after the death of her son Kevin in the Hillsborough disaster of 1989.

In the last interview he gave to the English Magazine ‚ÄúClassic FM‚Äù Solti specifically mentioned her as a young pianist about whom he was ‚Äúextremely enthusiastic, and I very much hope to help her in her career.‚Äù Following this, Sir George introduced Miss Krausz to the Chimay Foundation Competition in Brussels where she won the first prize by unanimous decision of the jury. She was the only pianist to be invited to perform in the Tributes to Sir George Solti presented in Italy and in London. Since then, Adrienne Krausz continues to impress the music world with each subsequent performance. Born in Hungary, Miss Krausz started the piano at the age of nine and in 1990 graduated from the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, where her teachers were Gy√∂rgy N√°dor, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g and Ferenc Rados. She has also studied with Yvonne Lef√©bure and L√≠via R√©v. Since 1991 she lives in Paris. Iv√°n Fischer and his Budapest Festival Orchestra invited her to open the Ascona Festival (2004) and the Bemus Festival in Belgrade (2005). She was also invited to play with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the Berliner Symphoniker. She made her debut in Japan with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra in 2001. Some of her prestigious partners and groups were Michael Gielen, Youri Bashmet, Mikl√≥s Per√©nyi, Boris Pergamenshikov, Sergej Krylov, the Keller and the Bart√≥k Quartets, the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra, etc. With Shlomo Mintz she made frequent recital tours all around the world. A finalist at the Piano Masters of Monte Carlo in both 1992 and 1993, she has won numerous first prizes in competitions such as the ‚ÄúWorld Competition‚Äù in Cincinnati (Piano USA 1989), the International Piano Competition in Senigallia (Italy 1985) the Hungarian National Piano Competition in Tarhos in 1984 and further prizes in Frankfurt (1987) and in Sydney (1988). Other acknowledgements include the Key of the city of Cincinnati, (Ohio, USA), the ‚ÄúDiamonds of culture‚Äù of the city of Miskolc (Hungary), and Grand Prix of the Hungarian Radio. Adrienne has been an invited guest at music festivals like Montpellier, Menton, Monte-Carlo, Schwetzingen, the Mermoz music Festival, Yokohama, Prague, Cracow, Budapest, Stresa, Palma and Sion. Her Shostakovich recording was chosen as ‚ÄúIndispensable‚Äù, in the French music-guide at Fayard edition. In 1996 she was acclaimed by the critics for her interpretation of the complete Preludes of Chopin and Shostakovich brought together on a CD. In 2003, the Hungarian Gramophone Magazine awarded her the prize for the best recording of the year. Adrienne often returns to Hungary to give concerts and has made several recordings for the Hungarian Radio and Television Networks.

Israel has an embassy in Belgrade and Serbia had an embassy in Tel Aviv. Yugoslavia was the second country in Europe to recognize Israel in 1948. The two countries have economic and cultural ties, helped by a sizable community of Jews from former Yugoslavia in Israel. Serbia agreed to move its embassy to Jerusalem on 4 September 2020. History Subotica Synagogue the Holocaust victims in Belgrade =The Jewish community of Serbia= Ever since the 13th century there has been a recorded Jewish community of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in the city of Belgrade. The first Jews to settle in the city originally arrived from Italy and the city of Dubrovnik, and later on from Hungary and Spain. The Jewish communities of the Balkans saw significant influx in the 15th and 16th centuries by the arrival of Jewish refugees fleeing the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire welcomed the Jewish refugees into his Empire. Jews became involved in trade between the various provinces in the Ottoman Empire, becoming especially important in the salt trade. In the northern province of Vojvodina, which was under Habsburg rule, Jews settled in the 18th century, particularly after the 1782 Edict of Tolerance by the Emperor Joseph II, which gave Jews a measure of religious freedom. The Jewish community developed substantially before and after World War I following the religious autonomy they have received, and many Jewish educational institutions and synagogues for both the Ashkenazi and Sephardic communities were established. By the year 1939 there were approximately 10,400 Jews living in Belgrade. Most of the Jews living in Serbia were killed during the Holocaust. During the war, many Jews were given refuge by the Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, and many of them fought along their side. Serbian civilians were involved in saving thousands of Yugoslavian Jews during this period.Why is Israel waffling on Kosovo?, by LARRY DERFNER, and GIL SEDAN After the war, most of those who survived gradually emigrated to Israel. According to the 2011 census, there are 578 declared Jews in Serbia, living mainly in Belgrade and Vojvodina. =Relations with SFR Yugoslavia= SFR Yugoslavia and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1948. Until 1952, a total of 7,578 Jews emigrated from Yugoslavia to Israel. During the period, Yugoslavia was mostly neutral in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, but maintained ties with Israel, helped by its sizable Jewish emigration. Yugoslavia severed all diplomatic relations with Israel following the Six-Day War in 1967, and it was following a pro-Arab policy since. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, newly formed FR Yugoslavia renewed the relations on January 31, 1992, seeking for certain international support as it was practically isolated from the international community during the Yugoslav Wars.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs ‚Äì February 1, 2012 ‚Äì Israel and Serbia mark 20 years since renewal of diplomatic ties Political relations Government of the Kingdom of Serbia, in exile at the time because of the German-Austrian occupation during the World War I, was to first government to officially endorse the Balfour Declaration which announced the establishment of the Jewish state in Palestine. Serbian diplomat to the United States and Zionist leader David Albala announced the support for the declaration on 27 December 1917. Milenko Vesniƒá, Serbian ambassador to Paris from 1907 to 1920, in one document referred to the new Jewish state as \\"Israel\\", which was the first official mention of that name in the international politics. According to professor Igor Primoratz: \\"Since the beginning of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Israel‚Äôs political establishment has taken a pro-Serbian stand. Facts that Israel had an embassy in Belgrade since October 1991 and that Serbia was the first among Yugoslavia's successor states to open the embassy in Israel (though ambassador Budimir Ko≈°utiƒá will never submit his credentials to the President of Israel due to the UN Security Council sanctions imposed on Belgrade) are just confirming that.

Smaller lasting disputes include border disputes over the Island of ≈†arengrad and the Island of Vukovar. Serbian and Croatian, official languages in Serbia and Croatia respectively, are mutually intelligible, being standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian language. Croatia has an embassy in Belgrade and a general consulate in Subotica. Serbia has an embassy in Zagreb and two general consulates, one in Rijeka and one in Vukovar. History During Duke Muncimir of Croatia's reign, the exiled Prince Petar Gojnikoviƒá of the Serbian House of Vlastimiroviƒá stayed in Croatia during his exile and later returned to Rascia and seized power there. Prince Petar exiled his cousins who were pretenders to the Grand Princely throne: Pribislav, Bran and Stefan whom Muncimir received and put under his protection.De Administrando Imperio, XXXII. Of the Serbs and of the country they now dwell in With the nation-building process in the mid-19th century, first Croatian‚ÄìSerbian tension appeared. Serbian minister Ilija Gara≈°anin's Naƒçertanije (1844) claimed lands that were inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians and Croats as part of a Greater Serbia. Gara≈°anin's plan also includes methods of spreading Serbian influence in the claimed lands. He proposed ways to influence Croats, who Gara≈°anin regarded as \\"Serbs of Catholic faith\\". Vuk Karad≈æiƒá considered Croatians who spoke Shtokavian dialect \\"Catholic Serbs\\" except those who speak Chakavian dialect. Croatia was at the time a kingdom in Habsburg monarchy, with Dalmatia and Istria being separate Habsburg Crown lands. Ante Starƒçeviƒá, an advocate of Croatian unity and independence, who was both anti-Habsburg and anti-Serbian in outlook envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks, Serbs, and Slovenes, considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Orthodox Christianity, while considering the Slovenes to be \\"mountain Croats\\". Starƒçeviƒá argued that the large Serb presence in territories claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement, encouraged by Habsburg rulers, and the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs. Starƒçeviƒá admired Bosniaks because in his view they were Croats who had adopted Islam in order to preserve the economic and political autonomy of Bosnia and Croatia under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. After Austro-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and Serbia gained its independence from Ottoman Empire, Croatian and Serbian relations deteriorated as both sides had pretensions on Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1902 major anti-Serb riots in Croatia were caused by reprinted article written by Serb Nikola Stojanoviƒá that was published in the publication of the Serbian Independent Party from Zagreb titled Do istrage va≈°e ili na≈°e (Till the Annihilation, yours or ours) in which denying of the existence of Croat nation as well as forecasting the result of the \\"inevitable\\" Serbian-Croatian conflict occurred. =Interwar period= Creation of Banovina of Croatia In World War I, Croats fought in the Austro- Hungarian army against Serbia, while Croatian general Ivan Salis-Seewis was a military governor of occupied Serbia. Some Croat POWs volunteered to fight in Thessaloniki battlefront with Serbian army. On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Sabor declared independence from Austria-Hungary and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which on 1 December 1918 entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia and formed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Initial Croatian zeal for the new state faded away as the republican view of a new state was ignored and especially since the concept of \\"Greater Serbia\\" was put in practice during the early 1920s, under the Yugoslav premiership of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. Using tactics of police intimidation and vote rigging,Balkan Politics, Time magazine, 31 March 1923 he diminished the role of the oppositions (mainly those loyal to his Croatian rival, Stjepan Radiƒá) to his government in parliament,Elections, Time magazine, 23 February 1925 creating an environment for centralization of power in the hands of the Serbs in general and Serbian politicians in particular.The Opposition, Time magazine, 6 April 1925 Police violence further alienated Croats, who began to ask for their own state. On 20 June 1928 Stjepan Radiƒá and five other Croat politicians (supported by a vast majority of Croats) were shot in the national assembly in Belgrade by a Serb deputy, enraged by continuous Croatian claims that they were 'exploited by Serbia and that Serbia is treating them like a colony'. This led to the royal dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929. The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia. The HSS, now led by Vladko Maƒçek, continued to advocate federalization of Yugoslavia, resulting in the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. =World War Two= In April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy who created a puppet-state called the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) which was governed by the pro-Axis Usta≈°a movement. The Ustashe sought to create an ethnically pure Greater Croatia by cleansing Serbs as well as Jews and Roma from its territory. The Ustashe regime systematically murdered around 300,000-350,000 Serbs, as a part of a genocide campaign. Approximately 100,000 people, primarily Serbs, Jews and Roma but also anti-fascist Croats, and others were murdered in Jasenovac concentration camp alone. The predominantly Serb Chetniks, a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement and guerrilla force, engaged in war crimes and ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats in order to establish a Greater Serbia, while also supporting the reinstatement of a Serbian monarchy. Some historians view these crimes as constituting genocide. The most recent estimates on the number of Muslims and Croats deaths caused by the Chetniks in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina range from 47,000 to 65,000. Following the victory of Yugoslav Partisans, who were led by the Croatian communist Josip Broz Tito, the Usta≈°a and the Chetniks were defeated. Yugoslav communists abolished the monarchy and established one-party socialist republic and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Newly formed socialist Yugoslav state under Tito's benevolent dictatorship \\"...All Yugoslavs had educational opportunities, jobs, food, and housing regardless of nationality. Tito, seen by most as a benevolent dictator, brought peaceful co-existence to the Balkan region, a region historically synonymous with factionalism.\\" was made up of six socialist republics including SR Serbia and SR Croatia. = Yugoslav wars= The period of 1991 to 1995 is marked as the Croatian War of Independence. It was preceded by SANU Memorandum which was published by Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1986 and which had assumed creation of Greater Serbia, consisting of most of Croatian territory and whole Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. For this purpose, Serbs living in Croatia stimulated by Serbian leadership established Republic of Serbian Krajina, which captured third of the whole territory of Croatia, which was occupied by the remnants of the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav People's Army (from Serbia and Montenegro) from 1991 to 1992 and was supported by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia through military support.Martiƒá verdict, pp. 122‚Äì123 \\"The Trial Chamber found that the evidence showed that the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, openly supported the preservation of Yugoslavia as a federation of which the SAO Krajina would form a part. However, the evidence established that Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá covertly intended the creation of a Serb state. This state was to be created through the establishment of paramilitary forces and the provocation of incidents in order to create a situation where the JNA could intervene. Initially, the JNA would intervene to separate the parties but subsequently the JNA would intervene to secure the territories envisaged to be part of a future Serb state.\\" The reason for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to support the Republic of Serbian Krajina against Croatian forces were common interests in upholding the status quo of keeping ethnic Serbs of former Yugoslav territories united, either within the extant Yugoslav state or as satellite states serving as proxies to Belgrade.Brown & Karim (1995), p. 120 The war killed some 20,000 people from both sides. An estimated 170,000 to 250,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were expelled from parts of Croatia overrun by Serb forces and hundreds of Croatian and other non-Serbian civilians were killed. During the Croatian military's Operation Storm in August 1995, around 250,000 Serbs fled from their homes and hundreds of Serb civilians were killed. Post-war relations After the end of the Croatian War of Independence, the two countries established diplomatic relations on 9 September 1996. Croatia filed a genocide lawsuit against Serbia at the International Court of Justice in 1999, and after Zagreb declined requests to withdraw it, Belgrade filed a countersuit in 2010. Both lawsuits were dismissed on 3 February 2015, as International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found no evidence to support either claim. The court ruled that both sides undoubtedly committed crimes, but they were not committed with genocidal intent so they are not considered genocide according to the Court's definition of genocide. =Border dispute= Boris Tadiƒá, President of Serbia, and Stjepan Mesiƒá, President of Croatia, in Zagreb, 2007. Boris Tadiƒá, President of Serbia, and Jadranka Kosor, Prime Minister of Croatia, in Ptuj, 2010. Due to the meandering of the Danube, the eastern border of Baranja with Serbia according to cadastral delineation is not followed, as each country controls territory on their side of the main river flow. Further south, near Vukovar and near ≈†arengrad, there are two river islands (Vukovarska ada and ≈†arengradska ada) which have been part of SR Croatia (during Yugoslavia) but during the war they came under Serbian control. Croatia is asking that the islands be returned because of the Badinter Arbitration Committee decision from 1991 that all internal borders between Yugoslav republics have become international. Serbia's position is that the natural border between the countries is the middle of the main flow of Danube, which would make the islands Serbian territory. Military occupation of the islands ended recently after an incident in which Serbian military opened fire and arrested the mayor of Vukovar Vladimir ≈†tengel with 19 other Croatian civilians and 8 children who were going to visit Zvezdan Kisiƒá, the mayor of the Serbian town Baƒçka Palanka. These islands are now under Serbian police control. =Consulate General of Serbia in Vukovar= Serbia established a diplomatic mission in Vukovar, Croatia on 5 February 1998, twenty days after the end of the reintegration process of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia into Croatia, which was the end of the Croatian War of Independence. The consulate is responsible for five Slavonian counties: Vukovar-Syrmia County, Osijek- Baranja, Brod-Posavina, Po≈æega-Slavonia and Virovitica-Podravina County. Due to the huge interest of local citizens, in the beginning consulate operated also in Beli Manastir. The consulate at the end of the war played a very positive role in the life of the local Serbian minority in the city and region. Representatives of the consulate are frequent interlocutors of local and national media when it comes to issues of protection and promotion of Serbian identity in the Danube region. Consulate organizes and participates in various cultural and educational projects and humanitarian actions, some of which are: celebration of the signing of Erdut Agreement, showing of documentary films, donation of equipment, organizing concerts etc. On the occasion of 150 anniversary of the birth of Nikola Tesla, consulate was, in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb, co-financed Days of Nikola Tesla in Osijek. Over time the consulate achieved close cooperation with minority institutions and organizations such as Joint Council of Municipalities, Eparchy of Osjeƒçko polje and Baranja, and Radio Borovo. Recent developments In 2005, the Republic of Croatia ratified a bilateral agreement with Serbia and Montenegro on the protection of the Serbian and Montenegrin minority in Croatia and the Croatian national minority in Serbia and Montenegro. However, Serbs continue to face discrimination in public sector employment and the restitution of tenancy rights to social housing vacated during the war. International organizations Both countries are full members of the Southeast European Cooperation Process, Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, Central European Initiative and Southeast European Cooperative Initiative. Croatia also supports Accession of Serbia to the European Union. Popular culture =Rivalry in basketball= Vlade Divac and Dra≈æen Petroviƒá at the 1990 FIBA World Championship The big rivalry in basketball started at the FIBA European Championship in 1995. At the time, Croatia was a newly independent state, while Serbia was a federal unit of FR Yugoslavia. Both countries did well in the tournament, with Yugoslavia ranking first. The third-place Croatian team caused an international scandal when they walked off the medal stand and out of the arena just before Serbs and Montenegrins were about to receive their gold medals. Curiously, there hasn't been a single direct game involving the two countries over the course of the championship. Croatia and Yugoslavia did face each other in a game at EuroBasket 1997. Four seconds before the end of the tense game, Croatian team was leading by two points when Serbian Sa≈°a ƒêorƒëeviƒá took the ball and made a three-pointer, winning the game for Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia went on to win the championship, while Croatia ended up ranking 11th overall. Afterward, on Euro championship 2001, Croats were heavily beaten by 88:60. Last match on big competitions was at the 2016 Olympics, were Serbia also won 86:83. This rivalry went on also to clubs. Serbian clubs dominate in regional league, where they won nine times (Partizan eight times), and Croatian club won only one title. Particularly at the final game of the regional ABA league with Partizan from Serbia and Cibona from Croatia. This time the Croats were leading just 0.6 seconds before the end of the game. When all seemed finished, the Serb from Partizan, Kecman, took the ball and made it from the other side. The Serbian team won again. = Rivalry in football = Rivalries between Croatian and Serbian football contenders became especially famous to the world in the early 1990s, starting with the historic Dinamo Zagreb‚ÄìRed Star Belgrade riot, which emphasized in some peoples' eyes the breakup of Yugoslavia. The Croatian national football team and the Yugoslav national football team played on only a few occasions‚Äîthe first being in 1999 for UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 8. Nevertheless, the rivalry between the two teams has been described as one of fiercest in the world.CNN ‚Äì SPORT ‚Äì Football ‚Äì Top 10 international rivalries Retrieved 6 November 2008.Goal ‚Äì News ‚Äì Portugal v Spain & the 10 most intense international football rivalries Retrieved 26 June 2012.Reuters ‚Äì Soccer ‚Äì Serbia and Croatia in World Cup stare-down Retrieved 31 July 2011.Caufght offside ‚Äì Fifa 2014 World Cup qualifying draw: Some hugely interesting fixtures ahead Retrieved 30 July 2011.

The match, which Croatia won 2‚Äì0, was closely followed around the world.

Later, Croatia drew Serbia 1-1 in Belgrade which meant Serbia was eliminated. During the match, Miralem Sulejmani, who was in a goal scoring opportunity, was knocked down by a tactical tackle from Josip ≈†imuniƒá for which he was given a red card. Some Serbs, including the tennis star Novak Djokovic, who supported Croatia's national team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, were publicly criticized by some politicians and media who called them \\"idiots\\" and \\"psychopaths\\". Vladimir ƒêukanoviƒá, a member of Serbia‚Äôs ruling Serbian Progressive Party and Vjerica Radeta, the Vice President of the National Assembly of Serbia, branded Djokovic an \\"idiot\\" and said that he should be ashamed of himself for backing their neighbouring country, the former citing the plight of Krajina Serbs.

Before the introduction of the league, Football Federation Australia (FFA) chairman Frank Lowy said he hoped to expand the competition into cities such as Hobart and Launceston, among others. In October 2007, Football Federation Tasmania CEO Martin Shaw suggested that Tasmania would be a viable location for an A-League club, mentioning the fact that it would need support from state and local government. It has been suggested that such a team would play games in both Hobart and Launceston. In 2008, a Tasmanian football taskforce was formed to investigate an A-League bid. The taskforce registered the name \\"Tasmania United FC\\" and submitted a bid for the join the 2011‚Äì12 A-League season. Despite multiple failed attempts to join the A-League, Tasmania United remains active in promoting a Tasmanian- based A-League club.

Indeed, the AFL has consistently refused Tasmania's push to have its own team, with economic factors being brought into play.

The Taskforce was unable to complete a formal proposal in time for the early expansion, although the Taskforce continued operating with the intention of obtaining a future A-league licence. Ken Morton has since stated that he believes Tasmania United FC's chance of entering the A-League to be \\"100%. I believe the A-League want us, the Tasmanian community want us and for this reason I believe it will become reality.\\" On 16 March 2009, Chairman John McGirr stated that the task force was in negotiation with a Dubai businessman regarding sponsorship and ownership of Tasmania United FC.http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25196677-2722,00.html The businessman has since been named as Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi‚Äîthe 77th richest man in the world with a net worth of $13.7 billion.Sheik in Tassie team bid Sport ‚Äì The Mercury ‚Äì The Voice of Tasmania As of December 2010, it is unknown if Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi has any involvement with the consortium. On 22 April 2009 the Tasmanian Government launched a six-week feasibility study to determine the possibility of a Tasmanian A-League side being viable. Stratcorp Consulting and Sporting Management Concepts, the same business to successfully manage the Melbourne Heart A-League licence bid have been engaged to manage the study utilising their experience in this field. The outcome was a final Report that considered the key issues and questions that decision makers and potential funding partners may have in relation to the need for the proposed A-League team. The Report was aimed at exciting key Ministers and Government staff about the opportunities to establish the team and provide sufficient need and justification to enable Government commitment. This feasibility study succeeded in obtaining State Government and FFA support and shortly after its review the State Government agreed to provide funding towards the preparation of a Business Plan. With the positive feedback obtained from the completed feasibility study, the taskforce obtained funding from the Tasmanian State Government to cover those costs associated with the preparation of a business plan that could be made available to both investors and the FFA. The business plan was completed successfully in late December 2010, with the consortium stating that it would be making a presentation to both the FFA and key investors in early to mid-2011 with the express intention of winning the now vacant 11th A-league licence for the 2012‚Äì2013 Season along with gaining crucial private investment. There is unknown if Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi‚Äîthe 77th richest man in the world, may be one of these potential investors. Early in 2011 the results of the business plan were released to the public by Tasmania United FC and these demonstrated that Tasmania could hold an A-league licence.http://www.arts.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/38845/Sc1423_Final_Report_v4_-_Public_Release.pdf Shortly after the business plan was released to the public the current state government made a media release alongside representatives of Football Federation Tasmania, who had no involvement with Tasmania United FC or a Tasmanian bid until that point, and with no members of the Tasmania United FC board present.Minister for Sport's media release on Tasmanian A-League team business case  April At the media release the State Government stated that they would not be pursuing any bid and that if they were to do so in the future then they would utilise a business model where Football Federation Tasmania controlled all aspects of the bid and club.Tassie A-League dream Soccer ‚Äì The Mercury ‚Äì The Voice of Tasmania A short time afterwards the board of Tasmania United FC who had laid the foundation stated that they would continue to press for a future Tasmanian A-League licence that worked with the State Government and Football Federation Tasmania, though as a wholly independent body. =Club culture= It has been decided that Tasmania United FC will be a club with a nickname that represents all Tasmanians. Many oppose using the name 'Tigers' as the state cricket team already has this nickname. For similar reasons the name 'Tassie Devils' may also be excluded as the former Tasmanian VFL side used this name and there is the expectation that it will be the name of a future Tasmanian-based AFL side. The Taskforce has obtained supporter opinion of the names Wolves, Apples, Lions, Convicts, Pirates and Islanders and several others through the use of website polling. Another suggestion was The Wanderers due to the famous overland walking track, however this title is now taken. No firm decisions have been made although Wolves remains a highly popular choice making use of the thylacines name 'native marsupial wolf'. =Potential home ground= Despite a growing national interest supporters of a Tasmanian A-League club are still divided over the location of home games with both the north and south ends of the state supporting home games being played in their own region. The two supporter groups are focused on either Hobart or Launceston. Both cities contain sporting venues; Bellerive Oval in Hobart and Aurora Stadium in Launceston, but both are oval designs and would be far from ideal. In spite of these concerns the Tasmanian A-league Taskforce have in consultation with the FFA implemented a policy directed towards delivering one A-League Club for all Tasmanians playing home games in both the north and south of the state. This has resulted in considerable frustration for some football fans in both the north and south of the state who believe that football should be solely located in their region only. Given that the future establishment of a 20/20 League in Australia may prevent the use of Bellerive stadium for A-League matches, other facilities have been suggested including the redevelopment of King George V Oval, North Hobart Oval, Wentworth Park or Rugby Park, along with the possible complete development of an entirely new sporting precinct somewhere in the Greater Hobart region. These possibilities are all reliant upon potential investment from third parties. Many potential supporters of A-League in Tasmania have encouraged the redevelopment of North Hobart Oval as Tasmania's premier association rules and rugby field in Tasmania. Other grounds that may be suitable for friendly matches include both the Devonport Oval and West Park in Burnie, as a Tasmanian A-league side will no doubt want a presence on the North West Coast of the state, if only in friendly matches. =Squad= During the bidding process, although there were no plans to sign players until the granting of an A-League licence, Ken Morton stated that he already had in mind \\"2 Dutch Under 21 stars who I think would do very well and they would be great acquisitions for the A-League. Both played in Under 21 European Championships for Holland.\\" However, with a delay to submission of the bid these acquisitions did not eventuate. While no firm decisions have been made Ken states that he is establishing scouting networks \\"through existing scouts in Brazil, the UK and Asia.\\" and intends to look at recruiting both locally and from \\"Asia, Africa and Europe.\\" When asked if he would be prepared to apply for the senior coach position once an A-League licence was granted, Ken Morton stated \\"Yes, without a doubt.\\" =National Youth League squad= Following the successful friendly matches played between a Tasmanian Youth Side and National Youth League squads Ken Morton has stated that \\"given a chance our youngsters can compete at this level\\" and that \\"the passion shown by these boys was tremendous.\\" Tasmanian sides have also performed in previous National Championships See also *Expansion of the A-League References External links * Official Tasmania United website Category:Expansion of the A-League Category:Soccer clubs in Tasmania Category:Association football clubs established in 2008 ","title":"Tasmanian A-League bid"},{"id":"20081838","text":"The Libyan Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science also known as LCRSSS, established in 1989, is a governmental research organization dedicated to the researches in remote sensing, space, and earthquake sciences, currently with more than 5 research stations.

Economic cooperation was marked by the construction of a small factory on the island with Yugoslav capitals.

It is used for a type of silicon based multijunction thin-film solar cell.  The micromorph cell  Micromorph cells are thin film solar cells based on a multijunction‚Äìarchitecture consisting of two solar cells that are stacked on top of each other. While the thin amorphous silicon top cell absorbs the blue light, the thicker microcrystalline silicon bottom cell absorbs the red and near-infrared light, allowing this so-called tandem cell to cover a wider range of the solar spectrum. Since the bandgaps of amorphous Silicon (1.7eV) and microcrystalline Silicon (1.1eV) are well suited for tandem solar cells, the Shockley-Queisser limit of this cell allows conversion efficiencies of over 30%. In reality this limit can not be reached and typical stable efficiencies are about 9% (world record 11.7%). That is well over the stable efficiencies of single junction thin film silicon solar cells which are around 6%. One reason of the low costs of silicon thin film solar cells is its very low thickness (2 Œºm) compared to silicon wafer (200 Œºm). In the red and infrared wavelength range 2 Œºm of silicon are not enough to absorb all light and therefore 'light trapping' is needed. The advantage of the micromorph approach is that it keeps the thickness of the amorphous top cell low. This reduces the effect of degradation induced by light (Staebler-Wronski effect). In multijunction cells top and bottom cell have to produce the same current. But the top cell is limited by the Staebler-Wronski effect and therefore light trapping and an intermediate reflector are needed to keep the thickness of the top cell low while increasing its current.  The intermediate reflector  The intermediate reflector is a layer (IRL) of Zinc oxide (ZnO intermediate reflector: ZIR) or Silicon oxide (SiOx intermediate reflector: SOIR) between the top and the bottom cell. Due to its lower refractive index of around 2 comparing to the surrounding silicon (4) light is reflected back into the top cell. This increases the top cell current from around 10mA/cm^2 to 12mA/cm^2, but reduces the bottom cell current by an equal amount.  The word micromorph  This artificial word was first mentioned in a scientific publication of the University of Neuch√¢tel research group of Prof. Arvind Shah by the author J. Meier in the year 1995 [1], but is based on long pioneering research of several authors and of several years. For a detailed list of publications, see the two main research group's publications website under http://pvlab.epfl.ch and under https://web.archive.org/web/20110222142422/http://www.fz- juelich.de/ief/ief-5/publicger/ Years later, other European, Japanese and American research groups started research activities in the field of improving the conversion efficiency of thin-film silicon solar cells by utilizing the stacked solar cell concept, naming the micromorph device 'hybrid' solar cell or naming the microcrystalline silicon absorber 'nanocrystalline' or even 'policrystalline' silicon. The word 'micromorph' has been lately claimed to belong to an equipment manufacturer of silicon coating tools, but in a patent judgement, this claim has not been accepted by European patent offices [2].

Also Hungary is an EU member and Serbia is an EU candidate. The two countries share 151 km of common border. There are around 254,000 people of Hungarian descent according to the latest census living in northern Serbia (particularly in Vojvodina) and around 7,000 people of traditional Serbian descent living in Hungary (not counting migrants from Serbia to Hungary since the 1990s).

However, Hungary participated in the Axis invasion on Yugoslavia which prompted the then Prime Minister of Hungary P√°l Teleki to commit suicide. In the communist era, Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito was against the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and supportive of Soviet military uses against Hungarians; but the suppression of Hungarian protesters by Soviet army might have influenced Tito's decision to change against the Soviets at the Prague Spring a decade later. The relationship between Serbia and Hungary went downhill in the 1990s, when Yugoslavia started to disintegrate. Hungary was one of the earliest supporters of newly independent Croatia,http://www.regione.taa.it/biblioteca/normativa/bilaterali/Ungheria%20Croazia_en.pdf and was among the major participants in the NATO-led bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. This strained relations between the two countries, with Hungary also sharing concerns over its Hungarian population in Yugoslavia.http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/30/hungary.concerns/ The atrocities of Yugoslav authorities against Hungarians such as deportation of Hungarian population also steered anti-Serbian sentiment in Hungary. Later, the relations continued to worsen, with Hungary being one of the earliest nations in the world to recognize Kosovo as an independent state.https://bbj.hu/politics/hungary-to-recognize-kosovo_37764 In 2013, a historical reconciliation was marked after decades of tensions between Belgrade and Budapest.Historical reconciliation between Hungary and Serbia The President of Hungary, J√°nos √Åder gave a speech in front of the National Assembly where he issued an official apology for the Hungarian role in the World War II persecution of Serbs such as Novi Sad raid.Hungary's president apologizes to Serbia for WW2 crimes In turn, in 2014 the Serbian National Assembly symbolically voided Yugoslav laws on collective guilt of Hungarian people for crimes committed during World War II.Big Step Forward In Hungarian- Serbian Reconciliation Serbian heritage in Hungary Serbian Kovin Monastery Grabovac Monastery The presence of Serbs in the territory of present-day Hungary dates from the Middle Ages. The mother of the Hungarian king G√©za II (1141-1162) was Helena of Serbia, a daughter of Uro≈° I, ruler of the Grand Principality of Serbia,. During the rule of G√©za II, her brother Belo≈° Vukanoviƒá was a palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary. Since the 14th century, escaping from the Ottoman threat, a large number of Serbs migrated to the Kingdom of Hungary. The most complex example of Serb architectural heritage in Hungary is the old town of Szentendre (Serbian: Sentandreja), next to the Danube, with 7 Orthodox Churches (two of which have been sold), brightly coloured merchant houses and the Museum of Serb Orthodox Heritage. In Budapest, the Serb Orthodox Cathedral in the Tab√°n district was damaged in WWII and later demolished. There is an old Serb Orthodox Church in Serb Street, Pest and the famous Serb college, Th√∂k√∂lyanum (Serbian: Tekelijanum). There are Serbian churches in V√°c (Vac), Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r (Stoni Beograd) with a Serbian open-air village museum, Szeged (Segedin), Baja (Baja) with two churches, Moh√°cs (Mohaƒç), Sikl√≥s (≈†iklo≈°), Eger (Jegra), Gy≈ër (ƒêur), Esztergom (Ostrogon), H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely (Va≈°arhelj).

Hungarian heritage in Serbia Cs√°rd√°s folk dance in Doroslovo Parts of the Vojvodina region were included into the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 10th century, and Hungarians then began to settle in the region, which before that time was mostly populated by Slavs. During Hungarian administration, Hungarians formed the largest part of population in northern parts of the region. Count Imre Cs√°ky settled Hungarians in his possessions in Baƒçka in 1712. In 1745, Hungarian colonists settled in Senta, in 1750 in Topola, in 1752 in Doroslovo, in 1772 in Bogojevo, in 1760 in Stara Kanji≈æa, in 1764 in Iƒëo≈°, in 1767 in Petrovo Selo, in 1776 in Martono≈°, in 1786 in Paƒçir and Ostojiƒáevo, in 1787 in Piro≈°, and in 1789 in Feketiƒá. Between 1782 and 1786, Hungarians settled in Crvenka and Stara Moravica, and in 1794 in Kula. Between 1751 and 1753, Hungarians settled in Mol and Ada (Those originated mostly from Szeged and J√°szs√°g). In 1764‚Äì1767, Hungarians settled in Subotica, Bajmok and ƒåantavir, and in 1770 again in Kanji≈æa, Mol, Ada and Petrovo Selo, as well as in Feldvarac, Sentoma≈° and Turija. In Banat, the settling of Hungarians started later. In 1784 Hungarians settled in Padej and Nakovo, in 1776 in Torda, in 1786 in Donji Itebej, in 1796 in Beodra and ƒåoka, in 1782 in Mono≈°tor, in 1798 in Maƒëarska Crnja, in 1773 in Krstur and Majdan, in 1774 in Debeljaƒça, in 1755‚Äì1760 in Beƒçkerek, and in 1766 in Vr≈°ac. In the 19th century, the Hungarian colonization increased. From the beginning of the century, the Hungarian individuals and small groups of settlers from Alf√∂ld constantly immigrating to Baƒçka. In the first half of the 19th century larger and smaller groups of the colonists settled in Mol (in 1805), as well as in Feldvarac, Temerin and Novi Sad (in 1806). In 1884, Hungarian colonists settled in ≈†ajka≈°ka and in Mali Stapar near Sombor. In 1889, Hungarians were settled in Svilojevo near Apatin and in 1892 in Gombo≈°, while another group settled in Gombo≈° in 1898. Many Hungarian settlers from Gombo≈° moved to Baƒçka Palanka. After the abolishment of the Military Frontier, Hungarian colonists were settled in Potisje, ƒåurug, ≈Ωabalj, ≈†ajka≈°ki Sveti Ivan, Titel and Mo≈°orin. In 1883 around 1,000 Sz√©kely Hungarians settled in Kula, Stara Kanji≈æa, Stari Beƒçej and Titel. In 1800, smaller groups of Hungarian colonists from Dun√°nt√∫l settled in ƒåoka, while in the same time colonists from Csan√°d and Csongr√°d counties settled in area around Itebej and Crnja, where they at first lived in scattered small settlements, and later they formed one single settlement - Maƒëarska Crnja. In 1824, one group of colonists from ƒåestereg also settled in Maƒëarska Crnja. In 1829 Hungarians settled in Mokrin, and in 1880 an even larger number of Hungarians settled in this municipality. In 1804, Hungarian colonists from Csongr√°d county settled in Firiƒëhaza (which was then joined with Turska Kanji≈æa), as well as in Sajan and Torda. Even a larger group of Hungarians from Csongr√°d settled in 1804 in Debeljaƒça. In 1817‚Äì1818 Hungarians settled in Veliki Bikaƒç, and in 1820‚Äì1840 smaller groups of Hungarians settled in Vranjevo. In 1826, colonists from J√°szs√°g and Kuns√°g settled in Araƒç near Beodra. In 1830, Hungarians from Alf√∂ld settled in Veliki Lec, in 1831 in Ostojiƒáevo, in 1832 in Malenƒçino Selo near Veliki Gaj, in 1839 and 1870 in Padej, in 1840 in Jermenovci and Maƒëarski Sentmihalj, in 1840‚Äì1841 in Du≈°anovac, in 1841 in Hetin, in 1859 in Sanad, in 1869 in ƒêurƒëevo (later moved to Skorenovac), and in 1890 in Gornja Mu≈ælja. In 1883‚Äì1886, Sz√©kely Hungarians from Bukovina were settled in Vojlovica, Skorenovac, Ivanovo and ƒêurƒëevo. Total number of Sz√©kely colonists was 3,520.

Diplomatic relations have been maintained since Poland and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes established them in 1919. Middle Ages Queen Jadwiga of Poland ( 1384‚Äì99) had partial Serbian ancestry, through King Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276‚Äì82) of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. Serbian fiddlers (guslars) were mentioned at the court of Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (r. 1386‚Äì1434) in 1415. Polish knight Zawisza Czarny, who joined Bohemian King Sigismund's war against the Ottomans, fell at the Golubac fortress in eastern Serbia in 1428; there is a commemorative plaque on the fortress in his honour (ƒåesma Zavi≈°e Crnog). Hungarian commander John Hunyadi led a long campaign against the Ottomans in 1443‚Äì44, accompanied by Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw III, Serbian despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Wallachian voivode Vlad II Dracul, and a Polish contingent. They marched throughout Serbia and defeated the Ottomans. The Polish hussars (cavalry) originated in mercenary units of exiled Serbian warriors, the concept having originated in Serbia in the late 14th century. The oldest mention of hussars in Polish documents date to 1500, although they were probably in service earlier. Early modern history After the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, Serbian guslars (fiddlers) found refuge throughout Europe, as mentioned in sources. Polish poets of the 17th century mentioned Serbian epic poetry and the gusle in their works. In a poem published in 1612, Kasper Miaskowski wrote that \\"the Serbian gusle and gaidas will overwhelm Shrove Tuesday\\" (Serbskie skrzypki i dudy ostatek zagluszƒÖ).Kre≈°imir Georgijeviƒá (2003). –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ—Ö—Ä–≤–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Å–º–∞ —É –ø–æ—ô—Å–∫–æ—ò –∫—ö–∏–∂–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (in Serbian).

The Internet Archive. p.39 Modern history =19th century= After the November Uprising (1830‚Äì31), Polish revolutionaries fled to the Principality of Serbia. Serbian commander, and later politician, Ilija Gara≈°anin (1812‚Äì1874) contacted these Polish emigrees. It was a Pole, Adam Czartoryski, who initiated the Naƒçertanije project (the precursor to Greater Serbia). The great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz (1798‚Äì1855) thought highly of Serb epic poetry, and chose it as a theme of lectures at Coll√®ge de France. The Serbians and Poles were part of the Pan-Slavic Sokol organizations, along with other Slavic nations. =World War I= In March 1914, Serbian, French, Polish and Greek allied troops landed at Odessa. In the early fall of 1918, an Allied account said that Serbs and Poles in a region from the Urals to Volga had been recruited by a French officer. In 1918, Serbs and Poles together with Chinese, were part of the \\"Officer's Corps\\", a unit of the Russian Consul at Harbin. =World War II= Serbs and Poles were some of the major Slavic victims of Nazi war crimes in Europe. The Nazis considered all Poles and Serbs as Untermensch, meaning \\"subhumans\\". Many ethnic Poles and ethnic Serbs died in concentration camps, or during retaliative guerrilla fights. Poles joined the Yugoslav Partisans in the beginning of the war. Yugoslav Partisans were often compared to the Polish Underground State and the Polish Resistance Movement which was the largest anti-Nazi guerrilla movement in the whole Europe. In the mountains of Serbia in the years 1942‚Äì43 there were three Polish companies attached to the Chetnik Corps. The Rules of Chetnik Warfare was first published in Polish, then translated into Serbian. On 1 June 1944, a Balkan Air Force was established by the British. It had mostly British, but also Italian, a Yugoslav squadron, and a Polish flight. Politics =Kosovo= Boris Tadiƒá meeting with Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, at the 63rd UN General Assembly session in September 2008 Polish opinion on NATO intervention in FR Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99) was mixed: 37% favoured involvement while 43% were against. The government decided in favor of a NATO-led operation to bring cease-fire in the conflict. During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in May 1999, a poll found 51% felt attacks to be justified, 26% opposed. Another poll found 53% in favour and 35% opposed. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Poland recognized it on 26 February 2008.Poland Recognizes Kosovo Poland was the first Slavic country to do so. In September 2008, President of Poland, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, stated that the original cause of the 2008 South Ossetia war was not the Georgian operation, but the recognition of Kosovo's independenceLet's First Help Georgia, Then Talk about Russia and that he would block attempts to establish diplomatic relations of Poland with Kosovo at ambassadorial level; however, the government has not proposed to send an ambassador to Pristina.Poland won't open embassy in Pri≈°tina The recognition of Kosovo Albanian independence has been criticized in Poland. Dozens of protests and demonstrations have been organized by various groups in Poland in support of the Serbian cause in Kosovo, with some attracting up to 1,500 to 2,000 people. An organization called \\"Poles for Serbian Kosovo\\" was formed in order to provide and support for Serbs in Kosovo. Also Poland is an EU member and Serbia is an EU candidate. Peacekeeping Poland had (as of July 2009) 274 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO-led Kosovo Force. Originally there were 800 Polish troops in KFOR.\\"Kosovo Force (KFOR)\\" www.nato.int Link accessed 21-07-09 Cultural relations The Polish and Serbian languages, both part of the Slavic languages (West and South branches, respectively), are related but not mutually intelligible. Due to huge popularity of the Yugoslav rock scene in Poland in the 1970s and 1980s, many Yugoslav artists toured Poland. Elektriƒçni orgazam recorded a live album titled Warszawa \\"'81'\\" to support the Polish opposition against Wojciech Jaruzelski. These connections in the 1980s led to albums being produced in Poland based on covers of popular Serbian and Yugoslav Rock bands with the albums Yugoton and Yugopolis covering artists such as Bajaga i Instruktori, Idoli and Elektriƒçni orgazam. The Kayah i Bregoviƒá-album by Polish singer-songwriter Kayah and Serbian musician Goran Bregoviƒá became a bestseller after its release in 1999. Poles in Serbia There are documents on Polish officers participating in the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813). In the second half of the 19th century, especially after the suppression of the January Uprising in Poland (1864), some 20 Polish doctors arrived in Serbia, most of which settled down and gave a great contribution to the development of medical culture in the renewed Serbian state. The League of Yugoslavia‚ÄìPoland (Liga Jugoslavija-Poljska) was active in the Interwar period, aimed at economical and cultural cooperation with Poland. The League was not a diaspora organization, although it gathered also a small number of Yugoslav Poles at its seat in Uzun‚ÄìMirko's Street 5 in Belgrade, especially during national and Catholic holidays. Members of the League helped Polish soldiers and civilians who in autumn 1939 fled from Romania via Yugoslavia to the West. Immediately after World War II some tens of Polish women with their Serbian husbands arrived in Serbia; they had met at forced labour- and concentration camps in Germany. The largest part of the Polonia (Polish diaspora) in Serbia is made up of women who married in Yugoslavia in the 1960s and 70s. During the Yugoslav wars, when Yugoslavia broke up, many Polish and their families either returned to Poland or emigrated to the West. According to the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Serbia, there are around 1,000 Polish citizens living in Serbia. These are individuals born in Poland, as well as their descendants from mixed marriages. Apart from Belgrade, larger numbers exist in Ni≈°, Novi Sad, Kraljevo, Vrnjaƒçka Banja and Subotica. The only community regarded starosedeoci (\\"natives\\"), is the one inhabiting Ostojiƒáevo in northern Serbia, having settled in the mid-19th century from the Vistula. Serbian people of Polish descent Serbian aviators Tadija Sondermajer and Stanislav Sondermajer, the youngest fighter in the Battle of Cer (1914), were of paternal Polish descent. Serbian officer and journalist Stanislav Krakov (1895‚Äì1968) had a father of Polish origin. Journalist and military analyst Miroslav Lazanski is of paternal Polish ancestry. Film director and political commentator Boris Malagurski is of distant paternal Polish ancestry.‚ÄûV√≠tejte v Kosovu, va≈°e auto je u≈æ tady!‚Äú Liter√°rn√≠ noviny  Resident diplomatic missions  * Poland has an embassy in Belgrade. * Serbia has an embassy in Warsaw.

History  The history of relations between the two countries goes back to the Great Turkish War, Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686‚Äì91) and Great Serb Migrations (formation of Military Frontier and building of Petrovaradin Fortress), to the era when the Kingdom of Serbia (1718‚Äì1739) had been a province of the Habsburg Monarchy, and the last Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì91) at the time of Habsburg- occupied Serbia (1788‚Äì92). Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip ( Domenica del Corriere, 12 July 1914) Foreign relations, as such, date from the proclamation of the Austrian Empire in 1804 and the formation in 1817 of the Principality of Serbia, an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire. The Habsburg recognized the independence of Serbia and established diplomatic relations in 1874, supported by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). Hungarian suppression of Serbian revolts during the 1848 Revolutions were not opposed by the Habsburg rulers. Serbian claims were not recognized by Hungary was eventually placated with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, further angering Serbian nationalists. One notable flare- up between the two countries was the 1906-1909 economic conflict known as the Pig War which occurred simultaneously with the diplomatic and military crisis over the Austrian annexation of Bosnia. Ultimately, the tensions between the two countries could not withstand the strain of Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Bosnian Serbs in 1914. Following the July Crisis, Austria invaded Serbia to punish it for allegedly supporting the assassins. The resulting war eventually destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leaving a shrunken First Austrian Republic as a rump state. Serbia annexed much of the former Austrian holdings in the Balkans to become the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Austria was eventually annexed by Germany, ending its separate foreign relations. A number of Serb medical doctors and veterinarians got educated in Austria during the interwar period and earlier as well.

The mural portrays Britain and the Allies, Serbia is shown as one of the little girls. The Kingdom of Serbia and the UK were allies in World War I. British, and more specifically, English influence in Serbia became more relevant only after WWI. Around 350 Serb pupils and students received an education in the United Kingdom during this period and afterwards, under the supervision of university professor Pavle Popoviƒá, who was a visiting professor at King's College. The Serbian Relief Fund and Serbian Minister's Fund were formed for the purpose of providing financial and other aid to Serb students in UK, and a hostel for Serb students was opened. In the 1920s, Serbs went to England to study banking, finances and economics, while in the 1930s mining engineering was the main field of study. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the UK was perceived as a friendly country and an ally. Serb elites, based mostly in Belgrade, like Slobodan Jovanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic considered that Serbs and the English shared a joint love of liberty and fierce patriotism, and they advocated looking upon United Kingdom in order to further develop democracy in the country. As early as the 1920s, British capital made its way to Serbia, mostly through banks. In 1920, the British Trade Corporation was founded in Belgrade. Although this bank only operated until 1928, its work led to serious improvements in the local industry, primarily mining. In the same period, relations between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Church of England were established. Several big donations of books by English to Serbian libraries took place in the 1920s. British citizens were the main foreign sponsors of scientific research in the interwar period. Archaeological excavations in Vinƒça were funded by sir Charles Hyde. Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá played an important role in furthering the relations between the two countries. He was held in high regard in London, and Velimiroviƒá was the first Orthodox clergyman to preach at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. He established firm relations between the Serbian Orthodox Church with the Church of England. An English Language and Literature Department was formed in Belgrade in 1929. Cultural and other exchanges became popular in the interwar period. A number of societies of Yugoslav-British friendship were functioning in Belgrade in 1930s, with full support from the Yugoslav government. Several important local cultural figures were part of the friendship society, such as Isidora Sekuliƒá, Ra≈°a Plaoviƒá, and Viktor Novak. As of 1935, the English language was taught in schools in Serbia, but to a smaller degree compared to French and German, due to lack of teachers and political reasons. A total of 75 students with Yugoslav citizenship were enrolled at British faculties in the Interwar period, of which six got their PhD in the country, mostly in the subject of English literature. Following the Yugoslav coup d'√©tat, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia entered World War II on the Allied side.

The oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of Stephen Uro≈° I of Serbia and Helen of Anjou. The first important contacts of French and Serbs came only in the 19th century when French travel writers first wrote about this Balkan country. In the 19th century, Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá, leader of Serbian Revolution, sent a letter to Napoleon expressing his admiration, while in the French parliament, Victor Hugo made a speech asking France to assist Serbia and to protect the Serbian population from Ottoman crimes. Rapid development of bilateral relations followed, so that the people in Serbia saw a great new friend in \\"mighty France\\", that could protect them from the Ottomans and Habsburgs. Relations between Serbia and France continued to improve until the First World War, when the \\"common struggle\\" against a common enemy reached its peak. Before the war France won the sympathy of the Serbian population by building railways, opening French Schools, a Consulate and a French Bank. Several Serbian kings from this period studied at universities in Paris, as well as large part of the future diplomats. Serbs gained a sense of Francophile because all these activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg empires. The Serbian-French alliance until 1914 even threatened the traditional inclination towards Russia. Great humanitarian and military assistance was sent by France to Serbia during the First World War, including assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end of the war, and the support of French newspaper headlines. In the interwar period, rivaling German political influence became less relevant, and France became the primary influence in Kingdom of Yugoslavia and French culture was favored by Serb elites. Alexander, Prince regent of Serbia, and Raymond Poincar√©, President of France, in 1916. The members of four generations of the national elite known as 'Parisians' played an important role in the political life of modern Serbia. Liberals, Progressives, Radicals and Independent Radicals pursued and shaped modern political principles and values in 19th century Serbia. Implementing and creatively adapting French models and doctrines, and the 'Parisians' contributed to the democratization and Europeanization of Serbia and the eminent place the French influence had in her politics and culture before the WWI. Also, a number of notable Serb painters were educated and worked in France, mostly Paris. French was the second language in schools during the whole interwar period, and it was studied as the second language in Kingdom of Serbia. French influence was visible in the literary production which drew on French models. This influence was explained with ‚Äústrong spiritual similarity between the French and Serbian mentalities and the French and Serbian languages\\" and it had a fundamental role in creation of the \\"Belgrade style\\". Some French travelers wrote that ‚ÄúSerbia is the most Francophile country in the world‚Äù.

The Periferico was originally planned by architect Carlos Contreras as early as 1925, together with other major roads such as the Viaducto Miguel Alem√°n. Some parts of the beltway were built to follow the bed of a river; the flow of the river was modified to flow through a pipe.Jorge Legorreta. \\"Viaducto y Perif√©rico, creaciones urban√≠sticas de Carlos Contreras\\". La Jornada, 16 October 2002. The beltway gained major media attention when the Mexico City mayor, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, started a project to turn a southern section of the ring into a two- story highway. The second level was finished in 2006 in the Federal District and in the State of Mexico in 2009. From Cuautitl√°n in the north (State of Mexico) to Naucalpan at the Federal District border the second floor operates as the Viaducto Elevado Bicentenario (\\"Bicentennial Elevated Viaduct\\").

Its collection of specimens numbers over 320 000, making it the third largest university herbarium in the Southern Hemisphere. The collection is highly representative of the Cape Flora and also houses many type specimens. The international herbarium abbreviation BOL is used when referring to the Bolus Herbarium.  History  Dr. Harry Bolus (1834-1911), a rich Cape Town businessman, began his collection in 1865 in Graaff-Reinet, and it is now the oldest functioning herbarium in the country. After his death, the South African College (which changed its name to the University of Cape Town on April 2, 1918) inherited his herbarium; a library featuring many expensive, unique, and rare books on botany; and a substantial amount of money for the maintenance and expansion of the collection. In 1924, a dedicated building was erected for the herbarium in Kirstenbosch, but it proved unsuitable later. Therefore, the herbarium was moved onto the campus in 1938. Dr. Lulu Bolus, Harry's niece, was also involved with the herbarium until her death in 1970.  Goal  Botanical and ecological research at the herbarium runs the gamut. The focus is primarily on Cape Province flora, including their taxonomy, invasive plants, biogeography, systematics, and evolution. Scientists from around the world conduct research here.  Special collections  The best- known of the several collections of plants in the herbarium are Harry Bolus's set of orchids and heaths, Dr. H.M.L. (Lulu) Bolus's Mesembryanthemum, Dr. Augusta Vera Duthie's fungi, and Henry Georges Fourcade's trees from the area between Humansdorp and George.  Bequests  Several botanists bequeathed their collections of flora and books to the Bolus Herbarium. Among them were Dr. C. Louis Leipoldt in 1946, Fourcade in 1948, and Gen. Jan Smuts in 1950.  Publications  Between 1915 and 1928, 4 editions were published of the Annals of the Bolus Herbarium. Later, Contributions from the Bolus Herbarium appeared.

It was the forerunner of the great helm. Development and characteristics Modern replica enclosed helmet The enclosed helmet covered the entire head, with full protection for the face and somewhat deeper coverage for the sides and back of the head than that found on previous types of helmets. It was developed near the end of 12th century and was largely superseded by the true great helm by c. 1240.Gravett, Plate D and p. 54 It is distinguishable from the great helm by a much greater depth to the face protection when compared to the depth of the helmet at the rear and sides. It probably evolved from the nasal helmet, which had been produced in a flat-topped variant with a square profile by about 1180.Gravett, p. 17 The enclosed helmet was created by adding a face-protecting plate, pierced for sight and breathing, and by extending downwards the back and sides of a flat-topped helmet, to produce a cylindrical helm.Gravett, pp. 17 and 54 From the evidence of extant contemporary illustrations the face protection was added first, probably as an extension of the pre-existing nasal. Some German illustrations dating to around 1180 show a bar at the end of the nasal covering the mouth, if such a bar had been extended and curved back to the brow of the helmet, a forerunner of a full face-plate would have been created.Gravett, p. 17Nicolle (1988), Plate G, pp. 59 and 62 One of the earliest illustrations of a fully developed example of this type of helmet, with the addition of a fan-shaped crest, is depicted on the second Great Seal of Richard I of England dating to 1198.Gillingham, Plate facing p. 152 Use Knights wearing enclosed helmets. German manuscript c. 1215 - Henrik van Veldekes The enclosed helmet would have been worn over a mail coif, with additional padding circling the head to cushion the helmet and help absorb the force of any blow.Nicolle (1988), Plate E and p. 57 The helmet may have arisen from a need for greater facial protection in response to the penetrating power of couched lances used in the closely packed \\"conrois\\" formation,Nicolle (1988), pp. 25-26 or possibly as a response to an increased threat from archery.Nicolle (1996), p. 50 The enclosed helmet was only used by men of knightly rank. Many soldiers, including knights, disliked the restriction to sight and hearing imposed by the enclosed helmet, and therefore the more open round-topped and flat-topped nasal helmets, plus 'kettle hats', continued in use alongside it into the mid 13th century.Nicolle (1988), p. 27 - illustration of Maciejowski Bible c. 1250 References Bibliography * *Gravett, Christopher (1993) Norman Knight 950-1204 AD, Osprey, London. *Nicolle, David, (1988) The Crusades, Osprey, London. *Nicolle, David, (1996) Knight of Outremer 1187-1344 AD, Osprey, London.

The book has been translated into 28 languages and over a million copies have been sold worldwide. In 2011, a bootleg Kurdish translation was found in a bookstore in northern Iraq. Oz was reportedly delighted.  Background  The book documents much of Oz's early life, and includes a family history researched by an uncle of his father. It describes a number of events he previously hadn't communicated. For example, before writing the book, Oz had avoided discussing his mother's 1952 suicide with his father, or writing publicly about it. Summary Oz chronicles his childhood in Jerusalem in the last years of Mandatory Palestine and the early years of the State of Israel. The love and darkness of his title refer to his mother, whose suffering from severe depression led her to take her own life when he was a boy. The book is an effort to describe Oz's feelings for his mother and the pain of losing her. After her death he spent his teenage years on Kibbutz Hulda. His parents, mother Fania Mussman and father Ariyeh Klausner, feature as prominent characters within the book. Importantly, his mother's 1952 overdose of sleeping pills becomes the point of exploration for the work, launching the deep probing into other parts of his childhood and youth. As a child, he crossed paths with prominent figures in Israeli society, among them Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Shaul Tchernichovsky, and David Ben-Gurion. One of his teachers was the Israeli poet Zelda. Historian Joseph Klausner was his great-uncle. Told in a non-linear fashion, Oz's story is interwoven with tales of his family's Eastern European roots. The original family name was Klausner. By changing his own name to a Hebrew one, Oz separated himself from his father. Film adaptation A production company owned by Natalie Portman acquired the film rights to the book. Portman began shooting the movie in February 2014 in Jerusalem. The film marks her directorial feature film debut and she also plays the role of Oz's mother; Slawomir Idziak is director of photography and Amir Tessler played the young Oz. Translations Elias Khoury, a Palestinian-Israeli lawyer whose father Daoud was a victim in a suicide bombing of Zion Square and whose son George was shot to death by Palestinian militants who mistook him for a Jew (see George Khoury), paid to have the book translated into Arabic and distributed in Beirut and other Arab cities in order to promote better understanding of the Jewish people's narrative of national rebirth. The English translation was done by Nicholas de Lange and published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2004. The translation was praised by New York Magazine's book reviewer Boris Kacha as \\"preserving the author‚Äôs gorgeous, discursive style and his love of wordplay.\\"  Reception  The book was well-received, receiving several awards, and a number of positive reviews. Sales of the book were also high, with The Guardian Reviewer Linda Grant describing the book as the \\"biggest selling literary work in Israeli history.\\" Grant describes the book as \\"one of the funniest, most tragic and most touching books I have ever read,\\" and \\" a testament to a family, a time and a place.\\" New York magazine reviewer Boris Kachika described the novel as very well written, though \\"sometimes meandering,\\" but all in all a \\"sophisticated and searing memorial.\\" The Jewish Book Council reviewer, Maron L. Waxmon called the novel a \\"a masterful double memoir\\" of both himself and \\"Israel's birth and early years.\\" For Waxman, \\"This is an important and richly rewarding book, sensitively told and filled with memorably drawn characters.\\" Controversy In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti a copy of his book A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic translation with his personal dedication in Hebrew: ‚ÄúThis story is our story, I hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz‚Äù.

It is a complex surrealist work, where the creativity and resourcefulness of a destructive personality is marshalled against itself in a nightmarish narration. Synopsis The story opens with a description of a woman‚Äôs brains scattered across the floor of an abandoned lime works, and a half-frozen man crouching on the ground nearby, covered in manure. From this first grotesque scene, Bernhard begins his story, a compelling tale of two people insidiously bound to each other, told through a hypnotic wave of voices ‚Äì the people of the small Austrian town nearby (Sicking),Map of Sicking, Austria, with links & info. the officials, the salesmen, the chimney sweeps, the local gossips, the couple themselves. The man, Konrad, is consumed with his work ‚Äì a book that is to be both visionary and definitive, the ultimate treatise on the subject of hearing. His wife, a cripple, is the victim of his obsessive experiments: he whispers one phrase in her ear, over and over, hundreds of times, demanding from her impossible degrees of aural discrimination. She has no way of knowing, or no strength to tell herself, whether he is a deluded madman or a genius. For three decades, he has been waiting for the ideal moment, the perfect constellation of circumstances, to arise, so that he may begin writing down his conclusions. But he never begins, and he is now an old man. We watch as he compulsively invites his own ruin. We feel him creep from one moment to the next, terrified of failure. Suppose he started writing and then caught a cold? Suppose he finished and his tome was judged worthless? Or his wife destroyed it? Even amidst the total isolation of the lime works, where they live, he is continually distracted. He hallucinates about prowlers. He hoards bits of food for dreaded visitors. And she torments him. He must feed her, read to her, bring her cider from the deep cellar (one glass at the time), maintain her voluminous correspondence with servants he has long ago forgotten, try on a mitten she has been knitting and unravelling for years, tend the earaches she develops from constant experiments... until the monotony and heartlessness of their life together shatters in a bloodbath. Excerpt The many voices narrating the novel appear within brackets (and Laska‚Äôs is the local tavern): \\"...Konrad‚Äôs wife, whose maiden name was Zryd, a woman almost totally crippled by decades of taking the wrong medication, and who had consequently spent half her lifetime hunched over in her custom-built French invalid chair, but who is now, as Wieser puts it, out of her misery, was taught by Konrad how to use a Mannlicher carbine, a weapon the otherwise defenseless woman kept out of sight but always within reach, with the safety off, behind her chair, and it was with this gun that Konrad killed her on the night of December 24‚Äì25, with two shots in the back of her head (Fro); two shots in the temple (Wieser); abruptly (Fro) putting an end to their marital hell (Wieser). Konrad had always been quick to fire at anything within range of the house, they say at Laska‚Äôs, and as everyone knows he did shoot the woodcutter and game keeper Koller who was passing by on his way home from work one evening about four and a half years ago; quite soon after Konrad had moved in, carrying his knapsack and a hoe, and catching it in the left shoulder because Konrad mistook him for a burglar; for which shooting Konrad was in due course sentenced to nine and a half months at hard labor. The incident brought to light about fifteen previous convictions of Konrad‚Äôs, mostly for libel and aggravated assault, they say at Laska‚Äôs. Konrad served his time in the Wels district prison, where he is being held again right now...\\" \\\\--T.

The person is unable to control either the thoughts or activities for more than a short period of time. Common compulsions include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected, often taking up more than an hour a day. Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense. The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide. The cause is unknown. There appear to be some genetic components, with both identical twins more often affected than both non-identical twins. Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing event. Some cases have been documented to occur following infections. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug-related or medical causes. Rating scales such as the Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity. Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder. Treatment involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine. CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur. Contrary to this, metacognitive therapy encourages the ritual behaviors as to alter the relationship to one's thoughts about them. While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects and thus is typically reserved as a second-line treatment. Atypical antipsychotics may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects. Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades. Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their lives while rates during any given year are about 1.2%. It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of 35, and half of people develop problems before 20. Males and females are affected about equally and it occurs worldwide. The phrase obsessive‚Äìcompulsive is sometimes used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone as being excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated.  Signs and symptoms  OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings. A meta-analytic review of symptom structures found a four-factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable. The observed groups included a \\"symmetry factor\\", a \\"forbidden thoughts factor\\", a \\"cleaning factor\\", and a \\"hoarding factor\\". The \\"symmetry factor\\" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions. The \\"forbidden thoughts factor\\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \\"cleaning factor\\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The \\"hoarding factor\\" only involved hoarding-related obsessions and compulsions and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings. While OCD has been considered a homogeneous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders. Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response. Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions. On the other hand, subtype-dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment. = Obsessions = People with OCD may face intrusive thoughts, such as thoughts about the devil (shown is a painted interpretation of Hell) Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to \\"relationship rightness\\". Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself--such as God, the devil, or disease-- will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled. Some people with OCD experience sexual obsessions that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of \\"kissing, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, incest, and rape\\" with \\"strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures\\", and can include \\"heterosexual or homosexual content\\" with persons of any age. As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about sexual orientation can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of sexual identity. Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self- criticism or self-loathing. Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms. OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases. = Compulsions = Skin-picking disorder Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting, and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive‚Äìcompulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance. Compulsions are different from tics (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking) and stereotyped movements (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually are not as complex and are not precipitated by obsessions. It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics. About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering books for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a library, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it. In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with antibacterial soap and hot water can make their skin red and raw with dermatitis. People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary. = Insight = The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs delusional thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD. = Overvalued ideas = Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as overvalued ideas. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do ERP therapy on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from psychotic disorders.O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281‚Äì284 = Cognitive performance = Though it was once believed to be associated with above-average intelligence, this does not appear to necessarily be the case. A 2013 review reported that people with OCD may sometimes have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding spatial memory, to a lesser extent with verbal memory, fluency, executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected. People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition. Specific subtypes of symptom dimensions in OCD have been associated with specific cognitive deficits. For example, the results of one meta-analysis comparing washing and checking symptoms reported that washers outperformed checkers on eight out of ten cognitive tests. The symptom dimension of contamination and cleaning may be associated with higher scores on tests of inhibition and verbal memory. = Children = Approximately 1‚Äì2% of children are affected by OCD. Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder symptoms tend to develop more frequently in children that are 10‚Äì14 years of age, with males displaying symptoms at an earlier age and a more severe level than females. In children, symptoms can be grouped into at least four types. = Associated conditions = People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, social anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, transformation obsession, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking), body dysmorphic disorder and trichotillomania (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide. Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts. Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by delayed sleep phase syndrome at a substantially higher rate than the general public. Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder. Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between drug addiction and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of coping with the heightened levels of anxiety), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of compulsive behavior and not just as a coping mechanism. Depression is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other anxiety disorder) may feel depressed because of an \\"out of control\\" type of feeling. Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder (OCPD), autism spectrum disorder, disorders where perseveration is a possible feature (ADHD, PTSD, bodily disorders or habit problems)Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses ‚Äì 2012 or sub-clinically. Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed \\"tic-related OCD\\" or \\"Tourettic OCD\\". OCD frequently co-occurs with both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Between 60‚Äì80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19‚Äì90% due to methodological differences. Between 9‚Äì35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1‚Äì2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes. OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders. Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for specific phobia, 18% for social anxiety disorder, 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for generalized anxiety disorder. The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.  Causes  The cause is unknown. Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing event. = Drug-induced OCD = Many different types of medication can create/induce pure OCD in patients that have never had symptoms before. A new chapter about OCD in the DSM-5 (2013) now specifically includes drug-induced OCD. Atypical antipsychotics (second generation antipsychotics), such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), have been proven to induce de-novo OCD in patients. = Genetics = There appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than non-identical twins. Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45‚Äì65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder. A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD. A mutation has been found in the human serotonin transporter gene, hSERT, in unrelated families with OCD. A systematic review found that while neither allele was associated with OCD overall, in caucasians the L allele was associated with OCD. Another meta analysis observed an increased risk in those with the homozygous S allele, but found the LS genotype to be inversely associated with OCD. A genome wide association study found OCD to be linked with SNPs near BTBD3 and two SNPs in DLGAP1 in a trio-based analysis, but no SNP reached significance when analyzed with case-control data. One meta analysis found a small but significant association between a polymorphism in SLC1A1 and OCD. The relationship between OCD and COMT has been inconsistent, with one meta analysis reporting a significant association, albeit only in men, and another meta analysis reporting no association. It has been postulated by evolutionary psychologists that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages. Examples would be moderate constant checking of hygiene, the hearth or the environment for enemies. Similarly, hoarding may have had evolutionary advantages. In this view OCD may be the extreme statistical \\"tail\\" of such behaviors, possibly due to a high amount of predisposing genes. = Autoimmune = A controversial hypothesis is that some cases of rapid onset of OCD in children and adolescents may be caused by a syndrome connected to Group A streptococcal infections, known as pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). A review of studies examining anti-basal ganglia antibodies in OCD found an increased risk of having anti-basal ganglia antibodies in those with OCD versus the general population.  Mechanisms  = Neuroimaging = Some parts of the brain showing abnormal activity in OCD Functional neuroimaging during symptom provocation has observed abnormal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right premotor cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, globus pallidus externus, hippocampus and right uncus. Weaker foci of abnormal activity were found in the left caudate, posterior cingulate cortex and superior parietal lobule. However, an older meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in OCD reported the only consistent functional neuroimaging findings have been increased activity in the orbital gyrus and head of the caudate nucleus, while ACC activation abnormalities were too inconsistent. A meta analysis comparing affective and non affective tasks observed differences with controls in regions implicated in salience, habit, goal-directed behavior, self-referential thinking and cognitive control. For non affective tasks, hyperactivity was observed in the insula, ACC, and head of the caudate/putamen, while hypoactivity was observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior caudate. Affective tasks were observed to relate to increased activation in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex(PCC), while decreased activation was found in the pallidum, ventral anterior thalamus and posterior caudate. The involvement of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop in OCD as well as the high rates of comorbidity between OCD and ADHD have led some to draw a link in their mechanism. Observed similarities include dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex, as well as shared deficits in executive functions. The involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in OCD is shared with bipolar disorder and may explain their high degree of comorbidity. Decreased volumes of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex related to executive function has also been observed in OCD. People with OCD evince increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, with decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, as well as decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. Increased white matter volume and decreased fractional anisotropy in anterior midline tracts has been observed in OCD, possibly indicating increased fiber crossings. = Cognitive models = Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control. The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus. The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC. One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the OFC leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli. Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts. Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection with compulsions. This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the ventral striatum when anticipating monetary reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC. Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-responsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli. Stimulation of the nucleus accumbens has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both. = Neurobiological = From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems. Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor 5-HT2A and serotonin transporter binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD. Orbitofrontal cortex overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to SSRI medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of serotonin receptors 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others. Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increase the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors. Further complicating things is the efficacy of amphetamines, decreased dopamine transporter activity observed in OCD, and low levels of D2 binding in the striatum. Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms. Abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD. Findings such as increased cerebrospinal glutamate, less consistent abnormalities observed in neuroimaging studies and the efficacy of some glutamatergic drugs such as the glutamate-inhibiting riluzole have implicated glutamate in OCD. OCD has been associated with reduced N-Acetylaspartic acid in the mPFC, which is thought to reflect neuron density or functionality, although the exact interpretation has not been established.  Diagnosis  Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize clinically significant obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the normal range of worries about conventional problems.Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000. A person may attempt to ignore or suppress such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational. Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD must perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning. It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized. OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the obsessive‚Äìcompulsive spectrum. = Differential diagnosis = OCD is often confused with the separate condition obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCD is egodystonic, meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because egodystonic disorders go against a person's self- concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is egosyntonic‚Äîmarked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their self-image, or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable. As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.Carter, K. \\"Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder.\\" PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006. By contrast, people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.  Management  A form of psychotherapy called \\"cognitive behavioral therapy\\" (CBT) and psychotropic medications are first-line treatments for OCD. Other forms of psychotherapy, such as psychodynamic and psychoanalysis may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the American Psychiatric Association (APA) noted a lack of controlled studies showing their effectiveness \\"in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD\\". The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to stigma associated with OCD. = Therapy = One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave The specific technique used in CBT is called exposure and response prevention (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears (\\"exposure\\"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession (\\"response prevention\\"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \\"contaminated\\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \\"contaminated\\" location, such as a school). That is the \\"exposure\\". The \\"ritual prevention\\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly habituates to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more \\"contaminated\\" or not checking the lock at all‚Äîagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1), 66 ‚Äì 70 BAO ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD. However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000, who criticized the quality of many studies. A 2018 review found that self-help metacognitive training improved symptoms in OCD. A 2007 Cochrane review also found that psychological interventions derived from CBT models were more effective than treatment as usual consisting of no treatment, waiting list or non-CBT interventions. It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy in combination with psychiatric medication is more effective than either option alone. = Medication = A blister pack of clomipramine under the brand name Anafranil The medications most frequently used are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Clomipramine, a medication belonging to the class of tricyclic antidepressants, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects. SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects. SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo. Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6‚Äì24 weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28‚Äì52 weeks. In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended antipsychotics for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment. For OCD there is tentative evidence for risperidone and insufficient evidence for olanzapine. Quetiapine is no better than placebo with regard to primary outcomes, but small effects were found in terms of YBOCS score. The efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine are limited by the insufficient number of studies. A 2014 review article found two studies that indicated that aripiprazole was \\"effective in the short-term\\" and found that \\"[t]here was a small effect-size for risperidone or anti-psychotics in general in the short-term\\"; however, the study authors found \\"no evidence for the effectiveness of quetiapine or olanzapine in comparison to placebo.\\" While quetiapine may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment- resistant OCD, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use. None of the atypical antipsychotics appear to be useful when used alone. Another review reported that no evidence supports the use of first generation antipsychotics in OCD. A guideline by the APA suggested that dextroamphetamine may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried. = Procedures = Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases. Surgery may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical lesion is made in an area of the brain (the cingulate cortex). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. Essentials of Abnormal Psychology. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006. Deep- brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of brain tissue. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so. In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive cognitive‚Äìbehavioral therapy with exposure and ritual/response prevention.Surgical Procedures for Obsessive‚ÄìCompulsive Disorder , by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008. Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive‚Äìbehavioral therapist has been carried out. = Children = Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents. Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children. Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children & Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press. Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as \\"probably efficacious\\", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD. After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel. Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.  Epidemiology  Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year estimated rates for obsessive-compulsive disorder per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life. Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide. It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty. Males and females are affected about equally.  Prognosis  Quality of life (QoL) is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon. In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.  History  In the 7th century AD, John Climacus records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming \\"temptations to blasphemy\\" consulting an older monk, who told him, \\"My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatsoever.\\" The Cloud of Unknowing, a Christian mystical text from the late 14th century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them, and, if that fails, \\"cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them\\", a technique now known as \\"emotional flooding\\". From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were possessed by the devil. Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the \\"evil\\" from the \\"possessed\\" person through exorcism.M. A. Jenike; Baer, L.; & W. E. Minichiello. Obsessive Compulsive Disorders: Theory and Management. Littleton, MA: PSG Publishing, 1986. The vast majority of people who thought they were possessed by the devil did not suffer from hallucinations or other \\"spectacular symptoms\\", but \\"complained of anxiety, religious fears, and evil thoughts.\\" In 1584, a woman from Kent, England named Mrs. Davie, described by a justice of the peace as \\"a good wife\\", was nearly burned at the stake after she confessed that she experienced constant, unwanted urges to murder her family. The English term obsessive-compulsive arose as a translation of German Zwangsvorstellung ('obsession') used in the first conceptions of OCD by Carl Westphal. Westphal's description went on to influence Pierre Janet, who further documented features of OCD. In the early 1910s, Sigmund Freud attributed obsessive‚Äìcompulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms. Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of \\"touching phobia\\" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an \\"external prohibition\\" against this type of touching. However, this \\"prohibition does not succeed in abolishing\\" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and \\"force it into the unconscious\\". p. 29. Freudian psychoanalysis remained the dominant treatment for OCD until the mid-1980s, even though medicinal and therapeutical treatments were known and available, because it was widely thought that these treatments would be detrimental to the effectiveness of the psychotherapy. In the mid-1980s, psychiatry made a sudden \\"about-face\\" on the subject and began treating OCD primarily through medicine and practical therapy rather than psychoanalysis. = Notable cases = John Bunyan (1628‚Äì1688), the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named). During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth. He later described his obsessions in his autobiography Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, stating, \\"These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations.\\" He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties. In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions: \\"Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties\\". British poet, essayist and lexicographer Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì1784) also suffered from OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, and repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps. He would touch every post on the street as he walked past, only step in the middles of paving stones, and repeatedly perform tasks as though they had not been done properly the first time. The American aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes is known to have had OCD. Friends of Hughes have also mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing. This was conveyed in The Aviator (2004), a film biography of Hughes.  Society and culture  ribbon represents Trichotillomania and other body focused repetitive behaviors. Concept for the ribbon was started by Jenne Schrader. Colors were voted on by the Trichotillomania Facebook community, and made official by Trichotillomania Learning Center in August 2013. =Art, entertainment and media= Movies and television shows often portray idealized representations of disorders such as OCD. These depictions may lead to increased public awareness, understanding and sympathy for such disorders. * In the film As Good as It Gets (1997), actor Jack Nicholson portrays a man \\"with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\\". \\"Throughout the film, [he] engages in ritualistic behaviors (i.e., compulsions) that disrupt his interpersonal and professional life\\", a \\"cinematic representation of psychopathology [that] accurately depicts the functional interference and distress associated with OCD\\". *The film Matchstick Men (2003), directed by Ridley Scott, portrays a con-man named Roy (Nicolas Cage) who has obsessive-compulsive disorder. The film \\"opens with Roy, at home, suffering with his numerous obsessive compulsive symptoms, which take the form of a need for order and cleanliness and a compulsion to open and close doors three times, whilst counting aloud, before he can walk through them\\". *In the USA Network American comedy-drama detective mystery television series Monk (2002‚Äì2009), the titular Adrian Monk fears both human contact and dirt. *In Turtles All the Way Down (2017), a young adult novel by author John Green, teenage main character Aza Holmes struggles with OCD. It manifests as a fear of the human microbiome. Throughout the story, she repeatedly opens a never-fully-healed callus on her finger in an effort to drain out what she believes are pathogens. The novel is based on author Green's own experiences of OCD. He explained that Turtles All the Way Down is intended to show how ‚Äúmost people with chronic mental illnesses also live long, fulfilling lives‚Äù.  Research  The naturally occurring sugar inositol has been suggested as a treatment for OCD. Œº-Opioids, such as hydrocodone and tramadol, may improve OCD symptoms. Administration of opiate treatment may be contraindicated in individuals concurrently taking CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine and paroxetine. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that affect the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate or the binding to its receptors. These include riluzole, memantine, gabapentin, N-acetylcysteine, topiramate and lamotrigine.

She grew up in a Haredi family and attended Bais Yaakov schools. She earned an M.A. in philosophy and history at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and later a Ph.D. in political philosophy. She became politically active in the early 1990s. In 1993, she established the Mifneh [\\"pivot point\\"] Institute to promote peace, tolerance, and democracy in Orthodox society. She was one of the founders of Orthodox Women for the Sanctity of Life, which opposed the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon. Greenfield is a member of the Board of Directors of B'tselem and was among the signatories of the Geneva accords. She wrote the book They Are Afraid': How the Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Became the Leading Force in Israel. She lives in Har Nof, and her five children attend Orthodox Zionist schools. In 2006, Greenfield decided to pursue a parliamentary career. She was on the Meretz list for the 17th Knesset and was ranked sixth in an internal vote by 700 of Meretz's 1,000 central committee members, after Chair Yossi Beilin, Ran Cohen, Avshalom Vilan, Zehava Gal-On, and Haim Oron. Meretz received five seats. On 4 November 2008, Greenfield replaced Beilin, who retired from politics, and became the first Haredi woman sworn into the Knesset. Prior to the 2009 elections, she again won sixth place on the Meretz list. However, she lost her seat in the February 2009 elections, as the party's representation was reduced to three seats. Greenfield opposes the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and supports a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict along the Green Line with \\"minor adjustments\\". She describes herself as a social democrat and a supporter of a strong welfare state. She does not follow any rabbis, claiming that contemporary Israeli rabbis do not advance the interests of their followers. She also accused them of not preparing their followers for the Gazan disengagement plan. She remains Orthodox, rather than choosing Reform Judaism or Conservative Judaism, because she believes in continuity, feels close to Jewish tradition and history, and is committed to observing Halacha. Greenfield considers herself an Orthodox woman with similar values to those of the United States and Europe, accepting separation of church and state, which she believes is necessary in Israel as well in order to save Judaism. She supports gay rights and gay marriage. In her book, she accuses the Haredi sector of using child benefits as a source of income. She does not use elevators on Shabbat, and has a pet dog. She has stirred controversy among the Haredim, and Haredi journalist Kobi Arieli claimed that she is not truly Haredi because she has a dog, and that \\"real Haredim\\" hate Meretz.

Such a claim may seek to cancel a government act (by far the most common type of administrative litigation), declare an act legally invalid, declare an inaction illegal, impose a duty or provide an injunction against future acts. * , which requires the resolution of a public law issue in the context of a private dispute. Most such cases are treated as ordinary civil litigation, so few cases are heard under the ex parte system.

The most common types are election-related litigation and citizen suits under the Local Autonomy Law. * , litigation between administrative entities or organs. Administrative litigation versus other means of appeal The Administrative Appeal Act may also be used to appeal a wrongful government act. Administrative appeals are made directly to the government body whose act is being appealed. Ordinarily the petitioner may choose either venue to contest a government act.

Education and early life Gregory was born Fritz Gugenheim in London, but changed his name as a result of the anti-German sentiment during the First World War, which culminated in the destruction of his laboratory notebooks by colleagues at the Cheshunt Experimental Station. He first studied at Dame Alice Owen's School, where he was persuaded by the school science master, G. A. Armitage that he should go into science, despite his artistic skills. He left the school at the top of his class with a number of prizes and passed the intermediate exam for the University of London in mathematics, physics, chemistry and mechanics in 1912, gaining acceptance into Imperial College London. Gregory intention when applying had been to study chemistry, but after attending a lecture by John Bretland Farmer he switched to botany, gaining his ARCS in 1914 and BSc in 1915, both with first class honours, and also won the Forbes prize. Having been exempted from service in World War I he gained his DIC in 1917, and followed this up with an MSc in 1920 and the DSc in 1921. By this point he had joined the Research Institute in Plant Physiology at the university, and began investigating the physiology of greenhouse crops at the Cheshunt Experimental Station. While there he noticed differences in how a plant grew at different times in the year but under a constant temperature, and attempted to express this in mathematical terms using very speculative evidence; the resulting arguments made him prominent within the field. Career After the completion of these studie, Gregory began working on the effects of electric current on plant growth under Vernon Blackman but remained interested in the study of growth, and began experimenting with that in 1919 at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, something he continued until 1937. By 1928 his work was visible and important enough that he was asked to advise the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation on their irrigation techniques in Sudan, setting up statistical studies so helpful that his final report was widely used in the development of agronomy within the country. When Blackman was appointed head of the biological laboratories at Imperial College Gregory was made assistant professor of plant physiology and assistant director of the research institute, resulting in him (for the first time in his career) having to give lectures at the university. Under Gregory the research institute became known for its work investigating vernalization, photoperiodism, transpiration and carbohydrate metabolism, with Gregory in high demand as an advisor both at the university and its various research institutes. After Blackman's retirement in 1937 Gregory was made head of the laboratories, although work at the university was heavily disrupted by World War II. In 1947 Gregory was appointed head of the research institute as well, and focused on repairing damage from the war. This period saw increased appreciation of Gregory as a scientist; he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1940, serving on its council from 1949 to 1951 and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1957 'In recognition of his distinguished studies in plant physiology.' Around the same time he was also elected a foreign member of the Indian Society of Plant Physiologists and the United States National Academy of Sciences. He retired in December 1958, and died in Hampstead General Hospital, London on 27 November 1961.

It was the first submarine of the Romanian Navy, built in Italy under Romanian supervision.Robert Gardiner, Warship 1992, p. 151 Construction and specifications Delfinul was ordered in 1927 from the Italian naval base and shipyard at Fiume (today Rijeka, Croatia). It was completed in 1931, but was accepted by Romania as the country's first submarine only in 1936, after the many corrections required by the Romanians were completed.Paul E.

Its home base was the Constan»õa Naval Base, from where the submarine completed nine war time patrols. When Romania entered the war (22 June 1941), the navy had only one submarine, but that presence meant that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet had to secure an anti-submarine service for its convoys and near its naval bases. As a fleet in being, Delfinul had only to exist rather than taking part in the battles. It was kept under shelter in Constan»õa and rarely got out to do a reconnaissance mission. That changed when two modern submarines were built at the Gala»õi shipyard in Eastern Romania ‚Äì (\\"Shark\\") and (\\"Porpoise\\"). =Patrol 1= CƒÉpitan (USN rank - lieutenant) Constantin CostƒÉchescu commanded Delfinul on its first war patrol which lasted 22‚Äì27 June 1941. A simple reconnaissance mission from shore. On 26 June at 00:30, CostƒÉchescu reported back to Constan»õa that a large Soviet war group was approaching Constan»õa. Because they lost their element of surprise, the Soviets lost a destroyer (Moskva) and the lead ship Kharkov and the cruiser Voroshilov were damaged in the following battle. =Patrol 2= The next patrol took place from 10‚Äì20 July, under the command of CƒÉpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Corneliu Lungu. Delfinul patrolled the south of the Crimean peninsula and made a reconnaissance mission to Novorossiysk, trying to evaluate the anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities of the enemy naval base. On 13 July it was southwest of Cape Idokopas, and on 15 July it reached the south of Feodosiya. In that area, they spotted an enemy ship, but it vanished shortly after. During the night it was detected by an enemy patrol craft, but Delfinul quickly submerged and avoided being attacked. On 16 July, the gyro compass broke down and the submarine began its journey for home. from Cape Sabla, Delfinul spotted a small Russian submarine on the surface, probably from the Malyutka class. Delfinul tried to attack it with the deck gun, but the rough seas and two unidentified hydroplanes led the commanding officer to decide to dive the submarine and break contact. On 30 July, Delfinul was scheduled to start another patrol at 16:00 (4:00 pm), but an engine malfunction forced the submarine to return to port at 19:00 (7:00 pm). =Patrol 3= On the third patrol (12‚Äì20 August 1941), Delfinul returned under the command of CƒÉpitan CostƒÉchescu. Its mission, to attack the convoys leaving or arriving at Odessa. They only had two poor chances to attack anything, on the night of 13‚Äì14 August and on 19 August, but they could not maintain contact. The sector was abundant in enemy patrol craft and hydroplanes. The submarine also made a reconnaissance mission of the coast of Crimea. On 20 August, on the way home (four miles off Constan≈£a), she fought the only submarine vs submarine engagement of the Black Sea naval war. At 12:08 pm, the Soviet M-class submarine M-33 launched a torpedo at her, which missed. Delfinul swiftly counterattacked with her twin 13 mm machine gun, causing the Soviet submarine to submerge and retreat.Antony Preston, Warship 2001-2002, Conway Maritime Press, 2001. p. 73Asocia»õia Na»õionalƒÉ a Veteranilor de RƒÉzboi, Veteranii pe drumul omoarei »ôi jertfei (1941-1945): de la Nistru la Marea de Azov, Volume 3, Vasile C√¢rlova Publishing, 1997, p. 517 =Patrol 4= The 4th patrol (3‚Äì19 September), took Delfinul deeper in enemy-controlled waters. This time, the chance to attack surface vessels really presented itself. After spotting two convoys which Delfinul couldn't follow, on the 9 September, at 9:35, it was detected on the surface by a cruiser, which CƒÉpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Corneliu Lungu identified as the . The submarine carefully maneuvered because of the underwater rocks. In the following days, the submarine had some chances of attack but the rough seas made it impossible. On 10 September, the submarine got into firing range of a two-ship convoy west from Cape Otrishenok, but the charge of an escort vessel forced CƒÉpitan Lungu to submerge and lose contact. Another chance presented itself on 16 September at 5:05 west of Novorosiisk, in the form of a Russian tanker and its escort. But the escort spotted the periscope. When they raised the periscope again, the CO saw that the escort called for help so he submerged and left the area, following the directive to take no chances with the escorts. On 17 September it took a course for Constan»õa, and, on the way back, it was spotted by a number of Russian hydroplanes and even depth charged by a patrol craft. =Patrol 5= The fifth patrol took place between 2 and 7 November 1941 and it is the patrol when the only attack of Delfinul took place. Its mission, the attack of the convoys destined for Sevastopol. Its CO was Constantin CostƒÉchescu. Near Constan≈£a they spotted an enemy submarine, but because of the darkness, they lost it. On the morning of 5 November, the submarine reached the neighboring waters of Yalta. At 6:36 they spotted a patrol vessel and kept watch. Around 8:05, sub-lieutenant Constantin Stegaru spotted a large transport vessel on a course of 290, steaming for Yalta. At 8:15, the ship turned to the left, closing on the submarine. The CO decided to wait for the ship to pass behind him and shot from an aft tube. At 8:43, Delfinul launched a torpedo from tube 6, from away. The torpedo explosion, followed by a bigger one could be heard, moments after the launch. It is possible that the ship was not escorted because the first contact with a submarine hunter ship came in an hour after the attack. The depth charging lasted from 10:30 until 18:30 (6:30 pm). There were 23 passes and 80 to 90 explosions from depth charges. During the attack, CƒÉpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Constantin CostƒÉchescu dove the submarine deeper and deeper, and when the enemy was listening, he would stop the submarine's machinery. Afterwards, they went near the Turkish coast, but a dreadful storm made the trip home a difficult venture. CƒÉpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Constantin CostƒÉchescu was later awarded the Order of Michael the Brave 3rd Class for the attack. The alleged sunken Soviet ship was claimed to be the 1,975-ton cargo Uralets (also known as Uralles).Antony Preston, Warship 2001-2002, Conway Maritime Press, 2001. p. 76Richard Compton-Hall, Submarines at War 1939-1945, Periscope Publishing, 2004, p. 127. However according to modern evaluations, the ship was sunk by the Luftwaffe on 30 October, during an air raid on Yevpatoria, and the torpedo attack missed the minelayer Ostrovsky Morozov M. E, The air battle for Sevastopol, 1941-1942, Eksmo Publishing, 2007, p. 147 The latter claim, however, is highly unlikely, as the crew of Delfinul reported to have heard an explosion seconds after launching the torpedo. The struck ship was most likely the Soviet tanker Kreml, which was damaged.Donald A Bertke, Gordon Smith, Don Kindell, World War II Sea War, Volume 4: Germany Sends Russia to the Allies, p. 389Florian Bichir, Corsarii uita»õi ai ad√¢ncurilor, p. 101 (in Romanian)[https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/2835.html Ships hit by U-boats: Kreml‚Äô, Soviet Motor tanker] =Patrol 6= The mission of the sixth patrol was to cut the Russian communication routes between Batumi and Istanbul. Delfinul left port on the 30 November, but because of bad weather, it was forced to return to base on the 3 December 1941. =Patrol 7= The seventh patrol (6‚Äì13 December) took Delfinul back to the Batumi-Istanbul line. It didn't detect any enemy convoys. On its way back, it detected two Russian submarines near Constan»õa. =Patrol 8= The first patrol of 1942 (18‚Äì30 May) found Delfinul under the command of Locotenent Comandor (USN rank - Lieutenant Commander) Constantin Lungu, who had been promoted. It patrolled the north side of the Turkish coast without detecting anything. It was attacked by two Russian planes on the 27 May, without sustaining any damage. =Patrol 9= The last patrol of Delfinul (25 June ‚Äì 3 July 1942) was carried out near Yalta. On the 27 June they arrived in the operation theatre but were forced to stay submerged because of enemy aircraft. Between 4:26 and 15:30 (3:30 pm) Delfinul was the target of 240 anti submarine bombs. A fuel tank cracked. After 16:00 (4:00 pm) enemy patrol craft appeared, and CƒÉpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) CostƒÉchescu ordered a full stop on the electric motors. The next day, the submarine was spotted on the surface by an enemy aircraft at 16:12 (4:12 pm). Some bullets damaged its conning tower. On 1 July, the last day of the Sevastopol evacuation, the Russian flotilla was very active in the Crimean zone, so Delfinul was spotted and hunted for 13 hours. Between 7:35 and 10:30 there were counted 107 depth charges. Around 13:00 (1:00 pm) there was an attack with 20 bombs, and at 15:40 (3:40 pm) another 24. In the evening, between 19:30 (7:30 pm) and 20:00 (8:00 pm), 82 depth charges and bombs exploded near the submarine and 35 away from it. In total 268 explosions, mainly air dropped anti submarine bombs and few depth charges. After the patrol ended, the submarine was sent for a total refit at the Gala»õi shipyard, arriving there on 24 November.Robert Gardiner, Warship 1992, p. 150 The end After the 23 August 1944 coup, the submarine was confiscated by Soviet forces and commissioned as TS-3 on 20 October 1944. After a short career in the Soviet Navy, it was decommissioned on 12 October 1945.

Fontenoy, Submarines: An Illustrated History of Their Impact, p. 230 The legacy The name Delfinul was passed to the only Romanian Navy submarine still in service today. It was bought from the Russians in the 1980s and is an improved diesel-electric attack . The new is still waiting for its new battery packs since the early 1990s.

It is a frazione of Bagnoregio, in the Province of Viterbo. Overview Castel Cellesi was originally an enclosed square structure composed of small farm houses which surrounded a larger open space accessible through two main gates known as the ‚ÄúUpper Gate‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLower Gate.‚Äù The Church and the Palace of Count Girolamo Cellesi were in the center of the village. Gradually more farmers joined the first settlers and the village spread out of its lower gate. Another large square was then added on, rectangular in shape, encircled by small houses which all looked alike in color, shape and size. Count Cellesi had decreed that no building could be erected higher than the second floor of his own palace. In the older of the two squares, one finds the Parish Church dedicated to Saint Girolamo. Its construction was commissioned by Count Girolamo Cellesi in 1664 and his monumental tomb is on the right hand wall entering the church. The building was restored and decorated with large frescoes in the late 19th century. The interior of the church has only one nave, covered with a wood beam roof and three steps lead to the altar where the statue of St. Girolamo is located. A large wooden statue of the Virgin Mary in the Assumption into Heaven, highly venerated in Castelcellesi, is located on the left of the altar. The most important monument of the village is the small church named after the Holy Sepulchre, founded by Count Girolamo Cellesi around 1674. It originates as a very modest chapel dedicated to the Madonna del Soccorso. Later, in 1703, another Count Cellesi, Francesco, had requested some Holy Relics from the Great Custodian of the Holy Land and started reconstruction of the chapel, enlarging it to twice its original size. During the renovation, a large rock slab was found in the center of the new church site. Since it was not possible to remove it, they decided to erect a Shrine around it shaped like the Holy Sepulchre in the Holy Land. The Holy Relics arrived at Castel Cellesi at the end of February 1704 and were placed in the Shrine. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was officially consecrated by the Bishop on March 7, 1704. A Brotherhood was founded to take care of the Holy Sepulchre and of the Church. For almost two centuries, until the end of the 19th century, the Holy Sepulchre of Castelcellesi was the destination of countless pilgrims coming from all over the Tiber valley. Even today it is one of the most important sites on the itinerary ‚ÄúShrines of the Holy Sepulchre in Europe.‚Äù Category:Frazioni of the Province of Viterbo Category:Former municipalities of Lazio ","title":"Castel Cellesi"},{"id":"20082415","text":"Atlanta High School may refer to: *Atlanta High School (Louisiana), Atlanta, Louisiana *Atlanta High School (Missouri), Atlanta, Missouri *Atlanta High School (Texas), Atlanta, Texas ","title":"Atlanta High School"},{"id":"20082418","text":"Kandahar is a city in Afghanistan.

The term is no longer used. vRPM answers the question: \\"How fast would you have to spin a virtual HDD to achieve the performance of an SSD in a client PC?\\" It uses a language that users understand, RPM (revolutions per minute), that is a de facto industry standard to measure the performance of the HDD inside PCs.  Comparing SSD vs. HDD input/output operation  The performance of a storage device can be quantified as the number of Input/Output operations Per Second (IOPS) it achieves. HDD IOPS is proportional to RPM. When a system requests to read/write data randomly from/to a HDD, seek time and rotational latency are two HDD activities that significantly reduce HDD IOPS. Seek time is the time it takes to move the HDD head to the correct cylinder to begin to receive data. Rotational latency is the time it takes to rotate the HDD platter beneath the head so that the data can be read/written. Rotational latency varies based on the RPM of the HDD. NAND flash is used as the non- volatile memory inside SSDs. It has faster random read than random write performance, since its write performance is delayed by the need to perform garbage collection to free space for writing. However, since NAND flash has no moving parts, the SSD achieves much higher IOPS than a HDD. For the client PC usage model with approximately a 50:50 read/write ratio, a PC IOPS number can be calculated as follows: :PC IOPS (mean)=1/[0.5/SSD IOPS (Iwrite)] + [0.5/SSD IOPS (Iread)] Using this equation, the results for client SSD PC performance are as follows: * 2006‚Äì2007 SSD generation: 5,000 Read IOPS; 10 Write IOPS; 20 PC IOPS * 2008 SSD generation: 10,000 Read IOPS; 100 Write IOPS; 200 PC IOPS * 2009 (estimated) SSD generation: 25,000 Read IOPS; 400 Write IOPS; 785 PC IOPS  Converting SSD IOPS rates into vRPM  The vRPM performance of an SSD can be calculated as follows: :vRPM=50/[0.5/SSD IOPS (Iwrite)] + [0.5/SSD IOPS (Iread)] where: * SSD IOPS (IWrite) is the sustained (to the SSD media) 4KB random write rate, Queue Depth=4 * SSD IOPS (IRead) is the sustained (to the SSD media) 4KB random read rate, Queue Depth=4 * 50 is the product factor in the calculation Using this calculation, SSD vRPM rates can be shown to be significantly better than HDD RPM rates, particularly in later generation SSDs: * 2006‚Äì2007 SSD generation: 5,000 Read IOPS; 10 Write IOPS; 20 PC IOPS; 1,000 vRPM * 2008 SSD generation: 10,000 Read IOPS; 100 Write IOPS; 200 PC IOPS; 10,000 vRPM * 2009 (estimated) SSD generation: 25,000 Read IOPS; 400 Write IOPS; 785 PC IOPS; 40,000 vRPM * 2011 SSD generation: 35,000 Read IOPS; 14,000 Write IOPS; 24,500 PC IOPS; 1,225,000 vRPM  vRPM adoption in industry  Despite its early objectives, vRPM has not become broadly supported in the industry and no longer appears on SanDisk's SSD website.

In the most significant isomer, fluoren-9-ol or 9-hydroxyfluorene, the hydroxy group is located on the bridging carbon between the two benzene rings. Hydroxyfluorene can be converted to fluorenone by oxidation. It is a white-cream colored solid at room temperature. Toxicity Fluorenol is toxic to aquatic organisms including algae, bacteria, and crustaceans. Fluorenol was patented as an insecticide in 1939,US patent 2197249: Insecticide and is an algaecide against the green algae Dunaliella bioculata.MSDS Its toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans are unknown. Eugeroic A study published by Cephalon describing research to develop a successor to the eugeroic modafinil reported that the corresponding fluorenol derivative was 39% more effective than modafinil at keeping mice awake over a 4-hour period. However, after further investigation it was determined that the eugeroic activity of the fluorenol analog was likely due to an active metabolite, which they identify as fluorenol itself. Fluorenol is a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor with an IC50 of 9 ŒºM, notably 59% weaker than modafinil (IC50 = 3.70 ŒºM), potentially making it even less liable for addiction.

The park covers 17,455 ha and follows the Mure≈ü River westward from the city of Arad to the Hungarian border. The park is a typical ecosystem for wetlands, with running waters, lakes, swamps and floodplains, with forests, an important place for the passage and nesting of bird species and is subjected to periodical floods (a flood every three years). The forests (7,500 ha) in the park are made up primarily of common oak, narrow-leafed ash, black and white poplar, white willow, and American black walnut. This area is an important place for nesting and passage for nearly 200 species of birds, most of which are strictly protected internationally. The main purpose of the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Parkhttp://www.luncamuresului.ro/ is to protect and preserve the habitats and landscape diversity from the region. The park has been designated a RAMSAR site, and under Natura 2000, the park was designated a SPA (Special Protection Area) for birds, and a SAC (Special Area of Conservation) for other species and habitats. Within the park, there are 4 strictly protected natural reserves: The Cenad Forest (310.5 ha), Big Isle of Cenad (2.1 ha), Igri»ô Islands (7 ha), and Prundul Mare (717.9 ha). The park is a sister park with the K√∂r√∂s-Maros National Park, in Hungary. The two parks border each other and have created a cross-border protected area with a future common management plan.  Biology  The Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park has an ecosystem that is typical for wetlands, with running and still waters, large forests and periodic floods (every several years). =Flora= The vegetation in the park grows in a continental climate, with warm summers and moderate winters. The annual average temperature is 10.5 degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall is 550 mm. Many plants within the park need the periodic flooding in order to germinate and to consume the nutrients freshly dissolved in the water. A large number of plants in the park are on ‚Äúthe red list of superior plants in Romania‚Äù, meaning they are vulnerable or rare species. Some of these include: yarrow (Achillea thracica), Water soldier (Stratiotes aloides), common corncockle (Agrostemma githago), Cirsium brachycephalum, prostrate false pimpernel (Lindernia procumbens), brittle waternymph (Najas minor), hog's fennel (Peucedanum officinale), lesser Butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia), Scottish dock (Rumex aquaticus), French vetch (Vicia narbonensis L. ssp. serratifolia). Besides this, there are also three species which are strictly protected according to the Bern Convention: European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia), floating watermoss (Salvinia natans), water caltrop (Trapa natans). Stands of oak (Quercus robur) and ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) are predominant in the park, together with the coppices of black and white poplar (Populus nigra and Populus alba) and white willow (Salix alba). These species are mostly found in the small forest in the Cenad area and in the 6,000 ha forest along the Mure»ô River between Arad and the village of Semlac (which includes the Ceala Forest). =Fauna= The fauna in the park encompasses a multitude of species, from large mammals to species living on the river bottom. There are large populations of mammal species living within the park. Among these are: European hamster (Cricetus cricetus), European polecat (Mustela putorius), brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), otter (Lutra lutra), European wildcat (Felis silvestris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), red deer (Cervus elaphus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). In 1988, the area which is now the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park was designated as an ‚ÄúImportant Bird Area‚Äù because of the existence of numerous bird species. Nearly all the birds living in The Mures Floodplain Natural Park are included in the annexes of the Bern Convention and the EU's Habitats Directive. Among them is the lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), whose numbers within the park are low, but which was chosen as symbol of the natural park. Approximately 200 species of birds live or pass through the park every year. Among these are: great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus), Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), water rail (Rallus aquaticus), European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). There is also a very large number of sand martins (Riparia riparia). Nearly half of the entire population of sand martins on the Mure»ô River can be found within the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park. All six of the species of reptiles and nine species of amphibians identified within the park are mentioned in the annexes of the Bern Convention and the EU's Habitats Directive. Their inclusion in these lists is due to the regress of these species, which are considered barometers for the state of an ecosystem's health. Among these are: European pond terrapin (Emys orbicularis), dice snake (Natrix tessellata), European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), and the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). For the fish species in the park, the periodic flooding of the Mure»ô River is a blessing; this process provides new spawning grounds, as well as generating new food and protection. The ichthyofauna in the park has a rich diversity and contains more fish species than any other section of the Mure»ô River. It is only in this section of the Mure»ô River that some species exist: white-eye bream (Abramis sapa), zarte (Vimba vimba), crucian carp (Carassius carassius), brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), striped ruffe (Gymnocephalus schraetser), zingel (Zingel zingel). Recreation/tourism Because of the proximity of the park to so many municipalities, the area that is now the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park has been used for recreation for centuries. Throughout time, local citizens have depended on this area for both recreation and to sustain their lives. The creation of the park in 2005, insures this will continue in the future, but with oversight and regulations. The most visited areas of the park are the Ceala Forest (due to its proximity to the city of Arad) and the Bezdin area (widely known as the most natural section of the park). =The Ceala Forest Visitor's Center= Between 2001-2005, the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park implemented, at what was then the largest PHARE grant in Romania (co-financed for 2.6 million Euros). Among other infrastructure projects, this grant built the park's current visitor's center. In May 2007, the Ceala Forest Visitor's Center, just outside the city of Arad, had its grand opening. The building houses a 34-bed hotel, a conference room that seats up to 70 people, a kitchen and dining area, a laboratory, and the park's administrative offices. =Eco- tourism= The park's eco-tourism program has two components: a guided/unguided canoe trip on the Mures River from the city of Arad to the town of Pecica; and bicycle rentals to be used on the park's bicycle trail network. Both are extremely popular during the spring and summer months. =Cultural= There are three monasteries within the park boundaries. All three monasteries are owned and operated by their respective churches, but due to their proximity to the Mure»ô River and its important ecosystem, these lands fall under the supervision and protection of the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park. On the northern side of the river is the Saint Paraschiva Monastery, which can be found just outside the village of Bodrogu Vechi. This is the newest monastery in the park and is accessed from the town of Pecica. On the southern side of the river are other two monasteries. The Hodo»ô-Bodrog Monastery, dating from 1177, is one of the oldest monastic institutions in the Romanian Orthodox Church. The monastery is accessible from the village of Bodrogu Nou and is 17 km from the city of Arad. The monastery is active and has many monks living and working there. The Bezdin Monastery, dating from 1539, is one of the few Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Romania which is still preserved. In comparison to the Hodo»ô-Bodrog Monastery, Bezdin is very isolated and is situated in what is considered the most natural part of the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park. The monastery is accessible from the commune of Munar and is 31 km from the city of Arad. =Bird watching and wildlife viewing= Because of the rich bird life within the park, the park administration constructed two structures in the Bezdin area. In 2004, the park erected a wildlife viewing tower in an area of the forest that is known to have wildlife viewing potential. In 2005, the park erected a bird watching tower near the Bezdin marsh. Both of these towers are accessible from the Bezdin Monastery and the commune of Munar. =Hunting and fishing= Hunting is allowed within the park during certain seasons and in specific areas. Fishing is also allowed, but only with a fishing license. Environmental education Because of the close proximity to a large city and the potentially large impact this causes the park, the park's environmental education program grew rapidly in the first three years in existence: 100 students (2006), 900 students (2007), and over 2,000 students (2008). The park administration was trained by Outward Bound Romania on experiential education strategies in the summer of 2007. The park has the Romanian park system's first low ropes course and has received notoriety in Romanian national news and within the park system for its education efforts.

Early life Dyar grew up in Concord, Massachusetts. As a young man he initially made a living as an apprentice watchmaker, working for the Concord clockmaker Lemuel Curtis from 1818 to 1825. For many years he lived in Paris where he made a good living as a chemist. In 1858 he returned to America and settled in New York City. He married May 9, 1865. Notability Alfred Munroe in Concord and the Telegraph records that Dyar and his brother Joseph were interested in the newly developed technology of electricity.Swayne, pp. 241-43. They came up with the idea of transmitting a message over electrical wire. Dyar experimented and finally concluded that he had discovered how a message could be transmitted over a single wire.Lane, p. 31: Harrison Gray Dyar, is the name of the American who first conceived the idea of sending messages over a wire by means of electric fluid. In 1826 he and his brother laid a wire line along the \\"Causeway\\", later called Lowell Road and the Red Bridge Road, that proved the technique viable.Lane, p. 32 According to Colonel Whiting of Concord, the telegraph wire was strung from the trees along the Red Bridge Road over the Concord River at Hunt's Bridge and went all the way to Curtis's residence. Dyar used apothecary vial jars as glass insulators for the bare iron wire. Dyar erected the first telegraph line and dispatched over it the first telegraph message ever sent in AmericaSwayne, p. 241: \\"Harrison Gray Dyar of Concord erected the first real line and despatched the first message over it by electricity ever sent by such means in America. This may seem strange to most of our readers,\\" says Alfred Munroe in Concord and the Telegraph, \\"as the credit of this great discovery has been generally conceded to Prof. Morse, but the latter deserves credit only for combining and applying the discovery of others.\\" -- as determined by Levi Woodbury of the Supreme Court of the United States.Crew, p. 465: \\"On this point, too, it may be well to state that, according to the decision of Levi Woodbury, when a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, messages were sent by means of electricity so long ago as in 1827, the inventor of the telegraph being Harrison Gray Dyar.\\" Dyar had used over half a mile of bare electrical wire to transmit the message. He employed mechanical and electrical means that Samuel Morse used many years later for the telegraph system he patented in 1847. The author Munroe explains that Dyar made his telegraph line at least eighteen years before the actual materialization of the first practical Morse telegraph line that was made between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland.Swayne, p. 241: \\"Among the earliest of 'those others' was a young man once a resident of this town. At least eighteen years before the actual materialization of the first Morse telegraph line, a message had been transmitted over half a mile of wire in Concord by means that in many respects are identical with those employed by Morse.\\" According to Munroe it was Dyar, not Morse, who erected the first real telegraph line at the race track in Long Island in 1826 Telegraphic History - Open Origins of Secret Wire and dispatched the first message ever sent.Lane, pp. 33-34. This was years prior to the joint patent of electric telegraphy by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone taken out in 1837 in England. Alfred Munroe writes in his book Concord and the Telegraph, \\"This may seem strange to most of our readers. The credit of this great discovery has been generally conceded to Professor Morse, but the latter deserves credit only for combining and applying the discoveries of others.\\" Dyar had erected his telegraph line some six years before Morse even began his investigation on telegraphy and some ten years before he began to talk about the subject. Because of threats with prosecution for \\"Conspiracy to send Secret Communications in advance of the Mail\\" Dyar abandoned his work. =Dyar's telegraph technology= Dyar recorded the sparks generated by the electrical current of his telegraph on a ribbon of moistened litmus paperDepew, p. 126. on a spool that revolved mechanically by a clockwork apparatus. The nitric acid that was formed on the litmus paper by the action of the electricity left appropriate legible small red marks for designated letters. Dyar's method was of frictional electrolytic nature where Morse's was an electromagnetic usage. Dyar's early experiments using this method worked quite well. In fact his experiments proved his theory would work and impressed several investors. He was able to get an advanced loan in New York to run a line at the Long Island race course in 1827. Dyar then proposed to string a wire across New Jersey from New York to Philadelphia. However, the New Jersey legislature was skeptical on the issue because of security reasons. They even condemned Dyar as being dangerous because they thought he was some kind of a \\"wizard\\". They refused permission for this experiment of Dyar's because of fear of sending secret communications in advance of the mail. There is an argument amongst historians that Morse got several of Dyar's plans for the telegraph from him. Morse married the sister of one of Dyar's associates named Charles Walker. Walker had worked with Dyar on the telegraph and had retained many of Dyar's sketches. Historians speculate that either Charles Walker or his sister (Lucretia Pickering Walker) might well have shown those sketches to Morse. One idea supposedly \\"borrowed\\" was that Dyar used batteries and had the idea of sending electric impulses along a single wire. Dyar also had the idea of spacing the sparks in such a way as to form an alphabetic code and developed out this code years before Morse developed his Morse code. Later life Sometime after 1868, Dyer purchased the \\"Lindon Hill\\" estate in Rhinebeck, NY. Originally part of the Artsen-Kip Patent, In 1835, John C. Tillotson, grandson of Judge Robert R. and Margaret Beekman Livingston of Clermont, sold \\"Lindon Hill\\" to Federal Vanderburgh, who built a house on the bluff overlooking the river, and resided there until his death in 1868.Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A.

He was the independent member of the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales parliament for the seat of South Coast from 1973 to 1995. Notably, the allegations about police corruption Hatton raised in Parliament resulted in the Wood Royal Commission. He is currently a social activist in his local community. Early life and background John Hatton was born in Hammondville, New South Wales, the son of Harry and Florence Hatton. He was educated at Hammondville Public School, Hurlstone Agricultural High School and Armidale Teachers' College. Hatton was the President of the NSW Shire of Shoalhaven before his entry into state politics. Hatton was the Foundation President and President for 15 years of the Shoalhaven Combined Progress Associations. State parliamentary career Hatton was the member for the New South Wales lower house seat of South Coast between 1973 and 1995. A measure of Hatton's local popularity occurred in the 1976 state election where he polled in excess of 77% of the first preference formal votes.NSW State Electoral Results for South Coast. First Preference Votes 1976 p77. Shortly after becoming elected, Hatton donated a parliamentary pay rise to charity because it had not been granted by an independent body. John Hatton was elected as an independent for this seat for 22 years through the Askin, Lewis, Willis, Wran, Unsworth, Greiner and Fahey governments to 1995. He used parliamentary privilege to expose organised crime in the Griffith mafia, police corruption and malfeasance within government departments and agencies. In 1994, by 46 votes to 45, he forced the minority Fahey Government to establish the Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption. This ground-breaking royal commission overcame objections from the Independent Commission Against Corruption, led to widespread reform of the NSW Police Force and the establishment of the Police Integrity Commission. Later life Hatton continues to advocate for his local community. In 2009 he called for a Royal Commission into property and planning corruption in NSW. Return to politics In September 2010, Hatton announced his intention to stand with a team of 21 independents for the New South Wales Legislative Council at the state election on 26 March 2011. His running mate was small business owner and Community Independent Ian Scandrett who was second on the ticket. Scandrett has since been elected twice to Wingecarribee Shire Council. The grouping of candidates were known as the John Hatton Independents Team. Hatton and his team were unsuccessful at the 2011 election.

He is the head coach of the Philippines sevens team. He represented New Zealand at both codes, and later also played for Croatia in two rugby union World Cup qualifying matches. Rugby union Born in Mangakino, New Zealand, Botica played rugby union for club side North Shore, New Zealand provincial side North Harbour, as well as Llanelli in Wales, and spent a period in France. Botica played 7 test matches between 1986-89 including two test matches in France. Botica was a member of the All Blacks World Cup winning squad of 1987 and toured with the All Blacks to Britain in 1989 and played in several of the mid-week matches. Botica appeared for the New Zealand MƒÅori (1985-1989), New Zealand Emerging Players (1985), North Island in the 1986 inter-island match and for the Anzac XV that played the British Lions in Australia in 1989. He even appeared in the Super 12, once for the Chiefs in 1998. He played for New Zealand sevens in eight international tournaments between 1985 and 1988, and was part of the first New Zealand team to win a Hong Kong Sevens title in 1986. In the early part of his rugby union career he was a rival to Grant Fox for the All Blacks number 10 jersey. Botica was regarded as more a running player whereas Fox was considered a superior kicker and it was Fox who eventually won the selectors' favour, forcing Botica to the bench and restricting the number of rugby union tests he played. Ironically, after switching codes Botica became known as one of the most dependable goal-kickers in rugby league. Rugby league =Club career= Botica joined Wigan in British rugby league in 1990. While at Wigan he became a prolific points scorer and the fastest man in the history of British league to reach 1,000 points. In 1991 he played for the New Zealand MƒÅori side in his first match of rugby league in New Zealand.Lion Red Rugby League Annual 1991 New Zealand Rugby League, 1991. p.116 During the 1991‚Äì92 season, he played for defending champions Wigan on the wing in their 21‚Äì4 victory against the visiting Australian champions Penrith in the 1991 World Club Challenge played at Anfield in Liverpool. During the 1992-93 season, Botica played at for Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge against the 1992 Winfield Cup premiers, the Brisbane Broncos. Brisbane became the first Australian side to win the World Club Challenge in England when they defeated Wigan 22‚Äì8 at Wigan's Central Park. Botica played , and kicked every point in Wigan's 5‚Äì4 victory over St. Helens in the 1992 Lancashire Cup Final. He scored 3 conversions in Wigan's 15‚Äì8 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1992‚Äì93 Regal Trophy Final, and scored a conversion in the 2‚Äì33 defeat by Castleford in the 1993‚Äì94 Regal Trophy Final and scored a try and 8 conversions in the 40‚Äì10 victory over Warrington in the 1994‚Äì95 Regal Trophy Final. Frano Botica holds the records for the most conversions (8) and points (16) in a Regal Trophy (or precursors) Final. Botica played in the 1994 World Club Challenge against the Broncos again, this time at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane. Wigan reversed the 1992 result with a 20‚Äì14 win in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 fans, including a number of Wigan supporters who had travelled to Australia to watch the game. Known as a very accurate goal kicker, Botica kicked four goals from four attempts on the night. Botica set a new record for most goals in a season for Wigan when he kicked 186 during the 1994‚Äì95 Rugby Football League season.\\"RECORDS\\" at wiganwarriors.com He returned to New Zealand to play for the Auckland Warriors during their inaugural year in 1995, before returning to England to play for the Castleford Tigers in 1996.Will our home-grown talent win the battle with foreign imports?

He made his test d√©but at against France at Carlaw Park in Auckland on 13 June 1991, kicking eight goals as the Kiwis thrashed the visitors 60‚Äì6. He then backed that up with a 6-goal performance in the second test in Christchurch. His selection had seen him flown in from England for the series after a dispute between the New Zealand Rugby League and Manly- Warringah over compensation saw in-form test incumbent Matthew Ridge become unavailable. This dispute, and his own solid form, saw Botica keep his spot for the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series against Australia in Melbourne where he kicked four goals and helped the Kiwis to a shock 24‚Äì8 win over the Kangaroos. Botica played fullback for the Kiwis in all three tests of the series, eventually won 2‚Äì1 by Australia who easily won the second test 44‚Äì0 at the Sydney Football Stadium before wrapping up the series with a 40‚Äì12 win at Lang Park in Brisbane. The goal kicking Kiwi fullback won praise from Australian coach Bob Fulton who proclaimed that he could play as well as any fullback in the Winfield Cup (NSWRL Premiership). Botica kicked six goals from eight attempts (75%) during the test series. Botica's last two tests came during the Kiwis' 1993 Tour of Great Britain and France. He played on the wing during the last two tests of the series against the Great Britain Lions at his home ground of Central Park in Wigan and at Headingley in Leeds, though the Lions, who had won the first test at Wembley Stadium 17‚Äì0, went on to win the series 3‚Äì0. He was not selected for the test against France at the end of the tour and would never again play a test for the Kiwis. Despite eventually becoming a five-eighth in rugby league, Botica spent much of his early time in the 13-aside code, including five of his seven tests for New Zealand, at fullback or on the wing. Return to union When rugby union became openly professional, Botica returned to the 15-a-side code to play for Llanelli in Wales and then in France. In 1997 and 1998 he played for Croatia in two World Cup qualifying matches.

Before 2005, Goldie and Griz served as the KU Golden Bear mascots. However, they were both \\"graduated\\" to make way for a new mascot. The Raymond Entertainment Group of Newark, Delaware, helped KU create the new mascot. On October 1, 2005, at Kutztown's football game versus West Chester University, Kutztown University unveiled Avalanche as the school's new mascot. Avalanche is so named to honor Kutztown State College during the time of the Golden Avalanche sports teams. The Golden Bears can be seen in more places than the sports fields. Golden Bear statues are located near the basketball courts on South Campus and in North Campus near the Boehm Science Building. Along with the statues, several residential areas are named after the Golden Bear. Golden Bear Village South behind University Place and Golden Bear Village West next to Rothermel Hall are student apartments which hold the Golden Bear moniker.

It features a team up of the protagonists of Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger with previous heroes of the Super Sentai Series over its twenty-five year history. This movie would be the inspiration for the Power Rangers Wild Force episode Forever Red. Plot When the Gaorangers engage in another battle with the Org Dukes Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, the two manage to summon the Lost Highness Rakushaasa, an Org Duke who can siphon the fighting spirit out of his opponents. Rakushaasa lends his power to Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, enabling them to defeat the Gaorangers. He then attacks and drains Gao Yellow (Gaku Washio), Gao Blue (Kai Samezu) and Gao Black (Sotaro Ushigome) of their battle spirits, leaving them in a state of near panic. Gao Red (Kakeru Shishi) quickly orders Gao White (Sae Taiga) to escort the other Gaorangers to safety as he continues to battle Rakushaasa alone. Rakushaasa subjects Gao Red to several illusion-based battles with previously vanquished Org Dukes, attempting to drive him to despair. Meanwhile, the shaken Gaorangers are suddenly confronted by a wandering monk, who tells them of the existence of Super Sentai, teams of multi-colored warriors of whom the Gaorangers are the latest version. Each of the Gaorangers' G-Phones then scurries off, causing the Gaorangers to chase them. The scurrying G-Phones lead each Gaoranger to a member of a previous Super Sentai team. Gaku is led to Yuusuke Amamiya, Red Falcon of Choujuu Sentai Liveman, who gives him a training lesson in swordsmanship and explains the Super Sentai's expertise with weaponry. Kai encounters Daimon Tatsumi, Go Yellow of Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive, who explains how each Sentai team develops fighting techniques. Sotaro is led to Gouki, Ginga Blue of Seijuu Sentai Gingaman, who teaches Gao Black about the Sentai use of physical strength. Sai meets Miku Imamura, Mega Pink of Denji Sentai Megaranger, who explains the strengths and abilities of female Super Sentai members. The two women are then surprised by Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, but the two Org Dukes are then challenged by the wandering monk, who reveals himself to be Banba Soukichi, Big One of J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai. Banba and Miku help Sai rescue an exhausted Kakeru from Rakushaasa's clutches, and the heroes are quickly joined by the rejuvenated Gaorangers and their Super Sentai teachers. As the former Super Sentai (led by Banba) engage and destroy Rakushaasa's hastily summoned force of Org Dukes, the Gaorangers battle and defeat Yabaiba, Tsue-Tsue and Rakushaasa. Rakushaasa then summons more power, growing to giant size and attacking the city. He easily defeats the Gaorangers' Gao Muscle, but is driven back by an onslaught unleashed from an array of transforming mecha and special vehicles from Super Sentai history. The Gaorangers then summon Gao King, which is then imbued with energy from past Super Sentai combined mecha forms. Gao King then unleashes a powerful blast that annihilates Rakushaasa's giant form. But Rakushaasa is not destroyed; he rejuvenates himself by draining power from a fleeing Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue and attacks the Super Sentai. The former Sentai explain that the Gaorangers need to summon Super Sentai Tamashii, the pure fighting spirit that imbues all of the teams. To help inspire them, Red Falcon summons 23 other Red Warriors from all the previous Super Sentai teams, from Akarenger of Himitsu Sentai Gorenger to Time Red of Mirai Sentai Timeranger. Their presence inspires the Gaorangers to summon Super Sentai Damashi from within themselves, which Kakeru uses to finally disintegrate Rakushaasa. With Rakushaasa's defeat, all the former Super Sentai vanish. Returning to their home base, the Gaorangers find their mentor Tetomu in a faint; she vaguely remembers seeing Rakushaasa's appearing but quickly dismisses it as a bad dream. It's left to Gaoranger's narrator to assure the team (and the viewer) that the adventure was real.

Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan and Egypt. They are special free trade zones established in collaboration with neighboring Israel to take advantage of the free trade agreements between the United States and Israel. Under the trade agreements with Jordan as laid down by the United States, goods produced in QIZ-notified areas can directly access US markets without tariff or quota restrictions, subject to certain conditions. To qualify, goods produced in these zones must contain a small portion of Israeli input. In addition, a minimum 35% value to the goods must be added to the finished product. The concept was invented by Jordanian businessman Omar Salahhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-01-25/this-peace-dividend- comes-duty-free-dot-dot-dot-but-its-getting-mixed-reviews-intl-edition. The first QIZ, Al-Hassan Industrial Estate in Irbid in northern Jordan, was authorized by the United States Congress in 1997. , there are five Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan and four QIZ designated regions in Egypt. The idea behind the establishment of QIZs was to foster a sense of prosperity and stability in Middle East through economic cooperation and employment. The zones differ from other trade zones as they are stand-alone entities within one country and not directly connected to other countries. In addition, their products are for exports and domestic consumption in any country, not limited to specific countries, and most importantly operate only under the authority and conditions laid down by the host government. History Jordan's King Abdullah's support was crucial for the success of Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan The concept behind a Qualifying Industrial Zone is credited to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, in anticipation of the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region. Salah set up a public share-holding company, Century Investments. Many Jordanian organizations criticized Salah for doing business with Israel and boycotted the purchase of output in Jordan. Despite the heavy criticism, Salah nevertheless received tacit support from King Abdullah of Jordan. To combat the boycott, Salah began to work with multinationals with a larger international stake. He then actively lobbied the Jordanian government to set negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States on the lines of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985. Faced with little enthusiasm by the Jordanian government, Salah scrutinized the Presidential Proclamation (No. 6955) that was part of the Palestinian agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993. In the agreement, the areas on the border between Israel and Jordan were designated as \\"Qualifying Industrial Zones\\", and goods produced here would not have tariff and quota restrictions to the US markets. Since the Hassan industrial estate in Irbid, where Salah had factories located, was situated far from the bordering areas, it did not qualify for QIZ status. Salah then lobbied the Jordanian government to extend these regions into other parts of Jordan. Government officials were lukewarm to the idea and told him that it would be \\"naive to assume\\" that the United States would give Jordan this status. Unfazed by this response, Salah traveled to the United States and lobbied hard with the US State Department, the White House, and the US Trade Representative that it was in US interests to extend the QIZ into Jordan's interiors. Lawyers in the United States then told Salah that even if a small portion of Israeli territory was associated with a QIZ, the proposal might materialize. Soon, USTR officials began to travel to Jordan to work on the deal. Finally, in 1997, an agreement was signed at the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) conference at Doha that established a QIZ agreement with Jordan. On 6 March 1998, the Al-Hassan Zone in Irbid was designated the first QIZ in Jordan. After the setting up of the first QIZ, few Jordanian companies took advantage of QIZ benefits due to the general hostility in doing business with Israel. Instead, Chinese and Indian companies quickly took advantage of the vacuum to set up business establishments. The lack of local enthusiasm was criticized by the Jordan Times for missing the \\"golden opportunity\\". Gradually though, more Jordanian businesses began to set up business establishments as political hostilities began to be overshadowed by business economics. Soon after 1998, an additional twelve sites were given QIZ status by USTR. Positive results from the Jordanian QIZ led to the Government of Egypt negotiating a separate QIZ protocol with the United States in Cairo on 24 December 2004. The protocol came into effect in February 2005. Regulations Chart of the inputs breakup by country Under the agreement (P.L. 104-234) requires that articles eligible for QIZ status must be manufactured in or directly imported from the areas administered by the Palestine Authority or another notified QIZ and meet the several conditions. To quality for this scheme a product must be substantially transformed in the manufacturing process. Material and processing costs incurred in a QIZ must total not less than 35% of the appraised value of the product when imported into the United States. Of this 35%, 15% must be either US materials or materials from Israel, and/or Jordan or Egypt depending on the program. The remaining 20% of the 35% input must come from Israel and Jordan or Egypt. The remaining 65% can come from any part of the world. All importers must also certify that the article meet conditions for duty exemption. Under the sharing agreements, the manufacturer from the Jordanian side must contribute at least 11.7% of the final produce, and the manufacturer on the Israeli side must contribute 8% (7% on high-tech products). Under the Israeli-Egyptian agreement, 11.7% of the inputs must be made in Israel. The clothing and textile industry has benefited most from this arrangement. As tariffs on these goods into the United States are relatively high, exporters have used the duty-free benefits of QIZs to gain quick access to markets in the United States. Jordan Location of Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan On 6 March 1998, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) designated the Al-Hassan Industrial Estate in the northern city of Irbid as the first QIZ. Since then, an addition twelve QIZs have been also designated across the country. Prominent QIZs include the Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate at Al Karak, owned and operated by the Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation, the Jordan Cyber City in Irbid, the privately owned Al- Tajamouat Industrial Estate at Amman, Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park and El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company near Zarqa. Upcoming industrial parks include the Gateway QIZ on the northern border with Israel, Aqaba Industrial Estate at Aqaba, and the Mushatta International complex in Amman. Jordan has seen a substantial economic growth since the QIZ were set up. Exports from Jordan to the United States grew from US$15 million to over US$1 billion in 2004. Government sources have estimated that over 40,000 jobs have been created with the set up of QIZs. Investment is currently valued at US$85-100 million and expected to grow to $180 to $200 million. The success of QIZ have led to the United States and Jordan signing a Free Trade Agreement in 2001 that was approved by the US Congress. Between 1998 and 2005 Jordan moved up from the United States' thirteenth to eight largest trading partner among the 20 Middle-East-North African (MENA) entities. In 2005, US exports to and imports from Jordan totalled an estimated $1.9 billion: U.S. exports, at an estimated $646 million, were 1.8 times their 1998 level; US imports, at $1.3 billion, were 80 times their 1998 level.USITC Dataweb Despite the 2001 FTA between the United States and Jordan, 75% of Jordanian articles enter the United States through the QIZ program. The apparel industry dominates both Jordan's QIZs and total exports to the United States, accounting for 99.9% of all QIZ exports and 86% of all Jordanian exports to the United States. The reason for this dominance is that QIZ products enter the United States free of duty, whereas, under the US-Jordan FTA, tariffs will not be fully eliminated until the end of the ten-year phase-in period, in 2011. Egypt QIZ locations in Egypt: Green: Central Delta Region, Magenta: Suez Canal Zone; Orange: Alexandria Region; and Red: Greater Cairo Zone. After the WTO phased out quantitative quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would be threatened by global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result in the loss of 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt.Data source: U.S. International Trade Commission Dataweb Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force. Positive results from the Jordanian led to the Government of Egypt negotiating a QIZ protocol in Cairo on 24 December 2004 that came into effect in February 2005. USTR has designated three QIZs in Egypt - the Greater Cairo Zone, the Alexandria Zone, and the Suez Canal Zone (69 CFR 78094). On 4 November 2005, the USTR designated a fourth zone in the Central Delta region and expanded the Greater Cairo and Suez Canal zones. The protocol signed between the two nations is a non-reciprocal arrangement and is expected to be a step towards the establishment of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries. However negotiations toward a US-Egyptian free trade agreement have recently been suspended over human rights issues. The results have been positive. Israeli exports to Egypt rose over 30% from US$29 million in 2004 to US$93.2 million and exceeded US$125 million in 2006. ten QIZs have been set up in Egypt. Some estimate that approximately 20% of companies based in QIZs are wholly owned by Jordanians. Social impact Women form a large part of the workforce in the QIZ. Although most experts note that companies based in QIZs hire foreign laborers, thousands of Jordanians, particularly women from the rural countryside, have found jobs at garment factories in QIZs. In a traditional society such as Jordan, many of these women had little previous work experience and were largely caretakers of their home. Despite the low wages paid by apparel factories in the QIZs, some women have been able to support their families. However, traditional attitudes toward a woman's place in the home persist, and many families continue to prohibit female members from working in QIZs. (See Women in Jordan) In response, the Jordanian Ministry of Labor has worked to ease the adjustment of women moving from the home to a new job by providing free transportation to work, subsidizing the cost of food in QIZs, paying for dormitories near factories to cut commuting times and providing childcare.http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/global-currents/made-in- jordan-garment-manufacturing-industry The long-term effect of female employment in QIZs are yet to be quantified, and there is some concern that over time, Jordanian women may have difficulty in achieving higher wages in a global economy where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets. When the QIZ program came into being in 1996, observers regarded it as a vehicle to support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between Israel and the two Arab states (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous ‚Äúcold peace‚Äù continues to prevail between Israel and the two Arab states. Since the conclusion of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade, though the overall totals remain modest. Criticisms By far the biggest international criticism of QIZs in Jordan is the humanitarian crisis within the factories. A comprehensive report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights found that Sri Lankan migrant workers were subject to \\"routine sexual abuse and rape.\\"Report on Foreign Workers in One of Jordan's Export Production Factories Jadaliyya, 12 June 2011 The United States Trade Representative (USTR) designation of 13 factories throughout Jordan (under the US-Jordan Free Trade Agreement) has led to disastrous realities, gender inequality and gender based violence: :\\"There are over 30,000 poor, mostly young women, foreign guest workers toiling in Jordan‚Äòs largely foreign-owned garment factories sewing clothing for export to the United States. Under the Free Trade Agreement, those garments enter the U.S. duty-free. :\\"The guest workers are from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, China, Nepal and Egypt. They earn less than three-quarters the wage of Jordanian garment workers, who account for only 15 to 25 percent of the total garment workforce. Jordanians earn $1.02 an hour while the foreign guest workers take home 74¬Ω cents an hour. The Jordanians work eight hours a day, while the guest workers toil an average of 12 hours a day.\\" See also *Special Economic Zones *Jordan‚ÄìUnited States relations References External links *Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan and Egypt Category:Special economic zones Category:Economy of Jordan Category:Economy of Egypt Category:Economy of Israel Category:Economy of the Arab League Category:Egypt‚ÄìJordan relations Category:Industry in Egypt ","title":"Qualifying Industrial Zone"},{"id":"20082859","title":"Manuel Mar√≠a Caballero Province"},{"id":"20082902","text":"Augustin Senghor in 2007.

It is the oldest British school in mainland Europe. It is a private, day school for both boys and girls, aged 3 to 18, with approximately 425 pupils on roll. It follows a British curriculum until the completion of the IGCSE. Senior pupils then study the IB Diploma Programme and many go on to higher education in the UK, Portugal, and other locations around the world. Accreditation OBS received CIS Accreditation in 2005. It is a member of the European Council of International Schools, the Council of British International Schools. Houses OBS has three houses named after prominent royal houses: *House of Windsor *House of Braganza *House of Lancaster History The Oporto British School opened in 1894 with 11 boys, with the Rev WS Picken MA as the Master. The School house, in the Porto suburb Foz do Douro, was rented at the time but was purchased in 1922 and remains part of the school's facilities. Non-British boys were accepted in 1902, and girls in 1914. Pupil numbers remained small, and it was not until well after the Second World War that the roll exceeded 100. The school, founded as a Prep School, continued as such until the mid-1950s, when some pupils remained to take their GCE examinations. The early 1960s saw a further development in provision for Portuguese pupils, as the school ensured that, in addition to following an English curriculum, a parallel course in Portuguese was also followed. Growing pupil numbers through the 1970s and into the 1980s meant that a significant building programme was required to provide the accommodation and facilities for in excess of 200 pupils. A curriculum for post-IGCSE pupils was developed in the early 1990s with the provision of courses leading to the award of the International Baccalaureate Diploma. By this time, the proportion of pupils from a Portuguese background exceeded that of all others, including British students. This trend continued, and there are in excess of 400 pupils in the school, 80% of whom are from Portuguese families, 10% are British, and 10% from other backgrounds. Along with recent growth in pupils numbers has been significant curriculum and campus development. The school achieved fully accredited status by the Council of International Schools. Leadership and management The school is run by an elected board of governors (chairman of the board Maria Jo√£o Carrapato) and the Senior Leadership Team include: Headmaster Robin Silk, Head of Primary Section Lucy Austin, Head of Secondary Section Chris Payne, Deputy Head (IB Coordinator) Claire Marsden, and the Business Manager Andr√© Guardado. There are also two elected members of staff representing staff members at all board meetings. The school has a Head Boy and Head Girl who represent the pupil body at public and ceremonial events. The school has a Parent-Teacher Association (The President of the Parents Association is the Head Master and the current Chair of the PTA is Elisabeth Martorell). Location The school is in the suburb of Foz do Douro in Rua da Cerca, Porto, Portugal. Sports, initiatives and extra-curricular activities Oporto British School has a range of sports. Traditionally, the main school sports have been football and basketball. The school's sport colours are blue and white. The school participates in school competitions annually and term-by-term. The school received Green Flag status on 29 September 2009 for environmentally friendly practice. The school participates in many national and international trips annually of sporting, charitable and cultural significance. These include: *IB Charitable and Educational rally in Tanzania *in 2016 a group of IB pupils as part of CAS went to different parts of India on an outreach program. *Model UN trips to Budapest, Bel√©m, Lisbon, and Paris *Science trips to Sierra de Gredos *Multi- school sports festival (basketball & football) in Cascais, Lisbon  References   External links  *Oporto British School *School Profile on IBO website Category:British international schools in Europe Category:Educational institutions established in 1894 Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Portugal Category:International schools in Porto Category:1894 establishments in Portugal ","title":"Oporto British School"},{"id":"20083053","text":"Celine Dion, referred to as the \\"Queen of Adult Contemporary\\", is one of the biggest international stars in music history, selling more than 250 million albums worldwide. In North American music, adult contemporary music (AC) is a form of radio-played popular music, ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day, with varying degrees of easy listening, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, quiet storm, and rock influence.Musical Terms . American Popular Music. Oxford University Press. Retrieved August 4, 2008. Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.R. B. Browne and P. Browne, eds, The Guide to United States Popular Culture (Popular Press, 2001), , p. 687. Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse‚Äìchorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments (though bass guitar is usually used) such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high- pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers (and other electronics, such as drum machines).J. M.

A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past. This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart. Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including \\"hot AC\\", \\"soft AC\\" (also known as \\"lite AC\\"), \\"urban AC\\", \\"rhythmic AC\\", and \\"Christian AC\\" (a softer type of contemporary Christian music). Some stations play only \\"hot AC\\", \\"soft AC\\", or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from musicians of many different genres. History =1960s: Early roots; easy listening and soft rock= Johnny Mathis concentrated on romantic readings of jazz and pop standards for the adult contemporary audience of the 1960s and 1970s. Adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s easy listening format, which adopted a 70‚Äî80% instrumental to 20‚Äì30% vocal mix. A few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. The easy listening format, as it was first known, was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as \\"rock and roll\\" stations. Billboard first published the Easy Listening chart July 17, 1961, with 20 songs; the first number one was \\"Boll Weevil Song\\" by Brook Benton. The chart described itself as \\"not too far out in either direction\\".Trust, Gary (July 23, 2011). \\"Vanilla Is Licking the Competition\\". Billboard. Vol. 123, Issue 25. Initially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, and others. The custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent rock and roll or pop hit songs, a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without selling out. Some stations would also occasionally play earlier big band-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s. After 1965, differences between the Hot 100 chart and the Easy Listening chart became more pronounced. Better reflecting what middle of the road stations were actually playing, the composition of the chart changed dramatically. As rock music continued to harden, there was much less crossover between the Hot 100 and Easy Listening chart than there had been in the early half of the 1960s. Roger Miller, Barbra Streisand and Bobby Vinton were among the chart's most popular performers. One big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was that, when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These middle of the road (or \\"MOR\\") stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era adult standards and big band titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs. Another big impetus for the evolution of the AC radio format was the popularity of easy listening or \\"beautiful music\\" stations, stations with music specifically designed to be purely ambient. Whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists, and rarely purchased (especially as singles, although Jackie Gleason's beautiful music albums sold well in the 1950s), AC was an attempt to create a similar \\"lite\\" format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists. In terms of record sales and career longevity, Barry Manilow is one of the most successful adult contemporary singers ever and the most best-selling of the 1970s. =1970s: Soft rock forms as a radio format= Late 1960s hard rock had been established as one of rock genres. From the end of the 1960s, hard rock and soft rock became popular in rock scene, with both emerging as major radio formats in the USA.M. C. Keith, The Radio Station: Broadcast, Satellite and Internet (Focal Press, 8th edn., 2009), , p. 14. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included Barbra Streisand, Carole King, Cat Stevens, James TaylorJ. M. Curtis, Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954-1984 (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236. and Bread. The Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s, when the texture of much of the music played on Top 40 radio once more began to soften. The adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it, with rock-oriented acts as Chicago, the Eagles, and Elton John becoming associated with the format. Soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid-to-late 1970s with acts such as Toto, England Dan & John Ford Coley, Air Supply, Seals and Crofts, Dan Fogelberg, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378. By 1977, some radio stations, notably New York's WTFM and NBC-owned WYNY, and Boston's WEEI, had switched to an all-soft rock format.C. H. Sterling, M. C. Keith, Sounds of Change: a History of FM broadcasting in America (UNC Press, 2008), pp. 136-7. As Softrock 103, WEEI was famous for its promotional campaigns, featuring slogans such as \\"Joni, without the baloni.\\" and \\"The Byrds, without the nyrds.\\" By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as Journey. \\"Journey fans can easily list a dozen soft rock ballads from the band...\\" Radio stations played Top 40 hits regardless of genre; although, most were in the same genre until the mid-1970s when different forms of popular music started to target different demographic groups, such as disco vs. hard rock. This evolved into specialized radio stations that played specific genres of music, and generally followed the evolution of artists in those genres. By the early 1970s, softer songs by The Carpenters, Anne Murray, John Denver, Barry Manilow, and even Streisand, began to be played more often on \\"Top 40\\" radio and others were added to the mix on many AC stations. Also, some of these stations even played softer songs by Elvis Presley, Linda Ronstadt, Elton John, Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, and other rock-based artists. Much of the music recorded by singer-songwriters such as Diana Ross, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Carole King and Janis Ian got as much, if not more, airplay on this format than on Top 40 stations. Easy Listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres, such as rock and roll or R&B.; In addition, several early disco songs, did well on the Adult Contemporary format. =1980s: Adult contemporary succeeds as radio format= \\"Careless Whisper\\" stayed at the #1 spot in the adult contemporary chart for 5 weeks. The song was George Michael's first solo single. On April 7, 1979, the Easy Listening chart officially became known as Adult Contemporary, and those two words have remained consistent in the name of the chart ever since. Adult contemporary music became one of the most popular radio formats of the 1980s. The growth of AC was a natural result of the generation that first listened to the more \\"specialized\\" music of the mid-late 1970s growing older and not being interested in the heavy metal and rap/hip-hop music that a new generation helped to play a significant role in the Top 40 charts by the end of the decade. Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists such as Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, John Denver, and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format, such as Richard Marx, Michael Jackson, Bonnie Tyler, George Michael, Phil Collins, and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by AllMusic as \\"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\\". However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time. The amount of crossover between the AC chart and the Hot 100 has varied based on how much the passing pop music trends of the times appealed to adult listeners. Not many disco or new wave songs were particularly successful on the AC chart during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and much of the hip-hop and harder rock music featured on CHR formats later in the decade would have been unacceptable on AC radio. Although dance-oriented, electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to Sheena Easton, Amy Grant, Lionel Richie, Christopher Cross, Dan Hill, Leo Sayer, Billy Ocean, Julio Iglesias, Bertie Higgins, and Tommy Page. No song spent more than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat. Two of these were by Lionel Richie, \\"You Are\\" in 1983 and \\"Hello\\" in 1984, which also reached #1 on the Hot 100. In 1989, Linda Ronstadt released Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind, described by critics as \\"the first true Adult Contemporary album of the decade\\", featuring American soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the twelve tracks. The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe. The Grammy Award-winning singles, \\"Don't Know Much\\" and \\"All My Life\\", were both long-running #1 Adult Contemporary hits. Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well. The album won over many critics in the need to define AC, and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play. =1990s: Subgenre formations/radio crossovers= Latin artist Marc Anthony's self-titled English-language album released in 1999 had singles that crossed over to the AC charts. The early 1990s marked the softening of urban R&B; in the shape of new jack swing, at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence. This in part led to a widening of the market, not only allowing to cater to more niche markets, but it also became customary for artists to make AC- friendly singles. At the same time, the genre began adopting elements from hard rock as tastes were shifting towards louder music, while AC stations in general began playing more rock acts. \\"Softer\\" features such as light instrumental music (carried over from the beautiful music format‚Äîmany AC stations carried the format until the early 1970s), new age songs and most pre-1964 artists were gradually phased out from AC radio throughout the early- mid 1990s. Unlike the majority of 1980s mainstream singers, the 1990s mainstream pop/R&B; singers such as All-4-One, Boyz II Men, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys and Savage Garden generally crossed over to the AC charts. Latin pop artists such as Lynda Thomas, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Selena, Enrique Iglesias and Luis Miguel also enjoyed success in the AC charts. In addition to Celine Dion, who has had significant success on this chart, other artists with multiple number ones on the AC chart in the 1990s include Mariah Carey, Phil Collins, Michael Bolton, Whitney Houston and Shania Twain. Newer female singer-songwriters such as Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Jewel, Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow also broke through on the AC chart during this time.Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits. New York City: Billboard Books. . In 1996, Billboard created a new chart called Adult Top 40, which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between \\"adult contemporary\\" music and \\"pop\\" music. Although they are sometimes mistaken for each other, the Adult Contemporary chart and the Adult Top 40 chart are separate charts, and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other. In addition, hot AC is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart as it exists today, despite the apparent similarity in name. In response to the pressure on Hot AC, a new kind of AC format cropped up among American radio recently. The urban adult contemporary format (a term coined by Barry Mayo) usually attracts a large number of African Americans and sometimes Caucasian listeners through playing a great deal of R&B; (without any form of rapping), gospel music, classic soul and dance music (including disco). Another format, rhythmic AC, in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft AC music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on disco as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits, such as those by Amber, C&C; Music Factory and Black Box, and includes dance remixes of pop songs, such as the Soul Solution mix of Toni Braxton's \\"Unbreak My Heart\\". In its early years of existence, the smooth jazz format was considered to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and related a stronger resemblance to the soft AC-styled music. For many years, George Benson, Kenny G and Dave Koz had all had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft AC stations. =2000s‚Äìpresent: AC music goes mainstream and mainstream music goes AC= A number of Michael Bubl√©'s singles and albums topped the AC charts in the 2000s and 2010s. During the 2000s, the AC market gained an increased presence in the music industry, as its radio formats were popular nationwide‚ÄîSmooth jazz and \\"Urban AC\\" stations were ubiquitous in the East Coast, while Soft rock and \\"adult standards\\" stations were common in the Midwest, and pop-oriented \\"Hot AC\\" and \\"world music\\"/Hispanic AC stations were easily found in the West Coast and the \\"Sun Belt\\". This led to the presence of numerous genres on the AC charts, often crossing to the \\"pop\\" charts, winning over many critics in the need to define AC, and increased the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day-to-day radio play. Josh Groban's single \\"You Raise Me Up\\" and Michael Bubl√©'s \\"Fever\\" are often considered to be key examples of the high production values and ballad-heavy sound that defined 2000s-era AC, often dubbed as \\"jazz-pop\\", heavily carrying classical, jazz and traditional pop influences. Artists such as Nick Lachey, James Blunt, Jamie Cullum, John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Norah Jones, Diana Krall, Amy Winehouse and Susan Boyle also achieved great success during this period. During most of the 2000s, country music/countrypolitan musicians such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes and Carrie Underwood scored hits on soft AC. A popular trend in the late 1990s and 2000s was remixing dance music hits into adult contemporary ballads, especially in the US, (for example, the \\"Candlelight Mix\\" versions of \\"Heaven\\" by DJ Sammy, \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" by D.H.T., and \\"Everytime We Touch\\" by Cascada). Key to the success of AC in the 2000s was the 25‚Äì34 demographic which had outgrown the pop music offerings of the time, most new rock became too alternative and harsh for AC radio and most new pop was now influenced heavily by dance-pop, hip-hop and electronic dance music.Whitburn, Joel (2007). Billboard Top Adult Songs 1961-2006 (Record Research Inc.), page 373. At the same time, the music industry also began to focus on older audiences and markets generally considered \\"niche\\". During the late 2000s, certain pop songs began entering the AC charts instead, generally after the songs had fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for RCA Music Group, said, \\"We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play\\". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary now began playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits had become established. An article on MTV's website by Corey Moss describes this trend as: \\"In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death. Or, to optimists, to get a second life.\\"\\"Never A 'Bad Day' ‚Äî Adult- Contemporary Radio, Where Pop Hits Live Strong\\", from mtv.com Retrieved February 26, 2009. As adult contemporary has long characterized itself as family-friendly, \\"clean\\" versions of pop songs began appearing on the AC chart, as were the cases of \\"Perfect\\" by P!nk, and \\"Forget You\\" by Cee Lo Green, both in 2011. AC radio's shift into more mainstream pop was a result of the changes on the broadcasting landscape following the 2005‚Äì2007 economic downturn and eventual recession, as advertisers preferred more profitable chart-based formats, which meant the demise of many AC-based formulas, primarily those aimed at older audiences, with tastes changing towards more modern music among all age groups. Diminishing physical record sales throughout the 2010s also proved a major blow to the AC genre, and there are concerns that the portable people meter, a device being used to determine radio listenership, may be incompatible with AC songs and may not accurately pick up that a person is listening to an AC station because of the pitches and frequencies used in the style. Key AC artists of the early-mid 2010s included Bruno Mars, Coldplay, Adele, Meghan Trainor, Maroon 5 and Ed Sheeran, featuring a more pop-influenced, uptempo style than the typical AC fare of previous years, also featuring production values reminiscent of the Motown sound and the so-called Wall of Sound that dominated the soul-heavy pop charts of the early 1960s, when the Easy Listening chart was first introduced. The earlier years of the decade also saw alternative and indie rock acts such as Wilco, Feist, The 1975, Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men, The Lumineers and Arcade Fire quickly becoming AC mainstays, although these were eventually replaced by rhythm-based rock bands such as Panic at the Disco, Neon Trees X Ambassadors, Sheppard, Bastille, American Authors, Fitz and the Tantrums, Foster the People, Twenty One Pilots, Walk the Moon and Milky Chance. During the middle of the decade, newer artists such as CeeLo Green, One Republic, Rachel Platten, Christina Perri, Andy Grammer, James Bay, Sara Bareilles, Shawn Mendes, Sia, Sam Smith, Gavin Degraw, Charlie Puth and Colbie Caillat and acts that were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were added to the rotation of most AC stations. As trap music and similar styles of hip-hop began dominating top 40 stations during the last years of the 2010s, AC stations began picking up rhythmic artists like Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding, Taio Cruz, and Pitbull as well as EDM artists like Calvin Harris, David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, and Zedd. Meanwhile, younger artists like Camilla Cabello, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Nick Jonas and the Jonas Brothers and Halsey began to be featured on AC stations more than on top 40 stations. Adult contemporary formats In radio broadcasting, adult contemporary is divided into several sub-formats, each with their own musical direction and demographic targeting. Hot adult contemporary formats generally feature an uptempo selection of recent hits that appeal to a wide adult audience, soft adult contemporary formats have a more conservative sound oriented primarily towards adult women, urban AC focuses on R&B; and soul music that appeal to African American adults, and rhythmic AC focuses on dance music and other rhythmic genres. A station formatted as adult contemporary with no qualifier, also referred to as \\"mainstream\\" adult contemporary, generally has a similar playlist to hot AC stations, but are broader in their playlists‚Äîespecially in their inclusion of classic hits from past decades. =Hot adult contemporary= Hot adult contemporary (hot AC) radio stations play a wide range of popular music that appeals towards the 18-54 age group,Marc Schiffman and Dana Hall, \\"Modern debates value of '80s gold.\\" Billboard, June 14, 1997, Vol. 109 Issue 24, p. 75. it serves as a middle ground between the youth- oriented contemporary hit radio (CHR) format, and adult contemporary formats (such as \\"mainstream\\" and soft AC) that are typically targeted towards a more mature demographic. They generally feature uptempo hit music with wide appeal, such as pop and pop rock songs, while excluding more youth-oriented music such as hip-hop. Recurrents usually reflect familiar and youthful music that adults had grown up with. Similarly, matured pop acts such as the Backstreet Boys, Jason Mraz, John Mayer, and Pink, as well as alternative and indie rock crossovers (such as Foster the People, Imagine Dragons, Lovelytheband, Portugal. The Man, and Twenty One Pilots), have also been common fixtures of present-day hot AC stations. The \\"hot AC\\" designation began to appear in the 1990s, to describe adult contemporary stations with a more energetic presentation and uptempo sound than their softer counterparts. An early example of the format, Houston's KHMX Mix 96.5, climbed from 14th place in the market to 3rd in the six months after its launch. The station's format and branding was widely replicated by other stations. Many hot AC outlets are among the top stations in their respective market. Initially focused more on pop rock, the format has evolved to reflect changes in the composition of this audience; by the mid-2000s, the format had evolved to include more uptempo pop music, helping to expand their audience among younger listeners such as millennials; Nielsen Audio ranked hot AC as the third most-popular format among millennials, behind pop and country music. Of the format's expanding demographic reach, WOMX-FM program director Dana Taylor stated that hot AC stations \\"may not be the radio station that everybody agrees on, but it's a radio station that everybody goes, 'I'm okay with that'.\\" The increasingly downtempo direction of pop hits in the mid-to-late 2010's also helped to attract additional listeners. Hot AC stations typically keep a larger body of recent hits in rotation than those with rigid, chart-driven formats like CHR and urban contemporary. As these stations' playlists have become concentrated towards airing only the current hits at a given time, hot AC airplay can build and sustain a song's popularity over a long-term period. This effect has been credited in helping build an audience for early singles from new acts such as Adele, Rachel Platten (\\"Fight Song\\", which achieved mainstream popularity after its use during Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign), and Max Schneider (whose 2016 single \\"Lights Down Low\\", over a year after its original release, became a sleeper hit on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 and Hot 100 due in part to strong hot AC promotion and airplay). The popularity of the hot AC format prompted mainstream adult contemporary stations to evolve in a similar direction, displacing softer songs in favor of uptempo songs usually featured on hot AC stations, while still featuring older recurrents than those typically played by hot AC stations.  Modern adult contemporary  Modern adult contemporary refers to AC formats with a stronger lean towards modern rock and pop rock. In the 1990s and early 2000s, modern AC was typically targeted towards women, with Mike Marino of KMXB in Las Vegas describing the format as reaching \\"an audience that has outgrown the edgier hip-hop or alternative music but hasn't gotten old and sappy enough for the soft ACs.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-13.pdf; The format typically focused on 90's female rock acts such as Shawn Colvin, Sheryl Crow, Indigo Girls, Jewel, and Sarah McLachlan, and folk rock-influenced bands such as Counting Crows and The Wallflowers. =Soft adult contemporary= The Soft adult contemporary format typically targets women 25‚Äì54 and at-work listening. Soft AC playlists are generally conservative in comparison to hot AC, focusing on pop and power ballads, soft rock, and other familiar, light hits. Upon its establishment in the 1980s, the soft AC format was positioned as being a more upbeat version of easy listening that would appeal better to a younger audience, mainly by excluding instrumental beautiful music. Easy listening stations had begun shifting to the format out of concern that their existing programming would not appeal to the current generation of listeners. In a 1990 article, James Warren of the Chicago Tribune characterized soft AC stations as being \\"as middle-of-the-road and unthreatening as modern media get\\", with personalities that were encouraged to be as inoffensive and \\"low-profile\\" as possible, and a more conservative music library than hot AC-leaning stations. In particular, Chicago's WLIT did not have its airstaff talk over the beginning and endings of songs (in contrast to the hot AC-leaning WFYR), and played Bob Seger's \\"We've Got Tonite\\" but not \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" (which was part of WTMX's playlist). The director of a soft AC station in Connecticut, WEZN-FM, told Warren that he had barred the reading of top-of-hour news headlines, so that listeners wouldn't be tempted to tune away to an all-news station to learn more. Soft AC stations tend to be more selective in their music libraries than other adult contemporary stations, preferring proven songs over current hits. Upon the onset of the format's popularity, core artists typically included singers such as Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Neil Diamond, Barry Manilow, Johnny Mathis, and Barbra Streisand. By the 1990s, to improve their appeal among changing demographics, some soft AC stations began to widen their playlist to include selections from contemporary acts such as Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Elton John, and Whitney Houston. On the other hand, by 1996, New York's WLTW had begun to phase out its softer music in favor of a more uptempo direction. In 2017, Inside Radio reported that soft AC had the third-largest decrease in U.S. stations offering the format over the past decade (at 128), ranking behind only adult standards and oldies ‚Äì a shift credited to aging demographics and a major boom in the wider-appealing classic hits format (which saw the largest overall increase over the same period). Consultant Gary Berkowitz argued that the soft AC format had become increasingly irrelevant in comparison to mainstream and hot AC, due to PPM markets preferring uptempo music. At the same time, however, soft AC began to experience a resurgence. In April 2016, iHeartMedia flipped its San Francisco classic soul station KISQ to soft AC as The Breeze; as of November 2018, it was the top station in the Bay Area. The trend continued into 2017 and 2018, with iHeartMedia extending its Breeze brand to other soft AC flips, and the brand (among others) being adopted by competitors such as Entercom. Industry analyst Sean Ross argued that older demographics were becoming more lucrative due to changes in listening habits among younger audiences, which prefer digital platforms such as music streaming services over linear terrestrial radio, and also noted how mainstream AC was dependent on the Top 40 charts to break new songs. Current soft AC stations have continued to feature recurrents such as Michael Bolton, Celine Dion, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Hall & Oates, and Whitney Houston, while contemporary musicians such as Adele and Michael Bubl√© have also become modern fixtures of the format. In addition, the soft AC sound has diversified to include more songs that are \\"safe and universal\\" and not necessarily \\"soft\\", with Ross presenting examples such as Simple Minds' \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\", as well as the retroactively-defined genre of yacht rock. Over time, some stations have gradually adjusted their playlists to include more recurrents from the 1980s and 1970s (although not to the same extent as other \\"soft oldies\\" formats, such as MeTV FM, which have also grown in popularity). =Urban adult contemporary= The Urban adult contemporary format focuses primarily on current and classic R&B; and soul music. The format typically targets African-American adults: July 2018 numbers from Nielsen Audio recorded it as the top format among African-Americans 25‚Äì54 and 35‚Äì64. It also has a sizable popularity among younger listeners, ranking behind urban contemporary as the second-most popular format among African- American adults 18‚Äì34 in the same report, with an 18.9 audience share. The format typically excludes youthful rhythmic music, such as commercial hip-hop and rap, that are usually associated with the urban contemporary format. The urban AC format is also associated with programming typically referred to as the \\"quiet storm\\", which focuses on mellower R&B; ballads and slow jams ‚Äî often in a jazz-influenced style. As urban contemporary stations prefer hit- driven hip-hop songs, labels typically service R&B; songs to the urban AC format only. Some current R&B; musicians have complained that this is an artificial divide that prevents them from reaching a wider, mainstream audience (citing the relatively smaller number of urban AC outlets in comparison to urban and rhythmic), even with attempts to give some singles a hip-hop-influenced sound to improve the potential for crossover appeal. Some acts have attempted to disassociate themselves from \\"R&B;\\" to reduce the effect of this stigma, although streaming services have helped to expose R&B; to a wider audience beyond urban AC radio. = Rhythmic adult contemporary = The Rhythmic adult contemporary format generally focuses on a variety of current and classic dance music, such as dance-pop, hip-hop, and R&B; (often resembling a blend of the Classic hits and hot AC formats in practice). The exact composition of current and recurrent content can vary between stations, depending on regional preferences and the heritage of rhythmic formats in the market, ranging from late-80s/early-90s dance hits (including freestyle), to disco and Motown. Rhythmic Hot AC has also been used as a format, popularized by stations such as New York's WKTU. =Smooth adult contemporary= Smooth Adult Contemporary was evolved from smooth jazz stations, in order to attract more younger listeners (particularly in the important 25-54 age demographic) without completely alienating jazz fans. Smooth AC stations played more of the vocalists popular on smooth jazz stations, such as Luther Vandross, Sade, Anita Baker, and Basia, Diana Krall,http://www.radio.net/s/calmjazzvocals while incorporating more mainstream and urban AC material from artists such as Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige and limiting instrumentals to two or three cuts an hour (and usually restricting airplay of instrumentals to artists such as Kenny G and Chuck Mangione who had crossover pop success). In markets where they existed, Smooth AC stations were meant to fill a void for soft music created by the mainstream Adult Contemporary format's overall move toward more uptempo adult Top-40 musical fare. =Contemporary Christian music= Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has several subgenres, one being \\"Christian AC\\". Radio & Records, for instance, lists Christian AC among its format charts. There has been crossover to mainstream and hot AC formats by many of the core artists of the Christian AC genre, notably Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Kathy Troccoli, Steven Curtis Chapman, Plumb, and more recently, MercyMe, for KING & COUNTRY and Lauren Daigle. Christmas music Since the 1990s it has become common for many AC stations, particularly soft AC stations, to play primarily or exclusively Christmas music during the Christmas season in November and December. While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format, most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop, MOR, and adult standards artists ‚Äì such as Mannheim Steamroller, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, The Carpenters, Percy Faith, Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams ‚Äì many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year. These Christmas music marathons typically start a few weeks before Thanksgiving Day and end after Christmas Day, or sometimes extending to New Year's Day. Afterwards, the stations usually resume their normal music fare. Several stations begin the holiday format much earlier, at the beginning of November especially after Halloween. The roots of this tradition can be traced back to the beautiful music and easy listening stations of the 1960s and 1970s. Syndicated radio shows and networks carrying the adult contemporary format * Delilah ‚Äì One of the USA's most popular radio shows, Delilah airs primarily in the evening.

According to Ukrainian Catholic Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, Pope Francis was mentored by Czmil and therefore knows the Eastern Rite well. Early life Father Czmil was born in Sudova Vyshnya a small town in western Ukraine, some 30 kilometers from the present Polish border Rawa Ruska/Medyka. His parents, Stefan and Julia Szydlowska (, Stepan ta Yulia Shydlovski), were Ukrainian patriots and Christians, who instilled into their son a love of Ukraine and the Greek Catholic Church, as the Ukrainian Catholic Church then was officially known. After the first school years in his native town, in 1925 he was sent to the Ukrainian all-boys gymnasium in Peremyshl [now Przemy≈õl, Poland], whose catechist was Father Petro Holynskyj. Stefan Czmil joined the Salesian Congregation. It was his goal to educate poor youths in Ukraine in the same manner as Saint John Bosco did in his time in Italy. Career In 1930 the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, Cardinal Cicognani, turned to Pope Pius XI asking him permission for Eastern rite candidates to the Salesians to retain their rite and Church traditions; it was granted. At the same time, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, Head of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (1901‚Äì1944), designated Josafat Kotsylovskyj, bishop of the Diocese of Peremyshl, to inform the Gymnasium's students of his intentions to send to Italy those willing to become Salesians. When the Salesian Superiors adhered to the projected plan of accepting candidates from Ukraine to the Salesian brotherhood, allowing them to retain their rite and Church traditions, Stefan Czmil and nine others expressed their intention to become Salesians. In 1932 they went to the town of Ivrea, in Northern Italy, where the Salesians had their school for candidates to the Salesian brotherhood. After graduating from the school of Salesian aspirants Czmil was admitted to the Salesian Novitiate in Villa Moglia (Chieri) in 1935. He took his three-year temporary vows in 1936. =Education= He studied philosophy (1936‚Äì39) at the Salesian College of Philosophical Studies in Foglizzo (Turin), then interrupted his studies for a two-year educative stage amongst the novices of Villa Moglia, after which he was admitted to the Salesian House of Studies in Bolengo for his Theology (1941‚Äì45), during World War II. Ordained a priest in 1945 by the Apostolic Visitator for Ukrainian √©migr√©s in Western Europe, Ivan Buchko, he followed up his studies with a baccalaureate in Pedagogy in 1947 at the Salesian Pontifical Athenaeum in Turin. Before that he was assigned as a tourist guide at the Catacombes of Saint Callistus in Rome under Salesian Administration, where he met scores of Ukrainian refugees unable to return to their homeland, who he helped to find new abode. He was also a teacher in the Salesian school of Valdocco (Turin) and an assistant in the Salesian Motherhouse of Valdocco to the Salesian Missionaries who came from overseas for a period of rest. =Missionary work= In 1948, with the assent of his superiors, Czmil was sent by the sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches for a 12-year period of apostolic and missionary work with Ukrainian immigrants in Argentina (Haedo and Ramos Mejia, suburbs of Buenos Aires). There the young Jorge Mario Bergoglio, later to become Pope Francis, rose early to serve Mass for him.Paul Vallely, Pope Francis: Untying the Knots, Bloomsbury, 2013 The local political authorities were not willing or ready to accept a different religious rite to the Roman Catholicism of Argentina. Czmil's health started to deteriorate: liver problems. =Italy= In 1961 Czmil became the new Director of the Ukrainian Pontifical Minor Seminary, Via Boccea 480, Rome, 00166 which by then had 110 seminarians (from all over the Western world) and approximately 10 teachers. It was under his Directorate that the school received the title of \\"Pontifical\\", mainly due to the intervention of Patriarch Josyf Slipyj, head of the Greek-Catholic Church. His position as Director of the Seminary ended in 1967 after which he took on a more spiritual role as pastor to the students. However, he also continued as a teacher, educator and confessor to the seminarians. He acted as spiritual lecturer and confessor to the Ukrainian religious communities in Rome. He was lecturer of Italian language and literature at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Rome: He supervised and edited the second volume of the Ukrainian-Italian, Italian-Ukrainian Dictionary. He was also member of the Commission for annulments of matrimony for Ukrainians in Italy, assigned to the cases of mixed marriages. In 1976 he was assigned once again to the position of director of the seminary. He was endowed in the Basilica of Saint Sophia in Rome with the title of Archimandrite on 8 December 1977, with the traditional mitre, pectoral cross and crozier. Illness Czmil's health deteriorated dramatically, and he had to be hospitalized. After a medical check-up it was decided he need an operation for gallstones. He seemed to be recovering, but on the morning of 22 January 1978 he fainted after celebrating the Divine Liturgy, and died. The funeral service was held that afternoon. Bishop Stefan Czmil, the first Ukrainian Byzantine-rite Salesian lies buried in the crypt of the Basilica of Saint Sophia in Rome. The following day it was revealed that he had been consecrated a bishop. The secret episcopal ordination took place in the Studite monastery in the town of Marino near Rome on April 2, 1977.

Boynton House (1908) was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in Rochester, New York. This privately owned prairie-style home was commissioned by widower Edward Everett Boynton and his teenage daughter Beulah Boynton. According to Beulah Boynton (recounted to Times Union reporter William Ringle in 1955) it cost her father between $45,000 - $50,000 for the house, the lot and the contents - a staggering sum in 1908. This two-story, approximately 5,500 square foot home, was originally situated on an acre lot in the city of Rochester.

T. Ham Manufacturing Co. of Rochester. Despite his financial success, Boynton's personal life was marked by tragedy. Three of his four children died at a young age, including his daughter Beulah's twin sister Bessie. On April 13, 1900 (Friday the 13th) his wife passed away. Beulah told Times Union Reporter William Ringle, \\"My father had no hobbies but me.\\" When Boynton decided to move out of his home at 44 Vick Park B in Rochester, New York he commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design what would become Rochester's only Wright-designed home. Beulah Boynton recalled, \\"I wanted Claude Bragdon to build our house. My father was quite taken with Wright.\\" Edward Boynton learned of Frank Lloyd Wright through a business partner, Warren McArthur. Wright designed the Warren McArthur House in the Kenwood District of Chicago in 1892. In 1906, Boynton commissioned the architect to design a home on an expansive piece of property on East Boulevard. Construction started in 1907 and the house was completed in 1908. Beulah Boynton was a teenager when she met Frank Lloyd Wright. She became very interested and involved in the design and construction of house. \\"I learned to read specs. I spotted an error in the masons laying the fireplace.\\" The original deed to the property was recorded on May 13, 1907 and the building permit (certificate of occupancy) was granted on May 15, 1908. \\"The building permit, #10988, lists a two story frame and plaster dwelling, 5h'~ x 115', valuation, $10,000.\\"Historic American Buildings Survey, E.E. Boynton House. Prepared by Kevin Patrick Harrington, Society for the Preservation of Landmarks in Western New York, December 6, 1966. Boynton was listed as \\"builder-owner\\" on the building permit, Frank Lloyd Wright as architect, and the contractors were Gorsline and Swan.\\" George T. Swan, son of the late George L. Swan, recalled his father saying, \\"The contractors expected trouble with Wright but discovered to their surprise and delight that reasonably amicable relations with him were possible so long as they adhered exactly to his specifications and instructions.\\" He continued, \\"He made no great trial for contractors,\\"¬ù said Swan, \\"but he gave the workmen fits.\\" I was too young to have known Mr. Wright but I heard a great deal about him from my father.¬ù Originally the Edward E. Boynton house occupied an approximately one acre lot. In addition to the 5,450 square foot residence, the property was home to a 30-foot by 60-foot reflecting pool, a tennis court, magnificent gardens and 28 American Elm trees. The driveway stretched the length of a city block - from East Boulevard to Hawthorn Street. 1908 - 1919 Boynton House Beulah and Edward Boynton lived at 16 East Boulevard for ten years. During that period, the Boyntons (one of the early automobile owners in the area) erected a garage on the property. Edward Boynton employed a cook, two maids (one for upstairs, one for downstairs), and two gardeners (one doubled as the chauffeur) during their stay. After Beulah Boynton married Ransom Noble Kalbfleisch he moved into the Boynton house joining his bride and her father. A daughter, Jean, was born in 1914. In 1919 Beulah and Jean moved to New York City with Kalbfleisch so he could work at the stock exchange.√Ç Edward Boynton joined them in New York and lived with them until his death on December 27, 1938. The house sat vacant for a year until June 1, 1919 until J. Oswald Dailey purchased it. 1919 - 1940 Turbulent times for the Boynton House The 1920s were a tumultuous time for both the country and the Boynton house. According to family members, Dailey lost all of his money and his wife's money speculating in commodity futures. In a financial bind, Dailey subdivided the property into two building lots that he sold for $22,000. The tennis court, formal gardens, pool, and fountain were removed. Two additional homes were built on the original Boynton plot, ‚Äú one on Hawthorn Street, at the back of the property, and the other on East Boulevard. (Beulah recalled during an interview with William Ringle in 1955, \\"There are now three other houses on what was the original lot. The porch was originally open, now it's glassed in.\\"Rochester Times Union, April 1955. Article by William Ringle. On April 18, 1921, the title to Wright's Boynton house was transferred to Florence C. Dailey. She failed make the loan payments and the bank took control. On October 19, 1925, Elizabeth J. Burns assumed the $18,000 mortgage held by the Rochester Trust and Safe Deposit Company. 1932 Frank Lloyd Wright returns to Rochester When he was 65 years old Frank Lloyd Wright returned to Rochester after an invitation to speak to a sold out crowd at the Memorial Art Gallery. On November 14, 1932, accompanied by Memorial Art Gallery Director Gertrude Moore, Mr. Wright drove by the Edward E. Boynton House and was enraged by the sight of the current diminished lot and external drainage pipes originating from the roof. Decades later Democrat & Chronicle reporter Katharine Seelye interviewed Gertrude Moore. Ms. Moore recounted, Wright literally ‚Äúrose in his wrath before her eyes...and in his distress banged his head on the ceiling of the cab. The driver was ordered on.\\" ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve wrapped conductor pipes around my plane spaces!‚Äù he shrieked. ‚ÄúThey have destroyed my house!\\" Still reeling from the sight of his house, Frank Lloyd Wright ranted throughout his evening lecture at the Memorial Art Gallery. ‚ÄúMr. Wright came to the platform (at the gallery) under a cloud of pessimism,‚Äù the Democrat and Chronicle reported the next day. ‚ÄúHe expressed himself as well convinced that no words of his could awaken the modern individual to the degradation of (contemporary) architecture (which was) ‚Äòpseudo this and pseudo that and never expressive of himself or his surroundings.'\\" Ms. Moore reimbursed the architect for his hotel bill and railroad fare but requested a downward adjustment to his speaking fee. Frank Lloyd Wright never returned to Rochester again. 1940 - 1968 The Boynton House's longest resident In 1940, the house was listed for $16,500, but languished on the market. By 1942, the bank assumed the mortgage once again. Arlene E. Howard purchased the house on October 7, 1943 for $8,000. She owned the house for almost 25 years. Ms. Howard painted several rooms, and some of the original Wright-designed furniture, throughout the house. Toward the end of her tenure Ms. Howard rarely visited the house and spent the majority of her time with her brother on her boat in Florida. When her housekeeper died, the house remained empty and neglected. The roof was repaired in 1967 but continued to cause problems. 1968 - 1974 Boynton House Dr. David Tinling, his wife Carolyn, and their four young children moved into the house on June 27, 1968. They purchased the Boynton House for $57,000.Interview with David Tinling, June 17, 2011 by Kim Bixler (Growing Up in a Frank Lloyd Wright House, p. 68). Dr. Tinling thought the house looked perfect. His wife Carolyn remembered the house in need of serious repairs. Incredibly, the carpets were still original and seventeen pieces of the original Frank Lloyd Wright- designed furniture remained in the house. The Tinlings pursued landmark status for the house and created legal covenants for the home's structure. In 1969, the City of Rochester passes a preservation ordinance, designating the Frank Lloyd Wright's Boynton House an official Rochester landmark. The original furniture was omitted from the protective covenants. In March 1973, University of Toronto professor H. Allen Brooks wrote to the Landmark Society of Western New York pointing out the importance of preserving the provenance of the furniture. At the same time, the Tinlings' marriage was unraveling forcing the sale of the Boynton House. Frank Lloyd Wright's Edward E. Boynton House was officially listed for sale, in 1973, for $82,500. 1974 - 1977 The public sees the Boynton House The house is enshrouded in bushes when it goes on the market, greenery flanking either side of the house above the second story roof. Louis and Joan Clark offer the Tinlings $55,000 which is rejected. Their second offer for $68,000 is accepted. The Clarks rip out and thin most of the trees and bushes surrounding the house, remove the old, dirty carpets, update the heating system, repair the plumbing, fix some electrical issues and start stripping the paint from the woodwork throughout the house. They also open up the house for fee-based tours. Over 2,000 people tour the Boynton House during the first two years the Clarks own the house.Seelye, Katharine (October 31, 1976). \\"The House That Frank Built\\". Democrat & Chronicle's Upstate Magazine, p. 10. Interested in obtaining museum status and continuing their tours, the Clarks reach out to the City of Rochester Zoning Board. The president of the neighborhood association, Dr. R. Paul Miller, writes an opinion piece for the Rochester Times Union opposing the idea. As a result of the neighborhood backlash, the constant repairs and several burglaries to the Boynton House, the Clarks decide they have had enough. They alert Rochester Times Union columnist Peter Taub that they are considering putting the house on the market. On April 29, 1977 his column appears in the paper - Wright House Up for Sale. 1977-1994 Protective covenants and complete roof replacement The Edward E. Boynton House never officially hits the real estate market. After seeing Peter Taub's column, Burt and Karen Brown deal directly with Louis and Joan Clark and end up acquiring the house in a stranger-than-fiction story recounted 40 years later in their daughter's memoir Growing Up in a Frank Lloyd Wright House. Several last minute negotiations over the house almost doom the deal between the Clarks and the Browns. The 1969 protective covenants set up by the Tinlings only pertain to the exterior structure of the house, not the 17 pieces of Wright-designed furniture. The Clarks want another $15,000-$25,000 for the furniture - on top of the $110,000 price tag for the house and the $25,000 agreed upon price for all the oriental rugs. The Browns appeal to the Landmark Society of Western New York (LSWNY) and eventually a deal is brokered where the LSWNY pays the Clarks for the furniture and then leases the Wright designed pieces back to the Browns for $1.00 a year for 75 years. According to the deal, the furniture pieces cannot be moved to the basement or attic and no alterations ( painting, reupholstering, stripping, etc.) can be made without prior approval. Insurance, repairs, and restoration costs are the responsibility of the lessee. With the real estate deal with the Clarks complete, the Browns work on a contract with the LSWNY making the protective covenants official, this time covering the original furniture. Burt and Karen Brown continue the Clarks' restorations projects - removing wallpaper and plush carpet in addition to stripping paint from the furniture, wood trim, radiator covers and Wright's builtins. The tour schedule is curtailed - limited to architect students and professors, community and charitable organizations and their daughter's girl scout troop and her fourth grade classmates. The Browns also turn their attention to replacing the roof which takes over two years to build from scratch (in hand soldered copper) and costs nearly $100,000 in 1977-1979. After 24 years working at Xerox Corporation, Burt Brown accepts a severance package and, with their two kids in college, Burt and Karen Brown move to Orlando, Florida. The house proves too costly to remain vacant on a part time basis and is put on the market, in the spring of 1993, for $895,000. The original furniture pieces are all professionally repaired by the Rochester conservator Ralph Weigandt and Mark Gervase, a Michigan based conservator from the Henry Ford Museum. After languishing on the market for months, a new realtor is hired and the house is relisted, for $460,000, in the fall of 1993. 1994-1996 Neglect and abandonment Gordon Nye, an executive for sporting goods manufacturer Voit, purchases the house in January 1994 for $425,000. Nye and his girlfriend move into the house and immediately struggle with living in Rochester (they are from California) and operating under some of the restrictive house rules. The Landmark Society of Western New York worries about their two large dogs and the safety of the original Wright-designed furniture. Nye is worried about his dogs escaping and sets about commissioning plans for a fence to enclose the property. The plans are rejected by the Landmark Society and Preservation Board. Nye applies for a construction permit and builds an unsightly chain link fence around the property as a work around. Less than a year after purchasing the house, the homeowners move back to California and leave it vacant - not paying the utilities, the security system fees and the mortgage. The dining room ceiling begins leaking and chunks of plaster begin falling from overhead. Defying the restrictive covenants (\\"pieces cannot be moved...\\"), the Landmark Society transfers all seventeen pieces to the Memorial Art Gallery where they reside from July 16, 1995 to January 12, 1996 and are put on public display. The bank begins proceedings to take over the house. 1996-2009 Rebirth and privacy Dr. Scott and Kathryn (Katie) McDonald purchase the house 'as is' in November 1996, for $260,000! The couple begin repairing and restoring and re landscaping the entire property. Scott's father, a skilled craftsman and woodworker, creates numerous pieces of craftsman style furniture for his son's new home. Instead of relishing the attention of living in the Boynton House and sharing with the public their restoration efforts, the McDonalds prefer their privacy, eschewing public tours and events. They give birth to a son and give him the middle name Wright. Although they love the Boynton House, they decide to move, putting it once more on the market, in the fall of 2009, for $830,000. 2009 to the present: surviving the next hundred years An ardent admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright and particularly of his Boynton House, Jane Parker manages to join a realtor's caravan - with a preview of new homes for sale - when she learns that this house is back in the market. After touring the house, she is ready to move in immediately. Her husband, Francis (Fran) Cosentino is skeptical whether the home is in move in condition. After purchasing it and a thorough inspection - the place has many problems - they embark on a massive project to restore and rehabilitate the 100 year old Boynton House. The roof is sagging; the exterior trim has rotted; termite and carpenter ant damage is evident throughout; in the basement essential support beams have been removed; undersized supports above the dining room are caving- in. Structurally the house is ready to collapse. They begin work in April 2010, hiring Bero Architecture and the landscape architectural firm Bayer Landscape Architecture. Establish a trust to fund the anticipated two year project and consult the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation for advice and for Wright's original architectural drawings. Parker/Cosentino decide to restore the enclosed front porch to its original design. Having been enclosed in the 1920s. They construct a new garage inspired by Wright's prairie style designs and incorporate a covered walkway on the property after noticing a pergola in several of Wright's original drawings of the site. Unable to reestablish the extent of the Boyntons original lot, since three other houses now sit on the space that had been sold off in the 1920s \\\\- they decide to remove the driveway at the front of the house and, instead of a driveway that stretches from East Boulevard to Hawthorn Street, its entrance on East Boulevard is removed and replaced with only a walkway, in place of both. Thus allowing more grass and a more spacious appearance. A lovely reflecting pool with Koi pond and an Asian inspired garden now occupy the small backyard. All of the art glass windows, doors, cabinets and light fixtures in the entire house are restored by the Wisconsin native Jeffrey Mueller,owner of Godfrey M√ºller Studios, a glass restoration company in Rochester. The still extant Wright designed furniture and all the woodwork - some of which had been painted over by previous owners and unprofessional stripped - is now meticulously refinished, repaired, and restored by Eric Norden, owner of Eric Norden Restorations, in Rochester. Several new furniture pieces are designed, in the spirit of a Wright contemporary and collaborator George Niedecken (1878-1945)- in the prairie style tradition. Darryl Gronsky, an interior designer in Rochester, with the contribution of the homeowner Jane Parker, referred to Niedecken‚Äôs designs archived in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee, Wis. to help select materials and fabrics for the renovated house. The building is now part of the East Avenue Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Legacy  Jane Parker and Fran Cosentino also consent to produce a documentary, chronicling the repair, rehabilitation and restoration of the Boynton House. Local Public Broadcasting System (PBS) WXXI in Rochester, New York, embarks on a two and a half year filming project, culminating in the nearly one hour documentary titled Frank Lloyd Wright's Boynton House: The Next Hundred Years. The documentary crew are assisted by Kim Bixler, daughter of Burt and Karen Brown who owned the Boynton House from 1977-1994. Her knowledge of the house history includes archival documents, newspaper articles, family histories, meticulous research, historical photographs and interviews with every living homeowner. Her book Growing Up in a Frank Lloyd Wright House is published in conjunction with the completion of the Boynton House project, one of the sponsorship gifts for public television sponsors and donors. Kim Bixler travels the country giving lectures about what it is really like growing up in a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

The candy has qualities similar to both caramels and taffy without being exactly either confection. The manufacturer, Tootsie Roll Industries, is based in Chicago, Illinois. It was the first penny candy to be individually wrapped in America.Manny Fernandez, \\"Let Us Now Praise the Great Men of Junk Food\\", New York Times, August 7, 2010. Beginning A patriotic advertisement for Tootsie Rolls during World War I According to the official company history, founder Leo Hirschfield (spelled Hirshfield in Tootsie Industries history) was an Austrian Jewish immigrant to the United States of America, son of an Austrian candy maker. He started his own career in the candy business at a small shop or factory located in New York City during 1896. He was employed in a senior position at the Stern & Saalberg company in Manhattan, New York, owned by Julius Stern and Jacob Saalberg, for many years. Details of his early career are disputed. The more common version has him starting a candy shop in Brooklyn that later merged with Stern & Sallberg. Another version has him starting at the factory and rising to a senior development position. The first candy that Hirschfield created was Bromangelon Jelly Powder. He completed the invention of Tootsie Rolls in 1907, after patenting a technique to give them their unique texture. He named the candy after his daughter Clara, whose nickname was \\"Tootsie\\". The first Tootsie Rolls were marketed commercially in September 1908. Hirschfeld became vice-president of the company, which changed its name to Sweets Company of America in 1917 around the time of the retirement of founders Stern and Saalberg. Hirschfield resigned or was fired in 1920, and subsequently started Mells Candy. On January 14, 1922, in his room at the Monterey Hotel in Manhattan, he shot himself to death, leaving a note saying that he was \\"sorry, but could not help it.\\" In 1935, the company was in serious difficulty. Tootsie Roll's principal supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn, concerned about the possible loss of an important customer, decided to acquire the troubled company. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubin family eventually achieved control of Tootsie Roll and agreed that Bernard Rubin would run the company as president. Under his leadership, the company was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits by changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size. Additionally, Rubin moved the company from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guided the company successfully through the difficult war years during which vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948, he had increased the sales volume twelve-fold. After Bernard Rubin's death, his brother William B. Rubin served as president until 1962, when William's daughter Ellen Rubin Gordon took control. As of August 2015, she is chairman and CEO of the company, having succeeded her late husband, Melvin Gordon, who was Chairman and CEO for many years. Tootsie Roll Industries (name adopted in 1966) is one of the largest candy manufacturers in the world. Approximately 64 million Tootsie Rolls are made daily. According to the company website, the original recipe calls for the inclusion of the previous day's batch, a graining process that continues to this day. \\"As such, there's (theoretically) a bit of Leo's very first Tootsie Roll in every one of the sixty four million Tootsie Rolls that Tootsie produces each day.\\"Welcome to Tootsie ‚Äì Tootsie Roll Product Information.

Advertisements =Tootsie Roll Hero= Captain Tootsie is an advertisement comic strip created for Tootsie Rolls in 1943 by C C Beck, Peter Costanza and Bill Schreider (1950 onwards). It featured the title character Captain Tootsie and his sidekick, a boy named Rollo (a black-haired boy), and three other young cohorts named Fatso (a red-haired boy), Fisty (a blonde boy), and Sweetie (a blonde-haired girl). It had stories in the form of full color one-page Sunday strips, black and white daily strips, and two issues of a comic book of the same title released by Toby Press. The advertisement comic was featured by many publishers and in the newspapers. Within the context of the stories, Captain Tootsie was quite strong and quicker to the punch than any of his enemies. His stories were light and \\"kid-friendly\\". Captain Tootsie's comic strip ads ended in the 1950s. In the 1970s, artist Herb Trimpe is believed to have modeled the original costume for the Marvel Comics character Doc Samson partly on Captain Tootsie's uniform.Brian Cronin (Nov 28, 2019). How Erik Larsen Has Used a Lost Hero As a Naive, Yet Compelling Contrast CBR.com, accessed 05 September 2020 In 2019, artist/writer Erik Larsen used Captain Tootsie as one of several older comic book characters in the public domain as part of his Savage Dragon series. =Jingle= The Tootsie Roll jingle, \\"Whatever It Is I Think I See\\", was recorded at Blank Tape Studios, New York in 1976. Elements of this ad can occasionally be seen today during advertised children‚Äôs programming. It aired on television regularly for more than 20 years, mostly during Saturday morning cartoon programming. The jingle was sung by a nine-year-old, Rebecca Jane Weinstein, and 13-year-old David Johnson, the children of jazz musicians and friends of the song's composer. Originally David was to sing the solo \\"Whatever it is I think I see becomes a Tootsie Roll to me\\", but his voice was changing and cracked on the high notes, so the solo was given to Rebecca.Reported by Rebecca Jane Weinstein. Rebecca still has the original reel-to-reel audio tape recording. Ingredients The current U.S. ingredients of a Tootsie Roll are: sugar, corn syrup, palm oil, condensed skim milk, cocoa, whey, soy lecithin, and artificial and natural flavors. In 2009, Tootsie Rolls became certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.Tootsie Roll Goes Kosher. Ou.org (2009-12-02). Retrieved 2012-01-03. Alternate flavors In addition to the traditional cocoa-flavored Tootsie Roll, several additional flavors have been introduced. Known as Tootsie Fruit Chews, flavors include cherry, orange, vanilla, lemon, and lime. These varieties are wrapped in red, orange, blue, yellow and green wrappers, respectively. Tootsie Frooties come in numerous different fruit flavors, including red strawberry, blue raspberry, grape, green apple, banana-berry, smooth cherry, fruit punch, pink lemonade, root beer, cranberry, blueberry, watermelon, and the newest, mango.

It was inspired by the games Caylus and Agricola and was developed in December 2007. The game was edited by Uwe Rosenberg and Hanno Girke and the former gets the main cover credit. The illustrator was Klemens Franz while the English translator was Melissa Rogerson. Numerous credits are given to others who assisted with playtesting and other tasks. The game was published by Lookout Games and distributed by Heidelberger Spieleverlag. The game was released at Spiel 2008 in both German and Australian English, with both editions published by Lookout Games. It did not do as well as its predecessor Agricola in the Fairplay polls, with a rating of 2.51 (1 is best), but has a high rating of 8.1 at BoardGameGeek (a different rating system), and is generally considered to be highly regarded by critics. The game was adapted into an iOS app by Codito Development Inc. and released on Jun 21, 2012. The game has a Metacritic rating of 82% based on 6 critic reviews.http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/le-havre-the-harbor A two player version called Le Havre: The Inland Port was released in 2012. There is also a corresponding iOS app Gameplay The gameplay takes place in the harbour of Le Havre, where players take goods such as fish and wood from the wharves. These goods are used either to feed the players' community, to construct buildings and ships, or are processed into finished goods. For example, a smokehouse building may be constructed in which players may process fish into smoked fish, which is more valuable. The game is played for a set number of rounds. The winner is the player with the greatest net wealth at the end. Points are earned by making money, building buildings and ships (which each have their own values), and selling goods. At the end of each round, players must be able to give food to their workers. The amount of food depends on the number of players; it starts out low and steadily increases to high values towards the end of the game. Players not planning ahead will soon find themselves with a shortage of food which will require taking loans from the Bank. Building ships can help with this food problem, as each ship will give the player a discount on their food each round (they count as trade routes which give the player more sources of food).

The game is based on the popular arcade game pinball. The role playing aspect of the game makes it unique from other pinball-based video games. Gameplay During the course of the \\"quest\\" mode, the player has to take on a nasty-looking witch in order to advance. The game is short, with six linear stages of gameplay. The player controls a ball-shaped character in the castle scenes and controls flippers used to shoot the pinball in the other scenes, at which time the pinball has no control over itself. In many scenes the objective is to shoot the ball into an opening or kill an enemy by striking it with the ball. Accomplishing these objectives allows the player to advance to the next stage of the game. Upgrades that add abilities to the flippers and/or ball can be purchased during castle scenes with gold earned throughout the game. The final boss is a red demon that is fought in a room of demonic symbols.

Overview In addition to the mainstream school, FCC also has two specialist units incorporated into it. These units are an Autism Resource Centre, (ARC) and a centre for students with physical disabilities (PD Centre).. History In the 1960s three schools, Tudor Grammar, De Brome (Boys Secondary Modern) School and Lafone (Girls Secondary Modern) School, were amalgamated to form Feltham Comprehensive School, known as \\"The Feltham School\\". The school ran from three sites, Upper School, Browells Lane (former Tudor Grammar site), and East and West Buildings located in Boundaries Road on the opposite side of the busy A312 Uxbridge Road. The Boundaries Road buildings were the former De Brome and Lafone sites respectively. When Feltham School opened, the former Lafone building had 12-form entry at age 11,(\\"Lower School\\") with pupils transferring to the De Brome building (\\"Middle School\\") for what were then known as the third and fourth years of secondary school (years 9 and 10 under the current year name system). In later years, prior to the move to a single site, both these buildings accommodated 11-14 year olds, i.e. present school years 7-10, with an equal number of forms in each building. During the late 1970s the school had a poor reputation. The first head teacher of Feltham School, Percy Bambury, encountered many difficulties related to the adjustment to a non- selective comprehensive system while trying to retain many of the high standards of achievement of the former Tudor Grammar, of which he had also been Head Teacher. Separate Deputy Heads for each of the individual buildings attempted to encourage pupils to aim high and \\"seize the day\\" (the English translation of the new school;'s motto, still in use today). The catchment area for the school is often described by media commentators as a tough working class suburb of London, though in reality children at the school come from a wide range of backgrounds in an area with Heathrow Airport as the principal employer, but many other service, IT and retail industries operating in the area too. The poor reputation may not have been entirely justified, however. The school achieved considerable success with musical productions and individual achievers such as Michael Collins and Wilfred Penny-Worth-Smythe. Also during this period, starting in November 1975, Deputy Head Brian Tyler (later featured in a BBC TV series about another comprehensive of which he became head) instituted what became a regular exchange programme for a number of years between students in the upper years of the school and Eton College in nearby Windsor. Feltham students stayed in the Eton College houses, went to lessons and generally entered into Eton's extra-curricular activities, while their Eton counterparts of similar age attended classes and social activities at Feltham while staying with the families of their exchanges. The appointment of Paul M. Grant as Head Teacher on the retirement of Percy Bambury in 1976 led to improvements in both discipline and standards. There was also a large investment in the school by the London Borough of Hounslow. A sixth form centre and additional facilities for pupils of 15‚Äì16 years, necessitated by the raising of the school leaving age in 1973, had led to the construction of what became known as the ROSLA block on the Browells Lane site. This was followed with the opening in 1983 of the Art, Design and Technology Building, and the construction of the first astroturf pitches in the borough. With the completion of this building, the former Lafone Girls School site (by now known as Lower West) was closed, with the exception of the separate gymnasium building. The main school building had been diagnosed with concrete cancer and was scheduled for demolition, which was completed by 1985. Through the mid to late 1980s, the school became more involved in community education, no longer restricting use of the school for those between the ages 11 to 19. This led to the school changing its name to Feltham Community School. Popular evening classes even enabled former less successful students of the school to re-take A Levels in adult life and in many cases to go on to mature age entry to higher education. The school continued working on two sites, i.e. the old De Brome (\\"Lower East\\") building and the Browells Lane (Tudor) complex, with pupils having to move between both via a purpose-built footbridge across the main road during breaks until the new Maths, Science, IT, and Library building was opened in 1985. Once open the former De Brome Boys School or East Building was closed, again with the exception of the gym. The De Brome building as a whole has however since remained in largely educational and Youth Service use, initially as a Road Safety Centre for the borough of Hounslow, and now as the Feltham campus of West Thames College, which offers mainly tertiary and technical education for the 16-19 year age group, though some provision is also now being made for younger pupils post-14 to study technical subjects here. Noteworthy. In April 1986 the new state of the art Library was officially opened as the Russell Kerr Library, by the Labour Party leader at the time, the Right Honourable Neil Kinnock. Australian-born Kerr had been the area's Labour MP for many years. A time capsule was also buried with contemporary items to be unearthed 50 years later. The final stage of development, a new sports complex, was delayed due to council cuts. This left sports and Physical Education still on three sites. In the early 1990s the new sports complex was built and completed. This finally brought the school on to one site. The former Lafone Girls School (West Building) site has since become a small housing estate, the names of which include De Brome Road, Slattery Road (after a former local councillor) and Wyatt Close. The former school gym still exists and is now used by Sportac 76, a Sports Gymnastics club which began life in the year of the Montreal Olympic games and the success of Jeff Davis, a former Tudor and Feltham pupil who was a talented gymnast. The Browells lane site stands on part of Hanworth Park, also known as Hanworth Air Park which was one of London's first aerodromes. These were once the grounds of Hanworth Palace, a former hunting lodge for King Henry VIII of England, hence the original grammar school's name of \\"Tudor Grammar\\" with the Tudor rose as its emblem. The school converted to an academy in 2011, but remained Feltham Community College, until it was renamed in 2016, as the current Springwest Academy. While named Feltham Community College, Ms Smith remained headteacher until Ms Victoria Eadie was in the post in 2010. Ms Mariella Wilson is the current headteacher of Springwest Academy.

Chief among these are the Canada Social Transfer, the Canada Health Transfer and equalization payments. The last of these can be spent however the receiving provinces see fit, while the first two are intended to support social and health services respectively. The health transfer is the largest of the three, with a combined cash and tax point value of $36.1 billion in the 2017-2018 budget. The social transfer has a cash and tax point value of $13.3 billion while the general equalization payments distributed $17.6 billion to six \\"have-not\\" provinces. While the territories do not participate in the equalization payment program (the Territorial Formula Financing program taking its place), they do participate in the health and social transfers. Total federal transfers The Canadian federal government budgeted in 2017-2018 $70.5 billion to transfer to the provinces and territories through major transfers (Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer, Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing), direct targeted support and trust funds), a $1.8 billion increase from the previous year, 2016-2017. Canada Health Transfer Unlike Equalization payments, which can be spent however the receiving provinces sees fit, the funds received as part of the Canada Health Transfer must be used by provinces and territories for the purposes of \\"maintaining the national criteria\\" for publicly provided health care in Canada as set out in the Canada Health Act. The Canada Health Transfer is made up of a cash transfer and tax transfer. In 2016-17, cash transfer payments from the federal government to the provinces and territories were $36.1 billion and tax point transfers were worth -$4.3 billion. The Canadian Health Transfer increases in line with a three-year moving average of nominal GDP growth, with funding guaranteed to increase by at least 3.0 per cent per year. While the transfer is allocated on an equal per capita basis, the cash component is not because it takes into account the value of provincial/territorial tax points. The value of a tax point represents the amount of revenue that is generated by one percentage point of a particular tax (in the case of the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer, the personal income tax or the corporate income tax). Since provinces do not have identical economies and, therefore, have unequal capacity to raise tax revenues, a tax point is worth more in a wealthy province than in a poorer province. Canada Social Transfer The Canada Social Transfer is the Canadian government's transfer payment programme in support of post-secondary education, social assistance and social services, including early childhood development and early learning and childcare. It was made independent from the Canada Health and Social Transfer programme on April 1, 2004 to allow for greater accountability and transparency for federal health funding. In the 2017/18 fiscal year, the Canada Social Transfer was projected to be $13.7 billion. The Canada Social Transfer is legislated to grow at 3.0 per cent per year. Equalization payments In Canada, the federal government makes payments to less wealthy Canadian provinces to equalize the provinces' \\"fiscal capacity\\" -- their ability to generate tax revenues. The program began in 1972.[Federal Budget companion document, 2007] In 2016-2017, six provinces will receive $17.9 billion in equalization payments from the federal government.Government of Canada budget website on equalization payments Until the 2009‚Äì2010 fiscal year, Ontario was the only province to have never received equalization payments; in 2009-2010 Ontario received 347 million dollars,CBC News article while Newfoundland, which has received payments since the program's creation, is now a so-called \\"have\\" province, and is now a net contributor and does not receive payments. Canada's territories are not included in the equalization program ‚Äì the federal government addresses territorial fiscal needs through the Territorial Formula Financing program. Equalization payments are based on a formula that calculates the difference between the per capita revenue yield that a particular province would obtain using average tax rates and the national average per capita revenue yield at average tax rates. The current formula considers five major revenue sources (see below). The objective of the program is to ensure that all provinces have access to per capita revenues equal to the potential average of all ten provinces. The formula is based solely on revenues and does not consider the cost of providing services or the expenditure need of the provinces. Equalization payments do not involve wealthy provinces making direct payments to poor provinces as the money comes from the federal treasury. As an example, a wealthy citizen in Quebec, a so-called \\"have not\\" province, pays more tax into the federal system and funds more equalization than a poorer citizen in Alberta that pays less federal tax, a so-called \\"have\\" province. However, because of Alberta's greater population and wealth, the citizens of Alberta as a whole are net contributors to equalization, while the government of New Brunswick, therefore the citizens, are net receivers of equalization payments. Equalization payments are one example of what are often collectively referred to in Canada as \\"transfer payments\\", a term used in other jurisdictions to refer to cash payments to individuals. Unlike conditional transfer payments such as the Canada Health Transfer or the Canada Social Transfer, the money the provinces receive through equalization can be spent in any way the provincial government desires. The payments are meant to guarantee \\"reasonably comparable levels\\" of health care, education, and welfare in all the provinces. The definition of \\"reasonably comparable levels\\", however, has been the subject of considerable debate. In 2016‚Äì2017, the total amount of the program was roughly 17.9 billion Canadian dollars. Traditionally, the payments have been seen as a way of promoting national unity. In addition, the ebb and flow of receiving or paying into equalization by the various provinces has moderated both recession and growth periods within individual provincial economies, which has increased long-term stability in the Canadian economy as a whole. Only a very small amount of Canadian government revenue is put into equalization; for 2009, it was slightly over 2%, at 13.6 billion out of 633.6 billion total revenue Canadian dollars.

Although violence between drug cartels had been occurring for three decades, the Mexican government held a generally passive stance regarding cartel violence through the 1980s and early 2000s. That changed on December 11, 2006, when the newly elected President Felipe Calder√≥n sent 6,500 Mexican Army soldiers to the state of Michoac√°n to end drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against the cartel violence, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican drug war between the government and the drug cartels.

Biography Plummer was born in 1848 at Mary Tavy, England. He emigrated to Canada with his parents (William Plummer and Elizabeth Williams) in 1859 and was educated at Upper Canada College. In 1867 he began work as a clerk in the Toronto branch of the Bank of Montreal. He joined the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1868 as a clerk, rising to become manager of several branches by 1878 and assistant general manager by 1903. He was the namesake of the canal- sized package freighter J. H. Plummer, built in 1903 by Armstrong Whitworth & Company Ltd. at Newcastle-on-Tyne. This 257-foot, 1,643-ton steamer was owned originally by the Canadian Lake and ocean Navigation Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the McKenzie and Mann Group.Greenwood, John O.

In 1903 Plummer acquired control of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (DISCO) from James Ross of Montreal, who in turn had purchased it from the Henry Melville Whitney syndicate of Boston, Massachusetts, in 1901. Plummer was elected president of DISCO in 1904. He acquired control of the Dominion Coal Company Ltd.(DOMCO) from Ross in 1910 and made both companies subsidiaries of the Dominion Steel Corporation (DOSCO). In 1919 Plummer negotiated the sale of DOMCO and DISCO to a syndicate of British investors led by Roy M. Wolvin of Montreal. This led to the organization in 1921 of the British Empire Steel Company (BESCO), which was succeeded in 1930 by the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation.This concerns mining and steelmaking properties were nationalized by the federal and provincial governments in 1968. James H. Plummer lived in retirement in Toronto until his death there at the age of 84 on 10 September 1932. Plummer is buried at St. James Cemetery.

Originally called Flash Lightning, the character's name was changed to Lash Lightning in issue #7 to avoid convusion with DC Comics' the Flash. Lightning Comics ended with issue #13 in June 1942. In this final issue, he was joined by a sidekick, Lightning Girl. Lash also appeared in issues #1 to 22 (Sept 1941 ‚Äì March 1946) of the Ace title Four Favorites; about halfway through this run the ‚ÄúLash‚Äù was dropped and he was simply named Lightning. Lightning Girl joined him in issue #6. Fictional biography =Ace= In 1940, explorer Robert Morgan is delving into an Egyptian pyramid when he encounters an ancient mystic called The Old Man of the Pyramids. The mystic teaches Morgan ancient secrets, and gives him the Amulet of Annihilation, on the condition that he uses his powers to fight evil. Morgan's powers include super-strength, super-speed, flight, the ability to generate electricity and radiate ‚Äúlightning heat,‚Äù and a measure of invulnerability (e.g., he can contain the explosion of a grenade with his bare hands); his powers can be recharged by electricity. Returning to the United States, Morgan dons a costume and changes his name to Lash Lightning (as opposed to maintaining a secret identity). His emblem is a triangle with a thunderbolt emerging from each of its three sides. His early foes include the Mummy, an insane college professor wrapped in bandages infused with radium, and the mad scientist Mastermind. His recurring villains also include a werewolf, the zombie-raising Dr. Diablo, and the Maestro, who wears a bee costume. Later, Lash‚Äôs friend Isobel Blake gains powers identical to his when he accidentally charges her with thousands of volts of electricity; she dons a costume similar to his and becomes his partner, Lightning Girl. The two of them are able to track each other via their ‚Äúlightning impulses.‚Äù =Project Superpowers= At some point after World War II, both Lash Lightning and Lightning Girl were imprisoned in the mystical Urn of Pandora, along with many other heroes, by the misguided Fighting Yank; decades later, the Urn was broken and the heroes released. The duo were then recruited, along with six other heroes (including Magno and Davey Captain Courageous, Mr. Raven, Soldier Unknown), and The Sword, to form a team called The Super-Mysterymen; the purpose of this team has not yet been revealed. =Living Legends= Lightning Girl is one of the sixteen heroes to have hopped sixty years into the future in the pages of the Metahuman Press serial Living Legends. She was the only one of the characters to return to college in an attempt to regain a normal life, but the return of a still-young Robert Morgan has complicated matters in the still-ongoing serial.

A historical marker on East Cemetery Hill at Gettysburg Battlefield uses the term \\"Fight\\" for the \\"Monterey Gap\\" action, Longacre uses \\"skirmish\\". All of the other references use the name \\"Monterey Pass\\". was an American Civil War military engagement beginning the evening of July 4, 1863, during the Retreat from Gettysburg. A Confederate wagon train of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, withdrew after the Battle of Gettysburg, and Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. H. Judson Kilpatrick attacked the retreating Confederate column. After a lengthy delay in which a small detachment of Maryland cavalrymen delayed Kilpatrick's division, the Union cavalrymen captured numerous Confederate prisoners and destroyed hundreds of wagons. Background General Robert E. Lee ordered his Confederate Army of Northern Virginia to begin withdrawing from Gettysburg following his army's defeat on July 3, 1863. When Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac did not counterattack by the evening of July 4, Lee realized that he could accomplish nothing more in his Gettysburg Campaign and that he had to return his battered army to Virginia. His ability to supply his army by living off the Pennsylvania countryside was now significantly reduced and the Union could easily bring up additional reinforcements as time passed, whereas he could not. Prior to the movement of the infantry and artillery, however, Lee was concerned with removing his long train of wagons, supplies, and wounded men over South Mountain and into the Cumberland Valley. He sent the majority of the wagons and ambulances under the direction of Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden over the Chambersburg Pike, which passed through Cashtown in the direction of Chambersburg and Hagerstown, Maryland.Coddington, pp. 536-38; Wittenberg et al., pp. 1-6. While Imboden's wagons moved northwest, Lee designated a shorter route for his three corps: southwest through Fairfield and over Monterey Pass to Hagerstown. After dark on July 4, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps headed out onto the Fairfield Road, followed by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps and Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps. Lee accompanied Hill at the head of the column. Departing in the dark, Lee had the advantage of getting several hours head start and the route from the west side of the battlefield to Williamsport was about half as long as the ones available to the Army of the Potomac.Coddington, pp. 537-39; Gottfried, pp. 278-80; Wittenberg et al., pp. 5, 39. However, the first traffic on the Fairfield Road had begun on the evening of July 3, when Ewell, concerned about the logistical challenges of the impending retreat, sent his corps trains and herds of captured cattle ahead of his main body. He divided his wagons into three columns. The first used the Cashtown Gap, the second the Fairfield Gap, and the third the Monterey Pass. The wagons headed for Monterey Pass followed the route of Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division, which was moving to the rear as escorts for the Union prisoners of war from the battle.Wittenberg et al., pp. 49-50. Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick Early on July 4 Meade sent his cavalry to strike the enemy's rear and lines of communication so as to \\"harass and annoy him as much as possible in his retreat.\\" Eight cavalry brigades took to the field. Col. J. Irvin Gregg's brigade moved toward Cashtown via Hunterstown and the Mummasburg Road, but all of the others moved south of Gettysburg. Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry division joined up with the brigade of Col. Pennock Huey at Emmitsburg, Maryland, and they were ordered to locate and destroy \\"a heavy train of wagons\\" that had been spotted by a Union signal station. Assuming that Ewell's corps wagon train was actually the main supply trains for Lee's army, Kilpatrick moved out aggressively at 10 a.m. on July 4, proceeding west on the Waynesboro-Emmitsburg Turnpike toward the village of Fountain Dale (just east of present-day Blue Ridge Summit on Pennsylvania Route 16) and Monterey Pass.Brown, pp. 124, 130; Wittenberg et al., pp. 52-54; Gottfried, p. 278; Coddington, p. 543. William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart understood the importance of securing the mountain passes and he assigned the primary responsibility to the cavalry brigades of Brig. Gens. Beverly H. Robertson and William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones. Recognizing the vulnerability of Ewell's immense wagon train in the narrow Monterey Pass, Jones asked permission from Stuart to use his entire brigade to defend it. Stuart allowed the 6th and 7th Virginia Cavalry regiments and a battery of horse artillery under Capt. Roger Preston Chew to be assigned. The 7th Virginia was soon recalled, replaced by the 4th North Carolina Cavalry of Robertson's Brigade.Wittenberg et al., pp. 50-52; Brown, p. 127. Engagement in the Pass Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, a brigade commander under Kilpatrick, received intelligence from a local civilian that the rear of Ewell's wagon train was approaching a large summer resort hotel named Monterey Springs, which sat atop the Pass. Despite being warned of a Confederate artillery placement ahead, Kilpatrick ordered his entire force to advance. A single 12-pounder Napoleon of Courtney's Battery fired a shot at the Union horsemen, but the gunners withdrew before they could be attacked.Wittenberg et al., pp. 54-58; Brown, p. 131. The remaining Confederate force on the road up the hill to the Pass consisted of a detachment of 20 dismounted cavalrymen under Capt. George M. Emack from the 1st Maryland Cavalry Battalion, along with a single cannon. As Union troopers from the 5th Michigan Cavalry approached Emack's men, the cannon opened fire and eight of the Marylanders conducted a mounted charge into the head of the Union column. In the dark and the heavy rain, the Union cavalrymen were taken by surprise and many of them retreated in panic. The Confederate cavalrymen dismounted and took up positions on both sides of the road. When the Federals returned, Emack's men waited patiently until they were about 10 yards away and opened fire. The Union cavalrymen were convinced they were opposed by a much larger force. While this standoff continued, Ewell's wagons were moving as swiftly as possible to get out of range of the Union cavalry threat.Wittenberg et al., pp. 59-60; Brown, pp. 124, 130-32. Fight at Monterey Pass By the time Grumble Jones was able to make his way to the scene through the crowded roads, the small Maryland detachment had been driven back several hundred yards, almost to the road junction being used by the wagon train. By this time less than one half of the train had made it safely through the Pass. Jones promised reinforcements from the 6th Virginia Cavalry and Emack ordered his men to hold their ground and conserve their ammunition. Meanwhile, elements of Jones's cavalry attacked Huey's brigade in the rear of Kilpatrick's column.Brown, pp. 133-34; Wittenberg et al., pp. 60-61. Kilpatrick brought forward two guns of horse artillery from Lt. Alexander C. M. Pennington's Battery M, 2nd U.S. Artillery, supported by men of the 1st Ohio Cavalry. South of the hotel, a bridge on the road had not been destroyed by the Confederates and Col. Russell A. Alger of the 5th Michigan Cavalry requested reinforcements to make a mounted charge across the bridge. Kilpatrick ordered Custer to make the attack with his full Michigan Brigade. The advance of the 5th and 6th Michigan Cavalry regiments was slowed by the darkness, difficult terrain, and dense undergrowth. The tiny group of Marylanders, supported by a few cavalrymen from the 4th North Carolina of Robertson's Brigade, had delayed the Union advance for nearly five hours.Wittenberg et al., pp. 62-64. At about 3 a.m. on July 5, as the Michigan Brigade continued to move slowly forward, Kilpatrick sent in the 1st West Virginia Cavalry under Major Charles E. Capehart. Capehart's 640 officers and men charged what they imagined to be \\"five times\\" their numbers. In hand-to-hand fighting with sabers and revolvers, they seized the Confederate cannon and Capehart was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallant service. The road was open to attack the wagon train.Brown, pp. 135-37; Wittenberg et al., pp. 64-66. Attacking the wagon train The Union cavalrymen crashed into the column of now lightly protected wagons. Custer, in his enthusiasm for the charge, was thrown from his horse and nearly captured. Grumble Jones also narrowly avoided capture. Pennington's artillery began shelling the wagons toward the rear of the column, splintering carriages and blocking any opportunity for retreat. The Union and Confederate cavalrymen became thoroughly mixed up among the wagons and the enemies were unable to differentiate themselves in the darkness. Several friendly fire incidents occurred as Union troopers accidentally fired on their own lines.Wittenberg et al., pp. 66-69. Union troopers rode all the way through the wagon train until they reached Ewell's infantry and captured large numbers of prisoners before returning to repeat the effort. They erected hasty barricades in front of the wagon train to protect what they had captured. More than 1,300 Confederates-- primarily wounded men in ambulances, but also slaves, free blacks, and some cavalrymen--were captured and most of the wagons were destroyed. Many of the mules survived and were turned over to the Cavalry Corps quartermaster. Kilpatrick later reported that he had destroyed Ewell's entire wagon train, although he had in fact encountered only a fraction of the full, 40-mile long train. The Confederates lost about 250 wagons and ambulances with casualties from Iverson's and Daniel's Brigades and of three artillery battalions, as well as 37 wagons from Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division quartermaster trains.Huntington, pp. 131-33; Wittenberg et al., 49-74; Sears, pp. 480-81; Brown, pp. 142, 144, 184; Coddington, p. 548; Gottfried, pp. 278-81; Longacre, pp. 249-50. The number of wagons captured is disputed. Brown reports that local residents cited \\"400 or 500\\". Longacre cites sources for 40 (Stuart) and 150 (Union Col. Pennock Huey). Huntington cites 300. Aftermath Following the fight at Monterrey, Kirkpatrick's division reached Smithsburg around 2 p.m. on July 5. Stuart arrived from over South Mountain with the brigades of Chambliss and Ferguson. A horse artillery duel ensued, causing some damage to the small town. Kilpatrick withdrew at dark \\"to save my prisoners, animals, and wagons\\" and arrived at Boonsboro (spelled Boonsborough at that time) before midnight.Wittenberg et al., pp. 81-86. Lee's retreat continued to the Potomac, as minor combat operations--primarily cavalry actions--occurred at Hagerstown (July 6 and 12), Boonsboro (July 8), Funkstown (July 7 and 10), and around Williamsport and Falling Waters (July 6-14). At the Potomac, the Confederates found that rising waters and destroyed pontoon bridges prevented their immediate crossing. Erecting substantial defensive works, they awaited the arrival of the Union army, which had been pursuing over longer roads more to the south of Lee's route. Before Meade could perform adequate reconnaissance and attack the Confederate fortifications, Lee's army escaped across fords and a hastily rebuilt bridge.Coddington, pp. 550-74.

A team led by Frank Rieg at the University of Bayreuth started development in 1985 and now the software is used by several universities, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. Z88 is capable of calculating two and three dimensional element types with a linear approach. The software package contains several solvers and two post-processors and is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Unix/Linux computers in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Benchmark tests conducted in 2007 showed a performance on par with commercial software.  History and functionalities  = Overview = The software was developed by Frank Rieg, a professor for engineering design and CAD at the University of Bayreuth. Originally written in FORTRAN 77, the program was ported to the programming language C in the early 1990s. There are two programs for finite element analysis: * Z88OS (current version 15.0) is available as free software including the source code under the GNU General Public License. Due to the modular structure of the program and the open availability of the source code it is possible to develop customized extensions and add-ons and several special case 2D and 3D continuum elements (e.g. anisotropic shell element) were developed by users. * Z88Aurora (current version 4.0) originally described the user interface of the Z88 finite element analysis program. After several additions and further development it now comprises a significantly larger range of functionalities than Z88OS. Z88Aurora is freeware, however the source code is not publicly available. Since 2014 two Android Apps are also available: * Z88Tina is a freeware FEA program for Android smartphones and tablets. Using Z88Tina it is not only possible to compute trusses and beams, but also continuum elements like plane stress elements, plates and tori. * Z88Mobile is free, like all Z88 products. This app offers two different modes (basic and advanced) and has a touch interface. The product family is supported by a software for topology optimization since 2016: * Z88Arion is a free program for topology optimization and provides three separate algorithms for computation (OC: Optimality Criteria, SKO: Soft Kill Option, TOSS: Topology Optimization for Stiffness and Stress). = Functionalities of Z88Aurora = Z88Aurora's current version contains several computation modules: * In the case of linear static analyses it is assumed that the result is proportional to the applied forces. * Nonlinear analyses are used for nonlinear geometries and nonlinear materials. * Using thermal and thermomechanical analyses it is possible to not only compute results about temperature or heat currents, but also thermomechanical displacements and stresses. * By utilizing natural frequency simulation natural frequencies and the resulting oscillations can be determined. * A contact module makes it possible to simulate interacting parts and assemblies. An integrated part management tool enables an effective handling of assemblies. There are options to simulate a glued connection or a friction-free connection and the contact discretization (type of contact: node-surface-, or surface-surface-contact), the mathematical imposition method (lagrange method, perturbed lagrange method or penalty method) and the direction of contact stiffness (normal or tangential direction) can be changed via the contact settings. This module only supports tetrahedrons and hexahedrons with linear or quadratic shape functions. Additionally the module is only available for linear mechanical strength analyses. Regardless of what module was selected the finite element analysis using Z88Aurora can be divided into three areas: pre-processor, solver (processor) and post-processor. The pre-processor builds the FE model. It is possible to either build the structure directly inside the software by using Z88Aurora's tools and using structural elemtents such as trusses and beams or a model can be imported from several file formats. Geometries can be imported from STEP files (*.STP), STL files in ASCII or binary format (*.STL) or Autocad files (*.DXF), while FE structure data can be imported from NASTRAN files (*.NAS), ABAQUS files (*.INP), ANSYS files (*.ANS) or COSMOS files (*.COS). Z88Aurora contains a total of 25 different element types, including 2D elements (truss, beam, plane stress elements, shaft elements, torus elements) and 3D elements (truss, beam, linear and quadratic tetrahedrons and hexahedrons). Two open source meshers (TetGen, by Dr. Hang Si (WIAS Berlin) and NETGEN, by Prof. Joachim Sch√∂berl (TU Wien)) generate tetrahedron meshes. A tetrahedrons refiner for existing tetrahedrons meshes (linear and quadratic), a mapped mesher for superelement structures (hexahedrons, shells, etc.), a shell thickener that creates column shells from 2D shell elements and a trimming function serve to refine the model. The set management enables an easy selection of surfaces, nodes and elements to apply boundary conditions, define materials, etc. The material database contains 52 pre-defined materials and is editable and can be extended easily. Various boundary conditions such as forces, displacements, pressure and thermal conditions can be applied using the graphical user interface. The solver computes displacements, stresses, temperatures and nodal forces depending on the selected computation module. Four numerical solvers are available for the linear finite element analysis: * A direkt Cholesky solver with so-called Jennings storage, that is useful (because fast) for small and medium structures made up of trusses and beams, * a direct multi-CPU sparse matrix solver for medium structures and * two differently preconditioned iterative solvers using sparse matrix storage for large FE structures. Stationary thermal or thermomechanical calculations use the iterative solvers or the direct multicore solver. Nonlinear calculations are done by applying a special iterative solver. The natural frequency simulation uses the Lanczos procedure. The results are visualized using the post-processor. It is possible to filter results or clip the part to view only the relevant sections. Specific results can be exported to text or CSV format and the analysis function permits the display of results pertaining to a single node. Moreover, the deformed structure can be used in other applications by exporting it to an STL file. The software comes with a Windows user interface with context- sensitive online help. Handbooks are available, demonstrating the use of Z88 and Z88Aurora, using examples. The Freeware is available for Windows, Linux and OS X. = Functionalities of Z88Arion = Topology optimization is done by optimizing an existing structure towards a given target function by changing its topology class within a pre- defined space. By removing material in suitable places an optimal structure is created. The goal of topology optimization is the automatic creation of an optimal structure under defined applied forces and boundary conditions within the virtual product development process. A draft model provides the basis. Displacements, stresses and natural frequencies and oscillations are computed via a structural analysis and will be taken into consideration by the optimization process. It is at this point that the exact model and design variables for the optimization process are defined. Not only the target function but also the boundary conditions and restrictions are defined here. The optimization problem is solved by an algorithm that iterates variations of the design variables. The result is an improved draft model, that goes through the same process until an optimal draft, the so-called design suggestion is achieved. Depending on the goal of the topology optimization two different methods can be chosen: * Optimality Criteria (OC) * Soft Kill Option (SKO) * Topology Optimization for Stiffness and Stress (TOSS) The OC method produces a design suggestion that features maximal stiffness in relation to a previously defined relative volume. The SKO process optimizes for maximum strength. The TOSS algorithm was specially developed by the development team at the University of Bayreuth and can be understood as an advancement of the OC method. It is a hybrid process of OC and a so-called SKO method (Soft Kill Option) and uses the optimal stiff structure resulting from the OC method and uses it as a basis to create a stress-optimized design suggestion. To do so material is added in overstressed areas and removed in understressed areas. The determined design proposal is displayed in the postprocessor. For example, the user can look at different iterations and vary presentation limits. In addition, since Z88Arion V2, it is possible to smooth the resulting structure and export it as STL to ensure direct reuse of the optimized part in other programs. There is also a direct interface to Z88Aurora.  Application  = Application in teaching and research = Z88 has been used to educate engineering students at the University of Bayreuth since 1998. The possibility of manual creation of the structure and the application of boundary conditions enables a simple visualization of the function of FEM software. Due to the open file sources the software can be used for research purposes in FE areas and can be modified to suit individualized needs. Among others, Z88 is used for research and teaching at the University Ravensburg-Weingarten,Use at the University Ravensburg-Weingarten, Fakulty for mechanical engineering, lecture Finite Elements, under Edmund B√∂hm.

Finite Elemente Analyse for Ingenieure: Eine leicht verst√§ndliche Einf√ºhrung has sold over 6000 copies. This textbook is designed for entry-level users of finite element analysis and useas Z88 to let the user follow the examples shown in the book on his own system. The book Maschinenelemente - Funktion, Gestaltung und Berechnung by Decker (19th edition) uses practical applications with Z88 to teach the calculation of machine elements with finite element analysis. = Application in the industry = Due to the Open Source approach many applications use the Z88 solver, its plot output, etc. Among other things Z88 has been adapted into a program to calculate point concentrated and linear loads on glass panes in building construction. Routines have been implemented to determine the Young's modulus and flexural strength of wood and a sub- application has been developed to calculate pressure vessels. Examples of companies using Z88 are * Boeing: Missile Defense Systems (USA), * Teledyne Brown Engineering (USA), * Winimac Coil Spring Inc. (USA), * Double D Design Ltd. (New Zealand), * RINGSPANN GmbH (Germany), * KTR Kupplungstechnik GmbH (Germany) und * Neuson Hydrotec GmbH (Austria). The availability of the source code and thus the transparency of applied algorithms and material models make Z88 ideal as a reference software for commercial tools such as NASTRAN and ABAQUS.

Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303 (1998), was the first case in which the Supreme Court issued a ruling with regard to the highly controversial matter of polygraph, or \\"lie-detector,\\" testing. At issue was whether the per se exclusion of polygraph evidence offered by the accused in a military court violates the Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. Opinion of the Court The Court ruled that Military Rule of Evidence 707, which makes polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial proceedings, does not unconstitutionally abridge the right of accused members of the military to present a defense.https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/polygraph/scheffer.html Significance The United States v. Scheffer ruling came, as legal writer Joan Biskupic noted in the Washington Post, \\"at a time when polygraph machines are increasingly being used outside the courtroom\\" -- and inside as well. Prosecutors were using polygraph results \\"to extract confessions from suspects,\\" Biskupic observed, and defense lawyers were using \\"them for leverage in plea bargains\\"; likewise polygraph tests were being subjected to greater and greater use in the workplace. Employers were using them to test job applicants with regard to past wrongdoing, and to monitor present jobholders as well (although this practice was mostly outlawed in 1988 by the Employee Polygraph Protection Act).

The Academy currently offers 3-year bachelor and 2-year MA programmes. The \\"Norwegian National Academy of the Arts\\" is still referred to simply as Kunstakademiet or the Art Academy amongst both Staff and students. Oslo National Academy of the Arts at Gr√ºnerl√∏kka History The Art Academy was formerly National Academy of Art (Statens Kunstakademi), an autonomous art academy formed in 1909. The noted Norwegian painter Christian Krogh was one of three professors at the Academy of Art when it was established. The staff additionally included painter Halfdan Str√∏m and the sculptor Gunnar Utsond (1864‚Äì1950).Gunnar Utsond (Store norske leksikon) The Academy was initially organized along the lines of the old master studios. The Academy moved to better premises in the Merchant Building on Drammensveien in central Oslo during 1919 and special drawing office at the rear of the Kunstnernes Hus in 1930. In 1935, the Danish painter and architect Georg Jacobsen came to the Academy. From 1935 to 1940, he worked in an extraordinary professorship in art construction and composition teaching. In 1941, the collaborationist Quisling regime called for new arrangements of the academy and added painter and Nasjonal Samling party member S√∏ren Onsager as a professor. In the mid-1990s the academy merged with the formerly independent Design, Craft, Stage Arts, and Opera academies to form the Oslo National Academy of Art (Kunsth√∏gskole i Oslo), the nation's largest arts college. The former Kunstakademiet then became the Faculty of Visual Arts within the KhiO administration organisation. In August 2010 all the schools physically merged into a new building in a former sail factory in Gr√ºnerl√∏kka on the east side of Oslo. Forming one of the largest art academies in Europe.

MA Choreography Two-year course (120 credits) The master‚Äôs programme in choreography is intended to train choreographers to be able to work at the highest national and international level on established stages and in the field of free dramatic art. Creative work involving dance and staging are the students‚Äô main concerns, and all the subjects on the curriculum reinforce this. Production of pieces the students have choreographed themselves and a thesis make up approximately one third of the course. The course also comprises musical and administrative subjects, as well as various arts and social subjects, including philosophy and aesthetics, which form the basis for work on the students‚Äô own artistic development. The course will enable students to develop an independent artistic style as a choreographer, and carry out choreographic work as part of other artistic productions. Students will become familiar with various choreographic working methods and styles. Collaboration with other specialist groups within dramatic art provides students with experience of the collective process which creates a production. Knowledge of staging effects is an important element of the course. Practical educational dance programme One-year full-time course (60 credits) The practical educational dance programme (PPU) is funded through the Ministry of Education and Research‚Äôs Outline plan for practical educational programmes. Applicants must have completed academic or vocational studies and have professional experience. The programme comprises educational science (30 credits), teaching theory (30 credits) and 12‚Äì14 weeks‚Äô practical training. Instruction takes the form of meetings, with three meetings in each semester. The practical training is organised both as ‚Äòon-the-spot‚Äô practice and as ongoing practical training. PPU qualifies students to work as a single- subject teacher at intermediate and secondary level in the compulsory school system, and in upper-secondary schools and adult education. The PPU in dance also aims to equip students to teach dance to pre-school children and in the voluntary sector, e.g. in schools of performing arts and private ballet schools, and to work as college teachers. The PPU in dance also provides the necessary skills to rehearse professional dancers in cultural institutions.

It was performed in December 1908 on the stage of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise, in Paris. The comedy raised a big scandal because in it Mirbeau denounces the Catholic charity-business and broaches a new taboo subject : the economic and sexual exploitation of young girls in \\"charitable\\" homes. In order to see his play performed as intended, he brought a suit against Jules Claretie and the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. He won his trial and the comedy could at last be performed.

Tais-toi !‚Ä¶ Tais-toi !‚Ä¶ The main character, Baron Courtin, is a conservative senator and a respectable Academician, who founded works of charity. But he has embezzled money from the \\"charitable\\" Foyer (Home) over which he presides : he risks all at once ruin, dishonor, and prison. But he escapes punishment. First, thanks to the former lover of his wife Th√©r√®se, the old financier Biron, who is cynical yet still in love, and to whom he forces the baroness to go and beg for his help, while she has given him up for young d'Auberval: Biron accepts paying for Courtin, but he means to recover the money by exploiting even more fiercely the work of the little girls of the Foyer. Then, thanks to an agreement made with the republican government : the government lets bygones be bygones in exchange for his silence in an important debate in the Parliament. On board Biron's cruise boat, Courtin will be able to polish at leisure his speech on the price of virtue, in the company of the two lovers of his wife, the former and the new one...

The Philipsburg-Osceola Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.Pennsylvania Academic Standards Wellness policy Philipsburg-Osceola Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The Superintendent annually reports to the Board on the district‚Äôs compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 This includes classroom party guidelines from the Pennsylvania Department of Education.Classroom party foods guidelines The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the wellness policy for approval. Special education In December 2010, the district reported that 326 students or 16% received special education services. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 279 pupils or 14% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.School District Special Education Data Report LEA Performance on State Performance Plan (SPP) Targets School Year 2008-2009 The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Director of Student Services. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district‚Äôs students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student‚Äôs needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Philipsburg-Osceola School District received a $1,229,110 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2012‚Äì13 and 2011-12 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that fewer than 10 students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student‚Äôs building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. StAR Team In accordance with Pennsylvania Act 211, the Students At Risk (StAR) team consists of faculty members who have been specially trained to assist students with drug, alcohol or emotional problems. A student becomes involved in StAR when an individual (friend, parent, teacher...etc.) who is concerned about the welfare of the student makes his or her concern known to the StAR team.

In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Philipsburg Osceola Area School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Philipsburg Osceola Area School Board set property tax rates for 2012 at 51.5600 mills for residents in Centre County and 115.500 mills for residents in Clearfield County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2011-12 - 117.7100 mills for residents in Clearfield County and 51.6100 mills for residents in Centre County *2010-11 - 117.2900 mills for residents in Clearfield County and 52.9600 mills for those in Centre County. *2009-10 - 115.2400 mills for residents in Clearfield County and 50.9000 mills for those in Centre County. *2008-09 - 109.6800 mills for residents in Clearfield County and 49.0380 mills for those in Centre County. *2007-08 - 101.4570 mills for residents in Clearfield County and 46.9742 mills for those in Centre County. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 The average yearly property tax paid by Clearfield County residents amounts to about 2.83% of their yearly income. Clearfield County ranked 707th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. Center County residents pay 3.34% of their yearly income in property taxes which ranked 438th in the USA.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Philipsburg Osceola Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Philipsburg Osceola Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Philipsburg-Osceola Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index for the budget year 2010-2011. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief of $348 was provided for approved residents of Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District. The greatest tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Centre County, 72% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Clearfield COunty 70% of property owners applied.Auditor General Jack Wagner: Potentially Hundreds of Thousands Of Pennsylvanians Missing Out on Property Tax Relief from Slots Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The school offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility to participate is determined by the school board. An eligibility check is made each week by the Athletic Director for students participating in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics.

Curriculum The school has a structural curriculum mandated by the French Ministry of Education and an English curriculum developed using guidelines from the National Council of Teachers of English and the State of Illinois. The program conforms to the French system. It is broken down into subdivisions that roughly correspond to those in the American school system: pre- kindergarten, junior kindergarten and kindergarten, elementary school (1st through 5th grades), middle school (6 through 9th grades), and high school (10th through 12th grades). The program from pre-K through 5th grade is divided into cycles: cycle 1 (pre-kindergarten, junior kindergarten and kindergarten), cycle 2 (1st and 2nd grade) and cycle 3 (3rd through 5th grade). left Middle school (coll√®ge) comprises grade 6 through 9. Instruction is structured according to subjects: French, English, mathematics, history, geography, civics, biology, technology, art, music and physical education. Beginning in grade 7 students also study physics and Latin. Starting in fourth grade, students learn a third language, either Mandarin, Spanish, or German. As part of the language curriculum, each language class does a cultural exchange for two weeks with another French school in the country they are studying. In high school, they are also given the opportunity to do a three- month study abroad trip. Middle school also offers the OIB curriculum which is the International Baccalaureate Option, which focuses in addition to French history and literature on American and world history and literature. Grades 10, 11 and 12 define high school in the French system and those 3 years are known as lyc√©e. During the lyc√©e years students choose a track with emphasis on different courses: track L (literature), ES (economics and social sciences) or S (sciences), which, as the French Department of Education reforms its curriculum, is set to change in 2021. The lyc√©e years, as well as the curriculum as a whole, prepare the students for the French general Baccalaureate examination and the international option of the French Baccalaureate. With the Baccalaureate degree, students of the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Chicago can enter selective American or European schools, colleges, or universities. The Lycee also offers the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme and Diploma Programme for English-speaking high school students.

History and description The church is dedicated to St Winwaloe and is Church of England. St Winwaloe was the third son of a Cornish couple who moved to Brittany. There he founded the monastery of Land√©vennec. There is no evidence that he visited Cornwall, and the church may have been founded by one of the monks from Land√©vennec, or perhaps by St Winwaloe's elder brother, Wennac. Nothing remains of the original building. The oldest part of the current church building is the twelfth century Norman doorway. The substantial tower is constructed of blocks of granite and serpentine giving it a chequer-board appearance. Other notable features are the serpentine pulpit and the font, which dates to the fifteenth century. The church was restored in the thirteenth century when the porch was added and in the fifteenth century when a new window was inserted into the tower. It is now a Grade I listed building.

Timeline * April 1, 2008: British environmentalist Murray Watson and his Kenyan colleague Patrick Amukhuma, employees of an Indian company under contract with the UN, were seized by unknown gunmen while conducting a survey in southern Somalia's conflict zones. Their driver, translator and two guards were not taken. Watson and Amukhuma have not been seen or heard from since. Their kidnappers' demands ranged from $2 million to $4 million in exchange for the men's release. * August 23, 2008: Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout, Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan and Somali photojournalist Abdifatah Mohamed Elmi were seized near Mogadishu along with two Somali drivers. Abdifatah and the two drivers were released on January 15, 2009. Lindhout and Brennan were released 15 months later on November 25, 2009 after a $600,000 ransom was paid. The abductors were teenage insurgents from the Hizbul Islam fundamentalist group. * July 14, 2009: Gunmen kidnapped two French security consultants working for the government from the Sahafi hotel in Mogadishu. The men were subsequently taken by Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam militants following a skirmish. Both men were then split up between Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam. One of the hostages, Marc Aubriere, escaped from his kidnappers while they slept on August 26, 2009. The other hostage, Denis Allex, was killed in a botched rescue attempt on January 11, 2013. * October 23, 2009: A British couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler, was kidnapped from their 38 ft sailing boat off the archipelago of the Seychelles during the night. The distress signal was sent out at 22h00. Naval forces and Search & Rescue centres did not swing into full action until the story broke on 27 October and pirates informed the media that the couple was in their hands. The yacht S/Y Lynn Rival was found the next day by naval forces, abandoned off the Central Somali Coast. The two hostages had been first taken onto a previously hijacked merchant ship, the MV Kota Wajar, and then onto land near Ceel Huur, north of Harardhere. The couple were released on 14 November 2010, after a reported ¬£600,000 ransom was paid. *September 11, 2011: Gunmen stormed a bungalow on Kiwayu island, Kenya, shot British publishing executive David Tebbutt dead, and took his wife Judith hostage to a hideout in Somalia. Police suspect that militants with the Al-Shabaab Islamist group were responsible. On March 21, 2012, Judith Tebbutt's captors released her after her family reportedly paid a ransom. *October 1, 2011: Frenchwoman Marie Dedieu was kidnapped from Kenya's Manda Island and taken to Somalia. Police suspect Al-Shabaab gunmen were responsible. Dedieu, who was paraplegic, died later in the month. *October 13, 2011: Two Spanish aid workers employed by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res were kidnapped from the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya and taken to Somalia. Their Kenyan driver was wounded but was not abducted. Police suspect Al-Shabaab militants are behind the abductions.

The militants bombed the camp, killed six people and wounded three others, and stole firearms, ammunition and a vehicle from the post. They also abducted between three individuals. According to local media reports, the insurgents later paraded the hostages in the southern Somali town of Bardhere (BardherBardere).

Early life Thomas Laycock was the son of Thomas (1756‚Äì1809) and Hannah Laycock (n√©e Pearson, 1758‚Äì1831). Whilst the details of his birth are unknown, it is known that he was baptised in London, and arrived in Sydney as a nine-year-old with his mother on 21 September 1791 aboard , as part of the Third Fleet. His father, Thomas, had been a quartermaster in the New South Wales Corps, who had also arrived in Sydney aboard HMS Gorgon. He soon entered service with the New South Wales Corps, and had been commissioned as ensign on 30 December 1795. A natural soldier, he rose to lieutenant by 1802. After service in both Sydney and Norfolk Island, Laycock was sent to Port Dalrymple, Van Diemen's Land to serve under Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp in 1806. Van Diemen's Land Arriving in Van Diemen's Land in 1806, Laycock found the northern settlement of Port Dalrymple to be stricken with famine. He was immediately entrusted with a mission to convey dispatches for Lieutenant-Governor David Collins in Hobart Town. No journey into the interior of the island had yet been attempted. Laycock set out on horseback, on 3 February 1807 with four other men from the New South Wales Corps, carrying three weeks provisions each. They followed the course of the Tamar River south towards the mountains visible in the distance. Climbing into the Central Highlands, the party soon discovered the Lakes district there. They found the going tough over the rugged alpine terrain, but once they had hit the flat ridge line, the party was able to observe much kinder terrain in the distance off to the east. Descending the southern slopes of the Central Highlands, the party came upon the Clyde River, which they named \\"Fat Doe River\\", and camped at a location that was later to become the township of Bothwell. The terrain around this region was much more amenable to travel, and Laycock noted the location for his return journey. They had managed to traverse the islands in just over eight days, arriving on 11 February. They arrived in Hobart Town and issued Collins with the dispatches, but were regrettably told, the situation in Hobart Town was no better than at Port Dalrymple, and no supplies could be spared for the northern colony. Exhausted from the southward journey, Laycock's party rested in Hobart Town for four days, before commencing their return journey. Following a more easterly route on their northward journey, the party found the going much easier, riding up through the Midlands that was to become the major pastures and farmland of the colony in the following decade. The route that they followed quickly became the 'Hobart Road', the main route between Port Dalrymple (soon after renamed Launceston, Tasmania) and Hobart Town. With minor variations, the route is also closely followed by the modern Midland Highway which is the major north-south artery of Tasmania, and forms part of the national highway number 1. Despite the famine, Laycock was rewarded for important his discovery by being given a cow, which of course was highly valuable given the short supply of food. He returned to Sydney in January 1808. Rum Rebellion Upon his return to Sydney, Laycock discovered that the Rum Rebellion was in full-swing, and the New South Wales Corps, under the leadership of Major George Johnston, and former soldier turned pastoralist John Macarthur had enacted a military coup and had arrested Governor William Bligh. Laycock was appointed to the criminal court that tried Macarthur for his involvement in the plot, and in so doing, he became the only physical casualty of the bloodless rebellion, when he was sent to search Government House for evidence, and fell through a manhole. As a reward for his duties and his discoveries in Van Diemen's Land, Laycock was granted of land in the Cabramatta region of southwestern Sydney, but like all officers involved in the Rum Rebellion, he had this land confiscated upon the appointment of the next Governor, Lachlan Macquarie. On 1 June 1809 he married Isabella Bunker, daughter of Eber Bunker. Following Macquarie's arrival, the newly married Laycock departed from New South Wales with wife Isabella, aboard HMS Dromedary on 18 March 1810, sailing for England. War of 1812 The New South Wales Corps were disbanded in disgrace following their part in the rebellion, and most of the men transferred into a newly formed 102nd Regiment of foot, and were recalled to England. Laycock also returned to England for the first time since he was a boy, but rejoined with the 98th Regiment of foot. By September 1811 he had been promoted to captain. The following year, war with the United States broke out in North America, and the 98th foot were dispatched to fight there. For the majority of the war, Laycock's regiment were stationed in Bermuda and New Brunswick, although companies did also garrison parts of the Atlantic coast from 1814 to 1818. Little is known about Laycock's experiences in the war, but he returned to England, selling off his commission upon his return. Later life and death Thomas Laycock and wife Isabella sailed immediately for Sydney aboard Fame with their two children, leaving on 8 March 1817, but Isabella took ill during the journey, and died on 12 May 1817. With two young children to look after, Laycock quickly remarried his second wife, Margaret (n√©e Connell) at St. Philips on 8 July 1817, with whom he had a further two children. Using the money he had saved from his service and sale of commission, he set up a general store and hotel, and quickly became one of the biggest suppliers of meat to the commissariat store. By 1819 he had become involved in local affairs, and was one of the leading citizens is a public call for the right to trial by jury. Years of life in the military took their toll upon Thomas Laycock, and at the age of 37 he died at home on his estate on 7 November 1823.
