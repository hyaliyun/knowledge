These programs date back to at least 2002NSA report on privacy violations in the first quarter of 2012, The Washington Post, August 16, 2013, p. 12. and were revealed in March 2013 in the book Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry, by Marc Ambinder and D.B. Grady. These special programs are conducted under the code name RAGTIME (also abbreviated as RT), and are divided into several subcomponents. It's said that about fifty companies have provided data to this domestic collection program. RAGTIME consists of four parts: RAGTIME-A, RAGTIME-B, RAGTIME-C, and RAGTIME-P.Shane Harris, Ragtime: Code name of NSA‚Äôs Secret Domestic Intelligence Program Revealed in New Book, February 27, 2013 According to the book Deep State, only about three dozen NSA officials have access to RAGTIME's intercept data on domestic counter- terrorism collection, though outside the agency some 1000 people have knowledge of the program's details. Internally, the NSA has a compliance staff of about four or five people to ensure the program stays within laws and regulations.Details Revealed on Secret U.S. ‚ÄúRagtime‚Äù Domestic Surveillance Program, February 28, 2013 Under the RAGTIME-P program, the FISA court and the US Attorney General both certify a slate of approved targets, which include bulk data, like phone call logs and records that can be collected around those targets. Apparently, RAGTIME-P can process as many as 50 different data sets at one time. All intercepted data go to the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, where a program called XKeyscore processes them and sending them to different so-called \\"production lines\\" that deal with targets, like counterterrorism or specific countries. These processed data are stored in different NSA databases like PINWALE for internet content and MARINA for internet metadata, which is generally stored for five years. Originally, RAGTIME only applied to NSA Establishment FISA data, but in 2002 this was changed and since then the program encompasses both NSA Establishment FISA and FBI FISA data. According to Marc Ambinder, RAGTIME refers to phonecall and e-mail content intercepted under FISA authority.Twitter message from August 16, 2013  See also  * STELLARWIND * PRISM  External links  * Ragtime: Code name of NSA‚Äôs Secret Domestic Intelligence Program Revealed in New Book * The NSA's Ragtime Surveillance Program and the Need for Leaks  Notes  category:National Security Agency Category:Counter-terrorism in the United States Category:Code names Category:Mass surveillance Category:American secret government programs ","title":"Ragtime (code name)"},{"id":"40292221","text":"Chicago Bulls College Prep (CBCP) is a public four-year charter high school located on the Near West Side of Chicago, Illinois.

It chronicles Detroit bands from 1967 to the 2000s. The book's narrative is told through verbatim quotes. It was released on June 25, 2013 by Da Capo Press. About the book The 336-page book, which reached #5 on Amazon.com in the rock and roll Bestsellers category, is an oral history of Detroit rock and roll. It offers quotes from the rock stars, club promoters, fans, producers and others involved in the scenes. It chronicles the careers of '60s and '70s icons like Iggy & The Stooges, Bob Seger, Alice Cooper and The MC5, but also tells of The Romantics, Negative Approach, Insane Clown Posse and The White Stripes. On July 17, 2013 White's Third Man Records in Nashville hosted a book-signing and discussion with the book's author Steve Miller and a panel of Detroit music insiders. The book features new interviews with guitar legends Ted Nugent, Dick Wagner (of The Frost) and James Williamson of The Stooges, among others. There is also exclusive interviews with Jack White, Suzi Quatro and Andrew W.K.. It tells of the psychedelic Grande Ballroom days and the Eastown Theater - where national superstar bands shared the stage with local acts. Other venues included are Michigan Palace, Bookies Club 870, City Club, Gold Dollar, and Magic Stick ‚Äì all popular venues in the Detroit area. Reviews To date, the book has received a largely positive response from critics, including favorable reviews from glossy rock magazine like Uncut Magazine and Mojo Magazine, among others. Wall Street Journal critic David Kirby had this to say in a July 5, 2013 review: \\"We get a picture of a dysfunctional Detroit scene that, like a negative image, shows what is needed to make great, lasting art by depicting its opposite. That makes the book worth reading, if in a perverse way. On July 24, 2013 The Boston Globe posted a review saying, \\"This book is not for the squeamish. But if you truly love rock 'n' roll, you'll enjoy the ride.\\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote this on July 23, 2013: \\"A punk rock overlap with \\"Please Kill Me\\" provides some of the book's most arresting passages with Motor City figureheads like Sinclair, The MC5‚Äôs Wayne Kramer and head Stooge Iggy Pop, who poses front and center on the book's cover, providing insights, contexts and entertaining asides.\\" The review goes on to say that \\"the story bogs down\\" at points, and notes that the book ignores black artists, including \\"the Motown legends\\". On June 21, 2013 The Austin Chronicle's Kevin Curtin commended the flow of the book: \\"With its scriptlike format, Detroit Rock City ‚Ä¶ makes you feel like you were in the scrum\\", but pointed out the book \\"didn't draw any over-arching conclusions\\". Record Collector reviewer Joel McIver, in the June 2013 issue, wrote this: \\"This book is for anyone who thinks that New York, Los Angeles and possibly Nashville are America‚Äôs only musical capitals.

Preceding the People's National Party victory in the 2012 general election Vasciannie was named Jamaica's ambassador to the United States in June 2012, and succeeded Jamaican businesswoman Audrey Marks, who was appointed under the Golding administration.

Life  B√ºhler was born Charlotte Berta Malachowski in Berlin, the elder of two children of Jewish government architect Hermann Malachowski, and his wife Rose (n√©e Kristeller). After graduating from high school in 1913, Charlotte Malachowski studied natural sciences and humanities at the University of Freiburg and the University of Berlin. In 1918, she received her doctorate from the University of Munich with a dissertation on the topic √úber Gedankenentstehung: Experimentelle Untersuchungen zur Denkpsychologie (\\"On the origin of thought: Experimental studies on the psychology of thought\\"). That same year she went to Dresden to work with Karl B√ºhler, where she continued her research in the fields of child and youth psychology, as well as working on her habilitation. In 1920, she completed her habilitation at the Technical University of Dresden and became qualified to teach in Saxony. She married Karl B√ºhler on April 4, 1916. Their daughter Ingeborg was born in 1917, and their son Rolf in 1919. Karl died in 1963 in Los Angeles, California. She herself fell ill in 1970 and returned in 1971 to live with her children in Stuttgart, where she died at the age of 80.  Academic appointments  In 1923, Charlotte B√ºhler went to teach at the University of Vienna, where in 1929 she was promoted to the position of associate professor. Both B√ºhlers worked closely together at this new institution, which provided them with a laboratory to conduct their research.Gleiche Bildungschancen f√ºr alle: Der Schulreformer Otto Gl√∂ckel. Das Epstein war auch Wirkungsst√§tte von Karl und Charlotte B√ºhler. (Equal education for all: The school reformer Otto Gl√∂ckel. Epstein was also a place for Karl and Charlotte B√ºhler). Parliament Correspondence, No. 358, 14 May 2007 In the next few years at Vienna she gained international prestige through her research and publications which led to the development of the \\"Viennese child psychology school\\" of Charlotte B√ºhler - the spirit of which is still maintained today in the Charlotte B√ºhler Institute.Profile at the Charlotte B√ºhler Institute, Vienna In March 1938, during a stay in London, she learned of the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany. Karl B√ºhler was taken into \\"protective custody\\" on March 23, 1938 due to his vocal anti-Nazi sentiments. Via connections in Norway, Charlotte B√ºhler arranged the release of her husband after six and a half weeks, and in October 1938 the family was reunited in Oslo. Because Charlotte B√ºhler was of Jewish descent they emigrated to the United States. Both B√ºhlers were offered professorships in 1938 by Fordham University in New York City, which, however, did not materialize. Karl B√ºhler then accepted a professorship in Saint Paul, Minnesota; however, Charlotte B√ºhler remained in Norway because she had already accepted a professorship at the University of Oslo and a position at the Teachers' Academy in Trondheim. Only after an urgent request by her husband did she emigrate in 1940 to Saint Paul in the United States, where she arrived shortly before the invasion of Norway. In 1942 she accepted a position as senior psychologist at the Minneapolis General Hospital. In 1945 she became an American citizen and moved to Los Angeles, California, as chief psychologist at the Los Angeles County Hospital. She held this position until her retirement in 1958; during that time she also served as a professor of Psychiatry at the University of Southern California. After her retirement she went into private practice in Beverly Hills, California.  Work  *In 1922 in Dresden, she published Das Seelenleben des Jugendlichen (\\"The mental life of young people\\"), in which, for the first time, a developmental perspective was used in adolescent psychology. \\"B√ºhler's world test\\" is a projective test method developed by Charlotte B√ºhler. *In Vienna, specializing in infant and adolescent psychology, B√ºhler established a focus on experimental research based on diaries and behavioral observations (the \\"Vienna School\\"). With her assistant Hildegard Hetzer, who was succeeded in 1927 by Lotte Schenk- Danzinger, she developed intelligence assessment tests for children which are used to this day. *In 1933, her work on Der menschliche Lebenslauf als psychologisches Problem (\\"The course of human life as a psychological problem\\") was the first German-language study to include old age among the psychological age spans and to consider gerontopsychology a part of psychology. She is therefore considered an early pioneer in the field of gerontopsychology.Ulrich M. Fleischmann: Gerontopsychologie (Gerontopsychology). In: Lexikon der Psychologie (Encyclopedia of Psychology). Science-online, accessed on 11 February 2011 *In the United States, she came up with four \\"basic tendencies\\" of humans: gratification, self-restricting accommodation, creative expansion, and maintaining internal order. Other ways of expressing these tendencies are: drive for personal satisfaction, adjustment for the purpose of obtaining security, creativity or self- expression, and need for order. She laid the foundations of humanistic psychology together with Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.  Honors  * The Charlotte-B√ºhler-Institut f√ºr praxisorientierte Kleinkindforschung (\\"Charlotte B√ºhler Institute for practical research on infants\\"), established in 1992 in Vienna, is named after her. thumb Plaque dedicated to Karl and Charlotte B√ºhler at the Palais Epstein, Vienna * A plaque in honor of Charlotte and Karl B√ºhler was unveiled in 1995 at the Palais Epstein in Vienna. * Dresden and Emsdetten have Charlotte B√ºhler roads and Vienna has a Charlotte B√ºhler way.

History =1668‚Äì1672= The Jesuit mission in the Mariana Islands was the first in Oceania; it soon also proved to be one of the bloodiest. On June 15, 1668, Diego Luis de San Vitores and a band of five other Jesuits arrived on Guam, the southernmost and largest island in a cordillera of fifteen volcanic islands. With the missionaries came a garrison of thirty soldiers, many of them colonials from the Philippines, whose responsibility was to protect the missionaries and to pacify the local people if need should arise. The initial reception of the missionaries by the Chamorro people was enthusiastic and reassuring. Within two months, however, the first show of hostility occurred when Fr. Luis de Morales was attacked and injured as he was on his way to baptize a dying man on Tinian. Two of the soldiers who accompanied him were hacked to death by the villagers. A similar incident took place on Guam at about the same time; Fr. Luis Medina was beaten so badly by a hostile mob that his face was swollen for weeks. The Jesuits attributed this sudden display of hostility to the calumnies of a Chinese castaway who had made his home in the Marianas for more than twenty years. He had spread the tale that the priests poisoned infants when they poured baptismal waters on their heads. These early outbursts were followed by a period of peace that lasted almost a year, but when the Chamorro chief who had become the protector of the missionaries on Guam died, trouble broke out anew. On the next missionary journey to the northern islands, a Malabarese catechist by the name of Lorenzo was seized by an angry rob and killed with spears after he had baptized a dying child. The stories of poisonous waters may have been getting a wide hearing, but there was more to the trouble than just these outlandish tales. The Jesuits had stepped into an island society that was a tangle of political divisions and alliances of convenience. In identifying themselves with one region through the chief who protected them, they had entirely unawares made enemies in other places. In such hostile areas, stories about the religious rites they performed, or almost any other misunderstanding, were sufficient to spark off a display of aggression. San Vitores, who was the superior of the Jesuit band and held civil authority over the troops, was the meekest of men and had forbidden the building of fortifications or the use of firearms. Nonetheless, the recent turn of events had persuaded him that sterner measures might be necessary for the preservation of the mission. Accordingly, he ordered larger detachments sent out to pacify outlying areas of the mission and he wrote to the Spanish for reinforcements to bolster the garrison. San Vitores may have personally \\"welcomed martyrdom,\\" but he had the responsibility of seeing to it that the mission was not wiped out, leaving the inhabitants of the islands without what he believed to be the necessary means of salvation. Despite San Vitores' efforts to forestall further hostilities, another outbreak occurred in January 1670 when Fr. Luis de Medina and two Filipino catechists visited Saipan to resume preaching there. The priest and his companions were taunted by a threatening band of Chamorros from the moment they came ashore. Two days later, on January 29, as the priest was on his way to baptize a sick child, he and his catechists were attacked by thirty armed Chamorros. Medina and one of his catechists, Hipolito de la Cruz, died in the volley of spears. Another uprising took place, this one on Guam, just six months later. The execution of a local chief for the murder of a Spanish boy led to a siege of the Spanish fort for a number of weeks, until the Chamorro force disbanded and an uneasy peace followed for the next several months. This peace came to an abrupt end when Diego Bazan, a young Mexican helper, was ambushed and cut to pieces by two machete-wielding Guamanians. On the next day, a Spanish soldier and two Filipino catechists, Damian Bernal and Nicolas de Figueroa, were also surprised and killed. A few days later, on April 2, 1672, San Vitores was on his way from his parish in northern Guam to the mission center in Agana, when he stopped to baptize a sick child against the orders of the child's father. The father, enraged at San Vitores for administering the sacrament, fell on the priest and his companion, Pedro Calungsod. The catechist died first, and then the Jesuit fell after receiving a cutlass blow to the head and a spear thrust in the heart. =1672‚Äì1685= San Vitores' death was a shocking blow for the new mission, not quite four years old at the time. His enthusiasm had been responsible for the founding of the mission, and his cheerful austerity as he went about his work was a source of constant inspiration for his companions. But his influence proved to extend far beyond the Marianas archipelago; within two years of his death, the first of the many biographies was published and San Vitores was already being heralded as a saint throughout much of Europe. Soon many miracles were ascribed to him during his lifetime and found their way into his biographies. His cause for canonization has been introduced and is close to being decided at this writing. The following years brought still more bloodshed; they saw the deaths of four more Jesuits and a number of their lay helpers. In February 1674, Fr. Francisco Esquerra and the five Filipino assistants with him were brutally murdered when the priest tried to give the Last Sacraments to an elderly Chamorro woman in the northern part of Guam. In December 1675, the Jesuit brother Pedro Diaz and two of his lay mission helpers were cut down after he reproached a group of young trouble- makers who had entered the mission school and were creating a loud commotion. The young men were already angry at Diaz for persuading some of the more desirable to abandon their promiscuous life and resume their schooling. Just one month later, in January 1676, Fr. Antonio de San Basilio was killed when a Chamorro struck him a fierce blow to the head after being accused of cheating the priest. The next to fall was Fr. Sebastian de Monroy, who was killed in September 1676 in retaliation for the execution of a native chief after a Spanish soldier was found murdered. Monroy and six soldiers were on their way from Sumay to Hag√•t√±a after the outbreak of trouble when they were lured onto the canoe of a chief whom they had thought friendly. The Chamorros overturned the canoe once it was well off shore, and massacred the priest and soldiers with spears and clubs. With the death of Monroy, the first period of martyrdom came to an end. The arrival of military reinforcements and the adoption of stronger sanctions by Spanish authorities introduced a period of relative tranquility for the following eight years. The mission had already suffered the loss of six Jesuits and another fifteen catechists, most of them Filipinos. Nonetheless, new volunteers for the Marianas mission came from all over Europe, particularly the northern countries, in numbers more than sufficient to compensate for the martyrs. The Spanish program to pacify the archipelago continued all the while under several different governors and military commanders. One of the most vigorous of these, Don Jose Quiroga, decided in early 1684 that he would lead an expeditionary force through the northern islands to put an end to Chamorro resistance once and for all. While Quiroga and a large part of the Spanish militia were on this campaign in the north, a few disaffected chiefs from Guam took this opportunity to attack the greatly reduced garrison there. On July 24, 1684, a band of forty warriors entered the stockade under the pretense of attending Mass, attacked the Spanish force, and killed several of the defenders. Two Jesuits were slain and four others wounded in the assault. Fr. Manuel Solorzano, the mission superior, was stabbed several times in the head, had one of his hands covered, and finally was killed with a knife thrust to the throat. Br. Balthasar Dubois, a Dutch lay brother who had come to the mission five years earlier, had his skull crushed in the attack. One of those wounded was the Filipino Donado Felipe Songsong and Andres de la Cruz. Perhaps a dozen or so lay helpers also lost their lives in the assault. As news of the attack on the fort spread throughout Guam, numerous uprisings broke out in the villages. Most of the Jesuit pastors were, by good fortune, already en route to Agana to attend a mission meeting later in the day. Only Fr. Teofilo de Angelis, the pastor of a village in northern Guam, failed to make it to safety. The priest was preparing to sail to Rota when two assailants sent by the local chief seized him and hanged him from the mast of the canoe, afterwards stripping his body and casting it into the sea. Two other Jesuits working on Rota also lost their lives in the revolt. Fr. Augustin Strobach, who had arrived in the mission only three years before, was pursued by hostile canoes when he made for Guam at the news of the uprising and was forced to return to Rota. In early August he set out again, this time towards the north to bring news of the revolt to Quiroga, but was apprehended at Tinian and beaten to death. Strobach's colleague, Fr. Karl von Boranga, managed to continue his work on Rota for another month after Strobach's death before he was accosted on September 24, 1684, and stabbed and clubbed to death. Another Jesuit, Fr. Pierre Coemans, had in the meantime joined a Spanish expedition sailing out of Saipan for the northernmost islands in the archipelago. When, on their return voyage, the Chamorro pilots overturned the canoes and drowned most of the soldiers, Coemans managed to save himself and made his way to Saipan to continue his work there. A year later, in July 1685, however, Coemans finally met a martyr's death when he was apprehended, tied to a tree, and killed with stones and spears. With Coemans' death, the first and greatest age of martyrdom came to an end in the young Marianas mission. Twelve Jesuits and perhaps two dozen of their lost colleagues lost their lives for the sake of the gospel during the first two decades of missionary activity. After 1685, however, all but token resistance ended among the Chamorro people. With Quiroga's pursuit and punishment of those responsible for the assault on the fort in Guam, and with his pacification of the northern islands, peace was eventually established in the Marianas and the Jesuits worked unobstructed for the next century. Martyrs =Father Luis de Medina and his auxiliary, Hipolito de la Cruz= Firsts to be martyred. The initial reception of the missionaries by the Chamorro people was enthusiastic and reassuring. Within two months, however, the first shows of hostility occurred. Luis De Medina was born February, 1637 in Malaga, Spain and became a missionary. Hipolito de la Cruz was a Visayan catechist and Jose was a boy who came from the Philippines. On January 29, 1670, he was hurdled to death together with Fr. Luis de Medina in Saipan. Despite Sanvitores' efforts to forestall further hostilities, another outbreak occurred in January 1670 when Fr. Luis de Medina and two Filipino catechists visited Saipan to resume preaching there. The priest and his companions were taunted by a threatening band of Chamorros from the moment they came ashore. Two days later, on January 29, as the priest was on his way to baptize a sick child, he and his catechists were attacked by thirty armed Chamorros. Medina and one of his catechists, Hipolito de la Cruz, died in the volley of spears. =Lorenzo= A young layperson who accompanied the Jesuits to Guam. On the next missionary journey to the northern islands, a Malabarese catechist by the name of Lorenzo was seized by an angry rob and killed with spears after he had baptized a dying child =Diego Bazan= A young Mexican helper of the Jesuits. He was ambushed and cut to pieces by two machete- wielding Guamanians. He died on March 31, 1672. =Damian Bernal and Nicolas de Figueroa= On April 1, 1672, in search of a Mexican colleague who turned out to have been murdered, the company of a Tagalog youth, a Spaniard, Manuel Rangel and a local convert, Ambrosio Hagman encountered a band of 20 ferocious natives who tried to ambush them. Though outnumbered, they fought back in self-defense and in the process, the natives speared their Spanish companion to death. On the other hand, the fearless Nicolas aimed his cutlass at the headman, killing him instantly. To scare away the followers, Nicolas further beheaded the vanquished where as he chopped the chief to pieces. Their enemies trembled and fled and the two Filipinos escaped to the hills in separate directions. He ended up in the village of Ipao where a friendly looking native welcomed him with the traditional embrace. But it turned out to be Judas' kiss. He was too tired and trusting for the art of subterfuge which the villagers seemed to have perfected. The treacherous host suddenly seized the catechist, dragged him to the edge of a cliff and flung him over. Below waited the other assailants who ganged up on their Christian victim and slew him with their lances. =Pedro Calungsod= On April 2, 1672, In their search for a runaway companion named Esteban, Calungsod and Diego Luis de San Vitores came to the village of Tumon, Guam. There they learnt that the wife of the village chief Mata'pang gave birth to a daughter, and they immediately went to baptize the child. Influenced by the calumnies of Choco, the chief strongly opposed to give some time to calm down, the missionaries gathered the children and some adults of the village at the nearby shore and started chanting with them the tenets of the Catholic religion. They invited to join them, but he shouted back that he was angry with God and was fed up with Christian teachings. When he learnt of his daughter's baptism, he became even more furious. He violently hurled spears first at Pedro, who was able to dodge the spears. Witnesses claim that Calungsod could have escaped the attack, but did not want to leave San Vitores alone. Those who knew Calungsod personally meanwhile believed that he could have defeated the aggressors with weapons; San Vitores however banned his companions to carry arms. Calungsod was hit in the chest by a spear and he fell to the ground, then Hirao immediately charged towards him and finished him off with machete blow to the head. San Vitores absolved Calungsod before he too was killed. He took San Vitores' crucifix and pounded it with a stone whilst blaspheming God. Both assassins then denuded the corpses of Calungsod and San Vitores, tied large stones to their feet, brought them out to sea on their proas and threw them into the water. =Diego Luis de San Vitores= Born on November 12, 1627 in Burgos, Spain, to a noble family, Diego Luis de San Vitores renounced worldly wealth and joined the Society of Jesus in 1640. Ordained in 1651, he urgently asked to be sent to a faraway mission where he could win souls for salvation. He was finally sent to the Philippines. On his way there, San Vitores stopped in Guam in 1662 and vowed to return. Three years later, through his close ties to the royal court, he persuaded King Philip IV of Spain and Queen Maria Ana of Austria to order a mission in Guam be established. Thus, Father San Vitores founded the first European settlement in Micronesia through his founding of the Marianas Mission. Well-received at first by the Chamorro, hostilities soon broke out. San Vitores, as the mission leader, became the target of Chamorro wrath during the so-called Great Chamorro War of 1672. He was attacked and died alongside Pedro Calungsod on April 2, 1672. =Francisco Esquerra= He was born on October 4, 1644 in Manila, Philippines and became a Jesuit priest. In February 1674, Fr. Francisco Esquerra and the five Filipino (names unknown) assistants with him were brutally murdered when the priest tried to give the Last Sacraments to an elderly Chamorro woman in the northern part of Guam. =Pedro Diaz= Born on 1574 in Avila, Spain and became a missionary to Micronesia. In December 1675, the Jesuit brother Pedro Diaz and two of his lay mission helpers were cut down after he reproached a group of young trouble-makers who had entered the mission school and were creating a loud commotion. The young men were already angry at Diaz for persuading some of the more desirable to abandon their promiscuous life and resume their schooling. =Antonio Maria de San Basilio= Born on 1643 in Catana, Sicily, Italy. Just one month later after the death of Fr. Pedro Diaz, in January 1676, Fr. Antonio de San Basilio was killed when a Chamorro struck him a fierce blow to the head after being accused of cheating the priest. =Sebastian de Monroy= The next to fall was Fr. Sebastian de Monroy, born on 1649 in Arahal, Spain. Who was killed in September 1676 in retaliation for the execution of a native chief after a Spanish soldier was found murdered. Monroy and six soldiers were on their way from Sumay to Agana after the outbreak of trouble when they were lured onto the canoe of a chief whom they had thought friendly. The Chamorros overturned the canoe once it was well off shore, and massacred the priest and soldiers with spears and clubs. With the death of Monroy, the first period of martyrdom came to an end.

The mission had already suffered the loss of six Jesuits and another fifteen catechists, most of them Filipinos. Nonetheless, new volunteers for the Marianas mission came from all over Europe, particularly the northern countries, in numbers more than sufficient to compensate for the martyrs. =Andr√©s de la Cruz= On July 24, 1684, a band of forty warriors entered the stockade under the pretense of attending Mass, attacked the Spanish force, and killed several of the defenders. Two Jesuits were slain and four others wounded in the assault. Fr. Manuel Solorzano, the mission superior, was stabbed several times in the head, had one of his hands covered, and finally was killed with a knife thrust to the throat. Br. Balthasar Dubois, a Dutch lay brother who had come to the mission five years earlier, had his skull crushed in the attack. =Manuel Solorzano, Balthasar Dubois and Teofilo de Angelis= Fr. Manuel Solorzano was born on December 25, 1649 in Fregenal, Spain, the mission superior, was stabbed several times in the head, had one of his hands covered, and finally was killed with a knife thrust to the throat. Br. Balthasar Dubois was born on March 15, 1654 in Tournai, Belgium, a Dutch lay brother who had come to the mission five years earlier, had his skull crushed in the attack. As news of the attack on the fort spread throughout Guam, numerous uprisings broke out in the villages. Most of the Jesuit pastors were, by good fortune, already en route to Agana to attend a mission meeting later in the day. Only Fr. Teofilo de Angelis born on January 15, 1652 in Siena, Italy, the pastor of a village in northern Guam, failed to make it to safety. The priest was preparing to sail to Rota when two assailants sent by the local chief seized him and hanged him from the mast of the canoe, afterwards stripping his body and casting it into the sea. The three of them died on July 24, 1684 in Ritidian and Agana, Guam. =Felipe Songsong= In the last wave of aggression against the missionaries in the Marianas in 1684‚Äì85, He also gave up his life for Christ to follow his much younger colleagues to eternal life.

He went to London as a young man for business, before emigrating to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1853, where he worked as a merchant and shipping agent for eight years. = New Zealand = Lahmann came to Otago in New Zealand when gold was discovered and had a tobacco store in Dunedin. The West Coast Gold Rush brought him to Greymouth in late 1865, where he had business interests in shipping, timber, and as a general merchant.  Politics  Lahmann was one of the founding members of the Greymouth town improvement committee. He succeeded William Henry Harrison as the representative of the Greymouth riding on the council of Westland County, the predecessor of Westland Province; he represented Greymouth from December 1868 until December 1872. He was the fourth chairman of Westland County, from 12 January 1871 to 8 January 1873. When the Westland Province was inaugurated, Lahmann successfully stood for election in January 1874 for one of the three seats in the Greymouth electorate. He remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of the council in October 1876. After John White resigned as Speaker of the Provincial Council to join its Executive, Lahmann became the council's second and last Speaker (8 June 1874 ‚Äì 31 October 1876). He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 9 July 1872 until his death.  Death  Lahmann died aged 74 on 1 June 1890 at his residence in Albert Street, Greymouth. He had been in poor health for several years and had been almost blind during that time. His wife had died many years before him.

Although the Thais had also declared war on the United States on the same day, a U.S.‚ÄìThai peace treaty was never signed because the American government opted not to recognise the legality of the declaration in light of the Japanese invasion of Thailand on 8 December 1941. The peace treaty went into effect on the day it was signed. It was registered in the United Nations Treaty Series on 23 August 1951.United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 99, pp. 131‚Äì47.  Background  During World War II, Thailand was an ally of the Empire of Japan. In that capacity, it gained some territories that were incorporated in Thailand in exchange for freedom for the Japanese government to establish military bases in these territories as well as in the rest of Thailand. The territories gained by Thailand were taken from French Indochina during a brief war with France in late 1940 and early 1941 and from British Malaya during the Japanese attack in December 1941. On 25 January 1942, the Thai government declared war on the United States and the British Empire. The Northern Army was sent to assist in the invasion of British Burma and part of that area was annexed. During the war, the parts of the Thai government kept secret ties with the Allied governments and cooperated secretly with their intelligence services. As the Japanese government surrendered in August 1945, the Thai government claimed it was never at war with the western powers, and that the declaration of war was imposed on it by the Japanese government. The US government accepted this legal interpretation, and treated the Thai government as a friendly nation. The British government, however, refused to accept this interpretation and demanded that a peace treaty be concluded.  Effects of the treaty  The main effect of the peace treaty was to undo the Thai annexation of the Shan States and four of the Unfederated Malay States.Specifically, the northern four: Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu. The British achieved less than they had hoped, largely because the United States opposed any punitive action against Thailand. They were unable, for instance, to reduce the size of Thai armed forces. The treaty did require the free delivery of up to 1.5 million tons rice, which was in surplus in Thailand, to British Malaya, where there was a shortage. It also forbade the Thais from building a canal across the Kra isthmus without British government permission, which clause undercut the authority of Pridi Banomyong's government. After its enactment, the United States and Britain restored diplomatic relations with Thailand on 5 January. The next day a general election was held. After the treaty, the United States lent $10,000,000 to Thailand for the reconstruction of her transportation network, heavily damaged by American bombing. Thailand joined the United Nations on 16 December 1946. A separate Australian‚ÄìThai Peace Treaty, required by the Australian declaration of war of 2 March 1942 and the Australian Statute of Westminster Adoption Act, was signed on 3 April 1946.

The game was released on 5 March 2013 via digital distribution on Steam. The game has a strong inspiration in exploitation films of the 1980s and 1990s, with all characters being one of multiple protagonists of these films. Most of the interaction between the characters of the game consists of \\"one-liners\\". These one-liners are part of the game's mechanics. The game is set in a futuristic Tokyo in 2027. Development The game was announced in February 2012 under the codename \\"Project JFK\\", and was unveiled during the Game Developers Conference 2012. The Showdown Effect was developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and co-developed by Pixeldiet Entertainment, their first game on the market. The Showdown Effect was created in the BitSquid video game engine. The pre-game production has begun in late 2011, with only a small part of the Arrowhead team working on the title. In January 2012 the rest of the team left another project they were working together and with the rest of the team at Stockholm, thus giving focus the full The Showdown Effect. On 8 February 2012, Paradox Interactive has announced that three new games would be revealed at GDC that year, including code name \\"Project JFK\\", which would later become The Showdown Effect. On 6 March 2012, the game was revealed to be a \\"2.5D multiplayer action game where players will participate in deadly battles to win fame.\\" In an interview to Joystiq, Emil Englund, the game designer of Arrowhead Game Studios, said the idea for The Showdown Effect came when they were working together with Paradox Interactive in creating a game similar to Super Smash Bros.. Moreover, the designer Johan Pilestedt, of The Escapist, said he considered the game a mix between Super Smash Bros. and GoldenEye 007. Pilestedt continued, commenting on some movies that were used for inspiration during the creation of the game, especially in the graphics: \\"It is close to the work of Tarantino. His films are so violent, but are exaggerated. The blood is not real blood, it's just red water. These exploitation films are a major influence on the violence present in Showdown. \\" Pilestedt also mentioned to the interviewer that animations in the film Ghost in the Machine and in Team Fortress 2 served as inspiration. Englund explained the significance of the name of the game, The Showdown Effect: \\"[...] is the moment where two people meet and they just know they have the look and know they have to battle. \\" Speaking with Kotaku Australia, Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, commented on the characters of the game, saying that they are all based on characters from action films of the 1980s such as John McClane in Die Hard, Roger Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon or \\"any movie 1980 with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\" Each character was created to resemble an archetype of the time, but never tried to imitate a single character. The team responsible for the game decided not to create a version for consoles, nor add support for gamepad in the version for computers. According to Pilestedt, after testing several different mechanical controls, decided to stay only with the keyboard and mouse because \\"if you have high damage and you hit all the bullets, the game goes to be about who pulled the trigger first.\\" Due to this, the game has a system where the bullets hit the opponent only if the sight reticle is on the enemy, if otherwise the bullets will hit only the scenario, making a system with gamepad \\"impossible\\". However, the version presented during the PAX East of 2012 had full support gamepad, which was removed after discussions about the game focus more on quick reflexes . Those who registered through the official website, or those who pre-purchased the game, gained access to the closed beta on 1 February 2013.

Sinnett was born in Hamburg, Germany, a son of Mrs. Percy Sinnett, a well-known English author, and was educated for the profession of civil engineer. He went to South Australia in 1849 as engineer to the Adelaide and Port Railway Company; but the scheme was never carried out. He then went into partnership with Thomas Burr, a former Deputy Surveyor General of South Australia, eventually (in 1857 in Melbourne) marrying Burr's eldest daughter, Jane. During this period he contributed regularly to the Mining Journal, edited by George Stevenson, at that time considered the best- conducted paper in South Australia. When the Victorian gold fields were discovered in 1851 Sinnett left South Australia for Melbourne, and accepted an engagement as contributor to the Herald, of which paper he became eventually editor and part proprietor. About 1855 he severed his connection with that paper and became a contributor to the Melbourne Argus, with which journal he remained till 1859, with the exception of a short period spent in editing the Daily News at Geelong. About the time that he joined the Argus was commenced the Melbourne Punch, of which journal he was one of the founders, and to the success of which he greatly contributed. In 1859 Sinnett again returned to South Australia to take the management of the Adelaide Ice Works. During his sojourn in South Australia from 1859 to 1865 he founded and edited the evening Telegraph, and was Parliamentary reporter for Hansard. He returned to Melbourne in 1865, where he resumed his connection with the Argus and was retained on the literary staff of that paper as contributor and leader-writer until within a short time of his death on 23 November 1866 in Kew, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

He conducted human medical experimentation at Auschwitz and introduced the procedure there of injecting lethal doses of phenol directly into the hearts of prisoners. He was captured by the Allies in 1945, sentenced to death at the Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials, and executed in 1947.  Early life  Friedrich Entress was born on 8 December 1914 in Posen, a Polish- Prussian province, and graduated in medicine in either 1938 or 1939. He was able to receive his doctorate in 1942 without writing a dissertation, \\"a privilege granted to Germans from the east\\". He had grey eyes and dark blonde hair and was described as having a \\"Nordic\\" profile. According to Michael Kater, he was part of a vigilante group of ethnic Germans that was supported by the Schutzstaffel (SS), and after the German invasion of Poland he joined the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde. Second World War Gross-Rosen concentration camp entrance Entress departed to various concentration camps as an SS doctor, starting with a post at Gross-Rosen concentration camp in 1941. He was at the main Auschwitz camp between 11 December 1941 and 21 October 1943. During the last seven or eight months (March 1943 to 20 October 1943) at Auschwitz, he became camp physician at Buna-Monowitz workcamp, also part of the Auschwitz camp system. Subsequently, Entress in October 1943 became senior physician at Mauthausen-Gusen. By 1945, he was an SS surgeon. On the death toll among inmates at Monowitz, where IG Farben had manufacturing facilities, Entress later commented, \\"The turnover of inmates in Monowitz was enormous. The inmates were weak and malnourished. It should be emphasised that the performance demanded of the inmates was not in accord with their living conditions and nutrition\\". He conducted human medical experimentation at Auschwitz, along with Helmut Vetter and Eduard Wirths, where he operated in \\"Block 21\\" and was paid by the Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary of IG Farben to test experimental drugs against typhus and tuberculosis (TB). Experiments included collapsing the lungs of people with TB. Establishing a TB ward, he perfected the technique before killing all those on the ward by injecting lethal doses of phenol directly through the chest wall and into the victims hearts, allowing up to 100 people to be killed each day. He became a key player in the organisation and administration of killings by phenol. The practice may have been used to cover up the results of experimental medical procedures, including surgery, that he and other doctors at the camp carried out despite not having surgical qualifications. In 1942, he gave Bayer associate Helmut Vetter approval to test TB drug Rutenol, an arsenic acid derivative. Josef Mengele, who had arrived at Auschwitz in May 1943, five months before Entress left for Mauthausen-Gusen, carried on TB work at Auschwitz from 1943. At one time, Czech doctor Karel Sperber worked under Entress. Capture and death Entress was captured by the Allies in May 1945, when he was serving as a surgeon with an SS tank division. At the Mauthausen- Gusen camp trials in 1946 he was sentenced to be executed by hanging. He did not testify in his own defence but petitions for clemency were received after the verdict from his wife Else and from Entress himself. The petitions were rejected and he was hanged on 28 May 1947 at Landsberg Prison.United States vs. Hans Altfuldisch et al Case No. 000-50-5.

He had supporting roles in two single-season situation comedies, The Dennis O'Keefe Show (1959-1960) on CBS and Our Man Higgins (1962-1963) on ABC. Major roles On The Dennis O'Keefe Show, Kelman played 10-year-old Randy Towne, reared by a single father, Hal Towne (Dennis O'Keefe), who writes a newspaper column entitled \\"All Around Towne\\". Kelman appeared in all thirty-two episodes of the series. Hope Emerson was cast as Amelia \\"Sarge\\" Sargent, the stern housekeeper, hence her name. Emerson died fifteen days before the last new episode of the series was aired, but she had finished her commitment to the program prior to her death and acted in the final segment which aired on May 10, 1960. Eloise Hardt was another regular cast member in the role of Karen Hadley, Hal's girlfriend. On Our Man Higgins, Kelman was Tommy MacRoberts, one of the three children of a suburban American couple, Duncan and Alice MacRoberts, played by Frank Maxwell and Audrey Totter. Stanley Holloway carried the title role of the MacRoberts' erudite English butler. Kelman appeared in all thirty-four episodes of Our Man Higgins, which might be loosely compared to the more successful NBC sitcom, Hazel starring Shirley Booth as a nosy housekeeper for an attorney, played by Don DeFore, his wife, and their son. Child actor Kelman's first appearances were in 1954 and 1955 as a choirboy on The Red Skelton Hour. He had an uncredited role in the 1955 film A Man Called Peter, based on the life of Peter Marshall, the Presbyterian pastor who was twice appointed chaplain of the U.S. Senate. In 1957, he portrayed Jimmy Logan in \\"Bentley and the Baby Sitter\\" on CBS's then- new sitcom, Bachelor Father, with John Forsythe and Noreen Corcoran. In 1957, Kelman played \\"Elmer\\" in the final Ma and Pa Kettle film, The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm, the last screen role for Marjorie Main. Her co-star was Parker Fennelly, rather than Percy Kilbride. On January 2, 1958, Kelman was Norman Fisher in the episode \\"The Big Jade\\" of NBC's pioneering police drama, Dragnet, starring Jack Webb. From 1958 to 1959, young Kelman played Homer Foley in three episodes of the NBC children's western series, Buckskin, with Tommy Nolan and Sally Brophy, as a son and his widowed mother living in a hotel in a small fictitious Montana community. In 1958, Kelman appeared in \\"The Unfamiliar\\" on Ronald W. Reagan's CBS anthology series, General Electric Theater. In the 1960 season premiere of the ABC/Warner Brothers detective series, 77 Sunset Strip, the then 10-year-old Kelman appeared as Randolph in the episode \\"Attic\\", set in a remote mountain hideout. The episode stars Roger Smith as Jeff Spencer and features Kathleen Crowley, Cynthia Pepper, Lee Van Cleef, and Gary Vinson. He appeared in 1961 on NBC's Bonanza, with Lorne Greene, in the episodes \\"Many Faces of Gideon Flinch\\" and \\"The Infernal Machine.\\" In 1961, Kelman was cast in conflicting roles as John and Oliver Hadley in the episodes \\"The Bully\\" and \\"The Sissy\\", respectively, of NBC's National Velvet family drama series, starring Lori Martin as the teenaged equestrian Velvet Brown. On December 7, 1961, he was cast as \\"Butch\\" in the episode \\"The Fabulous O'Hara\\" of ABC's sitcom, The Donna Reed Show. In 1961 and 1962, he appeared twice on CBS's Gunsmoke with James Arness.

In 1965, he guest starred as well on the ABC sitcom The Farmer's Daughter, starring William Windom and Inger Stevens. Young adult roles On November 29, 1968, Kelman was cast as Donny Clement in the episode \\"The Fatal Hours\\" of the ABC police drama Felony Squad, with Howard Duff and Dennis Cole. In 1969, he played an older teenager, Josh Odam, in the episode \\"Mexican Honeymoon\\" of CBS's My Three Sons sitcom with Fred MacMurray and Beverly Garland. Three years earlier, he appeared as Frankie Martin in MacMurray's film about the Boy Scouts of America, Follow Me, Boys!. Kelman played the character Mike in the coming of age picture, The First Time, a 1969 comedy about three inexperienced teenagers pursuing a sexual encounter in what turns out to be a nonexistent bordello near Buffalo, New York. His co- stars were Gerard Parkes and Jacqueline Bisset. On December 31, 1969, Kelman played Quincy Rust in the episode \\"The Adversaries\\" of CBS's Medical Center with James Daly and Chad Everett. The episode focuses on the competition between two interns. Audrey Totter, Kelman's co-star in Our Man Higgins, later joined the Medical Center cast but did not appear in this episode. In 1970, Kelman appeared twice on ABC's high school comedy-drama, Room 222, as Dennis Joplin in \\"The New Boy\\" and as Craig in \\"Captain of the Team\\". He was cast again with John Forsythe in his CBS sitcom, To Rome with Love. In 1971, he played Don Harper in \\"The Climate of Doubt\\" of the legal drama Men at Law, starring Robert Foxworth.

He won the NCAA national championship in the 150-pound weight class in 1977 and 1978 and the national championship in the 167-pound weight class as a senior in 1979. He was selected four times as an collegiate wrestling All-American and was also named the most outstanding participant in the 1978 NCAA Division I wrestling championships. Churella also received the 1979 Big Ten Medal of Honor for proficiency in scholarship, athletics and community service. When he graduated from the University of Michigan in 1979, Churella was the school's all-time record-holder in career wins (132), career falls (41) and single-season wins (44). Churella's collegiate success foreshadowed his qualification for the 1980 Summer Olympics, but the US' boycott of the event prevented the opportunity. Coaching career After graduating from Michigan, Churella served as the head wrestling coach at UNLV from 1979 to 1984. While holding that position, Churella established the Las Vegas Collegiate Invitational Tournament, later renamed the Cliff Keen Invitational. After UNLV discontinued its wrestling program, Churella returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant coach from 1985 to 1987. Later years Churella later went into the insurance services business and became the president and CEO of FDI Group, in Novi, Michigan. Three of his sons, Mark, Jr., Ryan and Josh were wrestlers at the University of Michigan. Churella returned to the program as an assistant coach from 2007 to 2008. Son Josh Churella joined the Michigan Wolverines wrestling coaching staff in 2012. Churella was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996 and the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1999.

Brucella ceti has been found in both classes of cetaceans, mysticetes and odontocetes. Brucellosis in some dolphins and porpoises can result in serious clinical signs including fetal abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone and skin lesions, strand events, and death. Brucella ceti was first isolated in 1994 when an aborted dolphin fetus was discovered. Only a small portion of those with Brucella ceti have overt clinical signs of brucellosis indicating that many have the bacteria and remain asymptomatic or overcome the pathogen. Serological surveys have shown that cetacean brucellosis may be distributed worldwide in the oceans. The likely transmission route for the bacterial pathogen in cetaceans is through mating or reproduction and lactation. Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease: marine mammal brucellosis can infect other species, including human beings. Brucella spp. are gram-negative in their staining morphology. Brucella spp. are poorly staining, small gram-negative coccobacilli (0.5-0.7 x 0.6-1.5 ¬µm), and are seen mostly as single cells  Bacterial Characteristics  B. ceti is a gram negative, non motile, aerobic bacteria. The cells are cocci, coccobacilli (short rods) with a diameter of 0.5‚Äì0.7 ¬µm and a length of 0.6‚Äì1.5 ¬µm. The arrangement of the cells are usually singular with occasional configurations in pairs or short chains. Cell growth occurs between 20 and 40 degrees celsius with the optimum temperature of 37 degrees celsius and is improved by the presence of blood or serum, supplemental CO2 is not required for cell growth. The ideal pH range is between 6.6 and 6.7.  Host range  B. ceti has been found via PCR isolation in 4 out of 14 cetacean families but antibodies against the bacteria have been isolated in 7 families. Within these families, B ceti has been cultured or found in Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoploden bidens), longfinned pilot whales (Globicephala melas), northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), white beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori), Maui's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui), narwhales (Monodon monoceros), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis)  Clinical Signs  The most common symptoms include spontaneous abortions, fatigue, anorexia, seizures, fainting and neurobrucellosis, which can lead to disorientation and stranding events . Other symptoms in dolphins from both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans include subcutaneous abscesses, endometritis, meningoencephalitis and discospondylitis. Post mortem pathology studies on cetaceans also find inflammatory lesions, nodules of granulation tissues and necrosis in the heart, lungs and reproductive organs. In addition to this, it is common to find non lethal lesions in the bones and joints, which indicates a chronic presence of B. ceti in cetacean populations. Only a small portion of infected individuals exhibit outwardly clinically or pathological signs.  Diagnosis  Most cases of B. ceti have been isolated from stranded or dead cetaceans found on the coasts. Diagnostic tests involve isolating the bacteria then completing direct identification methods to characterize the microorganism or indirect screening tests to find antibodies using serological tests. In most cases B. ceti is detected by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing.  Treatment  Captive dolphins with B. ceti have been treated with antibiotics, however, there has been no successful treatments for brucellosis documented in cetaceans.  Transmission  B. ceti is a non- mobile bacteria, unable to withstand harsh conditions outside of a host. It is shown to be transmitted both horizontally through social behavior and vertically from mother to fetus. It is passed through close contact between cetaceans through sexual intercourse, reproduction and aborted fetuses. B. ceti has been found in reproductive organs and in milk produced by the host. Some cetaceans species assist others give birth and the bacteria could be contracted this way. Transmission could also occur from feeding on fish infected with brucellosis through reservoirs that have the ability to replicate in cetaceans.  Epidemiology  B. ceti has been found to be distributed worldwide, with the first case in the Mediterranean documented in 2012. Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that has many different strains pertaining to different host species. There have been four confirmed cases of humans becoming infected with marine mammal brucellosis. Cetacean specific brucellosis in humans may be underestimated in African, South American and Southeast Asian countries where humans frequently come in contact with dead cetaceans.  History  Brucella ceti was first isolated in 1994 when an aborted dolphin fetus was discovered. The first case of B. ceti infecting the reproductive organs was recorded in a California aquarium, where bottlenose dolphins experienced abortions. The bacteria was isolated from both the fetus and the placentas.

They entered the season as three-time defending Eastern Conference champions and as two-time defending NBA champions, having defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals in seven games. In defeating the Spurs in 2013, the Heat handed the Spurs their first-ever series loss in the NBA Finals. The 2013-2014 season was the Heat's fourth and final season playing with the \\"Big Three\\" of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh and their sixth season under head coach Erik Spoelstra. In a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers in six games to become the first team to win four consecutive Eastern Conference championships since the Boston Celtics did so in the 1984-1987 seasons. Miami's quest for a three-peat ended when the San Antonio Spurs, whom they met in a rematch of the 2013 NBA Finals, won the NBA Finals by a 4-1 margin. Following the season, LeBron James left the Heat in free agency to rejoin the Cleveland Cavaliers and Ray Allen retired. Key dates *June 27: The 2013 NBA draft took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. *July 1: 2013 NBA free agency began. *March 3: LeBron James had a career-high 61 points against the Charlotte Bobcats.

Life Ker was born at Dunblane, Perthshire, and was for a time schoolmaster at Crieff. About 1710, after examination by ministers and professors, he became a master in the Royal High School, Edinburgh. In 1717 he was appointed professor of Greek in King's College, Aberdeen, the first specialist teacher of the subject there, despite his admiration for the uncompromising Jacobite Archibald Pitcairne. On 2 October 1734 Ker succeeded Adam Watt in the Latin chair at Edinburgh University. He studied law, and was a popular teacher, if (in the view of Alexander Carlyle) deferential to students from the nobility. He died at Edinburgh in November 1741. Works About 1725 Ker published his Latin poem Donaides (those of the River Don), celebrating worthies of Aberdeen. In 1727 there appeared his paraphrase of the Song of Solomon, Cantici Solomonis Paraphrasis Gemina. He was also the author of memorial verses on Archibald Pitcairne, Sir William Scott of Thirlestane (1674?-1725), and others. He was included with other Scottish Latinists, in William Lauder's Poetarum Scotorum Mus√¶ Sacr√¶, 1739. The Latin ballad on the battle of Killiecrankie versified in English by Sir Walter Scott and published in Chambers's Journal has been thought probably Ker's, since Robert Chambers.

With an enrollment of around 700 students in Grades 9-12, Franklin Academy is one of the larger high schools in the North Country region of Upstate New York and is accredited by the New York State Department of Education. The school traces its history to 1806 to the Harrison Academy, a private school that was established not long after the founding of Malone. History The first school in Malone was founded in 1806, not long after the town was established and was named Harrison Academy. The original structure was constructed from timber cut and hewed at the location of the school building, which also housed a courthouse, jails and place for worship. Originally a private institution, in 1831 it was made public and rechartered as Franklin Academy and housed in a new building made of stone. In 1868 Franklin Academy was merged with other schools located in the village of Malone.http://www.malonevillage.com/History.htm In 1930 the school moved into a new building on Academy Street where it was housed until moving to its current location in 1968. The former location on Academy Street is currently the location of Malone Middle School. The school completed expansions in 2003, witnessing upgrades to laboratories, the construction of a new library over the former quadrangle, gymnasium and upgrades of data capabilities.http://www.fehb.org/Plans/SchoolImprovementPlans/MCSDStudentAchievementActionPlanApproved12-09-08.pdf Academics Franklin Academy has 11 academic departments: Art, Athletics and Physical Education, Business, English, French and Spanish, Math, Music, Science, Social Studies, Special Education and Technology Franklin Academy offers students the option to pursue a Regents Diploma, typically for college- bound students.

Life He was the eldest son of Francis Scott, 1st Baronet of Thirlestane, Selkirkshire, and Lady Henrietta, daughter of William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian, who married in 1673. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 25 February 1702. On 20 May 1719 Scott executed a deed of entail of his lands of Thirlestane. Thirlestane in Selkirkshire should not be confused with Thirlestane in Roxburghshire, which is associated with the Kerrs, and later the Scott-Kerrs of Chatto and Sunlaws. Such confusion has led to the assumption that the Kerrs of Chatto are buried in Greyfriars. This is not the case. The Kerrs and Scott-Kerrs of Chatto and Sunlaws are buried at Sunlaws and Roxburgh, and possibly Hownam. He died on 8 October 1725. He is buried in the sealed south-west section of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh commonly called the Covenanter's Prison. /ref> Works Scott contributed to Archibald Pitcairne's Selecta Poemata (1726) some lyrics and macaronic verse; in the preface to the volume his literary merits are extolled by contemporaries. A family tradition attributed to him the ballad, The Blythsome Wedding, which was also claimed for Francis Sempill, by James Paterson (1849). Allan MacLaine considers neither attribution of this anonymous work to have merit. Family In 1699, Scott married Elizabeth, only surviving child of Margaret Brisbane, 5th Lady Napier, and her husband, John Brisbane, son of an Edinburgh writer. After her death he married Jean, daughter of Sir John Nisbet of Dirleton, East Lothian, and widow of Sir William Scott of Harden.

He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 31 December 1853 to 6 November 1860, when he was disqualified for absence. He was one of the founders of Wellington, arriving in 1840 on the Oriental. The Petre family was one of the first and most prominent colonial families of New Zealand; giving their name to Petre Bay, Chatham Island, and originally the town of Wanganui, north of Wellington. In 1841, Petre published an account of his time in Port Nicholson and Wellington. Petre returned to England to find a wife 13 months after arriving. His father sent for Mary Ann Eleanor Walmsley, then 15 years old and brought up in a convent, and the wedding happened in 1842. Mary Ann Petre's diary also survives. Petre lived in the Hutt Valley, and with Vavasour and Charles Clifford established a sheep station in the Wairarapa. Governor Sir George Grey appointed Petre to be Postmaster-General on 13 August 1853, but his appointment was not accepted by the First Parliament that met in 1854, and he left for England early in the new year. He returned with his family to England in 1854. His first wife died in 1885, and he remarried to the widow Sara Tolme. He died in Essex in 1889.Evening Post; 19 December 1889 p2 He seems to have been a man of strange appearance, from the description by his contemporary, the New Zealand social commentator Charlotte Godley: \\"He is immensely tall and thin and looks like a set of fire irons badly hung together\\". His father William Petre, 11th Baron Petre, was chairman of the New Zealand Company. The Petres were an aristocratic family from Ingatestone in Essex, England, and the Wellington suburb of Thorndon was named after their Thorndon Hall estate in England. The family were recusant Roman Catholics. The architect Francis Petre was his son.

Stockmen carried it west and north as they expanded across Australia. It subsequently died out in most of the country, but was creolised (forming Australian Kriol) in the Northern Territory at the Roper River Mission (Ngukurr), where missionaries provided a safe place for Indigenous Australians from the surrounding areas to escape annihilation at the hands of European settlers. As the Indigenous Australians who came to seek refuge at Roper River came from different language backgrounds, there grew a need for a shared communication system to develop, and it was this that created the conditions for Port Jackson Pidgin English to become fleshed out into a full language, Kriol, based on English language and the eight different Australian language groups spoken by those at the mission.

Most of these wrinkle fillers are temporary because they are eventually absorbed by the body. Most dermal fillers today consist of hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is present in skin and cartilage. Some people may need more than one injection to achieve the wrinkle-smoothing effect. The effect lasts for about six months or longer. Successful results depend on health of the skin, skill of the health care provider, and type of filler used. Regardless of material (whether synthetic or organic) filler duration is highly dependent on amount of activity in the region where it is injected. Exercise and high intensity activities such as manual labor can stimulate blood flow and shorten the lifespan of fillers. In the US, fillers are approved as medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the injection is prescribed and performed by a provider. What defines a qualified dermal injection provider varies by country and is a point of debate between board-certified doctors and injectors who operate under cosmetic or aesthetician licenses. Fillers are not to be confused with Neurotoxins such as Botox. Fillers are not approved for certain parts of the body where they can be unsafe, including the penis. In Europe and the UK, fillers are non-prescription medical devices that can be injected by anyone licensed to do so by the respective medical authorities. They require a CE mark, which regulates adherence to production standards, but does not require any demonstration of medical efficacy. As a result, there are over 140 injectable fillers in the UK/European market and only six approved for use in the US. In China, the market of cosmetic surgery increase in recent 10 years, NMPA (formerly CFDA) also has issued several guidance to regulate injectable filler.  Medical uses  Dermal fillers, also known as \\"injectables\\" or \\"soft-tissue fillers,\\" do just what their name suggests: they fill in the area under the skin. *non-surgical cleft repair/modification * treating fat loss secondary to HIV. Fillers were found to give a temporary acceptable therapeutic effect in HIV‚Äêinfected patients with severe facial lipodystrophy which is caused by the highly active antiretroviral therapy. A systemic review concluded that the injectable fillers resulted in high satisfaction, however, further research is needed to determine the safety of its use. Risks Risks of an improperly performed dermal filler procedure commonly include bruising, redness, pain or itching. Less commonly, there may be infections or allergic reactions, which may cause scarring and lumps that may require surgical correction. More rarely, serious adverse effects such as blindness due to retrograde (opposite the direction of normal blood flow) embolization into the ophthalmic and retinal arteries can occur. Delayed skin necrosis can also occur as a complication of embolization. Embolic complications are more frequently seen when autologous fat is used as a filler, followed by hyaluronic acid. Though rare, when vision loss does occur, it is usually permanent.  Materials used  Fillers are made of sugar molecules or composed of hyaluronic acids, collagens ‚Äî which may come from pigs, cows, cadavers, or may be generated in a laboratory ‚Äî the person's own transplanted fat, and biosynthetic polymers. Examples of the latter include calcium hydroxylapatite, polycaprolactone, polymethylmethacrylate, and polylactic acid. In 2012, \\"Artiste Assisted Injection System\\" was launched in the US market to assist in the delivery of dermal fillers. A study concluded that the injecting device can achieve reductions in patient discomfort and adverse events by controlling the rate of flow of injection of the filler the practitioner is using to fill in the lips and frown lines.

It is named after the city Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. A miniature banquet of meats, fish, vegetables, and spicy sambals eaten with plain white rice, it is Sumatra's most famous export and the Minangkabau people's primary contribution to Indonesian cuisine. A Padang restaurant is usually easily distinguishable with its Rumah Gadang style facade and typical window display. Such displays usually consist of stages and rows of carefully arranged stacked bowls and plates filled with various dishes. Padang restaurants, especially smaller ones, will usually bear names in the Minang language. Nasi padang is a vital part of Indonesian workers' lunch break in urban areas. When nasi padang prices in the Greater Jakarta area were raised in 2016, municipal civil servants demanded the uang lauk pauk (food allowance, a component of civil servants' salary) be raised as well. Nasi padang is found in various cities in Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Papua as well as neighboring countries Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia. Serving In Padang restaurants, there are two methods of serving: pesan (ordering) and hidang (serve) method. Pesan, the most common method, usually employed by small restaurants with one or two customers ordering at a time, means the customer examines the window display, chooses the dish and orders directly from the waiter in front. The dish is promptly served. In a larger Padang restaurant, the festive hidang method is usually employed. This mini banquet is most suitable for dining in a group. After the customers are seated, they do not have to order individually. The waiters, with stacked plates on their hands, will immediately serve the dishes. The table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with beef rendang, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and sambal, the spicy sauces ubiquitous at Indonesian tables. Typically, a dozen dishes will be served. Nasi padang served this way is an at-your-table, by-the-plate buffet. Customers only pay for what they have consumed from this array. In Minang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. Kobokan, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime, is provided for washing hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork. Dishes The hidang style of serving in a Padang restaurant Steamed rice is usually served with gulai cubadak (unripe jackfruit gulai) and boiled cassava leaves. Nasi padang dishes are quite similar to nasi kapau from Bukittinggi. The differences mainly lie in the method of serving. Dishes offered include: * Gulai cubadak, unripe jackfruit gulai * Sayur daun ubi kayu or sayur daun singkong, boiled cassava leaves * Rendang, chunks of beef stewed in spicy coconut milk and chili gravy, cooked well until dried. Other than beef, rendang ayam (chicken rendang) and rendang itik (duck rendang) can be found * Daun ubi tumbuk, cassava leaves in coconut milk * Kalio, similar to rendang; while rendang is rather dry, kalio is watery and light-colored * Gulai ayam, chicken gulai * Gulai cancang, gulai of meats and cow internal organs * Gulai tunjang, gulai of cow foot tendons * Gulai babek, gulai babat or gulai paruik kabau, gulai of cow tripes * Gulai iso or gulai usus, gulai of cow intestines usually filled with eggs and tofu * Gulai limpo, gulai of cow spleen * Gulai ati, gulai of cow liver * Gulai otak, gulai of cow brain * Gulai sumsum, gulai of cow bone marrow * Gulai gajeboh, cow fat gulai * Gulai itiak, duck gulai * Gulai talua', boiled eggs gulai * Gulai kepala ikan kakap merah', red snapper's head gulai * Gulai jariang, jengkol stinky bean gulai * Dendeng batokok, thin crispy beef * Dendeng balado, thin crispy beef with chili * Paru goreng, fried cow lung * Ayam bakar, grilled spicy chicken * Ayam balado, chicken in chili * Ayam goreng, fried chicken with spicy granules * Ayam lado ijo, chicken in green chili * Ayam pop, Minang-style chicken, boiled/steamed and then fried * Ikan bilih, fried small freshwater fish of the genus Mystacoleucus * Baluik goreng, crispy fried small freshwater eel * Udang balado, shrimp in chili * Rajungan goreng, crispy fried crab * Terong balado, eggplant in chili * Petai goreng, fried green stinky bean (Parkia speciosa) * Ikan asam padeh, fish with spicy-sour taste * Itiak lado mudo', duck in green chili * Peyek udang, shrimp rempeyek * Kerupuk jangek, cow's skin krupuk * Sambal balado, sambal with large sliced chilli pepper * Sambal lado tanak' * Lele goreng, fried catfish In popular culture * In 2016, Norwegian singer Audun Kvitland R√∏stad created an ode for nasi padang to describe his love for this food.

Naming The town was first known as West Virginia, then Virginia, and later Carbonate Camp and Carbonate for its carbonate mineral ores. History James Ridpath first settled the area circa 1880 and staked out the West Virginia Mine. There, he discovered the carbonate ore, a mixture of silver and lead, that would cause the town to prosper. Carbonate was founded in July 1881, after an article appeared in the Black Hills Daily Times about the ore and created an influx of settlers. By August, 200 men had settled in the town in tents and began placer mining for gold; a wagon road to Spearfish was completed that same month. A reservoir was built so that the residents would not have to use the same springs that the livestock did. A fund dedicated to growing the camp began in Deadwood, and several saloons, shops, and restaurants moved into the town. Two barber shops, two laundries, an office, and a drug store also emerged, among other businesses. The Carbonate Reporter was the first newspaper in the town, and The Nugget was established later, in 1886. By September, the outside interest in the town had started to fade, and the rush to settle in Carbonate slowed. In June 1883, mining operations were suspended because the roads had fallen into such disrepair that they could not be used. Ridpath, hoping to attract newcomers, planted an apple orchard and a strawberry bed. The town boomed again in 1885, when the nearby Iron Hill Mine started mining gold and galena. The Seabury- Calkins, nicknamed \\"Seabury-Coffin,\\" was another famous and productive mine in the area. The Seabury-Calkins miners accidentally dug into the Iron Hill Mine; however, during a mine fire, the Seabury-Calkins Mine became an inadvertent escape route. Other mines located in the area also contributed to the growth of the town.Bell, Anthony M. \\"State Treasure - South Dakota.\\" Lost Treasure Jan. 2012: 39. Web. 20 Aug. 2013. The town later had a hotel (which opened on May 1, 1886), several stores, boarding houses capable of housing a hundred men, post office, church, bank, mill to the west, and several low entertainment venues, including gambling halls and Fannie Hill's and Lottie Belmont's establishments. The largest hotel in Dakota Territory, William Hugginson's Black Hills Hotel, was three stories high and included a saloon and a banquet room. In August 1886, the first school session was held. A smelter was built in 1887 in Rubicon Gulch to the east. At some point, a cemetery was built. By 1891, Iron Hill Mine had turned a profit of $667,000. In 1888 and 1889, a diphtheria epidemic struck the area; the fumes from the smelter had killed every cat in the town and probably opened the door to respiratory diseases and illnesses spread by rats. Signs reading \\"Keep out: Black Diphtheria!\\" stayed in place until 1910. Silver prices began to decline in 1891, and soon, the town was largely abandoned. In 1900, the town's Hugginson Hotel was torn down for lumber to be used at the nearby Cleopatra Mill. In 1901, the mine was reworked and produced another of silver and of lead. In 1911, the mine was accidentally flooded and drove the owners out. Iron Hill continued operation until the 1930s, and today, only one house and headframe are the only remnants of the mine. Carbonate's last resident, an old man named Raspberry Brown, died in 1939. Geography Carbonate is located in the Black Hills of west-central Lawrence County. The climate of Carbonate is the same as the rest of western South Dakota; it is hot in the summer and freezing in the winter. Carbonate is located approximately four miles east of the ghost town of Maitland, near Squaw Creek, or five miles north of Trojan, 10.5 miles southeast of Spearfish, and seven miles northwest of Central City. While the houses were very scattered, the main site encircled an open valley. Only the buildings' foundations remain at the site.

The film stars Patricia Neal, Cloris Leachman, Bobby Darin, Tessa Dahl, Ron Howard, Kathie Browne, Joe Mascolo, Simon Oakland, and Thayer David. Plot summary Johnny Hanson (Ron Howard) is a teenager who arrives at a remote fishing village in New England. He goes to Ronda's Cafe, where he timidly sits at a table. When the owner Ronda Carlson (Cloris Leachman) comes to take his order, he asks her name, and when she replies, he abruptly departs. Shaken, Ronda returns to the kitchen where Eddie Martin (Bobby Darin), the cook and her boyfriend, asks if that was him and she nods her head 'yes'. Johnny walks to a residential neighborhood and sits outside one of the houses. The house belongs to Ronda's sister Cara (Patrica Neal), and when Cara's teenage daughter Celia (Tessa Dahl) comes outside to fetch the morning newspaper, she sees Johnny and smiles. Noticing her daughter's interest in the young stranger, the cantankerous Cara upbraids Celia, then turns her anger on her son Porgie (Roy Applegate), and later abuses Porgie's wife Yolanda (Gale Garnett), whom Cara considers a tramp. As Johnny walks down the road, Roy (Simon Oakland), the town's police chief, pulls him over and takes him to the police station for questioning. After Roy frisks Johnny, he finds several letters, and when Johnny demands their return, Roy explains that the town is on edge because several people have disappeared over the last few months and it is therefore his obligation to question every stranger. Upon reading the letters, Roy discovers that Johnny is the son Ronda gave away for adoption years earlier. Johnny then informs Roy that he has come to town to learn his father's identity, but Roy warns him not to unearth old secrets and to leave town right away. After Roy releases him, Johnny walks past Cara's house and Celia beckons him inside, then pulls him into the attic. From the attic window, Celia spies on her womanizing neighbor Piccolo (Joe Mascolo) as he seduces Crystal (Kathie Browne), his married mistress in the garden. Celia then turns to Johnny and tries to seduce him, but he is not interested. Johnny tells Celia that he discovered Ronda was his mother when he found some letters she had sent to Johnny's foster parents. Stating that Cara is Ronda's estranged sister, Celia takes Johnny into her late father's office and shows him some old family photos of her father, who died before she was born. When Cara returns home, Celia locks Johnny in the office, but he escapes through a window later that night. At the cafe, Eddie demands to know if Ronda intends to allow Johnny to live there. When Ronda answers 'yes', Eddie, intolerant of the situation, takes his pay and announces that he is quitting, as well as leaving Ronda. Finding Johnny outside, Eddie beats up him in anger. Hearing noises, Ronda hurries outside and, finding the bloodied Johnny, helps him into her house. There Johnny sees that Ronda has tacked his baby and boyhood pictures onto the wall, and Ronda confesses her regret over giving him up as a baby. Johnny demands to know who his father was, and when Ronda refuses to tell him, he leaves. Johnny attends church that Sunday, and afterward, Cara's gossipy neighbor, Florence (Jan Chamberlain), invites him to have some fresh baked bread at her house. As they sit at the table, Florence reveals that Cara and Ronda have not spoken since the day that Cara's husband George (Johnny's father) was stabbed and murdered in his front yard. Later, Porgie visits his sympathetic aunt Ronda, who reveals that Johnny is her son and asks him to pass the information to Cara. Porgie, who has been continually disparaged by his mother, suggest that Ronda tell her herself. Celia, meanwhile, has continued to spy on Piccolo and Crystal through the attic window, from which she throws a paper airplane containing a message to meet her at the summer house that afternoon. Crystal, who is amused by Celia's infatuation with Piccolo, insists that he attend and accompanies him there, waiting outside as he goes in to keep his rendezvous. When Piccolo fails to reappear, Crystal enters and finds Piccolo's dead body lying on the floor. Panicked, Crystal tries to run out the door, and finding it locked, races from room to room, looking for an escape. After discovering another dead body in the bathtub, Crystal turns to see Celia standing in the hallway with a cleaver in her hand. Terrified, Crystal jumps out a window and falls to her death. Meanwhile, as Porgie and his friend Bomber (Gerald E. Forbes) troll the waters for fish, their net pulls up a dead body. That night, Johnny visits Ronda and demands to know his father's name. As Johnny leafs through some old photo albums, Ronda informs him that his father is dead. Finding a clipping about his father in the album, Johnny snatches it and runs to Cara's house, where he confronts Cara and announces that he knows that her husband George was his father. Upon returning home, Celia goes to the kitchen, extracts a knife from the drawer, then eavesdrops from the hallway as Cara admits that upon discovering that George had an affair with her sister, she stabbed her stomach with a knife to abort her unborn fetus. The baby, Celia, survived, but was born mentally deranged. Cara then admits to stabbing and killing George in a jealous rage. Offering to give Johnny George's watches and rings, Cara goes upstairs to her bedroom to retrieve them. As Johnny waits in the living room, he hears Cara scream, and sees Celia running down the stairs. Rushing into Cara's bedroom, Johnny finds that she has been stabbed in the throat with a knife. Johnny nervously paces the hallways in search of Celia, and when he walks out the door, she assaults him with the knife and they struggle for possession of the weapon... The next morning, Celia is locked in a police car by Roy and taken away to jail as Johnny hitches a ride out of town.

In this case, coastal gothic horror, as young Johnny (Ron Howard) returns to the New England fishing village of his childhood, in search of a father he has never known. It is one of those towns where everyone seems to have a skeleton in the closet. Actually, a skeleton in the closet would be a blessing. This town has two skeletons on the beach (under the beach, to be precise), a corpse in the master bedroom, another corpse in the summer house's upstairs bathtub, two more in guest rooms, a third in the overgrown front yard, a fourth fresh-killed in the garage, and still another fouling up the nets in the nearby fishing grounds. There may have been more. I didn't notice. Johnny never finds his father ‚Äî mainly because his father, what is left of his father, can be found only at low spring tides during a strong offshore wind. But he does find his mother (Cloris Leachman), and his aunt (Patricia Neal), the local down-at-the heels aristocrat, who is also his father's widow. Eventually he finds the identity of the murderer, an identity that should keep you guessing for at least the first six minutes of the movie. Happy Mothers' Day, Love George makes use of several distinguished performers. Cloris Leachman was seen to better advantage in Last Picture Show. Ron Howard is currently seen to better advantage in American Graffiti. And Patricia Neal may be seen to better advantage any time in Maxim Coffee television commercials. In this, his first directorial assignment, Darren McGavin has come up to just about the level of his material, which is very low. The locations, actually in Nova Scotia, are predictably lovely. There is some sense of place (the great gift of the provincial horror movie), but no sense of purpose, or of a reasonable inevitable doom. Happy Mothers' Day, Love George, opened yesterday at the Plaza and New Embassy theaters. Production Happy Mother's Day, Love George was produced and directed by Darren McGavin. The film was written by Robert Clouse. Cinematography was done by Walter Lassally. Film editing was done by George Grenville. The score was composed by Don Vencent.

Meyer recognized defects in the enzymes of heme biosynthesis to be the cause of porphyrias and discovered how drugs can precipitate acute hepatic porphyria. He identified genetic variants in the enzymes of the human cytochrome P450 system and showed that they explain the variable clinical response to drugs. Genetic variants of N-acetyltransferase were also discovered in his laboratory.

His works are popular history, rather than scholarly. Life He was the son of James Paterson, farmer at Struthers, Ayrshire, where he was born on 18 May 1805; his father then had money troubles and gave up his farm. Paterson received an education, and then was apprenticed to a printer at the office of the Kilmarnock Mirror. Subsequently he was transferred to the Courier office in Ayr. On completing his apprenticeship, Paterson went to Glasgow, where he joined the Scots Times. In 1826 he returned to Kilmarnock, took a shop as stationer and printer, and in partnership with other gentlemen started the Kilmarnock Chronicle. Its first number appeared on 4 May 1831, during the agitation for the Great Reform Bill, and the paper closed in May 1832. In 1835 Paterson left Kilmarnock for Dublin, where for some time he acted as correspondent of the Glasgow Liberator. He went to Edinburgh, and ultimately found employment at a small salary in writing the letterpress for John Kay's Edinburgh Portraits, 1837‚Äì9, most of the biographies being his work. Failing to find further employment in Edinburgh, he accepted in 1839 the editorship of the Ayr Observer; but his prospects there were not good, and he returned to Edinburgh, where he supported himself by writing. About 1871 Paterson was attacked by paralysis, and he died on 6 May 1876. Works Aged 12, Paterson began to contribute to George Thomson's miscellany. In 1840 he published Contemporaries of Burns and the more recent Poets of Ayrshire, and in 1847 a History of the County of Ayr. In 1871 he published Autobiographical Reminiscences. The Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire, which he edited, appeared in 1847. Paterson's other publications were: * The Obit of the Church of St. John the Baptist at Ayr, with a translation and historical sketch, 1848. * The Poems of the Sempills of Beltrees, with notes, 1849. * The Poems of William Hamilton of Bangour, with a life of the poet William Hamilton, 1850. * Memoir of James Fillans, Sculptor, 1854. * Origin of the Scots and of the Scottish Language, 1855; 2nd ed. 1858. * History of the Regality of Musselburgh, 1857. * Wallace and his Times, 1858, and subsequent editions. * The Life and Poems of William Dunbar, 1860. * Notes to Archibald Crawfurd's The Huntly Casket and other Tales and Lyrics; with Reminiscences of the Author, 1861. * James the Fifth, or the Gudeman of Ballengich, his Poetry and Adventures, 1861. * The History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton, 1863. * A Contribution to Historical Genealogy: The Breadalbane Succession Case‚Äîhow it arose and how it stands, 1863. Paterson also played some part in the production of Peter Handyside M'Kerlie's History of the Lands and their Owners in Galloway (1870). He had a dispute with the author.

Miller was born in Westminster, Maryland. She graduated from Western Maryland College in 1885 and worked as a journalist for the Westminster Democratic Advocate. She then moved to Baltimore with her parents and started working for the Baltimore Telegram. At the Telegram she began covering the Baltimore Orioles in 1894 by disguising herself as a man; only after her female identity was found out was she known as the ‚Äúonly woman baseball reporter in the country‚Äù. She moved on to photography, submitting photos of Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War activities from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis to Leslie‚Äôs Illustrated Weekly, securing her a position there. At Leslie‚Äôs, Miller covered stories such as the Baltimore Fire of 1904, the presidential inauguration of Howard Taft, and Democratic party conventions. She also photographed portraits of Susan B. Anthony and Teddy Roosevelt. Miller was a professional journalist, but most people did not know she was a woman. She wrote with the byline \\"SKM\\", which hid her female identity. She may have been the first woman to cover major league baseball and is one of the few to combine photography with journalism. While on national tour with the Orioles in 1897, her gender was \\"discovered\\". She became the world's first female war correspondent while covering the fighting in Morocco between Spanish forces and the Moors in 1909. While working on an assignment in Germany, she was arrested as a spy. She also wrote on the Yukon Gold Rush and did interviews from several countries including Cuba, Czarist Russia, and Turkey. Her most reprinted interview was with Pancho Villa, a Mexican Revolutionary general in 1916 at his guerrilla base. A stroke in 1918 forced Miller to retire from Leslie's Illustrated Weekly, ending her career as a journalist. She died two years later. Her name was added to the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.  References  External links *Sadie Kneller Miller, MSA SC 3520-13571. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Aug. 2013.  Further reading  *Miller R.

On 4 January 1888, the No. 2 subdivision of Bulimba Division was separated to create the new Kianawah Division (later renamed Wynnum Division). On 19 January 1888, the No. 1 subdivision of Bulimba Division was separated to create Balmoral Division. On 24 October 1888, the western part of the division was split off to create Shire of Coorparoo. On 17 March 1892, there was an alteration of boundaries. The Pritchard's Road land and gravel reserve (100 acres) were transferred from Kianawah Division to Balmoral Division. The Grassdale Estate land was transferred from Kianawah Division to Bulimba Division. On 3 November 1894, the remaining part of Bulimba Division was renamed Belmont Division. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions with Towns and Shires, replacing the Belmont Division with the Shire of Belmont on 31 March 1903. In the belief that the shire was unable to develop properly without a railway service, the shire built its own railway, the Belmont Tramway, which was officially opened on Saturday 25 May 1912.

Biography Quale tra le pratiche usate in Italia per la dispensa delle acque (1814) He studied medicine, astronomy and mathematics at the University of Pisa. In 1788 he earned his laurea and the same year he started teaching mathematics at the Naval Institute of Livorno. In 1796, when Napoleon entered Italy, he endorsed the new order. Upon the reinstatement of the Austrian rule, he moved to France between 1799 and 1800. On returning he attained a chair at the University of Pisa. In 1801 he moved to the University of Pavia with the office of professor of infinitesimal calculus and become its dean. Brunacci believed that Lagrange's approach, developed in the \\"Th√©orie des fonctions analytiques\\", was the correct one and that the infinitesimal concept was to be banned from analysis and mechanics. In Brunacci's university teaching infinitesimal calculus differently from Lagrange's principles was even prohibited as a rule. Brunacci passed his idea of analysis on to his students, among which Fabrizio Ottaviano Mossotti, Gabrio Piola and Antonio Bordoni. He cooperated with the public administration, in 1805 he was in the Committee for the Naviglio Pavese (Pavia Canal) project and the following year as inspector of Waters and Roads.

Rupert Murdoch , , born in Melbourne, is a major international media proprietor ‚Äì he chairs two United States-based companies that control most of his assets: News Corp and Fox Corporation. Murdoch's career as a media proprietor began in 1952, when he inherited his father's stake in News Limited. The company's only major asset was an Adelaide daily newspaper distributed only in South Australia, The News. During the 1950s and 1960s, News Ltd acquired daily and weekly newspapers, including suburban and provincial publications, throughout Australia and New Zealand. From 1968, Murdoch bought British newspapers, beginning with the weekly News of the World and the daily The Sun. Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. Soon afterwards, he founded a US supermarket tabloid Star, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post. In 1981, Murdoch acquired The Times of London and The Sunday Times. He bought a major stake in 20th Century Fox in 1984, which became the basis of a new US free to air television network, Fox Broadcasting Company. To satisfy a legal requirement that only US citizens could own US television stations, Murdoch became a naturalised US citizen in 1985, and consequently forfeited his Australian citizenship. During the 1980s and 1990s, Murdoch became involved in pay television interests throughout the world, including STAR TV and Tata Sky in Asia and BSkyB, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland in Europe. NewsCorp also came to control both a major international publishing house HarperCollins, and Dow Jones & Company, which includes The Wall Street Journal.

The two strike up a brief conversation, and Savn is often confused by Vlad's behavior, as he has never seen an Easterner before. Vlad's arrival in town is concurrent with the mysterious death of Reins, a former servant of the Baron of Smallcliff. Vlad shows up again at the local inn, causing a stir. He talks to Savn and becomes interested in Reins's death. While most of the village assumes that Vlad killed Reins, Vlad begins to believe that the death did have something to do with him. After some questioning, Vlad determines that the Baron of Smallcliff is still Loraan, an Athyra wizard he killed during the events of Taltos. The time Savn spends with Vlad in public alienates him from his friends in the village. Savn takes Vlad to some nearby caves at his request and begins learning about witchcraft, sorcery, and thinking for himself. Vlad tells him that Loraan is an undead necromancer who killed Reins to draw Vlad out for a Jhereg assassin. Savn also becomes acquainted with Vlad's two jhereg, who are on constant lookout for assassins. Recurring sections from the point of view of Rocza reveal that she obeys the \\"Provider\\" only out of obligation to her mate, Loiosh. Vlad describes his plan to tunnel into Loraan's manor and use the caves' \\"dark water\\" to kill him. Before he can put his plan in action, however, he is attacked at the inn by Loraan's men. Vlad fights them off but becomes seriously wounded before teleporting away. Using Vlad's comments about sorcery as a guide, Savn locates Vlad and treats his injuries, which include a pneumothorax. While the rest of the village searches for Vlad, Savn recruits the master physicker and they fight off Vlad's infection. While recuperating, Vlad confirms Savn's growing suspicion that Vlad has been manipulating him in order to get his help. Savn goes to Loraan's manor and discovers that Vlad's allegations about him are true. Savn is thrown into a cell with his master, who has already been tortured into revealing Vlad's location. Savn treats his master and kills the guard to escape and warn Vlad. He contacts Rocza and summons Vlad into Loraan's cellar, where Loraan and the Jhereg assassin Ishtvan suddenly appear. Savn realizes that Vlad is still too wounded to fight off his attackers. Remembering Vlad's lesson about thinking for himself, Savn dispels his irrational fear of his Baron and uses the caves' \\"dark water\\" to menace the undead Loraan. Vlad uses the distraction to kill Ishtvan, but collapses immediately afterward. Robbed of his power, Loraan simply begins throttling Savn until Rocza slips Ishtvan's Morganti dagger into Savn's hand. Savn kills Loraan with the dreaded dagger, but the horror of the ordeal, and a subsequent head injury, snaps his mind. After reaching safety and healing completely, Vlad resolves to take responsibility for Savn's near catatonic state and seek out treatment for the boy he used. Trivia and Allusions * This is the first Vlad novel to feature a third-person narrative. * This is also the first Vlad novel to feature the narrative mostly through the point of view of a character other than Vlad (Savn). The House of the Athyra House Athyra is one of the noble Houses of the Dragaeran Empire. Members of the House are renowned for their academics and mental prowess. Athyra view knowledge as a means to power and pursue it zealously, focusing either on external study or internal contemplation. Athyra commonly become wizards due to the power of magical knowledge. They generally live solitary lifestyles, cloistered away from society in their pursuit of arcana. As a result, they often gain cold and cruel dispositions. They wear red and white as the colors of their House, and have noble's points that indicate their noble status. The House is named after the athyra, a large bird that uses psionics to attract prey and repel predators.

He lived and worked in Paris. During the 1950s, he was one of the most distinguished painters of Catalan art, known for creating a private language. He belonged to the Abstract Expressionism and European Informalism. These postmodern vanguardists have been characterized by their multiculturalism, manifested in their contrasting pictorial textures, and the need to invent a new mindset. Jim√©nez-Balaguer‚Äôs purpose was to establish a framework of knowledge of the human psyche based on Ferdinand de Saussure‚Äôs language model, in order to show how painting is a universal medium for the understanding of the Self. He regarded the construct of the Self as indispensable, and its visualization as vital; the human inner is neither an impalpable, untouchable soul nor an invisible, immaterial ego. His conception of creation and society involves him in a process of a permanent revolution, from which the subject must struggle for the construction of the Self. His work asserts that the Self is a performative act. Jose Mar√≠a Moreno Galv√°n in 1960 considered him one of the twenty most talented painters of Contemporary Catalan Art.Jos√© Mar√≠a Moreno Galv√°n, Introducci√≥n a la pintura espa√±ola actual 1960, Madrid Two fundamental archetypes structure his field: the Body-Memory and the Exterior-Interior.  Early years  Early on, Jim√©nez-Balaguer paints androgynous figures that exude a metaphysical sentiment. His portraits emphasize what is within, unmarked by gender or cultural identity. Like El Greco, one of his artistic references, he seeks the transcendental essence of being. In 1955, he abandons all description of the world in order to focus on the problem of transforming the invisible to visible. He considers that painting allows for true knowledge of oneself, with the projection of raw material. Following the parameters of Western philosophy, he thinks that all expression is an expression of something; therefore, the sign refers to a reality that constructs the object at the same time as the meaning. According to this tradition, everything is related and has its corresponding channels: everything is connected and meaning is constructed by analogy. His concept of Other Reality arises from here, as well as his work regarding boundaries and the concept of limit. The real, understood symbolically, is found between the Interior and the Exterior, between Corporality and Memory. One of his most important contribution to Catalan Informalism and 21st century painting is referencing this ‚ÄòOther Reality‚Äô as a linguistic-pictorial sign. During these formative years, surrounded by political turmoil, he actively participates in the recognition of a Catalan identity. He learns to write in his language, Catalan, which was prohibited in Francoist Spain. It is years of experimentation for the painter as he works on the hidden matter, that which one keeps inside one‚Äôs psyche: the fragile and subjective. Jim√©nez-Balaguer believes: ‚ÄúThat which is sensed is a reflection of the intelligible‚Äù, and he does not cease searching for the fundamental concept of individuation and independence. = Catalan Lyrical Abstraction = At the age of twenty, he goes to the mountains of the monastery in Montserrat and begins to paint with his friend, Josep Guinovart, experimenting a new freedom and liberating himself of the contingency of convention. He meets Ces√°reo Rodr√≠guez-Aguilera and his wife Mercedes de Prat, and a close friendship ensues. He publishes a manifesto, He Escuchado, whereby he defines his aspirations along the vein of Stanley Cavell: ‚ÄòClaim is what a voice does when it founds within itself in order to establish a universal assertion.‚ÄôSandra Laugier, Le priv√©, le secret et la voix du langage ordinaire, 2002 His sensibilities are along the lines of Merleau-Ponty regarding his defense of the body as the subject, and Wittgenstein: ‚ÄòThe human body is the best image of the human soul.‚Äô He exhibits in Ciclo Experimental d‚ÄôArt Nou directed by Josep Maria de Sucre i de Grau and Angel Mars√° and his paintings enrich the contemporary Catalan art scene. At the Galer√≠a Clan in Madrid, he receives the invaluable support of Manolo Millares, El Paso (grupo) and C√©sar Manrique, the latter becoming a good friend and inviting him to continue their contact. The goal is to impede the obstruction of expression and obtain total freedom of the Self. In 1956, the art critic Juan-Eduardo Cirlot includes him in the Art Informal movement. Catalan identity is in search of specificity, and is in opposition to the official art sanctioned by Francoist Spain. The painters of the 20th century, mainly Joan Mir√≥, insist on the need for a new art. In 1957, in the European May Salons, intellectuals such as Antoni T√†pies and Laurent Jim√©nez-Balaguer, present their latest works. All the Informalist painters evince a critical vision against a world of oppression and exclusion, dominated by diverse imperialisms. = Informalism and Information = In the 1970s, in dialogue with the poststructuralist period, he continues to explore the possibilities of a knowledge of the Self. From then on, his work heralds a new period based on the understanding of the problem of human expression and its inabilities, inhibitions, prohibitions, and negations; Jim√©nez-Balaguer‚Äôs paintings are a projection of the visualization of the unknown Inner. In spite of the abstraction of the images, he finds no reason they would be mysterious, magical nor mute; instead, they should be able to communicate meaning. The utility of a sign, is its power to give universal information that allows giving the subject more power. Although, Inform in Catalan language, is that which has no form, Jim√©nez-Balaguer chooses to investigate the second meaning of the word. As all words, ‚Äòinform‚Äô is not a univocal concept but a polysemous one. ‚ÄòInform‚Äô is also an exhaustive and organized exposition regarding a topic. Therefore, according to Jim√©nez-Balaguer, Informal is telling information that still has no form, and Informalism is the science of the formation of the meaning. Informalism becomes, from this perspective, the artistic current that visualizes the space where significance is built.

It is constructed as a critique against contemporary society that produces the destruction of subjectivity. During these years, Jim√©nez- Balaguer concerns himself with the power of painting as force. He thinks that the informalist image bears witness to a semiotic pre-symbolic memory. It is during this time that he frees himself from the destruction of the 1950s and the scratchings of postwar Informalism, in order to step into the 21st century. As such, after the amputations, the fragmentation of the image, the details of the wound, the assimilation of negativity and violence exercised against the matter of the Self, there is the human psyche that is capable of reconstructing itself. Jim√©nez-Balaguer focuses his art on the transformation of violence into Form. = Constitution of a universal language of the Self = During the 1960s, Jim√©nez-Balaguer and his wife Mar√≠a Teresa Andreu (Mery) relocate to Paris and establish themselves in the intellectual milieu. They have four children, Cristian, Virginie, Val√©rie and Eric. He meets the Parisian jeweler, Jean Vendome. In 1961, he is introduced to Antoni Clav√© and Stephen Spender from Gallery Saint-Germain. From then on and for the next twenty years, he develops a language of signs able to communicate the universal language of the Self. As such, it is a deconstruction of the idea that a private language cannot be understood by another. For Jim√©nez-Balaguer, the Inner has as a destiny: universal communication. In 1986, he meets Michel Tapi√©, the originator of the concept ‚ÄòArt Autre‚Äô and he is introduced to Rodolphe Stadler. From 1988 onward, he introduces a series of objects of the world in order to express the inward. His paintings become an enunciation with branches, ropes, cloth, grids, and nails.

From 1990, Laurent Jim√©nez-Balaguer devises the first system of signs for a universal language of the Inner. Each painting becomes the space for the visualization of the universal language of the Self from which the construction of the subject is confirmed. His work questions the classic attributes of the subject: time, acquired memory, and suffering. His works enquire on such elements. In 2000, he begins his philosophical dialogues with Alexis Virginie Jimenez on Catalan Art and Informalism; together, they create the artistic movement known as New Informalism. The movement begins in the year 2000 in his studio in Chevry II, in Gif sur Yvettes. The theoretical base is related to the New Cultural studies. Alexis Virginie Jimenez‚Äôs art videos, ‚ÄòInterventions‚Äô, are taped there. Jim√©nez-Balaguer‚Äôs work shares certain core values intrinsic to the field of Cultural studies and the theoretical struggle of intellectuals such as Julia Kristeva, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Alexis Virginie Jimenez, Judith Butler. The artist questions what to do with the cardinal points of Western metaphysics and how to interpret a new vision of the human identity. = Artwork : Universal graphic lexico = The ropes: symbolize the ties that unite the invisible Inner of man to the universal Totality. ‚ÄòThe rope is an emblematic material of the road that brings the artist to the territory of Informalism‚Äôs Art Autre.‚ÄôToni Mata i Riu, ‚ÄúFor√ßa s√¨gnica‚Äù, Regio 7, 2012, Barcelone Blue branches: symbol of the wanderings of the soul and its realization in a unitarian form.

The phylogenetic origin of the lineage was placed to various parts of Basidiomycota, but according to the analysis of larger datasets it is a (495-million-years-old) sister group of Agaricomycotina. The genome of the fungus contains no mating type locus and the species appears to be asexual. W. ichthyophaga requires at least 1.5 M NaCl for in-vitro growth (or some other osmolyte for an equivalent water activity), and it thrives even in saturated NaCl solution. This makes it the most halophilic fungus known and distinguishes it from halotolerant (e.g. Aureobasidium pullulans) and extremely halotolerant fungi (e.g. Hortaea werneckii), which are able to grow well even in the absence of salt in the medium. Inability to grow without salt is an exception in the fungal kingdom, but is common in halophilic Archaea. The fungus grows in the form of sarcina-like structures, or compact multicellular clumps. These increase in size almost four-fold when exposed to high salinity, and the cell wall experiences a three-fold thickening.. This results in a substantially decreased functional cell volume and is thought to be one of the halotolerance mechanisms of this species. The whole genome sequencing of W. ichthyophaga revealed that it has one of the smallest of all sequenced basidiomycetous genomes (9.6 Mbp, only 4884 predicted proteins). Contrary to what was observed for the extremely halotolerant H. werneckii, in W. ichthyophaga there are almost no expansions in metal cation transporter genes and their expression is not salt-responsive. On the other hand, there is a vast enrichment of hydrophobins (proteins of cell wall with diverse functions and many biotechnological uses), which contain an unusually high proportion of acidic amino acids. High proportion of acidic amino acids is thought to be an adaptation of proteins to high concentrations of salt. Only a limited number of strains of W. ichthyophaga have been isolated so far (from hypersaline water of solar salterns, bitterns (magnesium-rich residual solutions in salt production from sea water) and salted meat).

It is the mammalian homolog of the fly Indy (gene).  Function  SLC13A5 is a tricarboxylate plasma transporter with a preference for citrate. Clinical significance In 2014, by means of exome sequencing it was determined that a genetic mutation of the SLC13A5 gene is the cause of an extremely rare citrate transporter disorder. Mutations in SLC13A5 cause autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy with seizure onset in the first days of life. Those afflicted suffer from seizures, global developmental delay, movement disorder and hypotonia. Reduced expression of this gene is associated with longer lifespan in many organisms, including some non-human primates. Increased expression is associated with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A sugary diet upregulates the expression of the gene, and so does Interleukin 6 signaling.

The road starts at Iffley Road and continues until it becomes Weirs Lane, which ends up at Abingdon Road. It forms part of the B4495 road and is named after Donnington Bridge, a bridge over the River Thames constructed in the 1960s. Donnington Bridge Road is a major destination for Oxford in terms of sports on the River Thames. It is home to the City of Oxford Rowing Club, a rowing club situated near the junction with Meadow Lane on the southern side of Donnington Bridge, and on the eastern bank of the River Isis (the local name for the Thames). On the northern side, there is a Riverside Centre which has a sea cadets club and offers rowing, canoeing, kayaking and rockclimbing for teenagers. History According to some sources, a ford was located in the area, sometimes named 'Stanford' (meaning stone ford) on a Roman road called Port Way, which ran southwest to northeast. It is believed that this is one of the fords which gave Oxford its name. In 1954, Donnington Bridge was proposed in the place of a ferry that previously took vehicles over the Isis. On 22 October 1962, it was officially opened by Viscount Hailsham. His connections with Oxford include being an undergraduate at Christ Church and an MP for Oxford City. In the summer of 2007, Donnington Bridge Road was the site of deep floods which hit most of the country at the time. This area is especially prone to flooding due to its proximity to the River Isis, and some houses are situated at lower points than the river.

In Cuba, cuerda refers to a unit of volume measurement; in Spain and Paraguay, it refers to a unit of distance (length). By unit type Cuerda is a unit of area, volume, and distance (length), depending on the country of use. =Area: Puerto Rico and Guatemala= In Puerto Rico, a cuerda is a traditional unit of land area nearly equivalent to 3,930 square meters, or 4,700 square yards, 0.971 acre, or 0.393 hectare (ha). The precise conversion is 1 cuerda = 3,930.395625 m2. The term \\"Spanish acre\\" instead has been used sometimes by mainlanders. A cuerda and an acre have often been treated as equal because they are nearly the same size. According to Carlos Menocal Villagran, in Guatemala, the term cuerda refers to a unit of area and can have various meanings. Cuerda can refer to areas that are 50 x 50, 40 x 40, 30 x 30, 25 x 25 or 20 x 20 varas (i.e. 2500, 1600, 900, 625, or 400 square varas). In addition, some sources describe a cuerda as 32 x 32 varas. In Guatemala, the linear vara is equivalent to 0.8421 meters. Thus, *One cuerda of 50 x 50 varas = 1,746.84 square meters *One cuerda of 40 x 40 varas = 1,117.98 square meters *One cuerda of 30 x 30 varas = 628.87 square meters *One cuerda of 25 x 25 varas = 436.71 square meters *One cuerda of 20 x 20 varas = 279.50 square meters =Volume: Cuba= In Cuba, a cuerda is a traditional unit of volume for firewood, about 21% smaller than the U.S. cord.

His political stunt started when he was convinced by his cousin Governor Ali Dimaporo to run on the 1961 Philippine general election as Mayor of the town of Binidayan against his relative, the incumbent Mayor during that time, Mayor Omar Olama. After a hard and unpredictable election he won the said election and started his 30-year rule in the town. During the Marcos era, he joined the Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan Party of President Marcos and actively supported the programs and projects of the Marcos Administration. After the People Power, all elected officials has been removed from their respective posts. His brother Hajji Halim Datumulok was appointed as Mayor of the town. But after one year, Sultan Muliloda ran again for the position of Municipal Mayor on the 1988 Philippine local elections and won. Upon the establishment of Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, he actively supported his son-in-law Datu Ismael Camid's candidacy as an Assemblyman of the Regional Legislative Assembly of ARMM. In 1995, he announced his retirement from politics and formally endorsed his eldest son Datu Punudarano Datumulok to be his successor. In 1998, he supported his second son Datu Anwar Datumulok's bid as Mayor of the Municipality of Pagayawan. On the 2010 Philippine general election he endorsed his nephew, Abdullah Datumulok as his candidate for the Mayoralty election of Binidayan. And in 2012, a year before his death, he endorsed and supported his another son-in-law Dimnatang Radia, the current Regional Director Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)-Telecommunication Office Region 10 during that time, to be the next Mayor of Binidayan on the upcoming 2013 Philippine general election. As a leader, he was known for being sincere, dedicated to his work, kind, friendly, helpful, brave and approachable for his constituents. That made him popular and respected leader not only in the town and sultanate of Binidayan but in the entire province. He was also known to be one of the leaders in the Province of Lanao del Sur that settles conflicts or \\"rido\\" (clan feud), because of it, he was expected to run for the Gubernatorial election because of his popularity, achievements and experienced as a graduated mayor and sultan. But instead supported his son Mayor Panny's bid for the mayoralty election in his hometown and Mayor Anwar in Pagayawan, who both won the said positions. During his tenure, he was the most active mayor and the developer of Binidayan. He was even awarded by the Government of the Philippines as the most effective and outstanding mayor. Through his efforts, many projects were implemented, including rural hospitals, public markets, lake ports and many more. Life after political career After retiring from politics, Sultan Muliloda devoted his time managing his coconut plantation at Malabang Lanao del Sur and Marogong Lanao del Sur, he and his wife spent his time in his bungalow house at the middle of the plantation and monthly visiting his children. In 2010 he was ill and diagnosed with kidney disease, in February 2011 he started his dialysis three times a week at Polymedic Medical Plaza in Cagayan de oro City. Death and Burial In March 2013 the Sultan admitted to Polymedic Medical Plaza in Cagayan de Oro City for kidney problems, but was rushed to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and died due to a heart attack.

History Ithaca Division was one of the original divisions created on 11 November 1879 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. It comprised 3 subdivisions. By 1886, the residents of subdivision 1 were petitioning to separate and become the Shire of Windsor, resulting in the establishment of the Shire of Windsor on 11 February 1887. Meanwhile, the residents of subdivision 2 were petitioning to separate and become the Shire of Ithaca, resulting in the creation of the Shire of Ithaca on 18 August 1887. The now much depleted Ithaca Division then requested to be renamed the Enoggera Division and this occurred on 28 March 1888. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced divisions with shires and towns. As a result, on 31 March 1903, the Enoggera Division became the Shire of Enoggera. On 1 October 1925, the shire was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

Starring Djoewariah, Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa, it follows a womaniser named Soedrajat who abuses his status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance. Reviews were mostly positive, with one praising the film's depiction of women's issues in a Muslim society. Plot Soedrajat abuses his high social status in order to womanise and becomes his rich uncle's heir despite the latter having a son, the kindly and noble Soelarsa. The uncle is disappointed with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him. At the wedding, however, the terrible truth about Soedrajat is revealed. One of his former conquests, Tarmini, stands up and tells the crowd, including Soelarsa, of the bridegroom's true nature. In a rage, Soedrajat takes a revolver and shoots Tarmini. With her dying breath, Tarmini makes one last confession. Her father then takes revenge on Soedrajat. Production Wanita dan Satria was produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films. It was directed by Rd Ariffien, a former theatre leader and nationalist journalist who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with Harta Berdarah.; . The story was written by Saeroen, a former journalist with several screenwriting credits for Union. The black-and-white film starred Djoewariah, Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa.; Moesa was the most experienced of these: he had entered the industry in 1938 with Fatima, a production by Tan's Film, and had been with Union since 1940. Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since Bajar dengan Djiwa in 1940, while Ratna Djoewita and Hidajat had not appeared in any films before 1941.; . Release and reception Wanita dan Satria was released in 1941, reaching Bandung by August and Surabaya by September. The film was open to all ages. A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning. As part of the growing movement to attract Indonesian intellectuals, the marketing staff emphasised the respectable (non- theatrical) background of the actors; the intelligentsia had little respect for traditional theatre and its players. A review in the Surabaya-based Soerabaijasch Handelsblad wrote that the film \\"gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society.\\" Another review in the same newspaper wrote that the film \\"is captivating from start to finish\\", one which \\"the film audience in Surabaya should certainly not miss\\". Legacy After Wanita dan Satria, Union produced a further two films; none of these were by Rd. Ariffien, who had left the company. Saeroen likewise left soon after, joining Star Film. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles. Neither Ratna Djoewita nor Hidajat appeared in any films after 1941.; . The film is likely lost; the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

When performing alternating occlusion training, the person wears the occlusion goggles continuously for several hours while performing regular everyday activities. Wearing the device encourages or forces the alternating use of both eyes, similar to eye patching, but rapidly alternating in time. The aim is to circumvent the tendency to suppress the field of view of the weaker eye and to train the capacity for binocular vision. Traditionally, eye patches are used to block the field of view of one eye. Strabismic or amblyopic children are often required to wear an eye patch for hours or days. The use of the patch generally alternates on a daily or weekly basis between the two eyes, with a long time duration for the patching of the stronger eye and a shorter time duration, if any, for the patching of the weaker eye. In contrast to eye patching, training with occlusion goggles allows to use rapid rates of alternation. __TOC__  Flicker rates  The flicker rates at which the occlusion is alternated between the two eyes in alternating occlusion training are generally much slower than those employed by the widespread active shutter 3D glasses for viewing 3D television or cinema. Therapeutic procedures have been proposed in which the active eye is switched after a duration of many seconds (for example, with an ON (occlusion) duration of 40 seconds and an OFF state (open) duration of 20 seconds of each minute); others propose a much faster flicker rate of approximately 5 Hz. (abstract, full text PDF) An alternating occlusion device (the so-called Translid Binocular Interaction Trainer (TBIS) operating at a rate of 9 to 11 Hz) was introduced by Merrill Allen in 1967 to favor parallel processing of the eyes.Merrill J. Allen, Shock treatment for visual rehabilitation, Journal of the American Optometric Association, August 1967, volume 38, number 8, pages 661-662 (referenced here as citation only), and Merrill J. Allen, Opt. J. Rev. Optom. 1969 as cited by: (abstract, full text PDF) The flicker rate is crucial with relation to potential side effects and may possibly be relevant for the efficacy of the training. It has been suggested that the flickering sequence could be adapted to suit the depth of amblyopia, the required duration of treatment, the age of the patient, or could be adapted dynamically according to the visual function behavior of the amblyopic eye.  Side-effects and potential risks  Reported results of the use of alternating occlusion devices include improved vision, as well as occasional side effects of headaches or discomfort. The purchase of such an electronic LCD may require written permission by the patient's optometrist.Electronic Rapid Alternate Occlusion Goggles , Optometric Extension Program Foundation (OEPF), downloaded 20 August 2013 It was found that the flicker rates of 9 to 11 Hz that were employed in the TBIS device are slow enough and the stimulus weak enough to avoid any risk of epileptic seizure. In principle alternating occlusion may interfere with normal visual input. Strictly speaking, alternating occlusion is a form of visual deprivation and as such may have negative effects during a critical period of development. Experiments on kittens that were published 1965 by Hubel and Wiesel showed that continuously submitting kittens at a young age to a protocol under which the eyes were alternatingly occluded on a day-by-day basis over a prolonged period of time led to changes in the visual cortex, in particular a disruption in cellular connections that would normally enable binocular vision. Experiments with rearing young kittens under rapidly alternating monocular occlusion using constantly-worn electronic goggles showed that cortical binocularity was reduced if the flicker rate was 2 Hz or lower, and that binocularity developed normally if it was 2.5 or 3 or 5 Hz.

Originally built for the British Royal Navy, as HMS John Ebbs, the ship is notable for its role in evacuating Belgian gold reserves to England during the Battle of Belgium in May 1940. The success of the operation not only allowed the Belgian government in exile to fund its operations but deprived the German occupiers of an important asset to support their war effort. After the Belgian surrender, the vessel and its crew interned themselves in neutral Spain. Both crew and vessel were released in 1946 and A4 was scrapped soon afterwards. Background Pilote 4 (later renamed Patrouilleur A4) was purchased by the Belgian Corps de Marine in 1920, having previously served in the British Royal Navy during the First World War as HMS John Ebbs (FY3566). The vessel was a Mersey-class naval trawler, built by Cochranes in Selby, North Yorkshire, and was launched on 2 October 1917. Displacing , the vessel was long, and had a draught of . Fitted with engines that were capable of producing , it could travel at between . With a complement of 27, the Belgians armed the ship with two Maxim machine guns on the bridge and a gun at the stern. In 1939, A4 was waiting to be scrapped, but the deteriorating international situation caused by German expansionism led to its reactivation by the Ministry of National Defence. Because of Belgium's neutral status in the early stages of the Second World War, A4 had large Belgian tricolours painted on each side of its hull, as well as the word \\"BELGI√ã\\" (Dutch for \\"Belgium\\") in white, to prevent it being mistaken for a belligerent ship. After Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940, it was not repainted. Evacuation of Belgian gold During the interwar period, Belgium had created a gold-based currency, called the Belga, which ran parallel to the Belgian franc. The Belga was intended for international trading and meant that the National Bank of Belgium amassed considerable gold reserves, amounting to some by 1940. During the escalating international tensions in the 1930s, the Belgian government began moving large amounts of gold to the United States, Great Britain and Canada, but was forced to retain some gold in the country to maintain the Belga's value. By the time the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship available in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns for the safety of the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank. The fact that so much Belgian gold had been rescued before the German occupation allowed the Belgian government in exile to finance its own operations, unlike most other exiled governments which had to rely on British financial support. Aftermath Since Belgium had officially surrendered on 28 May and no official Belgian government yet existed in England, the crew of A4 took their ship to Bilbao in neutral Spain to avoid having to return to Belgium and become German prisoners of war. They arrived in Spain on 26 June and spent the rest of the war interned. Control of the ship was returned to Belgium in 1946 and it was scrapped in 1948. For his role in the evacuation of the gold, Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh was awarded the Order of Leopold II.

He was the twelfth son of Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia. He was the father of Faisal bin Musaid, the assassin of his brother King Faisal. Early life Musa'id was born in 1923. His father Ibn Saud became King of Saudi Arabia in 1932. His mother was Jawhara bint Saad bin Abdul Muhsin Al Sudairi. Before marrying Ibn Saud she had been married to Ibn Saud's full brother, Sa'd bin Abdul-Rahman, until Sa'd's death in 1915. Her sister, Haya Al Sudairi, was also a spouse of Ibn Saud and the mother of Prince Badr, Prince Abdul Majid and Prince Abdul Illah. Musa'id had two full- brothers Prince Saad and Prince Abdul Muhsin and one full-sister Princess Al Bandari. Personal life Following the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia Musa'id and his brothers began to live in several European cities, including Paris and London among the others. During this period Musa'id was caught in an inappropriate manner in Paris and was immediately sent to Saudi Arabia. King Abdulaziz confined Musa'id to the palace which made their relations negative decreasing the latter's potential chance to rule the country. Musa'id married Watfa, a daughter of Muhammad bin Talal, the 12th (and last) Rashidi amir. Their son Faisal bin Musaid was born in Riyadh on 4 April 1944. He subsequently divorced Watfa. His sons and daughters by Watfa were much closer to their maternal Rashidi relatives than their paternal relatives, Al Sauds. In 1965, his son Khaled, who was a fervent Wahhabite, was killed during a Riyadh protest against the introduction of television in Saudi Arabia. The details of his death are disputed. Some reports allege that he died resisting arrest outside his own home. No investigation over his death was ever initiated. Musa'id had another son, Bandar, and a daughter, Al Jawhara. He also had another son Abdul Rahman bin Musaid from a subsequent marriage. Abdullah bin Musa'id, another son, is a businessman and the owner of Sheffield United. Assassination of King Faisal On 25 March 1975 his son Faisal bin Musaid went to the Royal Palace in Riyadh, where King Faisal was holding a majlis. He joined a Kuwaiti delegation and lined up to meet the king. The king recognized his nephew and bent his head forward, so that the younger Faisal could kiss the king's head in a sign of respect. The prince took out a revolver from his robe and shot the King twice in the head. His third shot missed and he threw the gun away. King Faisal fell to the floor. Bodyguards with swords and submachine guns arrested the prince. The king was quickly rushed to a hospital but doctors failed to save him. Initial reports described Faisal bin Musaid as \\"mentally deranged.\\" He was moved to a Riyadh prison. He was deemed sane to be tried.\\"Milwaulkee Sentinel.\\" Faisal's lawyer Will Stand Trial [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] 31 Mar. 1975: 2. Print. He was found guilty of murder. Hours after the verdict, he was publicly decapitated in Riyadh. The assassin's brother Bandar was also imprisoned, but was released a year later. Later life Prince Musa'id did not hold any significant administrative positions and hence he was sidelined for the throne. The involvement of his son Faisal in the assassination of King Faisal could also have weakened his position. In addition he seemingly never sought one. He gradually lost his eyesight after the death of his first son, Khalid. He lived an austere private life where he was known to be pious. Death The Royal Diwan announced that Prince Musa'id had died on 19 August 2013. He was the second eldest living son of Ibn Saud at the time of his death next only to Prince Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. It was announced that funeral prayers for the late prince would be held at Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque in Riyadh the next day and a three-day mourning period was also declared.

The station was established in the early 1880s when artesian water was drilled so large volumes were available to water stock. A shepherd for the station was advertised in 1882, and the owner of Wooramel in 1883 was John Winthrop Hackett. The unstocked station was put on the market in 1885, at which time it occupied an area of . The property had a flock of approximately 21,000 sheep including 5,000 lambs in 1910. During shearing of the same year 325 bales of wool were produced. In 1923 Ernest A. Hall sold Sherlock Station to Edward Meares and acquired Wooramel Station. Hall immediately set to drilling bores to find permanent water sources for the flock. Three bores were sunk during 1924 to a depth of and were producing flows of millions of gallons per day. The station suffered from extensive damage from flooding following the passing of the remnants over a cyclone over the area in 1945. Father O'Sullivan, the flying padre, was forced to land his Tiger Moth airplane on a claypan at Wooramel in 1956 after experiencing engine trouble and poor visibility. He was sighted later by the pilot of a MacRobertson Miller DC3 that had been diverted to search. O'Sullivan was later rescued by a search party that had to cut a road from Wooramel to the site. The area was struck by years of drought until large scale flooding occurred in late 2010 following heavy rains from a tropical low. of rain fell in 24 hours and once the waters ebbed away locusts became a problem.

It was replaced by the first generation Prince Skyline ALSI in 1957. The Prince Sedan AISH had live axles in front and the back. In March 1956, the Prince Sedan Special AMSH was added to the line-up. It had a double wishbone suspension in front. Background The Tama Electric Car Company was producing several kinds of electric vehicles. Before the Korean War, the supply of gasoline was controlled by the GHQ and was expensive. In June 1950, the Korean War broke out. The price of batteries became extremely high (approximately ten times). On the other hand, the price of gasoline became cheaper. Tama Electric Car could not continue to produce electric vehicles. In September 1950, they decided to produce new gasoline vehicles instead of electric vehicles. In November 1950, they officially ordered the Fuji Precision Industries, one of the successors of disbanded Nakajima Aircraft Company, to design and produce a new gasoline engine for Tama. Tama finally stopped building electric vehicles in September 1951. In the next month, Fuji Precision completed the new gasoline engine named FG4A. This engine was based on the engine of the Peugeot 202 which was owned by Shojiro Ishibashi, the Bridgestone founder and the owner of the Tama Motors and the Fuji Precision. This engine (later renamed as G-1) was improved and modified gradually and was used until 1968 for the basic version of Prince Skyline S50, and was shared with the Subaru 1500 the first Subaru manufactured. (The upper version S57 used the new G15 SOHC engine in 1967 and 1968.) Around ten people belonged to Tama's development team headed by the design manager Jiro Tanaka. His assistant manager Takuya Himura, who would become the direct boss of Shinichiro Sakurai in October 1952, was in charge of the development of the Prince Sedan and other vehicles.1954 Prince Sedan AISH-II (JSAE Official Website) AISH-1 In 1952 the AISH-1 was introduced. An evolution of the previous Tama Senior sedan, the front end resembled Russian cars of the era and the side had a European look. The engine was the new 1.5L FG4A-10, an enlarged and modified version of the Peugeot 202 engine. There was also a truck version based on the AISH-1, the AFTF-1, which was also available in double cab and van versions. The AISH-1 was in production until June 1953, when it was replaced by the AISH-2. AISH-2 The AISH-2 was released in 1953 and was in production until November 1954. Although the styling was nearly identical to the previous model, the AISH-2 was both wider and slightly taller, thanks to changes in legislature in Japan in late 1952 that allowed the production of slightly larger passenger cars. The only other change was to the wheels, which were changed from 16 inches on the AISH-1 to more modern 15-inch ones. The engine and transmission were carried over unchanged from the previous model. Rear view of Prince Sedan AISH-2 AISH-3 The AISH-3 was released in November 1954. The changes to the AISH-3 were cosmetic, with a new grille design as well as a new side strip design. Engine and transmission remained the same. The AISH-3 was short-lived as it was replaced by the AISH-4 after only two months in production. AISH-4 The AISH-4 was released in February 1955 and was identical to the AISH-3 except for the engine, which was modified with a new cylinder head design that raised compression, increasing power to and top speed to . AISH-5 The AISH-5 was released in October 1955. The engine and transmission remained the same, but the exterior was redesigned. The grille was changed and now featured a \\"V\\" cast in the middle bar. The side strips were redesigned with a 45 degree bend in the front portion. Two-tone paint, a popular option, was introduced with the AISH-5. In addition to the Sedan Standard there was also a Deluxe model, featuring extra equipment such as a radio, white sidewall tires, and an exterior sun visor. In 1955 two commercial vehicles based on the AISH-5 were released: the AIPC-1 double cab pickup and the AIVE-1 delivery van. In March 1956 the AMSH-1 was released. This model was nearly identical to the AISH-5 except for the double wishbone independent front suspension which provided improved ride quality. AISH-6 The AISH-6, the final model in the AISH series, was released in October 1956. The grille was the same as the previous model, but the side strips were changed, now running horizontally the length of the car, except for a small V-shaped dip near the back of the rear doors. Two-tone paint remained available, but the colors were reversed: the dominant color was on the top section of the car and the contrast section on the bottom, opposite that of the previous model. Engine power increased again to thanks to higher compression as improved quality fuel was becoming available in Japan. The commercial variants were upgraded as well and were redesignated AIPC-2 and AIVE-2. An upmarket model with independent front suspension, the AMSH-2, was also available.

The farm is part of the gardens of Highgrove House, the country home of Charles, Prince of Wales. The produce is used as ingredients in Duchy Originals products, sold in vegetable boxes, and wholesaled to supermarkets and restaurants. Prince Charles is credited with using \\"pioneering agriculture techniques\\" to produce this organic food. Sustainability, organic, and biodynamic farming Charles, Prince of Wales, an advocate of organic farming methods Located in Tetbury, the Home Farm sells fruit and vegetables grown at Highgrove House, Prince Charles's Gloucestershire home. The estate uses sustainable farming practices and is run by a farm manager, David Wilson, with a supporting staff. Prince Charles converted the Home Farm estate to organic farming in 1986. He was initially criticised for some of his methods with many British farmers disliking his choice to avoid modern techniques. Since that time a significant number of farms have subsequently switched to organic agriculture, and visit Dutchy Home Farm to review methods there. In 2006 Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association declared that \\"I don't think it can be overestimated\\" how much that was due to the Prince's influence. Clarence House states that Prince Charles has \\"been pioneering agriculture techniques for over 30 years and continues to do so\\". Home Farm is reported to use \\"biodynamic farming\\" methods. This includes planting seeds according to the lunar cycle and using homoeopathic potions on the leaves of plants. The roof of the dairy was fitted with over 400 solar panels in 2011. They cover an area of around 691 square metres and are estimated to generate 86,000 kWh per annum. The farm epitomises Prince Charles's belief of working with organic methods: Farming and sales Ingredients grown at the Home Farm are used in Duchy Originals products. This ranges from milk and pork to barley and grain. The farm supplies carrots and potatoes to restaurants, supermarkets, and local schools as a wholesaler. In 1998 they began operating a vegetable box scheme for homes within a 15-mile radius of Tetbury. By 2010 they were selling over 250 boxes every week with an section of the farm dedicated to the scheme. The growing demand for the boxes and requests from customers to choose their own produce led to the creation of The Veg Shed. The Veg Shed operated every Wednesday in a converted barn. It closed in May 2013 after eight years of trading because it was no longer making a profit; in 2014 the area given over for vegetable production was being grazed by rare breed pigs. The shop was known for its \\"evocative potting-shed smell\\" and for selling unusually shaped vegetables that would normally be rejected for sale in supermarkets. While most of the Veg Shed produce came from the Home Farm there were other items for sale from further away, including lemons and bananas.

Early life and arrival in Australia Peter was born in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1818. His surname has been frequently misspelt as Peters, which sometimes led to confusion, but he was adamant it was Peter. In partnership with his brother (or cousin) Edward Peter, he arrived aged 19 at Adelaide, South Australia in January 1839 aboard the Indus. Promptly making their way to New South Wales by sea, the Messrs. Peter there purchased 12,500 sheep from the celebrated flocks of Icely & Co. and then successfully overlanded these from Bathurst to Adelaide in June 1840. Unlike some overlanders, they had no conflict with Aboriginal people along the route, which they were proud of. They were also proud that their flocks, mostly kept on and around the River Light, were scab free. Mid-North of South Australia The partners then took up pastoralist occupation licences at various locations in the lower Mid North, turning their flocks out onto these unfenced runs under the care of wandering shepherds. Their first head station, established in 1840, was on the Light River just east of present-day Marrabel. Around this time Peters Hill, a prominent peak on their runs, southwest of Marrabel, was named. W.S. Peter is listed in a government return of 1841 as the fifth largest sheep holder in the Province, the first being the South Australian Company. One of the drovers assisting W.S. Peter to overland livestock from New South Wales was a bachelor named William Roach. He was no stranger to the courts. Roach, aged about 40, was appointed by W.S. Peter as store-keeper at his station on the River Light. In August 1841, near the River Light, Roach encountered an Aboriginal man named Tudnurtya/Worta who had apparently slaughtered one of W.S. Peter's calves. A confrontation resulted in which Roach shot the Aboriginal man dead.Southern Australian newspaper, 3 September 1841, p.3. Roach's initial charge of murder was later downgraded to manslaughter and he was eventually dismissed without penalty. By then Roach had moved on to be employed as stock-keeper by C.J.F. Campbell at his Hill River run, near Clare. Again there were confrontations with Aboriginals allegedly killing and stealing cattle. In February 1845 Roach was visiting his employer Campbell at his Adelaide residence when he fell from his horse while intoxicated and was killed.Register newspaper, 19 February 1845, page 3. W.S. Peter held extensive occupation licences during the 1840s, setting up many outstations in the Mid-North for his flocks. Those outstations included the upper reaches of the Light River and the subsequent site of the Burra copper mine.Southern Australian, 6 January 1843, page 1S. Peter had shepherd huts at Burra as early as 1842. In 1844 he had 10,000 sheep depastured on a station known as Emu Lodge, or Emu Springs, with headquarters at Black Springs on the River Gilbert in County Light.Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, (Adelaide, 1927), Vol II, page 261. Peter then established his Gum Creek Station near Hanson, about 16 km southwest of Burra, being regarded as a prominent pioneer and citizen of the Manoora region. The fame and reputation of his Gum Creek Station was later imitated by the naming of a pastoral property in the Flinders Ranges. Eyre Peninsula In 1842 he was one of the four pastoralists in a volunteer party led by James Collins Hawker that went, along with a police party led by Inspector Tolmer, in search of Charles Christian Dutton, an ill-fated pastoralist of the Port Lincoln district. Resulting from this experience, in 1846 in partnership with George and Alex Elder, founders of Elders Limited, he established a sheep run named Warrow Station at Coulta near Port Lincoln. Having moved there, he was appointed a justice and magistrate for that district. In that role he conducted the coronial inquest into the murder of neighbouring pastoralist James Rigby Beevor. He married in 1856 to Jane Seymour, a daughter of pastoralist Henry Seymour of Killanoola station near Naracoorte. Jane's elder sister Elizabeth had married in 1845 to George Charles Hawker of Bungaree and Anama Stations, to whom W.S. Peter was now brother in law. After marriage he returned to his Gum Creek run, at the same time going into partnership with the Elder brothers in pioneering the Booleroo run, near present Booleroo Centre. By 1861 the combined Gum Creek and Booleroo runs comprised an area of 896 square miles and were carrying 60,500 sheep. On 28 February 1861 both runs, plus 27,700 sheep, were profitably auctioned when W.S. Peter decided to settle in the Canterbury region of New Zealand as a stud sheep breeder.Register newspaper, 15 February 1861, page 4. He and his family departed from Adelaide in June 1861 aboard the Oscar.Adelaide Advertiser newspaper, 10 June 1861, page 2. The Moonta Mine leases A controversial incident took place on 25 May 1861, a few weeks before their departure. W.S. Peter's stock and station agents were Elder, Stirling & Co. The firm were also agents for Walter Hughes, who just a few months earlier had been the purchaser of W.S. Peter's Gum Creek Station. Hughes also had a pastoral run at Wallaroo, where in December 1859 a shepherd discovered copper ore, leading to the establishment of Wallaroo Mines. When another shepherd made a similar discovery in May 1861 several rival claimants rushed to make their applications but at first were uncertain as to the exact locality. This was to become the fabulously rich mines at Moonta. In order to divert attention and prevent a rush, Elders used W.S. Peter's name on the original claim for these mineral leases, later being transferred by him to Hughes and his Company. The losing syndicate cried foul on this subterfuge, leading to a State Select Committee, chaired by G.S. Kingston, leading to court action which was eventually settled out of court.Register newspaper, 26 September 1863, pp 4‚Äì5. New Zealand In the meantime Peter had arrived at Canterbury, settling at Anama, near Ashburton, where he bred merinos.http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei- AclEarl-t1-body-d11-d1.html The name Anama was derived from his South Australian connection. The Peter Range, a mountain range at Canterbury, bears his name. A successful sheep-farmer, W.S. Peter was an equally successful politician, being appointed on 23 June 1868 to represent the Canterbury region on the Legislative Council; he remained a member until his death. He died on 23 May 1891 at Ashburton Hospital after a short illness. His son, Charles James Peter, married Violet Sealy on 21 December 1898 at St Mary's Church in Timaru. She was the eldest child of the surveyor, photographer, explorer, farmer, and entomologist Edward Sealy. Their daughter, Juliet Peter, became a notable potter.

The play is described by its authors as \\"three acts with a prologue\\" (\\"Com√©die en trois Actes, pr√©c√©d√©e d'un prologue\\"). It premiered at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville, Paris, on 27 October 1893, starring R√©jane in the title role. The play was revived many times in France and toured in the English provinces in 1897. It was also adapted as an opera, in 1915, and several times for film. Synopsis The first scene of the play is set in Catherine H√ºbscher's laundry in the Rue Sainte-Anne, Paris, on 10 August 1792. Catherine, who always speaks her mind, is known as \\"Madame Sans-G√™ne\\" of which an approximate English translation is \\"Madame Without-Embarrassment\\". She is engaged to Sergeant Lefebvre, a member of the Revolutionary forces. She rescues a young Austrian nobleman, Count Neipperg, from the pursuing militia. Lefebvre has the chance to betray Neipperg's hidden presence, but respects Catherine's desire to protect him. Once the hue and cry has died down they help him escape. R√©jane as Catherine (centre right) and Madeleine Verneuil and Camille-Gabrielle Drunzer, left, as Napoleon's sisters The rest of the play is set at the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne in September 1811, during the reign of Napoleon I. Lefebvre, who has married Catherine, has distinguished himself in the army and has been appointed Marshal of the Empire and Duke of Danzig. He and his wife are visited by Neipperg, who has been at the French court (where the Empress, Marie Louise, is Austrian) but is now obliged to leave, suspected of an affair with the wife of a high-ranking Frenchman. At a soir√©e Catherine ‚Äì sans-g√™ne as ever ‚Äì offends the emperor's sisters and the ladies of the court by her plain speaking. Napoleon tells Lefebvre that it is his duty to divorce Catherine and marry someone more suitable, reminding him that he himself renounced his beloved Jos√©phine to remarry for duty. Lefebvre refuses. Napoleon sends for Catherine, who reminds him of her past contributions to the Revolutionary cause in general and to Napoleon in particular: she nonplusses him by producing an old laundry bill of his that she had permitted to go unpaid when he was a penniless young soldier. She wins him round from anger to flirtatious good humour, and he agrees to drop the suggestion of divorce. Neipperg is apprehended in suspicious circumstances that make it seem that he is the empress's lover. Napoleon orders his execution. The Lefebvres and their friend Joseph Fouch√© are compromised by their association with Neipperg. Fouch√©'s enemy Savary hopes to encompass their disgrace, but proof of Neipperg's innocence comes to light at the last moment. Napoleon congratulates Fouch√© on his cleverness, but has to agree when Fouch√© tells him that in Catherine he has found someone still cleverer. The idea of a divorce is firmly ruled out, Fouch√© and the Lefebvres are restored to favour, and Savary is dismissed.Sardou and Moreau, pp. 3‚Äì83 Productions Images of premiere production, from Le Gaulois, February 1894 =France= The original cast included R√©jane as Catherine, a role she continued to play throughout her career.

He is the current manager of the Chunichi Dragons in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Although born in Fukuoka prefecture, Yoda grew up in Kimitsu, Chiba Prefecture. His wife is TBS Television announcer, Hiroko Kiba. Early Career He is the son of Kenji and Atsuko Yoda. He has two siblings, Kozue and Kaori. Yoda attended Kisarazu Chuo High School (now Kisarazu S≈çg≈ç High School) in Chiba Prefecture before entering Asia University. Yoda was troubled with injury during much of his time in college caused by blood flow issues from throwing too much during high school. However, as a member of NTT East in the industrial leagues, Yoda's 150km/h fastball caught the eye of national team selectors as well as professional scouts. At the 1989 NPB Draft Yoda was selected in the first round by the Chunichi Dragons after showing a preference for a non-Tokyo team. Yoda signed on a provisional contract with a ¬•75,000,000 sign-on bonus and a ¬•7,200,000 yearly salary. Professional Career Yoda's first appearance came in on April 7 1990 against the Yokohama Taiyo Whales on opening day. In the 11th inning with one out and runners on 1st and 3rd, he threw two strikeouts to close out his inning. From that point on Yoda was made full-time closer by manager Senichi Hoshino and on June 1 passed double-digit saves. Yoda received the fan vote to appear in the 1990 All-Star game going on to claim 31 saves as well as claiming Rookie of the Year and Most valuable reliever awards. On 15 August at Hiroshima Municipal Stadium, Yoda threw a 157km/h fastball, which was at the time a Japanese record. After the 1990 season, Yoda played on a team of Japanese all-stars, opposing American all- stars. While continuing as a reliever, Yoda had shoulder and elbow issues and was unable to leave behind any notable results after only 4 years of service. Halfway through the 1996 season, Yoda was traded to the Chiba Lotte Marines for Naoyuki Nait≈ç and in the same year enjoyed a study abroad with the Memphis Chicks of the Class AA Southern League. However, elbow injuries limited him. On return to the Marines, Yoda failed to make any first-team appearances and was released in the 1997 off-season. He signed for the Nippon-Ham Fighters in 1998 via a try-out. The Fighters without a full-time closer had hoped Yoda would make the team, but he ended the season failing to make an appearance for either the top or farm team. However, due to pitching well in the fall development league he stayed with the team for a further year. On 2 October 1999, Yoda made his first pitching appearance in 4 years but was released at the end of the year. The Hanshin Tigers would give Yoda another chance to revive his career in 2000 with then manager Katsuya Nomura mentioning in spring training that he was among the shortlist for closer. After pitching well in a pre-season game, Yoda was unable to get out of bed the following day following lumbar pain. Unable to fully recover, Yoda pitched in two farm games before eventually being released in the fall. Post-playing career =NHK Analyst and national team coaching= From 2001 to 2015, Yoda served as a color analyst for NHK baseball broadcasts. During this time, Yoda was also a columnist for Tokyo Chunichi Sports Shimbun as well as serving as a pitching coach for the Japan women's national baseball team and club team, Thousand Leaf Ichihara. Yoda served as a coach for the Japanese national baseball team in the 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classic. =Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles= On 13 October 2015, Yoda was appointed as pitching coach of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. In the off-season of the same year, Yoda was listed alongside Kazuyoshi Tatsunami, Takeshi Yamasaki, Hideki Hashigami, Kazuhiro Sasaki and Takashi Saito to take over as Rakuten manager. Masataka Nashida however would be the successful candidate. From 2018, Yoda was demoted to work with the Rakuten farm pitchers and at the end of the season was released. =Chunichi Dragons= On the 17th of October 2018, Yoda was instated as the new manager of his former club the Chunichi Dragons. Personal life Yoda's shoulder breadth has been somewhat of a topic since his playing days and has been measured at 60cm. Major leaguer, Yu Darvish who is 10cm taller than Yoda has been reported as saying \\"what's going on with those shoulders?\\" On Yoda's aforementioned debut with the Taiyo Whales, there was a cross-play involving Whales player Yoshiyuki Shimizu tackling then Dragons catcher, Takeshi Nakamura which almost lead to a brawl. Later on 22 June 1994, after striking Whales outfielder, Glenn Braggs, Yoda failed to tip his hat leading to Braggs charging the mound. Yoda and Braggs were ejected from the game after the following a bench-clearing brawl. Yoda hates the words \\"gambare\\" (do your best) and \\"doryoku\\" (determination), preferring the word junbi (preparation). After becoming Dragons manager, Yoda declared that he would use \\"player that are best prepared\\" and that he has explained \\"the importance of preparation before a game.\\" References External links *Dragons.jp *Rights Inc.

Luarsab also married Rostom's niece by whom he had a son. Luarsab was killed while on a hunt. A homicide was immediately suspected. The suspect was tried by single combat and wounded, but acquitted by virtue of being a victor in the duel.  Family background  Luarsab was a son of Prince Teimuraz-Mirza of Kartli ( 1600) and his wife, an anonymous daughter of Prince David Bagration-Davitishvili. He had a brother, Vakhtang (Rostom-Mirza; died 1655). He was a scion of all three royal branches of the Bagrationi dynasty; through his father, Luarsab was a great-grandson of King Luarsab I of Kartli and, through his mother, he descended from the Kakhetian and Imeretian royal families. The 18th-century Georgian chronicler Prince Vakhushti erroneously identifies Luarsab as \\"son of Vakhtang, son of King Simon\\", who was Luarsab I's son. This genealogy has been accepted by some modern scholars such as Cyril Toumanoff.  Biography  Luarsab was Muslim, living in Isfahan, the capital of the Iranian Safavids. In 1639, he was adopted and designated as heir apparent to the throne of Kartli by his father‚Äôs first cousin, the seasoned king Rostom, who had no children of his own. With the shah's approval, Luarsab was brought in Kartli, but the local nobility resented yet another Persian-educated Bagratid. Luarsab was mortally wounded by a bullet while on a hunt in the Karaia grove and died in the presence of the mourning Rostom. The prince's remains were interred at Ardabil. Prince Luarsab was married to Tamar, daughter of Prince Adam-Sultan Andronikashvili, member of the shah's elite ghulam guard, by an anonymous princess, half-sister of King Rostom. Although Prince Vakhushti claims that with Luarsab's death \\"the line of the great king Luarsab became extinct\\", the prince had a son, Giorgi (fl. 1652) and a grandson, Khosro (fl. 1700).  Aftermath  Rostom suspected his heir's death was not an accident and requested an inquiry from Isfahan, but nothing came of this as the shah's government was preoccupied with the war in Kandahar. In the meantime, Prince Shiosh Baratashvili denounced Prince Baindur Tumanishvili as a possible murderer and had him publicly tried by single combat in Tbilisi. Tumanishvili was wounded, but won the duel and was thus acquitted. Baratashvili, also wounded and defeated, was cast in prison by Rostom, but was later pardoned and, the 18th-century Georgian Paris Chronicle says, Prince Luarsab \\"remained unavenged\\". After the loss of his heir, Rostom intended to adopt the late Prince Luarsab's brother Vakhtang and, to the chagrin of many Georgians, give him Luarsab's widow in marriage. Vakhtang, serving to the shah as a prefect of Qazvin and having the example of his brother before him, was reluctant. Arriving in Isfahan in 1655, Rostom's envoy, Bakhuta, Prince of Mukhrani, found Prince Vakhtang already dead of illness. Within three years, the Prince of Mukhrani would become Rostom's new choice as heir apparent and would succeed him on the throne of Kartli as Vakhtang V.

At the time that Fellwock blew the whistle on ECHELON, the NSA was a nearly unknown organization and among the most secretive of the US intelligence agencies. Fellwock revealed that it had a significantly larger budget than the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Fellwock was motivated by Daniel Ellsberg's release of the Pentagon Papers. Today, Fellwock has been acknowledged as the first NSA whistleblower. (Archive) ECHELON is the name popularly given to the signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis network operated on behalf of the five signatory states (so called \\"Five Eyes\\" FVEY) to the UKUSA Security Agreement. According to information in a European Parliament document \\"On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system)\\", ECHELON was ostensibly created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s. Because of the Fellwock revelations, the U.S. Senate United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\\"Church Committee\\" as it was chaired by Frank Church) introduced successful legislation in 1973 to stop the NSA from spying on American citizens. Speaking about ECHELON, Frank Church said: > \\"...[T]hat capability at any time could be turned around on the American > people and no American would have any privacy left, such [is] the capability > to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't > matter.

It is a tributary of the Gier, which in turn is a tributary of the Rh√¥ne. The Gier valley was formerly heavily industrialized with coal and iron mines and factories. Basin The Dorlay rises in Mont Pilat. It is long. Tributaries are the Artiole, Mornante and Sellon. The Mornante and Sellon are known for the presence of white-clawed crayfish, a heritage species. The catchment area is about The source of the river is at an altitude of over , while the average elevation of the basin is The upper part of the basin is forested or pastureland. Communities A manuscript of 1200 gives the river the Latin name of Dorleum. In 1224 it is called Aqua de Dorllei. Subsequent mentions call it Rivus de Dorlay (1359), Dorleys (1527), Dourley (1718) and Dourlay (1789). It flows through the communes of La Grand-Croix, Saint-Paul-en-Jarez, Lorette, La Terrasse-sur-Dorlay and Doizieux. In the past, the river powered many weaving workshops in the valley. Dam Construction of a dam on the Dorlay by the town of Rive-de-Gier was discussed in 1884 but the project was abandoned due to cost. Today's Barrage du Dorlay is located at on the river between Doizieux and La Terrasse-sur-Dorlay. It was built between 1971 and 1973. The dam has a storage capacity of , with a catchment area of about . It is at an altitude of about . The dam supplies potable water to the municipalities of Lorette, Chateauneuf, Chagnon, Cellieu, St-Paul-en-Jarez, La Grand-Croix and part of Rive-de-Gier. In 2008 it supplied about of water to about 22,630 people. Since the dam is used for drinking water, swimming is not allowed - but some people swim anyway. Some local people use the dam for canoeing, but there are no rental boats. Coal In 1730 a large coal seam was found along the Dorlay. A number of mines were sunk to a depth of or more. These were worked for a short period, then abandoned due to lack of pumping equipment. Mining resumed in 1776 with pumps operating, but was abandoned in 1792 due to the volume of water entering the mines from the Dorlay. The river's path marks a geological fault in the Loire coal basin. In 1838 the Saint-Philippe mines were sunk on the right bank of the Dorlay to a depth of , but did not find any significant coal deposits.

From a poor background in Scotland, he and his brother Allan had the largest number of sheep in New Zealand. John McLean was also a politician, and he served on the Otago Provincial Council and the New Zealand Legislative Council. Early life McLean was born on Coll in 1818, one of the islands of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. His father, Alexander McLean, was a farmer and fisherman who lived on Lagmor, where he drowned in 1836. Initially, the family was sustained by the large tracts of land they owned on the islands of Tiree and Mull as well as on the mainland at Mowern and Ardnamurchan. But over the years, they needed additional resources to make a livelihood and resorted to fisheries. After his father's death, his mother, Mary, could not make a living with the lands left to her and they were in a penurious state. Mary took the five surviving of her eight children to Australia after widespread crop failure; they left Tobermory, Mull on the George Fyfe on 15 September 1839 and arrived in Sydney on 23 January 1840. John McLean and his brothers Allan and Robertson (Robert) made a living as working class shepherds, and became established enough so that they could buy two sheep runs in west Victoria, which they owned from 1848 to 1851. They capitalised on the Victorian gold rush by supplying the goldfields region, becoming runholders. Life in New Zealand Oamaru Chief Post Office In 1852, the brothers purchased the Ashfield run adjacent to the Waimakariri River in Canterbury, New Zealand, and the family moved to that country. Robertson returned to Scotland, where he died in 1871, but Allan and John owned runs in Canterbury, Otago, and Morven Hills, acquiring the Waikakahi property near Waimate from a Mr. Harris in 1866. Their sister Alexandrina (known to the family as Lexie) had married George Buckley in 1860, and Buckley became a shareholder in the Waikakahi run, but sold out to the brothers in 1875. In 1880, Allan and John's partnership ended. John and Allan McLean were New Zealand's largest owners of sheep by numbers. John McLean eventually settled in Oamaru, North Otago. McLean represented the Oamaru Town electorate on the Otago Provincial Council from 6 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial government system on 31 October 1876. He was member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 10 April 1867 to 21 August 1872, when he resigned. He died at Redcastle, a suburb of Oamaru, on 15 July 1902, having never married. His Redcastle land later became St Kevin's College. A family grave had been established at Christchurch's Addington Cemetery; his mother had been interred in 1871 and his sister Mary in 1875. McLean was apparently fond of his sister and wanted to be buried next to her, and his body was brought by train to Christchurch. His sister Alexandrina died a fortnight after him and was also buried in the family grave. In his will, McLean left funds for a clock and chimes to be added to the clock tower of the Oamaru Chief Post Office. His nephew, John Buckley, a son of George Buckley, unveiled the additions on 17 September 1903.

It is a collection of acoustic re- workings of various songs from the band's catalogue. Background In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. To open the exhibition, the Nelis, Ferris and Callaghan invited the five original members of the band to perform. The performance took place on March 20, to an audience of around 200 specially invited guests, where the band played a short set of acoustic versions of some of their better known songs. Following the enthusiastic reception to the exhibition reunion, the band decided to reconvene again to record a couple of acoustic songs for the forthcoming documentary DVD Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts. These sessions eventually resulted in a full album of material, consisting of re- recorded versions of songs spanning the band's whole career, some of which were dramatically re-imagined.

Purpose  Over the years great steps have been taken in reporting what really matters in clinical research. A clinical researcher might report: \\"in my own experience treatment X does not do well for condition Y\\". The use of a P value cut-off point of 0.05 was introduced by R.A. Fisher; this led to study results being described as either statistically significant or non-significant. Although this p-value objectified research outcome, using it as a rigid cut off point can have potentially serious consequences: (i) clinically important differences observed in studies might be statistically non-significant (a type II error, or false negative result) and therefore be unfairly ignored; this often is a result of having a small number of subjects studied; (ii) even the smallest difference in measurements can be proved statistically significant by increasing the number of subjects in a study. Such a small difference could be irrelevant (i.e., of no clinical importance) to patients or clinicians. Thus, statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical importance. Over the years clinicians and researchers have moved away from physical and radiological endpoints towards patient-reported outcomes. However, using patient-reported outcomes does not solve the problem of small differences being statistically significant but possibly clinically irrelevant. In order to study clinical importance, the concept of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was proposed by Jaeschke et al. in 1989. MCID is the smallest change in an outcome that a patient would identify as important. MCID therefore offers a threshold above which outcome is experienced as relevant by the patient; this avoids the problem of mere statistical significance. Schunemann and Guyatt recommended minimally important difference (MID) to remove the \\"focus on 'clinical' interpretations\\" (2005, p. 594).  Methods of determining the MID  There are several techniques to calculate the MID. They fall into three categories: distribution-based methods, anchor-based methods and the Delphi method. = Distribution-based methods = These techniques are derived from statistical measures of spread of data: the standard deviation, the standard error of measurement and the effect size, usually expressed as a standardized mean difference (SMD; also known as Cohen's d in psychology). # Using the one-half standard deviation benchmark of an outcome measure entails that patient improving more than one-half of the outcome score's standard deviation have achieved a minimal clinically important difference. # The standard error of measurement is the variation in scores due to unreliability of the scale or measure used. Thus a change smaller than the standard error of measurement is likely to be the result of measurement error rather than a true observed change. Patients achieving a difference in outcome score of at least one standard error of measurement would have achieved a minimal clinically important difference. # The effect size is a measure obtained by dividing the difference between the means of the baseline and posttreatment scores by the SD of the baseline scores. An effect size cut off point can be used to define MID in the same way as the one half standard deviation and the standard error of measurement. #Item response theory (IRT) also can create an estimate of MID using judges who respond to clinical vignettes illustrating different scenarios. = Anchor based = The anchor based method compares changes in scores with an \\"anchor\\" as a reference. An anchor establishes if the patient is better after treatment compared to baseline according to the patient's own experience. A popular anchoring method is to ask the patient at a specific point in during treatment: ‚Äò‚ÄòDo you feel that the treatment improved things for you?‚Äô‚Äô. Answers to anchor questions could vary from a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\", to ranked options, e.g., \\"much better\\", \\"slightly better\\", \\"about the same\\", \\"somewhat worse\\" and \\"much worse\\". Differences between those average scale score for who answered \\"better\\" and those who answered \\"about the same\\" create the benchmark for the anchor method. An interesting approach to the anchor based method is establishment of an anchor before treatment. The patient is asked what minimal outcome would be necessary to undergo the proposed treatment. This method allows for more personal variation, as one patient might require more pain relief, where another strives towards more functional improvement. Different anchor questions and a different number of possible answers have been proposed. Currently there is no consensus on the one right question nor on the best answers. = Delphi method = The Delphi method relies on a panel of experts who reach consensus regarding the MID. The expert panel gets information about the results of a trial. They review it separately and provide their best estimate of the MID. Their responses are averaged, and this summary is sent back with an invitation to revise their estimates. This process is continued until consensus is achieved.  Shortcomings  The anchor based method is not suitable for conditions where most patients will improve and few remain unchanged. High post treatment satisfaction results in insufficient discriminative ability for calculation of a MID. A possible solution to this problem is a variation on the calculation of a 'substantial clinical benefit' score. This calculation is not based on the patients that improve vs. that do not, but on the patients that improve and those who improve a lot. MID calculation is of limited additional value for treatments that show effects only in the long run, e.g. tightly regulated blood glucose in the case of diabetes might cause discomfort because of the accompanying hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and the perceived quality of life might actually decrease; however, regulation reduces severe long term complications and is therefore still warranted. The calculated MID varies widely depending on the method used, currently there is no preferred method of establishing the MID. There is no consensus regarding the optimal technique, but distribution-based methods have been criticized. For example, use of the standard error of the mean (SEM) is based on anecdotal observations that it is approximately equal to 1/2 SD when the reliability is 0.75. But Revicki et al. question why 1 SEM should \\"have anything to do with the MID? The SEM is estimated by the product of the SD and the square root of 1-reliability of a measure. The SEM is used to set the confidence interval (CI) around an individual score, that is, the observed score plus or minus 1.96 SEMS constitutes the 95% CI. In fact, the reliable change index proposed early by Jacobson and Truax [12] is based on defining change using the statistical convention of exceeding 2 standard errors\\" (p. 106).  Caveats  The MID varies according to diseases and outcome instruments, but it does not depend on treatment methods. Therefore, two different treatments for a similar disease can be compared using the same MID if the outcome measurement instrument is the same. Also MID may differ depending on baseline level Hays, R. D., & Woolley, J. M. (2000). The concept of clinically meaningful difference in health-related quality-of-life research: How meaningful is it? PharmacoEconomics, 18, 419-423. and it seems to differ over time after treatment for the same disease.

He was born on 20 March 1969 in Hungary, and died when his plane crashed at an airshow in Qatar on 7 March 2014. History In 1998 at the age of 29 N√°das got into connection with flying thanks to a pleasure flight. He liked it so much that he started his pilot course that day. After a few months he got his license. He was not satisfied with all this so he got into a Z-142 and continued his aviation career with aerobatics. His complete aerobatics training ended in 2001. He flew YAK-18, YAK-52 and Z-726, then single-seat machines: YAK-55M, ACRO-230, CAP-231, Z-50LS and he made the audience of several Hungarian events happy. A milestone in his aviation career was the year of 2007 when his plane, designed for perfect aerobatics (EXTRA 300 LP), arrived. This aircraft let him take part in different races as a worthy opponent. The years of learning and practising took their fruit in the year of 2009. On 7 March 2014 he was taking part in the Qatar Mile event at Al Khor Airport.

He has two siblings: Julio Rub√©n is the elder and Marta Mar√≠a is the younger. His paternal grandfather, Aurelio Arias, was a deputy in the National Constituent Assembly in 1946. His uncles, Bernardino and Sergio Gonz√°lez Ruiz, both served as Ministers of State and Acting Presidents under Roberto F. Chiari. His father was a businessman in the transport sector, and his mother graduated in dentistry at the University of Buenos Aires. Arias passed his childhood in the capital. He had five years of primary education at the Javier School, a Jesuit institution, then passed on to the Pedagogic High School to complete his secondary education. The summer holidays were always spent in the city of Las Tablas and in the countryside at Villa de Los Santos, which belonged to his mother's family. Like his mother, Arias went on to study at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was in contact with leading Argentine intellectuals and economists who had returned to the university at the end of the military dictatorship. His working life began in the clothing industry as a salesman soon rising to an executive position in the company. He was instrumental in developing the firm's trade with more than 12 neighboring countries. He is married to Aim√©e √Ålvarez and they currently (2013) have three children: David Jos√©, aged 19; Juan Enrique, 14; and Isabella, 10. Political career In 2006 he joined the Cambio Democr√°tico party, in which he assisted in formulating the plan for government, and acted as campaign spokesman. When that party's candidate Ricardo Martinelli became President in 2009 he offered Arias a Cabinet post as minister for foreign trade. In this position he set up the PROINVEX governmental agency for attracting investment and promoting exports. In 2010 he organised a series of conferences - PANAMAINVEST - in the capitals of major trading nations with the aim of promoting direct foreign investment. He worked to enhance the effectiveness of the office dealing with local headquarters of multinational companies, reducing management expenses and certifying its work by ISO 9001 quality standards. Among other tasks he also drew up a new law concerning Free Trade Zones. In 2011 President Martinelli appointed Arias as Minister of Housing and Land Management. Here his first task was to carry through the Proyecto Curund√∫ urban renovation project. He went on to build up the Piso y Techo (Eng: Floor and Roof) programme, aimed at improving the living conditions of poor families living in dwellings with earth floors, mainly in rural areas. He built the first barrio digital (digital neighbourhood), with wireless internet access in every dwelling. He also instituted a process of certifying the main directorates within his Ministry to ISO 9001 standards. He stepped down from his ministerial position on 15 February 2014, to concentrate on his presidential campaign. Presidential candidate 2014 In May 2013 Arias competed in the primaries for nomination by his party, Cambio Democr√°tico, as presidential candidate for the presidential election of 2014.

In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign, McCann, had invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a neologism to describe the behaviour. The word \\"phubbing,\\" a portmanteau of phone and snubbing, was first described by McCann Group Account Director Adrian Mills, who was working with David Astle. The term has appeared in media around the world and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann. Stop Phubbing campaign The Stop Phubbing campaign site, and related Facebook page, was part of an elaborate public relations effort designed to promote the Macquarie Dictionary of Australia. In the media, the website was originally credited by an Australian college student named Alex Haigh, who had been interning at McCann and was subsequently hired. A film, titled A Word is Born, describes the entire process and serves as an advertisement for the dictionary. Phubbing in the media The campaign was picked up by numerous media outlets, notably those in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Germany. The press reported on surveys showing statistics of the number of the people \\"phubbing\\", and published etiquette guides. Research In October 2015, media outlets (such as TODAY and Digital Trends) reported on a study by James A. Roberts, professor of marketing at Baylor University Hankamer School of Business, that was published in the journal \\"Computers In Human Behavior\\". The study consisted of two separate surveys of more than 450 U.S. adults to learn the relational effects of \\"phubbing\\" or partner phubbing. The survey found that 46.3 percent of respondents said their partners phubbed them, and 22.6 percent said it caused issues in their relationship. In an interview with Yahoo! Health, Roberts said, \\"We found that the ones that reported higher partner phubbing fought more with their partner and were less satisfied with their relationship than those who reported less phubbing.\\" References Category:Habits Category:Etiquette Category:Mobile phone culture Category:Neologisms Category:Words coined in the 2010s ","title":"Phubbing"},{"id":"40298009","text":"Petrobacter succinatimandens is a species of bacteria.

Prelude One of the mandates of Reconstruction placed on the former Confederate states was that each had to write a new constitution acceptable to Congress before rejoining the Union. South Carolina convened a Constitutional Convention in 1868. Since twenty-one of South Carolina's thirty-one counties were majority African-American, black delegates outnumbered white delegates seventy-six to forty-eight. As a result, the new Constitution did not reflect the traditional desires of the white power structure. The Constitution not only outlawed slavery, it \\"abolished imprisonment for debt, authorized universal male suffrage, gave the state its first divorce law\\" and, most significantly, established a \\"public school system for poor and rich, black and white.\\" Even after Reconstruction ended, free public education for African-Americans was not to be denied, although drastic cuts to funding and the abolishment of a law granting extra funds to poorer districts would come in 1878. State Superintendent of Education Hugh S. Thompson wrote that one of the greatest hazards to the state‚Äôs recovery was the \\"ignorance of a large number of our people.\\", and he proposed creating teacher-training schools. What would start as week-long or seasonal \\"Institutes for Colored Teachers\\" between 1880 and 1882 would become full normal training schools within a few years. Foundation and growth  Professional associations for teachers also grew out of the temporary institutes. First, the white-only South Carolina State Teachers Association in 1881, and in 1900, the Palmetto Education Association. The first president was J. Edward Wallace, who like all of the early presidents of the Association worked as a school administrator rather than as a teacher. Perhaps the most influential early leader was J.L. Cain, president from 1914 to 1922. Under his leadership, \\"it grew rapidly in membership and influence.\\" In 1920, there were 393 dues-paying members. By 1923, that had nearly doubled to 659 and would ultimately peak at 8,429 in 1964, with 37 counties reporting 100% membership among their teachers. In 1918, the first constitution was drafted, the first executive director was employed, and issuance was made for the first annual publication. According to the constitution, the organization's three purposes were: # To improve its members in the science and art of teaching. # To dignify and promote public interest in the cause of education. # To elevate the standards of the teaching profession and improve the Negro race educationally. Under the guidance of the association, the quality of teachers in Colored schools in South Carolina improved at an amazing pace. In 1925, less than 2% of the state's African-American teachers were certified. By 1937, 75% were certified. Along with this came an increased presence in the state's white-dominated power structure, and State Superintendents of Education asked the Association to \\"standardize Negro schools and colleges.\\" In 1919, South Carolina and the PEA hosted the annual convention of the American Teachers Association, then known as the National Association of Teachers of Colored Schools. From 1930 on, this partnership was made official, with the PEA as advocates at the state level and the NATCS at the national level. Brown v Board of Education and merger In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in education was unconstitutional. This began a long process that saw the American Teachers Association, parent organization of the PEA, merge with the National Education Association in 1966. On April 1, 1967, the House of Delegates of the Palmetto Education Association voted to merge with the South Carolina Education Association.

Microsoft announced the cancellation of the game on 7 March 2016. The servers shut down on 13 April 2016. Gameplay Fable Legends was based around four Heroes and a Villain. Each role may be filled by a player via online multiplayer or by an AI. The same game experience was possible regardless of multiplayer or single player (with four AI). All of the game's story and quests could have been played single player, using AI heroes as sidekicks or enemies. It was possible to play through the game's content as either a Hero or as a Villain. During each quest, the four Hero characters must use teamwork to succeed in their objectives, while the Villain player opposes them with an army of creatures. =Heroes= Each Hero in Fable Legends was to be a unique character with unique abilities, powers, and gameplay. Several playable heroes were identified as: Sterling, a Prince Charming type of character, who flourishes a rapier and wise cracks; Winter, who is focused on will-based abilities and ice attacks; Rook, focusing on ranged combat with a crossbow; and Inga, a paladin- like character wearing heavy armor, and wielding a sword and shield. Players can customise any Hero, ranging from colour and aces to outfits. Customisations would have been unlocked either with earned in-game silver (in game currency), or by purchasing them with real life money. Some cosmetic items may have only been purchasable. Hero Rotation A limited amount of heroes would have been available for free at a given time, after which a new set of heroes would take their place for everybody to play for a period of time. Heroes could have also been purchased for permanent access by earned in- game currency or by real-life currency. =Villains= The villain player controls the nature of the quest the hero characters embark on, such as where enemies spawn, how aggressive they are, when the boss will come lumbering out of its lair, when to bring down an impassable portcullis or lay a trap to separate heroes from each other to thwart them. The Villain has a certain amount of \\"creature points\\", which he uses during a setup phase to plan his strategy. Each creature costs a certain number of points to summon. During setup, the Villain can also place a certain number of interactive objects in the quest, such as traps and gates. Once the battle has begun, the Villain player focuses on ordering his creatures about in real time in a similar manner to an RTS game. He can order the creatures to attack a specific Hero, to activate special abilities, and to position for ambushes. During combat, he can also activate gates to damage and split up the Heroes, and use his traps to distract and wound them. =Social play= Like other games in the series, Fable Legends would allow players to interact with villagers and customize their characters with weapons, looks, armour, abilities and more. In the hub- city of Brightlodge, players would have had the opportunity to partake in jobs, play mini-games and enjoy pub games. Once the player selects a quest, they would be sent out into the world. =Platforms= Since the game has multiplayer capabilities, players would require an active Xbox Live subscription to play on Xbox One. On Windows 10, it was set to have a free-to- play model. Gameplay would have been in sync across platforms. Players could've played on Windows 10 and continue their progress on Xbox One and vice versa. Synopsis Fable Legends takes place several hundred years before the events of the original trilogy. This is a period of magic, folklore, and mythology, and humanity has yet to discover meaningful technology. Most people huddle in small villages, too witless and scared to venture out into the scary world about. Heroes are more common, but there is no Heroes' Guild yet, and the Heroes must rely on each other to succeed. The story of one quest revealed at gamescom told of an ancient artifact called \\"The Moon on the Stick\\", which the children of Albion once made wishes to. The heroes in Fable Legends are on a quest to locate this artifact. Development Fable Legends began development in the summer of 2012 and was announced on 20 August 2013 with a cinematic trailer directed by Ben Hibon and narrated by Michael Gambon as the Villain. The first revealed gameplay footage was shown on 9 June 2014 with gameplay performed on stage by the development team. A limited, closed multiplayer beta began on 16 October 2014. The game was intended to have a 5‚Äì10 year lifecycle, and to be integrated into the cloud features of the Xbox One. SmartGlass features would have allowed villain players to make their plan of attack before a quest. On 21 January 2015, Microsoft announced Fable Legends would also be released on Windows 10, exclusive to the Windows 10 Store. The game would feature cross-platform multiplayer between Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. Also support for DirectX 12 would be added with the game's release. On 26 February 2015, Lionhead confirmed that the game would use a free-to-play model. In an announcement on 14 December 2015, the game was officially delayed to 2016, so as to give additional time for Lionhead Studios to polish the game. An open beta was announced on the same day, and was set to be available in the first or second quarter of 2016. =Cancellation= On 7 March 2016, Microsoft announced the cancellation of the game and the closure of Lionhead Studios. The game's beta ended on 13 April 2016, with players who had purchased in-game gold receiving full refund from all in-game purchases.

These are colloquially known among PS2 hardware hackers as V0, V1, V2, ..., V18. Each region receives a different model number; for example, the V18 was released in North America as SCPH-90001, in Australia as SCPH-90002, and in Hong Kong as SCPH-90006. The final digit is a region code with no bearing on the hardware; many games and DVDs are restricted to certain regions, and the system software displays in different languages. The PS2 is primarily differentiated between models with the original \\"fat\\" case design and \\"slimline\\" models introduced at the end of 2004. In 2010, a television incorporating a PS2 was introduced. Original case design An SCPH-30000 model with DualShock 2 Three of the original PS2 launch models (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000, and SCPH-18000) were only sold in Japan and lacked the expansion bay of later PS2 models. These models instead included a PCMCIA slot. SCPH-10000 and SCPH-15000 did not have built-in DVD movie playback and instead relied on encrypted playback software that was copied to a memory card from an included CD-ROM (normally, the PS2 will only execute encrypted software from its memory card; see PS2 Independence Exploit). V3 had a substantially different internal structure from the subsequent revisions, featuring several interconnected printed circuit boards. In V4, everything except the power supply was unified onto one board. V5 introduced minor internal changes, and the only difference between V6 (sometimes called V5.1) and V5 is the orientation of the Power/Reset switch board connector, which was reversed to prevent the use of no-solder modchips. V5 also introduced a more reliable laser than the ones used in previous models. V7 and V8 included only minor revisions to V6. There was also the SCPH-3000x, 3500x, 3900x, and 500xx models. Beginning with model SCPH-500xx, the i.LINK port was removed. An infrared receiver was added for use with a remote to control DVD playback, leaving both controller ports free from the external receiver. The PS2 standard color is matte black. Several different variations in color were produced in different quantities and regions, including ceramic white, light yellow, metallic blue (aqua), metallic silver, navy (star blue), opaque blue (astral blue), opaque black (midnight black), pearl white, Sakura purple, satin gold, satin silver, snow white, super red, transparent blue (ocean blue), and also Limited Edition color Pink, which was distributed in regions including Oceania and parts of Asia. The small PlayStation logo on the front of the disc tray could be rotated 90 degrees, in order for the logo to be the right way up in both vertical and horizontal console orientations. This feature is also used on slimline consoles and the PlayStation 3. The original models were discontinued in 2004, as Sony ended production to clear existing inventory and prepare for the release of the slimline model. Slimline case designs In September 2004, Sony unveiled its third major hardware revision (V12, model number SCPH-700xx). Available in late October 2004, it is smaller, thinner, and quieter than the older versions and includes a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). Due to its thinner profile, it does not contain the 3.5\\" expansion bay and therefore does not support the internal hard disk drive. It also lacks an internal power supply, similar to the GameCube, and has a modified Multitap expansion. The removal of the expansion bay has been criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as Final Fantasy XI, which require the use of the HDD. The official PS2 Linux also requires an expansion bay to function. Currently only the modified Multitap is sold in stores; however, these are also compatible with the older versions, and also added support for multiple memory cards on some games. Third-party connectors can be soldered into the unit giving hard drive support due to still containing some of the necessary I/O controllers and firmware, but the process is involved, requiring the user to solder 39 IDE pinouts directly to the board.Hackday - hack your pstwo to support a hard diskPS2 Slim with internal HDD Two special aftermarket kit were created to make this mod easier for the consumer. The first was the HD Connect which was simply a board that sat attached to the back of the console, with communication wires taped to the PS2 through its air vents and drive power through one of its 5 V USB headers. The second, more expensive option, was the HD Combo: it included a replacement case with room for a hard drive. Certain modchips enable the use of a USB hard drive or other mass storage device. There are two sub-versions of the SCPH-700xx, one with the old Emotion Engine (EE) and Graphics Synthesizer (GS) chips, and the other with the newer unified EE+GS chip, but otherwise are identical. The sub-versions are variously referred to as V12 for both models, V11.5 for the older and V12 for the newer model, and V12 for the older and V13 for the newer model. The V12 model was first released in black, but a silver edition was available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, United Arab Emirates and other GCC countries, France, Italy, South Africa, and North America. A limited edition pink console also became available after March 2007. V12 (or V13) was succeeded by V14 (SCPH-7500x), which contains different ASICs than previous revisions, with some chips having a copyright date of 2005, compared to 2000 or 2001 for earlier models. It also has a different lens and some compatibility issues with a different number of PlayStation games and even some PS2 games. An addon to add HDD support to newer 7500x and onward models called the HDPro was created but had limited success. In the beginning of 2005, it was found that some black slimline console power transformers manufactured between August and December 2004 were defective and could overheat. The units were recalled by Sony and replaced by a 2005 model. Later hardware revisions had better compatibility with PlayStation games (Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions operates on most silver models); however, the new Japanese slim models have more issues with playing PlayStation games than the first PS2 revisions. In 2006, Sony released new hardware revisions (V15, model numbers SCPH-7700xa and SCPH-7700xb). V15 was first released in Japan on September 15, 2006, including the Silver edition. After its release in Japan, it was then released in North America, Europe and other parts of the world. The new revision uses an integrated, unified EE+GS chip, a redesigned ASIC, a different laser lens, an updated BIOS, and updated drivers. In July 2007, Sony started shipping a revision of the slimline PlayStation 2 (SCPH-7900x) featuring a reduced weight of 600 grams compared to 900 g of the SCPH-7700x, achieved through a reduction in parts. The unit also uses a smaller motherboard as well as a custom ASIC which houses the EE, GS, and the RDRAM. The AC adaptor's weight was reduced to 250 g from the previous 350 g. Another refinement of the slimline PlayStation 2 (SCPH-9000x) was released in Japan on November 22, 2007. As well as some cosmetic changes, the design of the hardware was overhauled, incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original (fat) PlayStation 2 revisions; this also increases the total weight to . On SCPH-9000x series consoles manufactured after the third quarter of 2008 as the last revision of the PlayStation 2, some changes were made (indicated by date code 8C) to incorporate a revised BIOS, which disables an exploit present in all older models that allowed homebrew applications to be launched from a memory card. PSX The PSX Sony also manufactured a consumer device called the PSX that can be used as a digital video recorder and DVD burner in addition to playing PS2 games. The device was released in Japan on December 13, 2003, and was the first Sony product to include the XrossMediaBar interface. It did not sell well in Japan, and was not released anywhere else. The PSX featured one USB port, a Memory Stick card reader and two PlayStation 2 Memory Card slots.

Background  After releasing the critically acclaimed ltd. edition vinyl only singles 'Come Down' and 'I Hate Models' the group entered the studio to record extra tracks for a CD mini-album release, which also featured both singles' A and B sides for those unable to purchase the vinyl releases. Although not intended to be regarded as the band's first album proper, the collection was highly acclaimed by both critics and fans alike and can be marked as an important early step in the group's career.  Musical style  The music featured on the album draws heavily from the British post-punk genre, with influences such as Gang of Four and Public Image Limited highly audible. Alongside these more aggressive and angular sound are psychedelic and space rock influences, such as the group's love of Syd Barrett's early Pink Floyd. The name of the album was taken from Barrett's use of the I Ching tome in his song Chapter 24. Some songs show a nod to the then contemporary dance-punk revival, with \\"Trying to Be Someone Else for Free\\" featuring the 'four to the floor' drum beat adopted by bands like Liars and The Rapture. Others present an almost grunge rock bent, and tracks \\"Come Down\\" and \\"How Does It Feel Now You're on Your Own\\" reminiscent of In Utero era Nirvana.  Critical reception  The album's release saw strong support from publications such as the NME. They awarded the album 8/10 and claimed it to be 'absolutely vital'.

Much of her research considers how early modern metaphysics, epistemology, psychology, political philosophy and ethics were thought to contribute to the overall project of living well. Passion and Action: The Emotions in Seventeenth-Century Philosophy (1997) concentrates on the role of the passions in early modern conceptions of the good life. In her work on Margaret Cavendish, James explores Cavendish‚Äôs efforts to blend philosophical insight and fantasy into a productive form of self-understanding. Two book on Spinoza, Spinoza on Philosophy, Religion and Politics (2012) and Spinoza on learning to Live Together (2020) range over the religious, epistemological, political and ethical aspects of a philosophical way of life. Throughout her work, Susan James tries to bring the history of philosophy into conversation with its contemporary counterpart. Her historical studies aim to illuminate contemporary philosophical problems.

Studies Ramon Sainero has a degree in Philology from the Universidad Complutense of Madrid. He attended PhD and M.A. studies in Irish literature in the New University of Ulster (Coleraine) and obtained his PhD in the Universidad Complutense of Madrid. He has attended intensive courses in Celtic languages and literature for over ten years in Ireland, at the Universities of Galway (Cararoe), Trinity College (Dublin), The University of Ulster (Coleraine) and Oideas Gael (Donegald). His university teaching has been given at the University of Ulster (Lector) and the Universidad Complutense (Lecturer).  Field of Research  His field of research for many years has been focused on Celtic Studies and the influence of early Indo-European culture in the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles. The commonly maintained theory is that the Celts, or at least Celtic Civilization, originated in central Europe, with Halstatt (Austria) and La Tene (Switzerland) as the principal sources of information on these origins. Although it appears evident that Central Europe was a key settlement site, from which the Celtic culture spread outwards, this does not mean the Celts, or the Celtic culture, originated from that part of Europe. The Danube, the Mediterranean Sea and Spain could also have constituted the site from which this invasive wave made its way into the interior of Europe, and this is a possibility that we should not discard. Nowadays a new theory has been developed with historical, archaeological, linguistic and cultural proofs, a theory that during centuries was considered only as mythology.  Written Works  Concerning this new theory, the following is a list of published studies he has authored: *The Celtic Heritage in Spain and Ireland (1987) contract signed in 1984 and published in 1987 by Ed. Akal (Madrid). It offers some surprising evidences as that the pre-Iberian alphabet of Tartessos is very similar or the same as continental Runes. *The Celts and Historical and Cultural Origins of Atlantic Europe, (The Celtic-Scythians in the Leabhar Gabhala) contract signed in 2003 andpublished in 2013 by Academica Press (USA). *The Celtic origins of the kingdom of Brigantia: the genesis of Spain, contract signed in 2003 and published in 2009 by Ed. Abada (Madrid). Sainero points out that Celtic manuscripts speak of the Scythians (mentioned by Herodotus and Scolots) and Scots as the primitive origin of Celtic people. The aim of his research is not to reject any historical or archaeological theory, but rather to contribute further to the existing body of knowledge. *A Historical and Linguistic reconstruction of Celts of the Iberian Peninsula, contract signed in 2012 and published in 2013, in which Sainero offers the lector a new way of studying the Celts and the primitive history and culture of the West Atlantic comparing Old Irish, Hispano-Celt and primitive Thracian languages.  His Theories  He offers in his studies a series of surprising data according with the Irish manuscript Leabhar Gabhala (Book of Invasions)Leabhar Gabh√°la (Do Ghabh√°laibh √ârend). The recension of Michael √ìcleirigh. Edited by R. A. Stewart Macalister and John MacNeill (irland√©s- ingl√©s). Hodges Figgis and Co., Dublin, 1916. on that perhaps may demonstrate how many of the historical events described in this manuscript were not pure invention and that, moreover, provide a historical and literary interpretation much more truthful than has so far been thought to be the case. At the estuary of the River Danube (Thrace), around the Black Sea and the eastern end of the Mediterranean, artistic, cultural and archaeological remains exist, some of which predate the 7th century BC, which point to the existence of a people, or series of people, with a shared religion and culture. The nearest inhabitants to them at that time, the Greeks, referred to them as Scythians, and many hypotheses exist that indicate that the Celtic culture was influenced by them in its origins, despite the fact that more complex forms were subsequently to develop.Annals of Clonmacnoise, The (Translated into English A. D. 1627. Faccsimile of the original title page. Printed at the University press, 1896). Reprinted by Llanerch Publishers, 1993. It was these Scythians who, according to the Leabhar Gabh√°la (Book of Invasions), on their journey across the Mediterranean would sometimes, but not always, make their settlements first in Greece, then in Egypt, subsequently in Spain and finally in Ireland. It was their descendants who were to go on to create the early Celtic kingdoms of Spain and Ireland. Up to this point, the aforementioned book has been considered by many specialists to be a fabulous story full of fantasy. One important and fundamental consideration in these booksAnnals of Ulster:, The: Ed. S. Mac Airt, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1983.Ora mar√≠tima (autor: Avieno), Ediciones Historia 2000 (Madrid), 1994. is that, when we refer to the Scythians (Scolots) and the Celto-Scythians (Thracian and/or Caucasian people?), we are in fact referring to Indo-European peoples who emanated out from the plains bordering on the Black Sea in a series of waves towards Central Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to him, It would perhaps be more accurate to speak of tribes, clans or waves of Indo- European migrants, but it is the Celtic manuscripts that speak of the Scythians and Scots (¬øScits or Scolots?) as the primitive origin of Celtic people. It is important to point out that the Scythians did not leave behind any written documentation. Presumably, they did not have a written language in this sense, but their Greek, Persian, Assyrian and Phoenician neighbours did, and indeed left us clear information on their history and culture. Their migrations were sometimes rapidly undertaken and took them long distances from their previous site, on which basis it is not surprising that the primitive documents, acceptable or not, make references to the Scots in IrelandAnnals of the Four Masters (Annala Rioghachta Eireann): Ed. de J. O¬¥Donovan, Hodges Smith (Dublin), 1856. Reprinted by The B√∫rca rare Books (Dublin), 1990. (people connected in their pilgrimage with Thracians, Greeks, Spaniards and other people). Sainero also credits them with possessing a significant army, capable of defeating, at certain times in history, the most fearsome armies of the era, such as the Medes, Persians and Assyrians. His comparison, following the above example is this: Approximately one thousand two hundred years previously, the peoples settled on the plains on the shores of Thracia and/or the Caucasus Sea, the Scythians and other nearby communities with settlements in Greece or Asia Minor, nomadic and skilled warriors and horsemen, were able, our evidence shows, to conquer some territories in Europe and, assimilating the culture of those they conquered, to go on to create a new civilization: the Celtic civilization.Primera Cr√≥nica General de Espa√±a (recop.: Alfonso X el Sabio), E.

In contrast to an eye patch that occludes the whole visual field of one eye, binocular occlusion allows some degree of binocular vision; more particularly, it emphasizes the role of binocular functioning in peripheral vision: objects that are located to the right can only be fixated by the right eye, and those located to the left only by the left eye.

The company expanded in the early 20th century into Europe under the brand National Radiator Company. In 1929 it amalgamated with the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company to form the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation, which evolved in 1967 into today's American Standard Companies. History =Predecessors= The Michigan Radiator & Iron Manufacturing Company was founded in 1888. John B. Dyar manager and owner of the Detroit Metal & Heating Works was the main promoter. Clarence M. Woolley joined the firm in 1887. The Detroit Radiator Company was formed in 1882 by Henry C. and Charles C. Hodges. The Pierce Steam Heating Company was founded in 1881 by John B. Pierce and Joseph Bond in Buffalo. The Standard Radiator Company (Buffalo) was established by Nelson Holland. =Foundation= 293x293px Advertisement for the American Radiator Company ‚Äì Baltimore Sun, September 11th, 1913 The American Radiator company was formed in 1891/2 from the Detroit Radiator Company, the Michigan Radiator & Iron Manufacturing Company, and the Pierce Steam Heating Company of Buffalo. The company was headed by Joseph Bond, (of Pierce Steam Heating Co.), as President, Charles Hodges, (of Detroit Radiator) as Treasurer, and Clarence Woolley (of Michigan Radiator) as Secretary. The company made a profit of $400,000 in its first year, but was subsequently affected by an economic depression (see also Panic of 1893). In 1894, Mr. Woolley convinced the other officers of the company to pay his way to Europe, whereupon he booked the sale of $50,000 worth of cast iron radiators for the Swiss capitol. This was the start of the company's entry into the European market. By the following year, the company had established a branch in London, England. The company began manufacturing in several west European countries, starting in 1898 and continuing into the 1920s. The company was successful in the United States and European markets, and attracted the attention of J.P. Morgan. Morgan helped the firm to combine most of the radiator manufactories in the US. In 1899, the company was re-incorporated under the same name, absorbing the St. Louis Radiator Manufacturing Company, and the Standard Radiator Manufacturing Company of Buffalo, and the radiator business of the Titusville Iron Company (Pennsylvania). After the death of Mr. Bond in 1902, Mr. Woolley, at age 39, succeeded him as President and Chairman of the Board. The American Radiator Building was constructed in New York in 1924. In the 1920s the company added several manufacturing plants in the US, as well as expanding a distribution network. =Successor= In 1929 the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company consolidated with the American Radiator Company to form the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation, which evolved in 1967 into today's American Standard Companies. European subsidiaries In 1894, following the Panic of 1893 and the consequent fall in demand for its products the company began investigating the potential of Europe as a market, and a sales branch was opened in London. In 1897, the company began investigating manufacturing in Europe, specifically France and Germany, countries with high trade tariffs; a branch was opened in Hamburg, which assembled and machine finished cast radiator parts shipped in knock down form. In 1898, the company acquired the established plant of Louis Courtot, in D√¥le, France (Dole, Jura) forming the Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs. In 1901, the company made the decision to establish a manufacturing plant in Germany, a site was selected in Sch√∂nebeck. Both establishments proved successful and in 1905 the company began planning for a factory in England, and a site was selected in Hull. By 1906 the European operations were so successful that on one occasion profits generated exceeded those from the company's American operations. Much of the profit was re-invested in expansion, and the construction of new factories was initiated in Italy (1910, opened 1911) and Austria (1912, opened by 1914). During World War I the plant became in involved in war work: the D√¥le plant was requisitioned by the French state, and manufactured shells; the German, Italian, and Austrian plants were also involved in producing munitions for their respective states; the English plant agreed to supply Belgium with hand- grenades, and also undertook contracts for the British state. The European operations were incorporated into the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation in 1929, forming the basis of that company's international operations. =Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs= thumb In the 1880s engineer Louis Courtot developed a central heating system using radiators and boiler, and established a foundry in Dole (Jura). The factory was acquired by the American Radiator Company in 1898, and a new company established as the Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs, with a capital of 500,000 francs. Courtot became the managing director of the plant. The company had with low wage costs and fair productivity, resulting in a saving compared to importing products. By 1903 the plant employed 180 people. In 1905 the company opened a new factory in Dole, and the earlier factory gradually ceased production. The factory became the largest in Dole employing nearly 2000. During the First World War the plant produced 155 and 380mm artillery shells, employing mainly female workers. At the end of the war, the shortage of manpower led to managed immigration of Polish workers, with a housing built for their families. During the 1920s new plant were constructed at Clichy-sous-Bois/Aulnay-sous-Bois and Argenteuil. As a consequence, in 1932 the plant in Dole switched to the manufacture of bathroom furniture, including porcelain sanitary ware. The Aulnay-sur-Bois plant opened in 1923. The two main factory buildings were built of reinforced concrete by the Limousin company to the designs of Eug√®ne Freyssinet. An extension was built in 1930, also by Limousin. Foundry work (boilers, cast iron baths) was switched to Aulnay. In 1929 a factory was opened in Dammarie-l√®s-Lys; the factory structure was also to the design of Freyssinet/Limousin. From 1931, the factory was used entirely for the manufacture of radiators, with a staff of 750. In 1949, after the parent company had become involved in the production of bathroom furniture (see American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation, formed 1929) the company was renamed \\"Id√©al Standard\\". Manufacture of radiators in Aulnay ceased in 1968. The oil crisis negatively affected the company's activities, and the plant in Aulnay closed. The Dammarie plant closed in 1975. In 1975, production of bathroom furniture ended at Dole. A new company Soci√©t√© Nouvelle Id√©al Standard was established under the control of Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Fonderie (65%) and Soci√©t√© de Dietrich. In 1984 the company came back under the control of American Standard. Bath production using acrylic resin started in 1986. In 1996 the company Sanifrance was created by the combination of activities of Id√©al Standard, Porcher, Piel and Emafrance as a subsidiary of American Standard. In 2005 Sanifrance became Id√©al Standard France, and in 2006 Id√©al Standard Industrie France. =Nationale Radiator Gesellschaft mbH= In 1900 the American Radiator Company decided to add a foundry to their existing operations in Germany, which had been assembling and finishing imported radiator parts in Hamburg from the late 1890s. In 1901 Nationale Radiator Gesellschaft mbH was formed in Berlin as a subsidiary of the American Radiator Company; a factory was established at Sch√∂nebeck in 1902. The company was known under the abbreviation NARAG. An additional factory was established in Neuss and production of radiators concentrated at Neuss, boilers at Sch√∂nebeck. With the incorporation in 1919 of the Standard Sanitary company into the parent company, its German subsidiaries were also merged into a division of NARAG, adding cast iron baths, brass water fittings, and porcelain bathroom fittings to the company's output. During World War I the factory manufactured shells for the German Empire. During the Second World War the Neuss factory was heavily targeted by bombing campaigns and required rebuilding at the end of the war. The Sch√∂nebeck plant became a subsidiary of Volkswagen in 1944 and was used to manufacture V1 rockets; the factory was supplied with slave labour from the Sch√∂nebeck camp, a sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, an estimated 200-400 concentration camp prisoners were used at the plant, other employees during the period included forced labour from eastern Europe, and Italy. The Sch√∂nebeck facility was in soviet occupied East Germany at the end of the second world war; as a result in 1950 the Neuss site began production of boilers. In 1951 the company was renamed Ideal Standard GmbH. A refrigeration company 'Gesellschaft die Rheink√§lte' (D√ºsseldorf) was acquired in 1955. In the 1960s, during the German economic boom the company expanded, with a sites in Wittlich (radiators), and in Waldbr√∂l und Berlin (boilers, radiators; acquired from the Projahn-Werkes). At the end of the 1960s the Wittlich site was concentrated on the production of fittings serving the whole European market; valve production was reduced at Neuss in favour of the Clichy factory in France, and the site in Neuss became focused on ceramic manufacture. In the mid 1970s the company withdrew from the heating business, and the sites in Waldbr√∂l and Berlin shut. =National Radiator Company Limited= thumb In 1905 the company's operations in France and Germany were proving successful, and the firm decided to open a factory in England. The company \\"National Radiator Company, Ltd.\\" was established, and $500,000 was provided for the establishment of a factory. A site in Kingston- upon-Hull was selected for the factory. Construction of the factory began in 1906, and the first casting was produced in December. The plant was expanded in 1910. During World War I, much of the production was shifted to the munition production. In 1917 the factory was further expanded, in anticipation of a post-war building boom. In 1934 the company was publicly listed as \\"Ideal Boilers and Radiators\\" (capital ¬£750,000) in order to raise cash for a factory extension. By 1938 a new plant producing vitreous sanitary ware had begun operation. During World War II the plant produced munitions including mortar bombs and grenades, as well as boilers and vitreous china for military use. In 1953 the company was renamed \\"Ideal Standard\\". In 1976 the boiler and radiator operations of the plant were acquired by Stelrad Group (Metal Box), whilst the vitreous china (bathroom furniture) operations remained under the control of Ideal Standard. Radiator production was ended at Stelrad's Hull site, and production was focused on boilers. In 1989 the Metal Box company demergered, and MB group formed; Caradon was acquired by MB group becoming MB Caradon in 1989 and the Hull boiler factory became Caradon Ideal in 1993. In the 2010s the Ideal Boilers' foundry was closed with the loss of 57 jobs and outsource casting to third parties. As of 2014 the boiler plant operated as \\"Ideal Boilers\\" as part of the Ideal Stelrad group., and the bathroom fittings plant is part of Ideal Standard. In 2015 Ideal Boilers was acquired from holding company ISG Holdings 1 by French HVAC business Groupe Atlantic. Recognition A logo on a radiator from American Radiator Co.

Aside from his trademark enthusiasm for performance art, another defining trait of Gonzo is the ambiguity of his species, which has become a running gag in the franchise. Gonzo has been considered to be of various origins, including a Frackle, in his debut appearance on The Great Santa Claus Switch; extraterrestrial in Muppets from Space; or avian creature. Developed and performed by Dave Goelz, Gonzo made his first appearance in the 1970 special The Great Santa Claus Switch, as the \\"Cigar Box Frackle\\". Originally a minor figure in The Muppet Show, he soon evolved into one of the franchise's primary characters. Gonzo has appeared in every Muppet film, including The Muppet Christmas Carol, where he portrayed author Charles Dickens and developed a double act with Rizzo the Rat. History The prototype of Gonzo appeared in The Great Santa Claus Switch, \\"as a generic gruff baddie\\". Jim Henson selected this Frackle as the basis for Gonzo, and gave the character to puppeteer Dave Goelz. Gonzo was created as a character with low self-esteem, as written by Jerry Juhl, with Goelz acknowledging he put himself into that interpretation. Later, with Jim Henson's approval, they reworked the eyes to allow the character to convey more excitement, and a \\"zany, bombastic appreciation for life\\". Gonzo has several memorable performances such as his 1979 song from The Muppet Movie, \\"I'm Going to Go Back There Someday\\". He became known for his stunts as acts within The Muppet Show and beyond, with the famous quote \\"I shall now eat a rubber tire to the music of The Flight of the Bumblebee...music, maestro!\\" In 1992, he played the part of Charles Dickens in The Muppet Christmas Carol, as director Brian Henson said Gonzo was the most improbable Muppet to do so. Here, he developed a double act with Rizzo the Rat, narrating and breaking the fourth wall, with Rizzo challenging Gonzo's claims to be Dickens. The Gonzo and Rizzo partnership was continued in Muppet Treasure Island (1996) and Muppets from Space (1999). Along with Kermit and Rizzo, Gonzo gave an audio commentary for the Muppets from Space DVD. In The Muppets, it was revealed that he had become a powerful plumbing magnate since the Muppets split up. In the 2015 television series The Muppets, Gonzo is a major character and the head writer of Miss Piggy's late night talk show, Up Late with Miss Piggy. Character Gonzo is not a puppet version of a human or a recognizable animal. He has an awkward, non animal-like appearance, which includes purple-blue fur, purple feathers on his head, bug-eyes, and a long, hooked nose, referred to as a \\"beak\\". In The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie, he performed as a performance artist, stunt double and daredevil under the name \\"The Great Gonzo\\" (or \\"Gonzo the Great\\"). Gonzo is good friends with all of the Muppets, but performed a double act with Rizzo the Rat since The Muppet Christmas Carol. Gonzo has a long-standing romantic relationship with Camilla the Chicken, whom he first courted in the Leslie Uggams episode of The Muppet Show, and directed Camilla and the other chickens in 2008 YouTube videos. =Species= A running gag related to Gonzo is that it is not clear what species he is supposed to be. Gonzo's self-identity is a \\"whatever\\". In The Muppet Movie, Kermit, while having his inner conversation, says \\"And a thing, whatever Gonzo is. He's a little like a turkey\\", to which his inner self replied \\"but not much\\". In the film The Great Muppet Caper, he is shipped to England in a crate labeled \\"Whatever\\" (while Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are respectively labeled \\"Frog\\" and \\"Bear\\"). In A Muppet Family Christmas, when Gonzo states to the Christmas Turkey that Camilla is his girlfriend, the Christmas Turkey says \\"You're not even a bird!\\" In the Muppet Treasure Island CD-ROM Game, Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat land in a bucket of molasses, following the dialogue of a carriage driver saying \\"It's raining rats and... whatevers\\". In The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, Gonzo played a Tin Man-ish character primarily known as the \\"Tin Thing\\". In Jim Henson's Muppet Babies, Gonzo (voice of Russi Taylor) was simply referred to, most often by Baby Piggy, as a \\"weirdo\\" or \\"blue weirdo\\". In Muppets from Space, Gonzo has a starring role. In the film, he is revealed to be an alien, and his alien family comes to Earth with a big party for him and before their departure they ask him to return to space with them. Gonzo sadly says farewell to the Muppets but he soon realizes that he would be abandoning his longtime friends who have been like his family all along and declines the aliens' offer.

Though primarily performed by Dave Goelz, he has also been voiced in animated form by Hal Rayle in Little Muppet Monsters. Brett O'Quinn performed Gonzo in Muppets Ahoy!, a 2006 Disney Cruise Line show. An infant-aged version of Gonzo appeared as a regular character in the animated spin-off television series Muppet Babies, voiced by Russi Taylor, alongside Kermit, Miss Piggy, and other central Muppet Show figures. Baby Gonzo is one of the cartoon characters featured in Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. Baby Gonzo later returned in the 2018 Muppet Babies series, voiced by Benjamin Diskin. Gonzo was featured on the #28 Havoline Ford of Ricky Rudd in the 2002 Tropicana 400 in an advertising campaign in which he and his fellow Muppets were featured on a select few NASCAR Nextel Cup Series race cars. Gonzo also appeared alongside his fellow Muppets on the Halloween 2011 episode of WWE Raw. Gonzo was announced as the Grand marshal for the Auto Club 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Ca. to give the famous command of \\"Drivers, Start your engines\\". He fulfilled his duty on March 23, 2014. NOAA's Gulfstream IV N49RF, named for Gonzo. Gonzo is also the namesake to the CT-142 Bombardier Dash 8 used by the Canadian Armed Forces for Air Combat Systems Officer training due to the blue paint job and elongated nose housing a specialized radar. A similar flying example is the Gulfstream IV light jetliner bearing US registration N49RF, flown for severe weather research by the US Federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and is also named for Gonzo as portside nose art. Reception Reviewing Muppets from Space in 1999, Roger Ebert found the most humorous part to be Gonzo being denied entry in Noah's Ark for not having a second member of his species, and expressed sympathy for his loneliness as an extraterrestrial, stranded since the Roswell UFO incident, adding \\"Poor guy (or whatever he is)\\". In 2012, The Guardians Lizzy Dening, reviewing the Muppet films, identified Gonzo as a favorite. That year, The Daily Beast wrote about appreciation for the Muppets in the LGBT community, calling Gonzo \\"the queerest Muppet of all\\". In 2015, Today.com, in reviewing the Humpty Dance YouTube video, referred to Gonzo himself as a \\"classic Muppet\\". That year, The Huffington Post identified Gonzo as a popular Muppet, saying to his fans, \\"People just don't GET you\\" adding \\"And nothing would ever be the same without you.\\" References =Bibliography=   * External links * at Disney.com Category:Television characters introduced in 1970 Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters Category:Fictional plumbers Category:Fictional proboscideans Category:Fictional stunt performers Category:Fictional writers Category:The Muppets characters de:Die Muppet Show#Gonzo ","title":"Gonzo (Muppet)"},{"id":"40299667","text":"Dorothea Sharp (1874 - 17 December 1955) was a British artist best known for her landscapes and naturalistic studies of children at play.

She went on to study at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where her work was admired by George Clausen and David Murray. She went on to Paris, where she first encountered the work of the Impressionists ‚Äì in particular Claude Monet ‚Äì that was to have a profound and lasting effect on her art, resulting in the highly impressionistic and spontaneous style that she was to adopt for the rest of her life. In 1903 she became an Associate of the Society of Women Artists, and in 1908 a full member, going on to serve as vice-president for 4 years.

Lord Aveland later succeeded his mother as Lord Willougby d'Eresby, and was created Earl of Ancaster in 1892. As the younger son of a peer, Charles bore the courtesy title 'The Honourable'. The Conservative politicians Gilbert, 2nd Earl of Ancaster and Lt-Col Claud Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby were his brothers. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.Obituary, The Times (London), 22 December 1949. Military career In March 1888, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy obtained a commission as a part-time Militia officer in the 4th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment (Royal South Lincolnshire Militia),Monthly Army List December 1889. and then in January 1891 transferred to the Regular Army as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Scots Guards. He was promoted to lieutenant 11 August 1894, and captain on 7 June 1899. He was serving with the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards when the 2nd Boer War broke out.Quarterly Army List (various edns). =Second Boer War= The 2nd Scots Guards left Southampton on the SS Britannic in March 1900, arrived in South Africa as reinforcements the following month, and soon took part in operations in the Orange River Colony. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was present at the actions of Biddulphsberg and Wittenbergen. Early in 1901 he served briefly as an extra Aide-de-Camp to the British High Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner. Heathcote- Drummond-Willoughby became Adjutant of the 2nd Scots Guards in December 1901, and was present with the battalion during further operations in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony until the Boer surrender on 31 May 1902. For his service during the war he was promoted to brevet major on 22 August 1902. He left Port Natal on the SS Michigan with other men of the 2nd battalion in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when the battalion was posted to Aldershot. He then returned to the role of Aide-de-Camp to Milner (now Lord Milner) in South Africa until the end of 1903. Returning to his regiment in London, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was promoted to the substantive rank of major in 1904. =Territorial Force= In 1904 Heathcote- Drummond-Willoughby was made Commandant of the School of Instruction for Officers of the Auxiliary Forces. Based at Chelsea Barracks, this provided training for the part-time officers of the Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers. When he retired from the army in June 1908, he did not sever his military connections, but became an officer in the new Territorial Force created from the former Yeomanry and Volunteers under the Haldane Reforms. From 1908 until 1912 he was Commanding Officer of the 15th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment (TF). On 11 April 1912 he became commander of the 6th London Infantry Brigade with the rank of colonel (TF). The 6th London Bde comprised four South London battalions (21st‚Äì24th) of the London Regiment and formed part of the 2nd London Division. =World War I= On the outbreak of World War I, 6th London Bde was mobilised and Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was appointed Temporary Brigadier-General. In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. The division embarked for France in March 1915, concentrating round B√©thune. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 6th London became 142nd (1/6th London) Brigade. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's 142 Bde carried out the division's first offensive action, on 25 May during the Battle of Festubert. The leading battalions swept across the open ground and immediately captured the German front trenches with few losses, but were then caught by enfilading fire from German artillery and suffered heavy casualties, as did the supports sent up to consolidate the gains. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby went on sick leave on 10 June 1915, and did not return to 142 Brigade.> He was replaced on 14 August, but on 7 September he was appointed to command a new brigade, 120th, in 40th Division, forming at Aldershot. This was one of the last of the 'Kitchener Army' divisions to be formed, and the standard of height for infantry soldiers had been lowered in order to encourage volunteers: some of these so-called 'bantams' were well-knit, hardy men, but many others, especially in 120th Bde, were under-developed and unfit. It was estimated that the four battalions in the brigade would provide enough fit men for only two serviceable battalions. To prevent the departure of the division to the Front being indefinitely postponed, the divisional commander asked for fresh units to be drafted in. Consequently, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby had to carry out a complete reorganisation of his command in February 1916. Divisional training was then intensified and the division was warned for overseas service in May 1916.. 40th Division disembarked in France in June 1916, and spent the whole war on the Western Front. Heathcote-Drummond- Willoughby's brigade was the first part of the division to see serious action, being engaged in the Battle of the Ancre (the last phase of the Battle of the Somme, 14‚Äì18 November 1916), detached under the command of 31st Division. Early in 1917 the division followed up the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, with offensive action 24 April, when 120 Bde captured Villers-Plouich and Beaucamp. Villers-Plouich and over 300 prisoners were captured by 13th Bn East Surrey Regiment and Beaucamp entered by 14th Bn Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In November 1917, during the Battle of Cambrai, the division relieved 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division to continue the breakthrough. The attack on the morning of 23 November, with the objective of capturing Bourlon Wood, was begun by 119 and 121 Bdes with tank support, while 120 Bde was in reserve. Confused fighting went on for two days and nights, with Heathcote- Drummond-Willoughby feeding his troops gradually into the line. On the afternoon of 24 November 14th Bn Highland Light Infantry of 120 Bde together with some tanks attacked Bourlon village; although the HLI fought their way through the village, they became cut off on the other side. 40th Division ordered a renewed attack the following morning to break through and relieve them. The only troops available to 121 Bde for this task were the uncommitted 13th East Surreys from 120 Bde. The East Surreys attacked around dawn, made contact with the HLI battalion HQ, but were unable to get through to the HLI companies furthest forward, who were forced to surrender. In the two days the division suffered over 4000 casualties, and Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's battalions had been badly damaged while under the command of others. All brigades on the Western Front were reorganised after the heavy losses of 1917. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's brigade lost its English battalions and became an entirely Scottish formation as it prepared for renewed fighting in 1918. The divisional history records that 120 Brigade 'suffered a severe loss on the 15th [March 1918] when the brigade commander was sent home. General Willoughby had been in very poor health for some time, but had struggled to remain at his duty in order to see the big [German] offensive, though the delay in the opening of the attack rendered this impossible'. To the regret of his divisional commander, Heathcote‚ÄìDrummond-Willoughby was invalided back to the UK after two-and-a-half years in continuous command. His brigade was virtually destroyed during the subsequent German Spring Offensive. Having been made a CMG in January 1916, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was awarded a CB in the New Year Honours of 1918.London Gazette 1 January 1918. On demobilisation he was granted the Honorary rank of Brigadier-General on 4 March 1919.London Gazette 25 April 1919. After the war he was a popular Chairman of the Turf Club in London. Family life Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy married (7 January 1907) Lady Muriel Agnes Stuart Erskine, eldest daughter of the 14th Earl of Buchan. They had two children: * Charles Peregrine Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy, b 13 September 1905. * Rosalie Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy, b 10 July 1908, married (25 April 1935) Lt-Col Sir Terence Nugent (1895‚Äì1973), who was created Baron Nugent in 1960. Nugent was the son of Brig.-Gen. G.C. Nugent, who had commanded 141st Brigade alongside Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy's 142nd Brigade in 47th Division, and had been killed in action 31 May 1915.Thepeerage.com.

Overview Over the decades, experimental condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including superconductors and superfluids. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including Subir Sachdev hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.Merali 2011, p. 303 So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.Sachdev 2013, p. 51 Criticism With many physicists turning towards string-based methods to address problems in condensed matter physics, some theorists working in this area have expressed doubts about whether the AdS/CFT correspondence can provide the tools needed to realistically model real-world systems.

He was inspired by French writer Moliere, whose plays he adapted into Telugu. Bhamidipati became a trend setter in the field of humour play writing. Bhamidipati not only translated some English farces into Telugu but also wrote original prahasanas (farces) in Telugu. His prahasanas are considered to be the best of type even today.  Early life  Bhamidipati's father Narsavadhanulu was a Vedic scholar, but Bhamidipati developed love for literature at young age. In that era many theatre organisations competed for awards in Parishat competitions in verse drama. Bhamidipati, belonging to a poor family was one of the Parishat's beneficiaries. That helped him to get through his graduation. \\"Drama stood by me and hence I shall do something for drama\\" was his motto and he began writing plays especially for students. Though he joined the government service, economic and family conditions forced him to take up a job as teacher at Rajahmundry. Bhamidipati did his M.A in Mathematics and retired as head master of Veeresalingam High School, Rajuhmundry. He was in the company of great scholars, including legendary literary figures like Madhunapantula Satyanarayana, Chilakamarthi Lakshmi Narasimham, Sripada Krishnamurthy Sastry and Kasi Krishnamacharyulu. But the influence of Raghupathi Venkataratnam Naidu was more. Yet, Bhamidipati was a great fan of English plays and literature. His professor Cooldre's observation that ‚Äòpoetry and music were not different‚Äô made Bhamidipati sit and think.

Author Patanjali Sastry says that apparently Bhamidipati told his son Radhakrishna, who later became a film script writer; that he committed a mistake in adapting Moliere in his works and asked his son never to follow other's works if he wanted to leave his own impression on his work. \\"Though he wrote comedies, he remained an introvert and never smiled even when some one cracked a joke,\\" informs Patanjali Sastry. Bhamidipati was greatly influenced by Gurajada Appa Rao‚Äôs works, especially for its modernity and use of spoken regional dialect.

The Junius Pamphlet. 1916.Angus, Ian, https://johnriddell.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/the-origin-of- rosa-luxemburgs-slogan-socialism-or-barbarism/ \\"The origin of Rosa Luxemburg‚Äôs slogan ‚Äòsocialism or barbarism‚Äô\\" It existed from 1948 until 1967. The animating personality was Cornelius Castoriadis, also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan. Socialisme ou Barbarie (S. ou B.) is also the name of the group's journal.  History The group originated in the Trotskyist Fourth International, where Castoriadis and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu‚ÄìMontal tendency in the French Parti Communiste Internationaliste in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \\"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\\", leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \\"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German 'left' of the 1920s, p. 134 They developed parallel to, and were in dialogue with, the Johnson‚ÄìForest Tendency, which developed as a body of ideas within American Trotskyist organisations. One faction of this group later formed Facing Reality. The early days also brought debate with Anton Pannekoek and an influx of ex-Bordigists into the group. The group was composed of both intellectuals and workers, and agreed with the idea that the main enemies of society were the bureaucracies which governed modern capitalism. They documented and analysed the struggle against that bureaucracy in the group's journal. The thirteenth issue (January‚ÄìMarch 1954), as an example, was devoted to the East German revolt of June 1953 and the strikes which erupted amongst several sectors of French workers that summer. Following from the belief that what the working class was addressing in their daily struggles was the real content of socialism, the intellectuals encouraged the workers in the group to report on every aspect of their working lives. Socialisme ou Barbarie was critical of Leninism, rejecting the idea of a revolutionary party, and placing an emphasis on the importance of workers' councils. While some members left to form other groups, those remaining became more and more critical of Marxism over time. Jean Laplanche, one of the group's founding members, recalls the early days of the organization: The Hungarian Revolution and other events of the mid-1950s led to a further influx into the group. By this time, they were proposing the fundamental point as This became characterised as a distinction between the dirigeant and ex√©cutant in French, usually translated as order-givers and order-takers. This perspective enabled the group to extend its understanding to the new forms of social conflict emerging outside the realm of production as such. That was also the case for the 1960-1961 Winter General Strike in Wallonia. After the May 1958 crisis and an influx of new meeting attendees, disagreements on the organisational role of a political group led to the departure of some prominent members including Claude Lefort and Henri Simon to form Informations et Liaison Ouvri√®res. By 1960, the group had grown to around 100 members and had developed new international links, primarily in the emergence of a sister organisation in Britain called Solidarity. In the early 1960s, disputes within the group around Castoriadis' increasing rejection of Marxism led to the departure of the group around the Pouvoir Ouvrier journal. The main Socialisme ou Barbarie journal continued publishing until a final edition in 1965, after which the group became dormant and announced its indefinite suspension in June 1967.

She was convicted of plunder for her involvement in the PDAF Scam and is facing charges for alleged involvement in the misuse of the Malampaya fund for disaster response operations. Early life Janet Luy Lim was born in Malabon, then a municipality of Rizal. She is the fourth of five children of a Chinese Filipino couple: Johnny Co Lim (born Lim King Sing) and Magdalena \\"Nelly\\" Lim Luy. The family lived in Binondo, Manila until December 1970, when Johnny Co Lim died, and Luy returned with her children to her hometown of Maluso, Basilan. Napoles, who was six at the time, studied at the Maluso Central Elementary School, and completed her secondary education at the local Claretian school. The family ran the Luys' sari-sari store, and delivered drinks to workers at the local port. However, some residents of Maluso have claimed that the Luys were a rich family, owning a fish drying business and plots of land. As the security situation in Basilan began to deteriorate, and the family received threats of extortion, the Lim family moved back to Manila. Napoles reportedly met her husband, Jaime G. Napoles, on board a ferry which traversed between the southern islands of Mindanao,. They married in April 1982, when she was 18. In Manila, the couple lived in Fort Bonifacio, where the young Napoles ran a carinderia. Business career and government involvement Napoles' business interests date back to the early 1990s. In 1993, she solicited for investments in a shipyard in Cebu, promising 5% interest on all investments. It was later discovered that the money was not invested in the shipyard: according to Col. Ariel Querubin, who was a friend of the Napoles family, the money they had invested in the shipyard was reportedly invested elsewhere, with Napoles pocketing the interest. While the investment was eventually recovered, Querub√≠n claims the investment led to the death of his first wife. In 2001, Napoles and her husband were implicated in the acquisition by the Armed Forces of the Philippines of ‚Ç±3.8 million worth of substandard Kevlar helmets, and were charged with graft and malversation of public funds by the Sandiganbayan (people's special tribunal). While her husband was dropped from the list of defendants in 2002, Janet Napoles stood trial, and was acquitted on October 28, 2010 for lack of evidence. In 2013 it was revealed that Janet Napoles's JLN Corporation had paid significantly less taxes than the average local public school teacher. Records show that from 2009 to 2011, the company paid between ‚Ç±9,036 and ‚Ç±25,164 in annual taxes, whereas a public school teacher at that time would have paid around ‚Ç±35,952 per year. =PDAF scam= Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) was a program initially implemented in 1990, designed to allow legislators to fund small-scale infrastructure or community projects which fell outside the scope of the national infrastructure program. It was later ruled as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the Philippines.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/336120/supreme-court- declares-pdaf-unconstitutional/story/ Napoles has been linked with an alleged misuse of PDAF, together with Philippine Senators Bong Revilla, Jinggoy Estrada, Juan Ponce Enrile, and other congressmen. GMA News She was convicted of plunder on December 7, 2018, for her involvement in the PDAF scam, with the conviction being upheld by the Sandiganbayan anti-graft court on March 13, 2019. =Illegal detention case= Janet Lim Napoles was accused of illegally detaining Benhur Luy, her cousin and former employee in 2014. Luy's three- month custody under Napoles ended in March 2014. Napoles alleged that Luy took a ‚Ç±5.5 million loan under her name without her authorization. She also alleged that Luy was supposed to deposit ‚Ç±300,000 to her account but did not do so, accusing Luy of theft. Luy insists that he was detained by Napoles due to fears that Luy will expose Napoles' alleged significant role in the PDAF scam. Lim was later found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and was sentenced to reclusi√≥n perpetua on April 14, 2015. Napoles and her lawyers have indicated that they will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals. =2017 Acquittal case= The Office of the Solicitor General with the court of appeals has filed a \\"manifestation in lieu of rejoinder\\" recommending the Acquittal of Janet Lim Napoles from the Luy detention case. This decision by the Solicitor General Jose Calida was backed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte saying that he himself would move for the dismissal of the case citing selective prosecution under Aquino administration. The criminal actions must proceed against all responsible according to Duterte. = Fertilizer fund scam = Napoles and six others were indicted in 2018 for their involvement in the fertilizer fund scam. The group was indicted for graft and malversation of public funds over PHP5 million worth of projects, including the anomalous purchase of fertilizers in 2004 in Surigao del Norte. Jo Chris Trading, a firm owned by Napoles, was tagged as the distributor of allegedly overpriced and diluted liquid fertilizers. Fertilizer funds totaling PHP728 million were allegedly diverted in a vote-buying scheme involving favored local officials. = Malampaya fund scam = Napoles is facing charges for her alleged involvement in the Malampaya fund scam. The case involves the misues of PHP900 million sourced from the fund for disaster response operations in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Ondoy (Ketsana) and Typhoon Pepeng (Parma) in 2009. Personal life Janet Napoles' husband was a major in the Philippine Marine Corps who participated in the God Save the Queen coup attempt against President Coraz√≥n Aquino. Originally a reservist, he later applied for active duty status, and eventually retired from the Marines on December 31, 2004. Together, they have five children, Jo Christine, Jerald, James Christopher, Christian, and Jeane. Jo Christine Napoles is the president of the Metro Manila chapter of the OFW Family Club party list, and was the group's third nominee to the House of Representatives until she withdrew her nomination on August 8, 2013. Jeane Napoles has been criticized for her ostentatious lifestyle, including owning a $2 million unit at the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles while she studied fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. The Philippines Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a P17.88-million tax evasion case against Jeane Napoles. The Philippine Star (Philstar Global Corp.) Jerald Napoles is a theater actor and TV personality of ABS-CBN. Jo Christine and James Christopher were charged with graft related to the pork barrel scam and the Malampaya fund scam. Janet Napoles, children Jo Christine, James Cristopher, and Jeane Catherine, her brother Reynald Luy Lim, and his wife Ana Marie were indicted by a U.S. court for domestic and international money laundering. There are conflicting accounts as to the net worth of the Napoles family. While Napoles has described her family as middle class, acquaintances in Basilan claim that her maternal family had old money, which she confirmed in an earlier interview as having inherited. Her extended family in Basilan, however, has denied her claims of such an inheritance. She has also claimed that most of her wealth was due to sound investments, mostly with coal trading in several countries but particularly in Indonesia. However, the profitability of Napoles' business ventures has been questioned: according to disclosures made with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011 and 2012, the corporations under the JLN Group of Companies reported a total net income of less than ‚Ç±1 million, and Merlina Su√±as, one of the whistleblowers in the PDAF scam, has alleged that the Napoleses are not knowledgeable about the coal industry. In other disclosures made to the SEC, it was revealed that Napoles owned at least 28 houses in a number of cities in Luzon, with her family members also holding property in the United States. She also maintains, according to the Department of Justice, around 415 accounts with seventeen banks. The Napoles family also maintains a fleet of 30 vehicles, which are all registered under the flagship company of the JLN Group of Companies, JLN Corporation. Napoles is a member of the Roman Catholic Church and has close ties with a number of Catholic clergy. She maintained a home for priests in Makati which was run by Monsignor Josefino S. Ramirez, who previously served as rector of the Quiapo Church, where her mother funded the church's feeding programs for the poor. Ramirez reportedly brought the image of the Black Nazarene on a number of occasions to Napoles' house, where they would hear Mass, and has confirmed that he received from her a monthly stipend of ‚Ç±150,000, and lived in one of Napoles' houses. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila has distanced itself from Napoles, saying that the projects she funded were part of Ramirez's personal apostolate and are not official projects of the archdiocese.  Health  Janet Lim-Napoles was admitted to the Ospital ng Makati on March 31, 2014 for treatment of a uterine cyst. On April 1, 2014, she underwent a series of tests, including electrocardiography (ECG), two-dimensional echocardiogram (2D-echo) and an X-ray. The following day, she underwent a blood test, and a week later underwent an endometrial biopsy examination despite her high blood sugar levels.

His family had to move in July 1922 to Athens due to the Greek‚ÄìTurkish population exchange. He developed an interest in politics after he came into contact with Marxist thought and philosophy at the age of 13.Cornelius Castoriadis/Agora International Interview Cerisy Colloquium (1990), p. 2 (French original: Entretien d'Agora International avec Cornelius Castoriadis au Colloque de Cerisy (1990)). At the same time he began studying traditional philosophy after purchasing a copy of the book History of Philosophy (ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¶ŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±œÇ, 1933, 2 vols.) by the historian of ideas . Sometime between 1932 and 1935, Maximiani Portas (later known as \\"Savitri Devi\\") was the French tutor of Castoriadis.Dosse 2014, p. 17. During the same period, he attended the 8th Gymnasium of Athens in Kato Patisia,Marianthi Bella, \\"In my Neighborhood, Patisia ...\\", Glinos Foundation, 2013, p. 5. from which he graduated in 1937. His first active involvement in politics occurred during the Metaxas Regime (1937), when he joined the Athenian Communist Youth (ŒöŒøŒºŒºŒøœÖŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒùŒµŒøŒªŒ±ŒØŒ± ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±œÇ, Kommounistiki Neolaia Athinas), a section of the Young Communist League of Greece. In 1941 he joined the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), only to leave one year later in order to become an active Trotskyist.At the time, Castoriadis was under the influence of the Trotskyist militant Agis Stinas (Tasis 2007, pp. 40‚Äì1). The latter action resulted in his persecution by both the Germans and the Communist Party. In 1944 he wrote his first essays on social science and Max Weber,Suzi Adams. Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation. New York: Fordham University Press, 2011, p. 218. . which he published in a magazine named Archive of Sociology and Ethics (ŒëœÅœáŒµŒØŒøŒΩ ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒóŒ∏ŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ, Archeion Koinoniologias kai Ithikis). Castoriadis heavily criticized the actions of the KKE during the December 1944 clashes between the communist-led ELAS on one side, and the Papandreou government aided by British troops on the other. In December 1945, three years after earning a bachelor's degree in law, economics and political science from the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences of the University of Athens (where he met and collaborated with the Neo-Kantian intellectuals Konstantinos Despotopoulos, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Konstantinos Tsatsos),Dosse 2014, p. 22. he got aboard the RMS Mataroa,Tasis 2007, p. 42. a New Zealand ocean liner, to go to Paris (where he remained permanently) to continue his studies under a scholarship offered by the French Institute of Athens. The same voyage‚Äîorganized by Octave Merlier‚Äîalso brought from Greece to France a number of other Greek writers, artists and intellectuals, including Constantine Andreou, Kostas Axelos, Georges Candilis, Costa Coulentianos, Emmanuel Kriaras, Adonis A. Kyrou, Kostas Papa√Øoannou, and Virgile Solomonidis.Tasis 2007, p. 43.Dosse 2014, p. 37.Fran√ßois Bordes, \\"Exil et cr√©ation : des penseurs grecs dans la vie intellectuelle fran√ßaise\\", in Servanne Jollivet, Christophe Premat, Mats Rosengren, Destins d'exil√©s, Le Manuscrit, 2011, p. 66. = Paris and the Chaulieu‚ÄìMontal Tendency = Once in Paris, Castoriadis joined the Trotskyist Parti Communiste Internationaliste (PCI). He and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu‚ÄìMontal Tendency in the French PCI in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \\"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\\", leading them to break away to found the libertarian socialist and councilist group and journal Socialisme ou Barbarie (S. ou B., 1949‚Äì1966), which included Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and Guy Debord as members for a while, and profoundly influenced the French intellectual left. Castoriadis had links with the group known as the Johnson‚ÄìForest Tendency until 1958. Also strongly influenced by Castoriadis and Socialisme ou Barbarie were the British group and journal Solidarity and Maurice Brinton. = Early philosophical research = In the late 1940s, he started attending philosophical and sociological courses at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris (facult√© des lettres de Paris), where among his teachers were Gaston Bachelard,Cornelius Castoriadis/Agora International Interview Cerisy Colloquium (1990), p. 4.Dosse 2014, pp. 43‚Äì4.Tasis 2007, pp. 67‚Äì8. the epistemologist Ren√© Poirier, the historian of philosophy Henri Br√©hier (not to be confused with √âmile Br√©hier), Henri Gouhier, Jean Wahl, Gustave Guillaume, Albert Bayet, and Georges Davy. He submitted a proposal for a doctoral dissertation on mathematical logic to Poirier, but he eventually abandoned the project.Dosse 2014, p. 44. The working title of his thesis was Introduction √† la logique axiomatique (Introduction to Axiomatic Logic). = Career as economist and distancing from Marxism = At the same time (starting in November 1948), he worked as an economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) until 1970, which was also the year when he obtained French citizenship. Consequently, his writings prior to that date were published pseudonymously, as \\"Pierre Chaulieu,\\" \\"Paul Cardan,\\" \\"Jean-Marc Coudray\\" etc. In his 1949 essay \\"The Relations of Production in Russia\\",PSW 1, pp. 135‚Äì158. Castoriadis developed a critique of the supposed socialist character of the government of the Soviet Union. According to Castoriadis, the central claim of the Stalinist regime at the time was that the mode of production in Russia was socialist, but the mode of distribution was not yet a socialist one since the socialist edification in the country had not yet been completed. However, according to Castoriadis' analysis, since the mode of distribution of the social product is inseparable from the mode of production,\\"[L]e mode de r√©partition du produit social est ins√©parable du mode de production.\\" (P. Chaulieu, \\"Les rapports de production en Russie\\", Socialisme ou Barbarie n¬∞ 2 (May 1949) reproduced in La Soci√©t√© bureaucratique - Volumes 1‚Äì2, Christian Bourgois √âditeur, 1990, p. 164.) the claim that one can have control over distribution while not having control over production is meaningless.\\"L'Id√©e que l'on puisse dominer la r√©partition sans dominer la production est de l'enfantillage.\\" (La Soci√©t√© bureaucratique - Volumes 1‚Äì2, p. 166.) Castoriadis was particularly influential in the turn of the intellectual left during the 1950s against the Soviet Union, because he argued that the Soviet Union was not a communist but rather a bureaucratic capitalist state, which contrasted with Western powers mostly by virtue of its centralized power apparatus.Peter Osborne (ed.), A Critical Sense: Interviews with Intellectuals, Routledge, 2013, p. 17. His work in the OECD substantially helped his analyses. In the latter years of Socialisme ou Barbarie, Castoriadis came to reject the Marxist theories of economics and of history, especially in an essay on \\"Modern Capitalism and Revolution\\", first published in Socialisme ou Barbarie in 1960‚Äì61 (first English translation in 1963 by Solidarity). Castoriadis' final Socialisme ou Barbarie essay was \\"Marxism and Revolutionary Theory\\", published in April 1964 ‚Äì June 1965. There he concluded that a revolutionary Marxist must choose either to remain Marxist or to remain revolutionary.\\"Marxism and Revolutionary Theory\\" later became the first of the two parts of IIS (the second being \\"The Social Imaginary and the Institution\\", a previously unpublished follow-up to \\"Marxism and Revolutionary Theory\\"). The relevant quote from IIS, p. 14 is: \\"Starting from revolutionary Marxism, we have arrived at the point where we have to choose between remaining Marxist and remaining revolutionaries\\".Arthur Hirsh, The French Left, Black Rose Books, 1982, p. 126. = Psychoanalyst = When Jacques Lacan's disputes with the International Psychoanalytical Association led to a split and the formation of the √âcole Freudienne de Paris (EFP) in 1964, Castoriadis became a member (as a non-practitioner). In 1968 Castoriadis married Piera Aulagnier, a French psychoanalyst who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment under Jacques Lacan from 1955 until 1961.\\"Piera Aulagnier n√©e Spairani\\" entry at Psychoanalytikerinnen.de In 1969 Castoriadis and Aulagnier split from the EFP to join the Organisation psychanalytique de langue fran√ßaise (O.P.L.F.), the so-called \\"Quatri√®me Groupe\\",Tasis 2007, p. 216. a psychoanalytic group that claims to follow principles and methods that have opened up a third way between Lacanianism and the standards of the International Psychoanalytical Association.Sophie de Mijolla-Mellor (2005). \\"Quatri√®me Groupe (O.P.L.F.), Fourth Group.\\" In: A. de Mijolla (Ed.), International dictionary of psychoanalysis, vol. 3 (p. 1429). Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale. Castoriadis began to practice analysis in 1973 (he had undergone analysis in the 1960s first with Ir√®ne Roubleff and then later with Michel Renard).Dosse 2014, p. 175. = Philosopher of history and ontologist = In 1967, Castoriadis submitted a proposal for a doctoral dissertation on the philosophy of history to Paul Ric≈ìur (then at the University of Nanterre).Dosse 2014, p. 264. An epistolary dialogue began between them but Ric≈ìur's obligations to the University of Chicago in the 1970s were such that their collaboration was not feasible at the time.Dosse 2014, pp. 264‚Äì5. The subject of his thesis would be Le fondement imaginaire du social-historique (The Imaginary Foundations of the Social-Historical) (see below). In his 1975 work, L'Institution imaginaire de la soci√©t√© (Imaginary Institution of Society), and in Les carrefours du labyrinthe (Crossroads in the Labyrinth), published in 1978, Castoriadis began to develop his distinctive understanding of historical change as the emergence of irrecoverable otherness that must always be socially instituted and named in order to be recognized. Otherness emerges in part from the activity of the psyche itself. Creating external social institutions that give stable form to what Castoriadis terms the (ontological) \\"magmaFrom the contemporary geological term magma, \\"blend of molten or semi-molten rock\\", from the Ancient Greek ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±, \\"thick unguent\\" (Suzi Adams, ed., 2014, ch. 6).\\"A magma is that from which one can extract (or in which one can construct) an indefinite number of ensemblist organizations but which can never be reconstituted (ideally) by a (finite or infinite) ensemblist composition of these organizations.\\" (IIS, p. 343.)Klooger, Jeff. \\"The Guise of Nothing: Castoriadis on Indeterminacy, and its Misrecognition in Heidegger and Sartre,\\" Critical Horizons 14(1), 2013, p. 7: \\"'Magma' is the name Castoriadis gives to the mode of being which he sees as underlying all others, and which is characterized by an indeterminacy in which particular determinations come to be, but without congealing into inalterable forms, and without diminishing the potential for the emergence of new and different determinations.\\" of social significations\\"IIS, p. 359.Subsequent attempts by Castoriadis at formalizing the notion of magma were not successful. According to logician Athanassios Tzouvaras, the properties of a magma that Castoriadis proposed were either unformalizable or inconsistent (see Athanassios Tzouvaras, \\"Sets with dependent elements: Elaborating on Castoriadis' notion of 'magma'\\" [n.d.]). allows the psyche to create stable figures for the self, and to ignore the constant emergence of mental indeterminacy and alterity. For Castoriadis, self-examination, as in the ancient Greek tradition, could draw upon the resources of modern psychoanalysis. Autonomous individuals‚Äîthe essence of an autonomous society‚Äîmust continuously examine themselves and engage in critical reflection. He writes: > ... psychoanalysis can and should make a basic contribution to a politics of > autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is a necessary condition for > autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back > upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its > reasons for acting, its deep-seated [profondes] tendencies.

Castoriadis was not calling for every individual to undergo psychoanalysis, per se. Rather, by reforming education and political systems, individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion. He offers: \\"if psychoanalytic practice has a political meaning, it is solely to the extent that it tries, as far as it possibly can, to render the individual autonomous, that is to say, lucid concerning her desire and concerning reality, and responsible for her acts: holding herself accountable for what she does.\\"FT A: \\"First Institution of Society and Second-Order Institutions\\" (essay based on a lecture presented on December 15, 1985 in Paris), p. 163. = Sovietologist = In his 1980 Facing the War text, he took the view that Russia had become the primary world military power. To sustain this, in the context of the visible economic inferiority of the Soviet Union in the civilian sector, he proposed that the society may no longer be dominated by the one-party state bureaucracy but by a \\"stratocracy\\"‚Äîa separate and dominant military sector with expansionist designs on the world. He further argued that this meant there was no internal class dynamic which could lead to social revolution within Russian society and that change could only occur through foreign intervention. = Later life = In 1980, he joined the faculty of the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) as Directeur d'√©tudes (Director of Studies).Sophie Klimis and Laurent Van Eynde (eds.), L'imaginaire selon Castoriadis: th√®mes et enjeux, Facult√©s Universitaires Saint Louis √† Bruxelles, 2006, p. 47 n. 8. He had been elected Directeur de recherche (Director of Research) in EHESS at the end of 1979Schrift 2006, p. 112. after submitting his previously published material in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project of connecting the disciplines of history, sociology and economy through the concept of the social imaginaryDosse 2014, pp. 305‚Äì11.He had proposed in his application form the creation of a Chair in Recherches sur les r√©gimes sociaux contemporains, \\"Research on contemporary social systems\\" (Dosse 2014, p. 308), which he eventually occupied. (see below). His teaching career at the EHESS lasted sixteen years.OPS, p. xxi. In 1980, he was also awarded his State doctorate from the University of Nanterre; the final title of his thesis under Ric≈ìur (see above) was L'√âl√©ment imaginaire de l'histoire (The Imaginary Element in History). In 1984, Castoriadis and Aulagnier divorced. In 1989, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences by Panteion University and in 1993 another one in Education Sciences by the Democritus University of Thrace.Dosse 2014, pp. 350‚Äì1. In 1992, he joined the libertarian socialist journal Society and Nature (established by Takis Fotopoulos) as a writer; the magazine also featured such writers as Murray Bookchin and Noam Chomsky.Chris Atton, Alternative Literature: A Practical Guide for Librarians, Gower, p. 41. He died on 26 December 1997 from complications following heart surgery. He was survived by Zoe Christofidi (his wife at the time of his death), his daughter Sparta (by an earlier relationship with Jeanine \\"Rilka\\" Walter,Tasis 2007, pp. 43 and 85 n. 23. \\"Comrade Victorine\\" in the Fourth International),Anon. (2003), Foreword to The Rising Tide of Insignificancy and Kyveli, a younger daughter from his marriage with Zoe.Tasis 2007, p. 81.Alex Economou: Obituary ‚Äì Cornelius Castoriadis (1922‚Äì1997)  Philosophy  Edgar Morin proposed that Castoriadis' work will be remembered for its remarkable continuity and coherence as well as for its extraordinary breadth which was \\"encyclopaedic\\" in the original Greek sense, for it offered us a paideia, or education, that brought full circle our cycle of otherwise compartmentalized knowledge in the arts and sciences. Castoriadis wrote essays on mathematics, physics, biology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, linguistics, society, economics, politics, philosophy, and art. One of Castoriadis' many important contributions to social theory was the idea that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through the social imaginary without strict determinations,IIS, p. 3. but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to (or by positing) social imaginary significations. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former.Marcela Tova, \\"The imaginary term in readings about modernity: Taylor and Castoriadis conceptions\\", Revista de Estudios Sociales 9, June 2001, pp. 32‚Äì39. (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of the radical imaginaryIIS, p. 146. can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.)IIS, p. 373.Chiara Bottici, Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary, Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 50.Nicolas Poirier, \\"Cornelius Castoriadis. L'Imaginaire radical\\", Revue du MAUSS, 1/2003 (No. 21), pp. 383‚Äì404. However, the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.\\"The Social Imaginary and the Institution\\" in IIS, pp. 167‚Äì220. Also in CR, pp. 196‚Äì217.Schismenos 2013, p. 86. He used traditional terms as much as possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them. = Autonomy and heteronomy = The concept of autonomy was central to his early writings, and he continued to elaborate on its meaning, applications, and limits until his death, gaining him the title of \\"Philosopher of Autonomy.\\" The word itself is Greek, where auto means \\"for/by itself\\" and nomos means \\"law.\\" It refers to the condition of \\"self-institution\\" by which one creates their own laws, whether as an individual or as a whole society. And while every society creates their own institutions, only the members of autonomous societies are fully aware of the fact, and consider themselves to be the ultimate source of justice. In contrast, members of heteronomous societies (hetero- 'other') delegate this process to an authority outside of society, often attributing the source of their traditions to divine origins or, in modern times, to \\"historical necessity.\\"\\"Alienation appears first of all as the alienation of a society to its institutions, as the autonomization of institutions in relation to society.\\" (IIS, p. 115.) Castoriadis then identified the need of societies not only to create but to legitimize their laws, to explain, in other words, why their laws are just. Most traditional societies did that through religion, claiming their laws were given by God or a mythical ancestor and therefore must be true. An exception to this rule is to be found in Ancient Greece, where the constellation of cities (poleis) that spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean, although not all democratic, showed strong signs of autonomy, and during its peak, Athens became fully aware of the fact as seen in Pericles' Funeral Oration.Cornelius Castoriadis. Ce qui fait la Gr√®ce : Tome 3, Thucydide, la force et le droit. Seuil 2011. (S√©minaire of 13 February 1985.) Castoriadis considered Greece, a topic that increasingly drew his attention, not as a blueprint to copied but an experiment that could inspire a truly autonomous community, one that could legitimize its laws without assigning their source to a higher authority. The Greeks different to other societies because they not only started as autonomous but maintained this ideal by challenging their laws on a constant basis while obeying them to the same degree (even to the extent of enforcing capital punishment), proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist. Regarding modern societies, Castoriadis notes that while religions have lost part of their normative function, their nature is still heteronomous, only that this time it has rational pretenses. Capitalism legitimizes itself through \\"reason,\\" claiming that it makes \\"rational sense\\",Cornelius Castoriadis (1999). ¬´ La rationalit√© du capitalisme ¬ª in Figures du Pensable, Paris: Seuil. but Castoriadis observed that all such efforts are ultimately tautological, in that they can only legitimize a system through the rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament claimed that \\"There is only one God, God,\\" capitalism defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of costs, and then legitimizes itself based on its effectiveness to meet these criteria. Surprisingly, this definition of logic is also shared by Communism, which despite the fact it stands in seeming opposition, it is the product of the same imaginary, and uses the same concepts and categories to describe the world, principally in material terms and through the process of human labor. = The imaginary = The term \\"imaginary\\" originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (see the Imaginary) and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. Castoriadis believed that for a given society, as we penetrate the layers of its culture deeper and deeper, we arrive at meanings that do not mean something other than themselves. They are, so to speak, \\"final meanings\\", that the society in question has imposed on the world, on itself.IIS, pp. 142‚Äì3. Because these meanings (manifestations of the \\"radical imaginary\\" in Castoriadian terminology) do not point to anything concrete, and because the logical categories needed to analyze them are derived from them, these meanings cannot be analysed rationally. They are arational (rather than irrational), and must therefore be acknowledged rather than comprehended in the common use of the term. Castoriadis' views on concept formation is in sharp contrast to that of postmodernists like Jacques Derrida, who explicitly denies the existence of concepts \\"in and off themselves\\".Jacques Derrida. Positions. University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 57. Radical imaginary is at the basis of cultures and accounts for their differences. In his seminal work The Imaginary Institution of Society, Castoriadis argues that societies are founded not as products of historical necessity, but as the result of a new and radical idea of the world, an idea that appears to spring fully formed and is practically irreducible. All cultural forms (laws and institutions, aesthetics and ritual) follow from this radical imaginary, and are not to be explained merely as products of material conditions. Castoriadis then is offering an \\"ontogenetic\\",Yannis Ktenas. How Castoriadis read Weber: Meaning, values, and imaginary institution. Published: March 6, 2018 from PUBLIC SEMINAR. or \\"emergentist\\" model of history, one that is apparently unpopular amongst modern historians,Ricardo Duchesne. Uniqueness of Western Civilization. BRILL, 2011, p. 267. but can serve as a valuable critique of historical materialism. For example, Castoriadis believed that Ancient Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from Chaos, while in contrast, the Hebrews had an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a rational entity, God or Yahweh in the Hebrew Bible. The former developed therefore a system of direct democracy where the laws were ever changing according to the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God. Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined above). That same imaginary is the foundation of its opposing ideology, Communism. By that measure he observes (first in his main criticism of Marxism, titled the Imaginary Institution of Society,IIS, p. 23. and subsequently in a speech he gave at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain on February 27, 1980)EA, p. 9. that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same industrial revolution type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first. Similarly, in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail, since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real, thus perpetuating the problem. Castoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science. This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created. In the second part of his Imaginary Institution of Society (titled \\"The Social Imaginary and the Institution\\"), he gives the example of set theory, which is at the basis of formal logic, which cannot function without having first defined the \\"elements\\" which are to be assigned to sets.IIS, pp. 223‚Äì5. This initial schema of separation (sch√©ma de s√©paration, œÉœáŒÆŒºŒ± œÑŒøœÖ œáœâœÅŒπœÉŒºŒøœç) of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore, precedes the application of (formal) logic and, consequently, science. = Social constructionism = Castoriadis was a social constructionist and a moral relativist insofar as he held that the radical imaginary of each society was opaque to rational analysis. Since he believed that social norms and morals ultimately derive from a society's unique idea of the world, which emerges fully formed at a given moment in history and cannot be reduced further. From this he concluded that any criteria by which one could evaluate these morals objectively are also derived from the said imaginary, rendering this evaluation subjective. This does not mean that Castoriadis stopped believing in the value of social struggles for a better world, he simply thought that rationally proving their value is impossible. This however does not mean that Castoriadis believed there is no truth, but that truth is linked to the imaginary which is ultimately arational. In his book World in Fragments, which includes essays on science, he explicitly writes that \\"We have to understand that there is truth - and that it is to be made/to be done, that to attain [atteindre] it we have to create it, which means, first and foremost, to imagine it\\".WIF, p. 373. He then quotes Blake who said \\"What is now proved was once only imagin'd\\". = Chaos = The concept of Chaos, as found in Ancient Greek cosmogony, plays a significant role in Castoriadis' work, and is connected to the idea of the \\"imaginary\\".IIS, p. 46.FT B, p. 80. Castoriadis translates the Greek word \\"chaos\\" as nothingness.Note that he doesn't entirely exclude its definition, in chaos theory, as a state of maximum entropy. According to him, the core of the Greek imaginary was a world that came from Chaos rather than the will of God as described in Genesis. Castoriadis concludes that the Greeks' imaginary of a \\"world out of chaos\\" was what allowed them to create institutions such as democracy, because‚Äî if the world is created out of nothing‚Äî man can model it as he sees fit,Castoriadis advocated that \\"[t]he surging forth [surgissement] of signification‚Äîof the institution, of society‚Äîis creation and self-creation. ... Signification emerges to cover over the Chaos, thus bringing into being a mode of being that posits itself as negation of the Chaos\\" (WIF, p. 315). without trying to conform to some divine law. He contrasted the Greek imaginary to the Biblical imaginary in which God is a \\"willing\\" (i.e. intentional) agent and man's position is to understand God's will and act according to it. = The Ancient Greeks and the modern West = Castoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek cities (poleis) not as a model to imitate, rather as a source of inspiration towards an autonomous society. He rejects also the term city state used to describe Ancient Greek cities; for him the administration of Greek poleis was not that of a State in the modern sense of the term, since Greek poleis were self‚Äìadministrated. The same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring Phoenicians, who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean, were monarchical till their end. During this time of colonization, however, around the time of Homer's epic poems, we observe for the first time that the Greeks, instead of transferring their mother city's social system to the newly established colony, instead, for the first time in known history, legislate anew from the ground up. What also made the Greeks special was the fact that, following the above, they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy. This phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the Renaissance,WIF, p. 72; cf. Renaissance republics. again as a product of small independent merchants. He sees a tension in the modern West between, on the one hand, the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of \\"open societies\\" and, on the other hand, the spirit-crushing force of capitalism. These are respectively characterized as the creative imaginary and the capitalist imaginary: > I think that we are at a crossing in the roads of history, history in the > grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its > general orientation. That's the road of the loss of meaning, of the > repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and > cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the > capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of \\"rational mastery,\\" > pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for > the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience > that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in > the domination of this capitalist imaginary. The other road should be > opened: it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social > and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and > collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would > require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.FT A: > \\"Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads,\\" p. 146. He argues that, in the last two centuries, ideas about autonomy again come to the fore: \\"This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950. This is a very specific period because of the very great density of cultural creation but also because of its very strong subversiveness.\\"FT A: \\"Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads,\\" p. 134.  Lasting influence  Castoriadis has influenced European (especially continental) thought in important ways. His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well- known writing to emerge from the continent (especially in the figure of J√ºrgen Habermas, who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis).Elliott 2003, p. 101. Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis' work to a North American sociological audience,Joas, H. 1989. \\"Institutionalization as a Creative Process: The Sociological Importance of Cornelius Castoriadis's Political Philosophy\\", American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 4: 5 (March), 1184‚Äì99. and Johann P√°l Arnason has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis' thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public (especially during his editorship of the journal Thesis Eleven).Arnason, J. P. 1989. \\"Culture and Imaginary Significations\\", Thesis Eleven, February 1989, 22(1): 25‚Äì45. In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy (Brill), and Suzi Adams's Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation (Fordham University Press).

It was referred as a film with a great story and good tension but weak in its giallo part.  Cast  * George Hilton: Billy Rhum Cooney * Jack Betts: David Phaylard * Walter Barnes: Jarrett/Clay Thomas * Sonia Romanoff: Mara * Erika Blanc: Jenny * Mario Brega: Andreas/Yanaro * Jeff Cameron: Mark  Plot  A man dressed as a monk accompanied by a woman arrives to Middletown with a statue of St Absalom on a wagon. Jarret and his gang set fire to a hay wagon in the street and during the confusion they rob the bank, and place the gold coins inside the statue, which was parked by the window of the bank office. Then they ride off and disperse to avoid the pursuing posse. The monk and his companion proceed with the statue to the insignificant town of Poorlands. Later the gang reconvenes there. When the sheriff tries to telegraph his suspicions he is shot, and Jarret takes control of the town and puts a guard with the telegraph operator to make sure that all incoming messages are acknowledged. The man in monk clothes, who is called ‚Äùthe priest‚Äù (Il Santo) objects that killings were not part of the agreement. Jarret‚Äôs plan, however, is to await an Indian guide who knows the way through the desert, and then kill everybody and burn the town to get rid of witnesses. However the guide does not arrive ‚Äì because he was killed earlier in a fight with the Priest who had tried to pay him not to come. The Priest secretly continues a liaison with Jarret‚Äôs woman Mara (the woman on the wagon) and plans to take the gold. He thus supports Jarret against gang members who want it to be divided at once. Billy Rhum, the brother of the sheriff, is locked up in jail but slips out, first to bury the body of his brother, and next to save his friend Mark, who has been caught trying to go for help. When the furious Jarret has all the citizens dragged out into the street and starts shooting people the telegraph operator attempts to send an alarm and is shot. ‚ÄùThe priest‚Äù (who no longer dress' as one) has become aware of Billy‚Äôs outings and offers him money to kill Jarret. When the gang check the statue they find stones instead of gold. Now the posse approaches to investigate why the town telegraph has ceased acknowledging. All men are locked in and women, children and gang members appear as attending the funeral of the telegraph operator. Suddenly Billy Rhum appears as the sheriff, and suggests that the men of the town ‚Äì that is Jarret and the gang ‚Äì join the posse. When they have left, he offers the Priest to leave with Mara, but the two start a shoot-out over the money. They are joined first by Jarret and then by his men, who have turned back covered by the dust of the posse. Billy offers part of the gold to Jarret or the Priest if they kill the other. The rest of the gang perish in the fight and after Priest has saved Billy they join forces, while Mara and Billy‚Äôs girl friend Jenny fight over a gun in the saloon. Jarred barricades himself in the sheriff office and finds the gold hidden in boxes with dynamite. He starts throwing dynamite at his foes, but the whole office explodes and sends the gold raining over the citizens.

He was a student leader during the unrest of May 1968 in FranceZEIT Online Cohn-Bendit zieht sich 2014 aus Politik zur√ºck and was also known during that time as Dany le Rouge (French for \\"Danny the Red\\", because of both his politics and the colour of his hair). He was co-president of the group European Greens‚ÄìEuropean Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He co- chairs the Spinelli Group, a European parliament inter-group aiming at relaunching the federalist project in Europe. He was a recipient of the European Parliament's European Initiative Prize in 2016. Early life Cohn- Bendit was born in 1945 in Montauban, France, to German Jewish parents who had fled Nazism in 1933. He spent his childhood in Montauban. He moved to Germany in 1958, where his father had been a lawyer since the end of the war. He attended the Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim near Frankfurt, a secondary school for children of the upper middle class. Being officially stateless at birth, when he reached the age of 14 he chose German citizenship, in order to avoid conscription. He returned to France in 1966 to study sociology at the University of Paris's Faculty in Nanterre under the supervision of the network society's theorist Manuel Castells. He soon joined the larger and classic nationwide anarchist federation F√©d√©ration anarchiste, which he left in 1967 in favour of the smaller and local Groupe anarchiste de Nanterre and the Noir et rouge magazine. Although residing in Paris, he was frequently able to travel back to Germany, where he was notably influenced by the death of Benno Ohnesorg in 1967, and the assault on Rudi Dutschke in April 1968. In this tense context, he invited Karl Dietrich Wolff, leader of the Socialist German Student Union, for a lecture in Paris, which would prove influential to later May events. In Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was a leader in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as participating in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed to attracting to him a lot of student supporters later to be called the '22 March Movement', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist ideology. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968, students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris. Daniel Cohn-Bendit (1968) From 3 May 1968 onwards, massive student and workers riots erupted in Paris against Charles de Gaulle's government. Cohn-Bendit quickly emerged as a public face of the student protests, along with Jacques Sauvageot, Alain Geismar and Alain Krivine. His \\"foreign\\" origins were highlighted by opponents of the student movement, leading to students taking up the chant, \\"Nous sommes tous des Juifs allemands\\" (\\"We are all German Jews\\"). The French Communist Party leader Georges Marchais described Cohn-Bendit as the \\"German anarchist Cohn-Bendit\\" and denounced some student protesters as \\"sons of the upper bourgeoisie ... who will quickly forget their revolutionary flame in order to manage daddy's firm and exploit workers there\\". Continued police violence, however, prompted trade unions (and eventually the Communist Party) to support the students, and from 13 May onwards, France was struck by a general strike. However, Cohn- Bendit had already retreated on 10 May with a few friends to the Atlantic coast city of Saint-Nazaire, seeing that his Nanterre group had become a minority without political influence in the larger Paris students' movement. Cohn-Bendit's political opponents took advantage of his German passport and had him expelled from Saint-Nazaire to Germany on 22 May as a \\"seditious alien\\". On 27 May the Communist-led workers signed the Grenelle agreements with the government; on 30 May supporters of the president organised a successful demonstration; new elections were called and at the end of June 1968 the Gaullists were back in power, now occupying three-quarters of the French National Assembly. On the whole, Cohn-Bendit had participated little in the May 1968 Paris events, which continued without him, but he had become a legend, which was to be used later in the 1990s upon his return to France. Activism Daniel Cohn-Bendit in 2011 In Frankfurt in the family house, Cohn-Bendit became one of co-founders of the autonomist group Revolutionary Struggle (Revolution√§rer Kampf) in R√ºsselsheim. From this point, his fate was linked with Joschka Fischer, another leader in the group. Both were later to become leaders of the Realo wing of the German Green Party, alongside many former Communist and non-Communist libertarian leftists. Some have suggested that the group participated in violent action, which was common in the German extreme left of the early-seventies. But testimony from witnesses appears contradictory, sometimes unreliable. Communal apartments were common on the left, and peaceful political activists could easily have shared living quarters with terrorists, without further collaboration. In 2003, a request was presented by Frankfurt prosecutors to the European Parliament, requesting they waive the immunity of MEP Cohn-Bendit, in the context of a criminal investigation against the terrorist, Hans-Joachim Klein, but the request was rejected by the assembly. While Fischer was more concerned with demonstrations, Cohn-Bendit worked in the Karl-Marx-Buchhandlung bookshop in Frankfurt and ran an anti-authoritarian kindergarten.Vo√ükuhle sagt Festrede f√ºr Cohn-Bendit ab S√ºddeutsche Zeitung 14 March 2013 In his 1975 book Le Grand Bazar,Cohn-Bendit, Daniel: Le Grand Bazar, 1975, 191 pp. P. Belfond, , he described himself as engaging in sexual activities with very young children at the kindergarten. In 1978, an edition of Pflasterstrand, an alternative magazine Cohn-Bendit edited, described being seduced by a 6-year-old girl as one of the most beautiful experiences the author had ever had.R√ºdiger Soldt, Eine Ehrung voller Entschuldigungen Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 April 2013 In 2001, Cohn-Bendit said that the accounts were invented for purposes of \\"verbal provocation\\", and that \\"I admit that what I wrote is unacceptable nowadays\\".Kate Connolly. Sixties hero revealed as kindergarten sex author  World news  The Observer. Guardian, 28 January 2001. Retrieved on 2012-06-15. Joining the Greens Cohn-Bendit became editor of Pflasterstrand at a time when many 'rebel' movements were petering out. The alternative magazine served as house organ to the anarchist-oriented Sponti-Szene in Frankfurt. There he began taking part in the environmental movement's civil agitation against nuclear energy and the expansion of the Frankfurt airport. When the Sponti movement officially accepted parliamentary democracy in 1984 he joined the German Green Party. In 1988, he published, in French, Nous l'avons tant aim√©e, la r√©volution (In English: We Loved It So Much, the Revolution), a book full of nostalgia for the 1968 counter-culture, and announced his shift toward more centrist policies. In 1989, he became deputy mayor of Frankfurt, in charge of multicultural affairs. Immigrants made up some 30% of the city's population at that time. He also developed a more tolerant policy towards drug addicts. As member of the European parliament At the 1994 European Parliament election in Germany, Cohn-Bendit was elected to the European parliament, although he had been placed only eighth on the electoral list because of his support of military intervention in Bosnia. German Greens at the time did not support the resumption of German military intervention abroad. At the European elections in 1999, he re-entered French politics as the lead candidate on the list of Les Verts, the French Green Party. He found considerable support in the French media, who often feature him, even when he does not represent or is at odds with the party. He reached 9.72% of votes, a score since then unequalled by the French Greens until 2009 (16.28% of the votes), when he was again the Green lead candidate. In 2002, he became joint president of the Green group in the European Parliament, together with the Italian member Monica Frassoni. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Cohn-Bendit attracted controversy for his independent views. He was criticised from the political right for being a strong proponent of freer immigration, the legalisation of soft drugs, and the abandonment of nuclear power, and from the left for his pro-free market policies, his support for military interventions in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and frequent collaboration with centrist personalities, including Bernard Kouchner and Fran√ßois Bayrou. Cohn-Bendit's disregard for conventional European politics of left and right has made him more unpopular in France than in Germany. The French Green Party and the French left in general remain more attached to these distinctions, whereas in the German Green Party, the moderate Realo wing had already won over the hard-line Fundi wing, so that possible alliances with the Conservatives were no longer taboo, and third way policies under the center-left Gerhard Schr√∂der government, such as Agenda 2010 and the Hartz I ‚Äì IV laws, found considerable support in the corporate and financial sectors. Cohn-Bendit was also accused of not giving to the French party the percentage of his income that all MEPs and other elected members are expected to give to their party, even though the party had formally agreed to exempt him from this before his first election in France. This, alongside his pro-European attitude, led him to participate in the 2004 European elections in Germany and not France. He then became the highest- placed male candidate on the list and was elected again. In 2009, Cohn-Bendit criticised Pope Benedict XVI over his comment that condoms only make AIDS worse.Le Parisien. Leparisien.fr (18 March 2009). Retrieved on 2012-06-15. In 2010, he was involved in founding JCall, an advocacy group based in Europe to lobby the European parliament on foreign policy issues concerning the Middle East. =Support for European constitution= In 2003, during the Convention that prepared the text of the European constitution, Cohn-Bendit singled himself out by stating that the countries who would vote No should be compelled to hold a second referendum, and in case of a second No, should be expelled from the European Union. In February 2004, in the context of the preparation of his electoral campaign and in the wider context of the final governmental drafting of the text, he led the foundation of the European Green Party in Rome. Fischer had directly participated to the drafting as German minister of foreign affairs, he was considered one of the candidates for the new role of \\"European minister of Foreign Affairs\\" evoked in the text, and his speech was the keynote of the event. Cohn-Bendit described the European Green Party as the first stone of European citizenship, but other commentators described this new structure as a mere adaptation of the former Federation of European Green Parties. Just as in the former structure, only delegates from national parties were allowed to vote, individual supporters were only entitled to receive information, and all other federations of European parties had to adapt their statuses later in 2004 to the new regulations from the European Commission about European political parties, in order to continue receive public funding. However, Cohn-Bendit as usual was early and energetic in presenting this innovation to the media. During this congress in Rome he also confirmed his involvement in favour of free software. He publicly confessed not understanding much about computer terms, but supported license- free software as part of a stronger market economy. In 2005, he took an active part in the campaign in favour of the European constitution during the French referendum. The treaty was considered by a large part of the left as a European version of globalisation, and Cohn-Bendit became loathed by treaty opponents as one of the symbols of centre-left leaders collaborating with neo- liberalism through international institutions, along with Pascal Lamy from the Socialist Party. He also singled himself out by appearing publicly with right- wing leaders, contrarily to the tactics adopted by the Green Party and the centre-left during that campaign. =2009 European elections= On 7 June 2009, the European Parliament elections gave Cohn-Bendit a major breakthrough in France. In spite of a conservative victory by Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP Party with 27.9% of the votes and an overall conservative victory all over Europe, Europe √âcologie, the coalition founded by Cohn-Bendit, won over 16.28% of the votes, trailing the French Socialist Party led by Martine Aubry (16.48%) by only 0.2%. According to official French results, Cohn-Bendit's list thus became the third political force in France, even overtaking the Socialist Party in the Paris region, and, furthermore by adding the votes of an alternative green party also present in the election, giving greens a never yet experienced weight in French politics. His list featured Franco-Norwegian Magistrate Eva Joly, a specialist of anti-corruption struggles, and Jos√© Bov√©, a controversial trade unionist. =Spinelli Group= On 15 September 2010, Daniel Cohn-Bendit supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate striving for federalisation of the European Union. Other prominent supporters are: Guy Verhofstadt, Jacques Delors, Joschka Fischer, Andrew Duff, Elmar Brok. Political controversy On 5 December 2008, members of the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, including Cohn-Bendit, visited the Czech Republic prior to the start of the Czech presidency of the European Union. They were invited by Czech President V√°clav Klaus to meet him at Prague Castle. Cohn-Bendit, as chairman of Green Group, brought a European flag and presented it to Klaus. Cohn-Bendit also said that he \\"did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply have to sign it\\". Cohn-Bendit also told the Czechs not to interfere with passage of the EU's climate change package.\\"Guess Who‚Äôs Coming To Dinner\\", National Platform for EU Research & Information, accessed January 2009 This meeting was negatively commented in the Czech Republic as an undue interference in Czech affairs. Co-president of the Independence/Democracy parliamentary group, Nigel Farage, compared Cohn-Bendit's actions to a \\"German official from seventy years ago or a Soviet official from twenty years ago.

Defense of paedophilia Cohn-Bendit published a number of provocative statements regarding \\"sex with children\\" in the 1970s and early 1980s, notably in his 1975 book The Great Bazaar (Der grosse Basar) where he describes erotic encounters with five-year-olds in his time as a teacher in an anti- authoritarian kindergarten.Jan Fleischhauer, Ann-Katrin M√ºller and Ren√© Pfister, \\"Paedophile Links Haunt Green Party,\\" Spiegel (13 May 2013). Retrieved 20 November 2013. Since at least 2001, Cohn-Bendit has been accused of defending paedophilia during the 1970s. This controversy re-surfaced in 2013: as Cohn-Bendit received the Theodor Heuss Prize, there was a rally by child-protection activists. The president of Germany's Federal Constitutional Court cited the book as grounds for his refusal to give the speech at the awards ceremony. The affair triggered wider research into the pro-pedophilia activism which prevailed in the German Green Party (without direct involvement on the part of Cohn-Bendit) well into the 1980s. An article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung uncovered several \\"repulsive\\" passages (absto√üende Texte) in Pflasterstrand, a leftist magazine for which Cohn-Bendit was, under press law, responsible. It cited a 1978 defence of Cohn-Bendit's of this editorial practice, as well as an appearance of Cohn-Bendit in a French television talk-show in 1982 where he described a five-year-old girl undressing him as an \\"eroticomaniac game\\". Cohn-Bendit reacted to these allegations by claiming that his descriptions of erotic encounters with pre- pubescent girls were not based on true events but were merely intended as what he today calls \\"obnoxious provocation\\" aimed at questioning sexual morals at the time that \\"shouldn't have been written that way.\\" Paedophilia accusations haunt Green politician DW Akademie, 4 May 2013.Kate Connolly, \\"Green party in Germany to investigate backing for paedophiles in 80s\\" The Guardian (14 May 2013).

The base comprises the forces and relations of production (e.g. employer‚Äìemployee work conditions, the technical division of labour, and property relations) into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life. The base determines society's other relationships and ideas to comprise its superstructure, including its culture, institutions, political power structures, roles, rituals, and state. While the relation of the two parts is not strictly unidirectional, as the superstructure often affects the base, the influence of the base is predominant. Marx and Engels warned against such economic determinism.Engels's letter to J. Bloch; from London to K√∂nigsberg, written on September 21, 1890. Historical Materialism (Marx, Engels, Lenin), p. 294 - 296. Published by Progress Publishers, 1972; first published by Der sozialistische Akademiker, Berlin, October 1, 1895. Translated from German. Online version: marxists.org 1999. Transcription/Markup: Brian Baggins. Retrieved December 16, 2017. The model and its qualification In developing Alexis de Tocqueville's observations, Marx identified civil society as the economic base and political society as the political superstructure.Pawel Zaleski, \\"Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality\\", Archiv f√ºr Begriffsgeschichte, Felix Meiner Verlag, vol. 50, (2008). Marx postulated the essentials of the base‚Äìsuperstructure concept in his preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859): Marx's \\"base determines superstructure\\" axiom, however, requires qualification: #the base is the whole of productive relationships, not only a given economic element, e.g. the working class #historically, the superstructure varies and develops unevenly in society's different activities; for example, art, politics, economics, etc. #the base‚Äìsuperstructure relationship is reciprocal; Engels explains that the base determines the superstructure only in the last instance.Dictionary of the Social Sciences, \\"Base and superstructure\\" entry. Applications, revisions, and criticisms  Marx's theory of base and superstructure can be found in the disciplines of political science, sociology, anthropology, and psychology as utilized by Marxist scholars. Across these disciplines the base-superstructure relationship, and the contents of each, may take different forms. =Max Weber= Early sociologist Max Weber preferred a form of structuralism over a base and superstructure model of society in which he proposes that the base and superstructure are reciprocal in causality‚Äîneither economic rationality nor normative ideas rule the domain of society. In summarizing results from his East Elbia research he notes that, contrary to the base and superstructure model \\"we have become used to,\\" there exists a reciprocal relationship between the two.Scaff, Lawrence A. The British Journal of Sociology , Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 1984), pp. 190‚Äì215 =Antonio Gramsci= The Italian political philosopher Antonio Gramsci divided Marx's superstructure into two elements: political society and civil society. Political society consists of the organized force of society (such as the police and military) while civil society refers to the consensus-creating elements that contribute to cultural hegemony. Both constituents of this superstructure are still informed by the values of the base, serving to establish and enforce these values in society.Morera, Esteve Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique , Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1990), pp. 28, 29. = Walter Rodney = Walter Rodney, the Guyanese political activist and African historian, discussed the role of Marx's superstructure in the context of development cycles and colonialism. Rodney states that while most countries follow a developmental structure that evolves from feudalism to capitalism, China is an exception to this rule and skipped the capitalism step. > \\"The explanation is very complex, but in general terms the main differences > between feudal Europe and feudal China lay in the superstructure ‚Äì i.e. in > the body of beliefs, motivations and sociopolitical institutions which > derived from the material base but in turn affected it. In China, religious, > educational and bureaucratic qualifications were of utmost importance, and > government was in the hands of state officials rather than being run by the > landlords on their own feudal estates.\\" By extension this means that the Marxist development cycle is malleable due to cultural superstructures, and is not an inevitable path. Rather the role of the superstructure allows for adaptation of the development cycle, especially in a colonial context. =Freudo-Marxism and sex-economy= Freudo-Marxist Wilhelm Reich's discipline of analysis known as sex economy is an attempt to understand the divergence of the perceived base and superstructure that occurred during the global economic crisis from 1929 to 1933.Reich, Wilhelm. The Mass Psychology of Fascism. New York: Albion, 1970. 22‚Äì23. Print. To make sense of this phenomenon, Reich recategorized social ideology as an element in the base‚Äînot the superstructure. In this new categorization, social ideology and social psychology is a material process that self-perpetuates, the same way economic systems in the base perpetuate themselves. Reich focused on the role of sexual repression in the patriarchal family system as a way to understand how mass support for Fascism could arise in a society.Reich, Wilhelm. The Mass Psychology of Fascism. New York: Albion, 1970. 14. Print. =Criticisms in critical theory= Contemporary Marxist interpretations such as those of critical theory criticise this conception of the base‚Äìsuperstructure interaction and examine how each affects and conditions the other. Raymond Williams, for example, argues against loose, \\"popular\\" usage of base and superstructure as discrete entities which, he explains, is not the intention of Marx and Engels: =Can the base be separated from the superstructure?= John Plamenatz makes two counterclaims regarding the clear- cut separation of the base and superstructure. The first is that economic structure is independent from production in many cases, with relations of production or property also having a strong effect on production.Lukes, Steven. The Nature of Political Theory. Ed. David Miller and Larry Siedentop. Oxford [Oxfordshire: Clarendon, 1983. 104. Print. The second claim is that relations of production can only be defined with normative terms‚Äîthis implies that social life and humanity's morality cannot be truly separated as both are defined in a normative sense.Lukes, Steven. The Nature of Political Theory. Ed. David Miller and Larry Siedentop. Oxford [Oxfordshire: Clarendon, 1983. 105. Print. =The legality question= A criticism of the base and superstructure theory is that property relations (supposedly part of the base and the driving force of history) are actually defined by legal relations, an element of the superstructure. Defenders of the theory claim that Marx believed in property relations and social relations of production as two separate entities.Cahan, Jean Axelrad. Science & Society , Vol. 58, No. 4 (Winter, 1994/1995), pp. 394‚Äì395 =Neoliberalism and the state= Colin Jenkins provides (2014) a critique on the role of the capitalist state in the era of neoliberalism, using base and superstructure theory as well as the work of Nicos Poulantzas. Regarding developments in the United States during this era (roughly 1980-2015), Jenkins highlights the nature in which political parties and the political system itself are inherently designed to protect the economic base of capitalism and, in doing so, have become \\"increasingly centralized, coordinated, and synchronized over the past half-century.\\" This, according to Jenkins, has led to a \\"corporate-fascistic state of being\\" that is challenging the equilibrium of this fragile relationship. His analysis specifically addresses the role of both major parties, Democrats and Republicans, in the United States: =Triviality= Neven Sesardic agrees that the economic base of society affects its superstructure, however he questions how meaningful this actually is. While the original claim of a strong form of economic determinism was radical, Sesardic argues that it was watered down to the trivial claim that the base affects the superstructure and vice versa, something no philosopher would dispute. Thus Sesardic argues that Marx's claim ultimately amounts to nothing more than a trivial observation that does not make meaningful statements or explain anything about the real world.Sesardiƒá, Neven. \\"Marxian Utopia.\\" (1985), Centre for Research into Communist Economies, , pp.14-15Blanshard, Brand. \\"Reflections on economic determinism.\\" The Journal of Philosophy 63, no. 7 (1966): 169-178, pp.175-177 See also * Althusser * Classical Marxism * Criticism of Marxism * Cultural hegemony * Dialectical materialism * Economic determinism * False consciousness * Historical materialism * Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses * Materialism * Reification * Social change * Social structure References Further reading * Althusser, Louis and Balibar, √âtienne.
