Finding both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that was difficult, highly stylized, and ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem, in the vein of The Waste Land, that expressed a more optimistic view of modern, urban culture than the one that he found in Eliot's work. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has been hailed by playwrights, poets, and literary critics alike (including Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold Bloom), as being one of the most influential poets of his generation.Referenced in this NY Times articleBloom, Harold. \\"Introduction.\\" The Complete Poems of Hart Crane. New York: Liveright, 2001.\\"Hart Crane.\\" Voice and Visions Video Series. Produced by the New York Center for Visual History. 1988. Life and work Hart Crane was born in Garrettsville, Ohio, the son of Clarence A. Crane and Grace Edna Hart. His father was a successful Ohio businessman who invented the Life Savers candy and held the patent, but sold it for $2,900 before the brand became popular. He made other candy and accumulated a fortune from the candy business with chocolate bars. Crane's mother and father were constantly fighting, and they divorced early in April 1917.Exact date seems to be April 1, but is described somewhat unclearly in Mariani p. 35 Crane dropped out of East High School in Cleveland during his junior year and left for New York City, promising his parents he would attend Columbia University later. His parents, in the middle of their divorce proceedings, were upset. Crane took various copywriting jobs and moved between friends' apartments in Manhattan. Between 1917 and 1924 he moved back and forth between New York and Cleveland, working as an advertising copywriter and a worker in his father's factory. From Crane's letters, it appears that New York was where he felt most at home, and much of his poetry is set there. Career Throughout the early 1920s small but well-respected literary magazines published some of Crane's poems, gaining him among the avant-garde a respect that White Buildings (1926), his first volume, ratified and strengthened. White Buildings contains many of Crane's best poems, including \\"For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen\\", and \\"Voyages\\", a sequence of erotic poems. They were written while he was falling in love with Emil Opffer, a Danish merchant mariner. \\"Faustus and Helen\\" was part of a larger artistic struggle to meet modernity with something more than despair. Crane identified T. S. Eliot with that kind of despair, and while he acknowledged the greatness of The Waste Land, he also said it was \\"so damned dead\\", an impasse, and characterized by a refusal to see \\"certain spiritual events and possibilities\\". Crane's self-appointed work would be to bring those spiritual events and possibilities to poetic life, and so create \\"a mystical synthesis of America\\". Crane returned to New York in 1928, living with friends and taking temporary jobs as a copywriter, or living off unemployment and the charity of friends and his father. For a time he lived in Brooklyn at 77 Willow Street until his lover, Opffer, invited him to live in Opffer's father's home at 110 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. Crane was overjoyed at the views the location afforded him. He wrote his mother and grandmother in the spring of 1924: > Just imagine looking out your window directly on the East River with nothing > intervening between your view of the Statue of Liberty, way down the > harbour, and the marvelous beauty of Brooklyn Bridge close above you on your > right! All of the great new skyscrapers of lower Manhattan are marshaled > directly across from you, and there is a constant stream of tugs, liners, > sail boats, etc in procession before you on the river! It's really a > magnificent place to live. This section of Brooklyn is very old, but all the > houses are in splendid condition and have not been invaded by foreigners... His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in The Bridge (1930), intended to be an uplifting counter to Eliot's The Waste Land. The Brooklyn Bridge is both the poem's central symbol and its poetic starting point.Poetry Foundation profile Crane found a place to start his synthesis in Brooklyn. Arts patron Otto H. Kahn gave him $2,000 to begin work on the epic poem. When he wore out his welcome at the Opffers', Crane left for Paris in early 1929, but failed to leave his personal problems behind. His drinking, always a problem, became notably worse during the late 1920s, while he was finishing The Bridge.Delany, Samuel R. (1996), Longer views: extended essays, Wesleyan University Press, p. 190 In Paris in February 1929, Harry Crosby, who with his wife Caresse Crosby owned the fine arts press Black Sun Press, offered Crane the use of their country retreat, Le Moulin du Soleil in Ermenonville. They hoped he could use the time to concentrate on completing The Bridge. Crane spent several weeks at their estate where he roughed out a draft of the \\"Cape Hatteras\\" section, a key part of his epic poem. In late June that year, Crane returned from the south of France to Paris. Harry noted in his journal, \\"Hart C. back from Marseilles where he slept with his thirty sailors and he began again to drink Cutty Sark.\\" Crane got drunk at the Cafe Select and fought with waiters over his tab. When the Paris police were called, he fought with them and was beaten. They arrested and jailed him, fining him 800 francs. After Hart had spent six days in prison at La Santé, Harry Crosby paid Crane's fine and advanced him money for the passage back to the United States, where he finally finished The Bridge. The work received poor reviews, and Crane's sense of his own failure became crushing. Death Crane visited Mexico in 1931–32 on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and his drinking continued as he suffered from bouts of alternating depression and elation. When Peggy Cowley, wife of his friend Malcolm Cowley, agreed to a divorce, she joined Crane. As far as is known, she was his only heterosexual partner. \\"The Broken Tower\\", one of his last published poems, emerged from that affair. Crane still felt himself a failure, in part because he recommenced homosexual activity in spite of his relationship with Cowley. While en route to New York aboard the steamship Orizaba,Mariani (1999) p. 421 he was beaten after making sexual advances to a male crew member. Just before noon on April 27, 1932, Hart Crane jumped overboard into the Gulf of Mexico. Although he had been drinking heavily and left no suicide note, witnesses believed his intentions to be suicidal, as several reported that he exclaimed \\"Goodbye, everybody!\\" before throwing himself overboard. His body was never recovered. A marker on his father's tombstone at Park Cemetery outside Garrettsville, Portage County, OhioWilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition. includes the inscription, \\"Harold Hart Crane 1899–1932 lost at sea\\".Untrecker (1969) Poetics Crane's critical effort, like those of Keats and Rilke, is mostly to be found in his letters: he corresponded regularly with Allen Tate, Yvor Winters, and Gorham Munson, and shared critical dialogues with Eugene O'Neill, William Carlos Williams, E. E. Cummings, Sherwood Anderson, Kenneth Burke, Waldo Frank, Harriet Monroe, Marianne Moore, and Gertrude Stein. He was also an acquaintance of H. P. Lovecraft, who eventually would voice concern over Crane's premature aging due to alcohol abuse. Most serious work on Crane begins with his letters, selections of which are available in many editions of his poetry; his letters to Munson, Tate, Winters, and his patron, Otto Hermann Kahn, are particularly insightful. His two most famous stylistic defenses emerged from correspondences: his Emersonian \\"General Aims and Theories\\" (1925) was written to urge Eugene O'Neill's critical foreword to White Buildings, then passed around among friends, yet unpublished during Crane's life; and the famous \\"Letter to Harriet Monroe\\" (1926) was part of an exchange for the publication of \\"At Melville's Tomb\\" in Poetry. The literary critic Adam Kirsch has argued that \\"[Crane has been] a special case in the canon of American modernism, his reputation never quite as secure as that of Eliot or Stevens.\\"Kirsch, Adam. \\"The Mystic Word. The New Yorker. October 9, 2006 \\"Logic of Metaphor\\" As with Eliot's \\"objective correlative\\", a certain vocabulary haunts Crane criticism, his \\"logic of metaphor\\" being perhaps the most vexed. His most quoted formulation is in the circulated, if long unpublished, \\"General Aims and Theories\\": \\"As to technical considerations: the motivation of the poem must be derived from the implicit emotional dynamics of the materials used, and the terms of expression employed are often selected less for their logical (literal) significance than for their associational meanings. Via this and their metaphorical inter-relationships, the entire construction of the poem is raised on the organic principle of a 'logic of metaphor,' which antedates our so-called pure logic, and which is the genetic basis of all speech, hence consciousness and thought-extension.\\"Hammer (1997) p. 163 There is also some mention of it, though it is not so much presented as a critical neologism, in his letter to Harriet Monroe: \\"The logic of metaphor is so organically entrenched in pure sensibility that it can't be thoroughly traced or explained outside of historical sciences, like philology and anthropology.\\"Hammer (1997) p. 166 L. S. Dembo's influential study of The Bridge, Hart Crane's Sanskrit Charge (1960), reads this 'logic' well within the familiar rhetoric of the Romantics: \\"The Logic of metaphor was simply the written form of the 'bright logic' of the imagination, the crucial sign stated, the Word made words.... As practiced, the logic of metaphor theory is reducible to a fairly simple linguistic principle: the symbolized meaning of an image takes precedence over its literal meaning; regardless of whether the vehicle of an image makes sense, the reader is expected to grasp its tenor.Dembo (1960) p. 34 Difficulty The publication of White Buildings was delayed by Eugene O'Neill's struggle (and eventual failure) to articulate his appreciation in a foreword to it; and many critics since have used Crane's difficulty as an excuse for a quick dismissal.See article on White Buildings Even a young Tennessee Williams, then falling in love with Crane's poetry, could \\"hardly understand a single line—of course the individual lines aren't supposed to be intelligible. The message, if there actually is one, comes from the total effect.\\".Leverich, Lyle. Tom: The Unknown Tennessee Williams. New York: Crown Publishers, 1995. p. 162 It was not lost on Crane, then, that his poetry was difficult. Some of his best, and practically only, essays originated as encouraging epistles: explications and stylistic apologies to editors, updates to his patron, and the variously well-considered or impulsive letters to his friends. It was, for instance, only the exchange with Harriet Monroe at Poetry when she initially refused to print \\"At Melville's Tomb\\" that urged Crane to describe his \\"logic of metaphor\\" in print.Mariani (1999) p. 191 But describe it he did, then complaining that: \\"If the poet is to be held completely to the already evolved and exploited sequences of imagery and logic—what field of added consciousness and increased perceptions (the actual province of poetry, if not lullabies) can be expected when one has to relatively return to the alphabet every breath or two? In the minds of people who have sensitively read, seen, and experienced a great deal, isn't there a terminology something like short-hand as compared to usual description and dialectics, which the artist ought to be right in trusting as a reasonable connective agent toward fresh concepts, more inclusive evaluations?\\"Hammer (1997) p. 281 Monroe was not impressed, though she acknowledged that others were, and printed the exchange alongside the poem: \\"You find me testing metaphors, and poetic concept in general, too much by logic, whereas I find you pushing logic to the limit in a painfully intellectual search for emotion, for poetic motive.\\"Hammer (1997) p. 282 In any case, Crane had a relatively well- developed rhetoric for the defense of his poems; here is an excerpt from \\"General Aims and Theories\\": \\"New conditions of life germinate new forms of spiritual articulation. ...the voice of the present, if it is to be known, must be caught at the risk of speaking in idioms and circumlocutions sometimes shocking to the scholar and historians of logic.\\"Hammer (2006) p. 164 \\"Homosexual Text\\" As a boy, he had a sexual relationship with a man.\\"[That] Hart Crane was homosexual was by now well known to most of his friends. He said to Evans that he had been seduced as a boy by an older man.\\" Rathbone, Belinda. Walker Evans: A Biography. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1995. p. 4 He associated his sexuality with his vocation as a poet. Raised in the Christian Science tradition of his mother, he never ceased to view himself as a social pariah. However, as poems such as \\"Repose of Rivers\\" make clear, he felt that this sense of alienation was necessary in order for him to attain the visionary insight that formed the basis for his poetic work. Recent queer criticism have suggested reading Crane's poems – \\"The Broken Tower,\\" \\"My Grandmother's Love Letters,\\" the \\"Voyages\\" series, and others – with an eye to homosexual meanings in the text. The prominent queer theorist Tim Dean argues, for instance, that the obscurity of Crane's style owes itself partially to the necessities of being a semi-public homosexual – not quite closeted, but also, as legally and culturally necessary, not open: \\"The intensity responsible for Crane's particular form of difficulty involves not only linguistic considerations but also culturally subjective concerns. This intensity produces a kind of privacy that is comprehensible in terms of the cultural construction of homosexuality and its attendant institutions of privacy.\\"Dean (1996) p. 84 Thomas Yingling objects to the traditional, New Critical and Eliotic readings of Crane, arguing that the \\"American myth criticism and formalist readings\\" have \\"depolarized and normalized our reading of American poetry, making any homosexual readings seem perverse.\\"Yingling (1990) p. 3 Even more than a personal or political problem, though, Yingling argues that such \\"biases\\" obscure much of what the poems make clear; he cites, for instance, the last lines of \\"My Grandmother's Love Letters\\" from White Buildings as a haunting description of estrangement from the norms of (heterosexual) family life: The critic Brian Reed has contributed to a project of critical reintegration, suggesting that an overemphasis on the sexual biography of Crane's poetry can skew a broader appreciation of his overall work.Reed (2006) In one example of Reed's approach, he published a close reading of Crane's lyric poem, \\"Voyages,\\" (a love poem that Crane wrote for his lover Emil Opffer) on the Poetry Foundation website, analyzing the poem based strictly on the content of the text itself and not on outside political or cultural matters.Reed, Brian. \\"Hart Crane: \\"Voyages' \\". The Poetry Foundation. Retrieved February 2, 2011. Influence Crane was admired by artists such as Allen Tate, Eugene O'Neill, Kenneth Burke, Edmund Wilson, E. E. Cummings and William Carlos Williams. Although Hart had his sharp critics, among them Marianne Moore and Ezra Pound, Moore did publish his work, as did T. S. Eliot, who, moving even further out of Pound's sphere, may have borrowed some of Crane's imagery for Four Quartets, in the beginning of East Coker, which is reminiscent of the final section of The River, from The Bridge.Oser, Lee. T. S. Eliot and American Poetry. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1998. pp. 112–114. Important mid-century American poets, such as John Berryman and Robert Lowell, cited Crane as a significant influence. Both poets also wrote about Crane in their poetry. Berryman wrote him one of his famous elegies in The Dream Songs, and Lowell published his \\"Words for Hart Crane\\" in Life Studies (1959): \\"Who asks for me, the Shelley of my age, / must lay his heart out for my bed and board.\\" Lowell thought that Crane was the most important American poet of the generation to come of age in the 1920s, stating that \\"[Crane] got out more than anybody else ... he somehow got New York City; he was at the center of things in the way that no other poet was.\\" Lowell also described Crane as being \\"less limited than any other poet of his generation.\\" Hart Crane Biographical Sketch Online Perhaps most reverently, Tennessee Williams said that he wanted to be \\"given back to the sea\\" at the \\"point most nearly determined as the point at which Hart Crane gave himself back\\".Leverich (1995) pp. 9–10 One of Williams's last plays, a \\"ghost play\\" titled \\"Steps Must Be Gentle\\", explores Crane's relationship with his mother.The Theatre of Tennessee Williams, V. 6. New York: New Directions, 1971–1992. In a 1991 interview with Antonio Weiss of The Paris Review, the literary critic Harold Bloom talked about how Crane, along with William Blake, initially sparked his interest in literature at a very young age: > I was preadolescent, ten or eleven years old. I still remember the > extraordinary delight, the extraordinary force that Crane and Blake brought > to me—in particular Blake's rhetoric in the longer poems—though I had no > notion what they were about. I picked up a copy of The Collected Poems of > Hart Crane in the Bronx Library. I still remember when I lit upon the page > with the extraordinary trope, \\"O Thou steeled Cognizance whose leap commits > / The agile precincts of the lark's return.\\" I was just swept away by it, by > the Marlovian rhetoric. I still have the flavor of that book in me. Indeed > it's the first book I ever owned. I begged my oldest sister to give it to > me, and I still have the old black and gold edition she gave me for my > birthday back in 1942. . .I suppose the only poet of the twentieth century > that I could secretly set above Yeats and Stevens would be Hart Crane.Weiss, > Antonio. \\"Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1.\\" The Paris Review. > Spring 1991, No. 118. More recently, the American poet Gerald Stern wrote an essay on Crane in which he stated, \\"Some, when they talk about Crane, emphasize his drinking, his chaotic life, his self-doubt, and the dangers of his sexual life, but he was able to manage these things, even though he died at 32, and create a poetry that was tender, attentive, wise, and radically original.\\" At the conclusion of his essay, Stern writes, \\"Crane is always with me, and whatever I wrote, short poem or long, strange or unstrange—his voice, his tone, his sense of form, his respect for life, his love of the word, his vision have affected me. But I don't want, in any way, to exploit or appropriate this amazing poet whom I am, after all, so different from, he who may be, finally, the great poet, in English, of the twentieth century.\\"\\"The Poem That Changed My Life: On Hart Crane's 'Eternity'\\", Gerald Stern, American Poet, Fall 2011, Issue 41. Such important affections have made Crane a \\"poet's poet\\". Thomas Lux offered, for instance: \\"If the devil came to me and said 'Tom, you can be dead and Hart can be alive,' I'd take the deal in a heartbeat if the devil promised, when arisen, Hart would have to go straight into A.A.\\"Davis, Peter. Poet's book- shelf: Contemporary Poets on Books That Shaped Their Art. Selma, IN: Barnwood Press, 2005. p. 126 Yvor Winters, noted for generally-stern criticism, praised some of Crane's poetry in *In Defense of Reason*, though he heavily criticized Crane's works and poetics. Beyond poetry, Crane's suicide inspired several works of art by noted artist Jasper Johns, including \\"Periscope\\", \\"Land's End\\", and \\"Diver\\", the \\"Symphony for Three Orchestras\\" by Elliott Carter (inspired by The Bridge) and the painting Eight Bells' Folly, Memorial for Hart Crane by Marsden Hartley.MacGowan, Christopher John. 20th-century American Poetry. Maldon, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2004. p.74 Depictions Crane is the subject of The Broken Tower, a 2011 American student film by the actor James Franco who wrote, directed, and starred in the film which was the Master thesis project for his MFA in filmmaking at New York University. He loosely based his script on Paul Mariani's 1999 nonfiction book The Broken Tower: A Life of Hart Crane. Despite being a student film, The Broken Tower was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2011 and received DVD distribution in 2012 by Focus World Films. Crane appears as a character in Samuel R. Delany's novella \\"Atlantis: Model 1924\\", and in The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

The flying buttress (arc-boutant, arch buttress) is a specific form of buttress composed of an arch that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs. The defining, functional characteristic of a flying buttress is that it is not in contact with the wall at ground level, unlike a traditional buttress, and so transmits the lateral forces across the span of intervening space between the wall and the pier. To provide lateral support, flying-buttress systems are composed of two parts: (i) a massive pier, a vertical block of masonry situated away from the building wall, and (ii) an arch that bridges the span between the pier and the wall — either a segmental arch or a quadrant arch — the flyer of the flying buttress.For the functional mechanics of the flying buttresses, see  History  Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, Greece, showing an early example of flying buttresses. As a lateral-support system, the flying buttress was developed during late antiquity and later flourished during the Gothic period (12th–16th c.) of architecture. Ancient examples of the flying buttress can be found on the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and on the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki. The architectural-element precursors of the medieval flying buttress derive from Byzantine architecture and Romanesque architecture, in the design of churches, such as Durham Cathedral, where arches transmit the lateral thrust of the stone vault over the aisles; the arches were hidden under the gallery roof, and transmitted the lateral forces to the massive, outer walls. By the decade of 1160, architects in the Île-de- France region employed similar lateral-support systems that featured longer arches of finer design, which run from the outer surface of the clerestory wall, over the roof of the side aisles (hence are visible from the outside) to meet a heavy, vertical buttress rising above the top of the outer wall. The flying buttresses of Notre Dame de Paris, constructed in 1180, were among the earliest to be used in a Gothic cathedral. Flying buttresses were also used at about the same time to support the upper walls of the apse at the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, completed in 1163. Watkin, David, \\"A History of Wesern Architecture\\" (1986), page 130 Flying buttress of Reims Cathedral, as drawn by Villard de Honnecourt The advantage of such lateral-support systems is that the outer walls do not have to be massive and heavy in order to resist the lateral-force thrusts of the vault. Instead, the wall surface could be reduced (allowing for larger windows, glazed with stained glass), because the vertical mass is concentrated onto external buttresses. The design of early flying buttresses tended to be heavier than required for the static loads to be borne, e.g. at Chartres Cathedral (ca. 1210), and around the apse of the Saint Remi Basilica, which is an extant, early example in its original form (ca. 1170). Later architects progressively refined the design of the flying buttress, and narrowed the flyers, some of which were constructed with one thickness of voussoir (wedge brick) with a capping stone atop, e.g. at Amiens Cathedral, Le Mans Cathedral, and Beauvais Cathedral. The architectural design of Late Gothic buildings featured flying buttresses, some of which featured flyers decorated with crockets (hooked decorations) and sculpted figures set in aedicules (niches) recessed into the buttresses. In the event, the architecture of the Renaissance eschewed the lateral support of the flying buttress in favour of thick-wall construction. Despite its disuse for function and style in construction and architecture, in the early 20th century, the flying-buttress design was revived by Canadian engineer William P. Anderson to build lighthouses.Russ Rowlett, Canadian Flying Buttress Lighthouses, in The Lighthouse Directory.  Construction  Architectural drawing of a Neo-Gothic flying buttress for the late 19th-century Votive Church, in Vienna Given that most of the weight-load is transmitted from the ceiling through the upper part of the walls, the flying buttress is a two-part composite support that features a semi-arch that extends to a massive pier far from the wall, and so provides most of the load-bearing capacity of a traditional buttress, which is engaged with the wall from top to bottom; thus, the flying buttress is a lighter and more cost-effective architectural structure. By relieving the load-bearing walls of excess weight and thickness, in the way of a smaller area of contact, using flying buttresses enables installing windows in a greater wall surface area. This feature and a desire to let in more light, led to flying buttresses becoming one of the defining factors of medieval Gothic architecture and a feature used extensively in the design of churches from then and onwards. In the design of Gothic churches, two arched flyers were applied, one above the other, in which the lower flyer (positioned below the springing point of the vault) resists the lateral-thrust forces of the vault, whilst the upper flyer resists the forces of wind-loading on the roof. The vertical buttresses (piers) at the outer end of the flyers usually were capped with a pinnacle (either a cone or a pyramid) usually ornamented with crockets, to provide additional vertical-load support with which to resist the lateral thrust conveyed by the flyer. A flying buttress as remedial support for a church wall in the English village of Chaddesley Corbett ;Remedial support application Another application of the flying-buttress support system is the reinforcement of a leaning wall in danger of collapsing, especially a load- bearing wall; for example, at the village of Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, England, the practical application of a flying buttress to a buckled wall is more practical than dismantling and rebuilding the wall. Aesthetic style of the Gothic period The early-Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris (shown here with buttresses as later modified) features flying buttresses with blocky porticoed pinnacles, surrounding tall nave, a clerestory, a wide triforium, and two side aisles. Arrows show structural forces (details) The desire to build large cathedrals that could house many followers along multiple aisles arose, and from this desire the Gothic style developed. The flying buttress was the solution to these massive stone buildings that needed a lot of support but wanted to be expansive in size. Although the flying buttress originally served a structural purpose, they are now a staple in the aesthetic style of the Gothic period. The flying buttress originally helped bring the idea of open space and light to the cathedrals through stability and structure, by supporting the clerestory and the weight of the high roofs. The height of the cathedrals and ample amount of windows among the clerestory creates this open space for viewers to see through, making the space appear more continuous and giving the illusion of there being no clear boundaries. It also makes the space more dynamic and less static separating the Gothic style from the flatter more two dimensional Romanesque style. After the introduction of the flying buttress this same concept could be seen on the exterior of the cathedrals as well. There is open space below the arches of the flying buttress and this space has the same effect as the clerestory within the church allowing the viewer to view through the arches, the buttresses also reach into the sky similar to the pillars within the church which creates more upward space. Making the exterior space equally as dynamic as the interior space and creating a sense of coherence and continuity. Gallery of flying buttresses In fiction  The architecture and construction of a medieval cathedral with flying buttresses figures prominently into the plot of the historical novel The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett (1989).

Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders. Etymology Nicholas Andry coined the word in French as ', derived from the Ancient Greek words ὀρθός orthos (\\"correct\\", \\"straight\\") and παιδίον paidion (\\"child\\"), and published Orthopedie (translated as Orthopædia: Or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children) in 1741. The word was assimilated into English as orthopædics; the ligature æ was common in that era for ae in Greek- and Latin-based words. Though, as the name implies, the discipline was initially developed with attention to children, the correction of spinal and bone deformities in all stages of life eventually became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice. Differences in spelling As with many words derived with the \\"æ\\" ligature, simplification to either \\"ae\\" or just \\"e\\" is common, especially in North America. In the US, the majority of college, university and residency programs, and even the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, still use the spelling with the digraph ae, though hospitals usually use the shortened form. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform: in Canada, both spellings are acceptable; orthopaedics usually prevails in the rest of the British Commonwealth, especially in the UK. History=Early orthopedics Many developments in orthopedic surgery have resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the Middle Ages the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' blood which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. Originally, the term orthopedics meant the correcting of musculoskeletal deformities in children. Nicolas Andry, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris coined the term in the first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation and splinting to treat deformities in children. His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of the palms' and freckles.Gundle KR. Rearticulations of Orthopaedic Surgery: The Process of Specialty Boundary Formation and the Provision of Fracture Care in the United States. Lulu: 2014. Jean-André Venel established the first orthopedic institute in 1780, which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He developed the club-foot shoe for children born with foot deformities and various methods to treat curvature of the spine. Advances made in surgical technique during the 18th century, such as John Hunter's research on tendon healing and Percival Pott's work on spinal deformity steadily increased the range of new methods available for effective treatment. Antonius Mathijsen, a Dutch military surgeon, invented the plaster of Paris cast in 1851. However, up until the 1890s, orthopedics was still a study limited to the correction of deformity in children. One of the first surgical procedures developed was percutaneous tenotomy. This involved cutting a tendon, originally the Achilles tendon, to help treat deformities alongside bracing and exercises. In the late 1800s and first decades of the 1900s, there was significant controversy about whether orthopedics should include surgical procedures at all.Gundle KR. \\"Rearticulations of Orthopaedic Surgery: The Process of Specialty Boundary Formation and the Provision of Fracture Care in the United States\\", Lulu: 2014. Modern orthopedics Hugh Owen Thomas, a pioneer of modern orthopedic surgery.Examples of people who aided the development of modern orthopedic surgery were Hugh Owen Thomas, a surgeon from Wales, and his nephew, Robert Jones. Thomas became interested in orthopedics and bone-setting at a young age and, after establishing his own practice, went on to expand the field into general treatment of fracture and other musculoskeletal problems. He advocated enforced rest as the best remedy for fractures and tuberculosis and created the so-called 'Thomas Splint', to stabilize a fractured femur and prevent infection. He is also responsible for numerous other medical innovations that all carry his name: 'Thomas's collar' to treat tuberculosis of the cervical spine, 'Thomas's manoeuvre', an orthopedic investigation for fracture of the hip joint, Thomas test, a method of detecting hip deformity by having the patient lying flat in bed, 'Thomas's wrench' for reducing fractures, as well as an osteoclast to break and reset bones. Thomas's work was not fully appreciated in his own lifetime. It was only during the First World War that his techniques came to be used for injured soldiers on the battlefield. His nephew, Sir Robert Jones, had already made great advances in orthopedics in his position as Surgeon-Superintendent for the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1888. He was responsible for the injured among the 20,000 workers, and he organized the first comprehensive accident service in the world, dividing the 36 mile site into 3 sections, and establishing a hospital and a string of first aid posts in each section. He had the medical personnel trained in fracture management. He personally managed 3,000 cases and performed 300 operations in his own hospital. This position enabled him to learn new techniques and improve the standard of fracture management. Physicians from around the world came to Jones’ clinic to learn his techniques. Along with Alfred Tubby, Jones founded the British Orthopaedic Society in 1894. During the First World War, Jones served as a Territorial Army surgeon. He observed that treatment of fractures both, at the front and in hospitals at home, was inadequate and his efforts led to the introduction of military orthopedic hospitals. He was appointed Inspector of Military Orthopaedics, with responsibility over 30,000 beds. The hospital in Ducane Road, Hammersmith became the model for both British and American military orthopedic hospitals. His advocacy of the use of Thomas splint for the initial treatment of femoral fractures reduced mortality of compound fractures of the femur from 87% to less than 8% in the period from 1916 to 1918.Welsh Biography Online (accessed 14 May 2011) The use of intramedullary rods to treat fractures of the femur and tibia was pioneered by Gerhard Küntscher of Germany. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during World War II and led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of fractures in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late 1970s when the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture. X-ray of a hip replacement. The modern total hip replacement was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in tribology at Wrightington Hospital, on England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head ,and a polyethylene, acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty and its derivative designs were the most- used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants. The Exeter hip replacement system (with a slightly different stem geometry) was developed at the same time. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design and technique of joint replacement (arthroplasty) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant. Knee replacements, using similar technology, were started by McIntosh in rheumatoid arthritis patients and later by Gunston and Marmor for osteoarthritis in the 1970s developed by Dr. John Insall in New York utilizing a fixed bearing system, and by Dr. Frederick Buechel and Dr. Michael Pappas utilizing a mobile bearing system. External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the Vietnam War but a major contribution was made by Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov in the USSR. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in Siberia in the 1950s. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, and malaligned fractures. With the help of the local bicycle shop he devised ring external fixators tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment and lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His Ilizarov apparatus is still used today as one of the distraction osteogenesis methods. Modern orthopedic surgery and musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive and to make implanted components better and more durable. Training This image, taken in September 2006, shows extensive repair work to the right acetabulum 6 years after it was carried out (2000). Further damage to the joint is visible due to the onset of arthritis - a bone/joint disease. In the United States, orthopedic surgeons have typically completed four years of undergraduate education and four years of medical school. Subsequently, these medical school graduates undergo residency training in orthopedic surgery. The five-year residency is a categorical orthopedic surgery training. Selection for residency training in orthopedic surgery is very competitive. Approximately 700 physicians complete orthopedic residency training per year in the United States. About 10 percent of current orthopedic surgery residents are women; about 20 percent are members of minority groups. There are approximately 20,400 actively practicing orthopedic surgeons and residents in the United States. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2011–2012) published by the United States Department of Labor, between 3-4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons. Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further training, or fellowships, after completing their residency training. Fellowship training in an orthopedic sub-specialty is typically one year in duration (sometimes two) and sometimes has a research component involved with the clinical and operative training. Examples of orthopedic sub- specialty training in the United States are: * Hand and Upper Extremity * Shoulder and Elbow * Total Joint Reconstruction (arthroplasty) * Pediatric Orthopedics * Foot and ankle surgery * Spine surgery * Orthopedic Oncologist * Surgical Sports Medicine * Orthopedic Trauma These specialised areas of medicine are not exclusive to orthopedic surgery. For example, hand surgery is practiced by some plastic surgeons and spine surgery is practiced by most neurosurgeons. Additionally, foot and ankle surgery is practiced by board- certified Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) in the United States. Some family practice physicians practice sports medicine; however, their scope of practice is non-operative. After completion of specialty residency/registrar training, an orthopedic surgeon is then eligible for board certification by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists. Certification by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery means that the orthopedic surgeon has met the specified educational, evaluation, and examination requirements of the Board. The process requires successful completion of a standardized written exam followed by an oral exam focused on the surgeon's clinical and surgical performance over a 6-month period. In Canada, the certifying organization is the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada; in Australia and New Zealand it is the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. In the United States, specialists in hand surgery and orthopedic sports medicine may obtain a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in addition to their board primary certification by successfully completing a separate standardized examination. There is no additional certification process for the other sub-specialties. Practice Radiography to identify eventual bone fractures after a knee injury.

(right forearm) Anterior and lateral view x-rays of fractured left leg with internal fixation after surgery According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopedic surgeons are as follows: # Knee arthroscopy and meniscectomy # Shoulder arthroscopy and decompression # Carpal tunnel release # Knee arthroscopy and chondroplasty # Removal of support implant # Knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction # Knee replacement # Repair of femoral neck fracture # Repair of trochanteric fracture # Debridement of skin/muscle/bone/fracture # Knee arthroscopy repair of both menisci # Hip replacement # Shoulder arthroscopy/distal clavicle excision # Repair of rotator cuff tendon # Repair fracture of radius (bone)/ulna # Laminectomy # Repair of ankle fracture (bimalleolar type) # Shoulder arthroscopy and debridement # Lumbar spinal fusion # Repair fracture of the distal part of radius # Low back intervertebral disc surgery # Incise finger tendon sheath # Repair of ankle fracture (fibula) # Repair of femoral shaft fracture # Repair of trochanteric fracture A typical schedule for a practicing orthopedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties and possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting. Arthroscopy The use of arthroscopic techniques has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered in the early 1950s by Dr. Masaki Watanabe of Japan to perform minimally invasive cartilage surgery and reconstructions of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy allows patients to recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. It is a very popular technique. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today and is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty. The majority of upper extremity outpatient orthopedic procedures are now performed arthroscopically. Arthroplasty Arthroplasty is an orthopedic surgery where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight- bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a popular alternative. Joint replacements are available for other joints on a variable basis, most notably the hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, and finger joints. In recent years, surface replacement of joints, in particular the hip joint, have become more popular amongst younger and more active patients. This type of operation delays the need for the more traditional and less bone-conserving total hip replacement, but carries significant risks of early failure from fracture and bone death. One of the main problems with joint replacements is wear of the bearing surfaces of components. This can lead to damage to surrounding bone and contribute to eventual failure of the implant. Use of alternative bearing surfaces has increased in recent years, particularly in younger patients, in an attempt to improve the wear characteristics of joint replacement components. These include ceramics and all-metal implants (as opposed to the original metal-on-plastic). The plastic chosen is usually ultra high-molecular-weight polyethylene, which can also be altered in ways that may improve wear characteristics. Epidemiology Between 2001 and 2016, the prevalence of musculoskeletal procedures drastically increased in the U.S, from 17.9% to 24.2% of all operating room procedures performed during hospital stays. In a study of hospitalizations in the United States in 2012, spine and joint procedures were common among all age groups except infants. Spinal fusion was one of the five most common OR procedures performed in every age group except infants younger than 1 year and adults 85 years and older. Laminectomy was common among adults aged 18–84 years. Knee arthroplasty and hip replacement were in the top five OR procedures for adults aged 45 years and older.

She received 11 battle stars for World War II service and three Presidential Unit Citations, for her second, third, and fifth war patrols. Trout also delivered ammunition to the besieged American forces on Corregidor and brought out 20 tons of gold bars and silver pesos from the Philippine currency reserve to Pearl Harbor. During 1941, she was used as a target by a series of tests determining the vulnerability of submarines to depth charge attacks.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/WDR/WDR58/WDR58-18.html Trout is credited with sinking 12 enemy ships for 37,144 tons according to JANAC records. During her first ten war patrols she made 32 torpedo attacks, firing 85 torpedoes, including 34 hits, 5 confirmed premature detonations, 5 confirmed duds, and 25 suspected duds. She was also involved in six battle surface actions and was attacked with depth charges eight times. She was reported overdue on 17 April 1944 and presumed lost on her eleventh war patrol. Origins Trout was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the trout, any of certain small, fresh-water fishes, highly esteemed by anglers for their gameness, their rich and finely flavored flesh and their handsome (usually mottled or speckled) coloration. Her keel was laid down on 28 August 1939 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 21 May 1940 sponsored by Mrs. Walter B. Woodson, and commissioned on 15 November 1940 with Lieutenant Commander Frank Wesley \\"Mike\\" Fenno, Jr., as captain. Initial operations On 2 July 1941, following \\"shakedown\\" operations along the east coast, Trout and sister ship departed New York City, bound for the Pacific. After transiting the Panama Canal and stopping at San Diego, California, the submarines arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1941, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 with others of her class. Trout conducted training operations with Submarine Division 62 until 29 November when she departed Pearl Harbor to conduct a simulated war patrolAfter October 1941 Pacific Fleet submarines carried war shots with tubes flooded, and orders to fire if attacked. \\"Simulated\\" did not imply a training exercise but a defensive patrol. off Midway Island. Wartime operations=1st patrol — America enters the war  On her defensive station, Trout patrolled submerged during daylight to avoid detection by ships or aircraft. On the morning of 7 December, she received word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That night, the surfaced submarine observed two destroyers shell Midway Island. She was about ten miles distant and proceeded toward the enemy ships at full speed, but they retired before she arrived. Frustrated in being unable to fire a shot, she continued her now-unrestricted war patrol until 20 December 1941 when Fenno returned the ship to Pearl Harbor. 2nd patrol — to the Philippines On 12 January 1942, Trout stood out of Pearl Harbor with 3500 rounds of 3\\" AAA ammunition to be delivered to the besieged American forces on Corregidor. She topped off with fuel at Midway on 16 January and continued westward. On 27 January, near the Bonin Islands, she sighted a light off her port bow, closed to of the vessel, and fired a stern torpedo which missed. She closed to , discovered that her target was a submarine chaser, and, as she had been warned to avoid small ships, resumed her course for the Philippines. On 3 February, Trout rendezvoused with PT-34 off Corregidor and was escorted through its minefields to its South Dock. Trout unloaded her ammunition cargo, refueled, loaded two torpedoes, and requested additional ballast. Since neither sandbags nor sacks of concrete were available, she was given 20 tons of gold bars and silver pesos319 40-pound gold bars and 630 bags each containing 1,000 silver pesos. to be evacuated from the Philippines. The specie came from twelve Philippine banks emptied of their assets, absent the paper money, all of which had been burned to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands. She also loaded securities, mail, and United States Department of State dispatches before submerging shortly before daybreak to wait at the bottom in Manila Bay until the return of darkness. That evening, the submarine was loaded with more mail and securities before she was escorted to open water. Trout set a course for the East China Sea which she entered on 10 February. That afternoon, Trout launched a torpedo at a freighter from a range of but missed. The submarine then closed the target before firing two more which both hit the freighter. Approximately 25 minutes later, her sonar heard four explosions that were the boilers of Chuwa Maru blowing up as she sank. That evening, Trout was returning through the Bonin Islands when she sighted a light. She changed course, closed the range to , and launched two torpedoes at the ship. Both missed. In the time that lapsed between firing the first and the second torpedo, an enemy torpedo passed down Trout’s port side. As the submarine went to , another torpedo passed overhead. Trout came up to periscope depth and fired a third torpedo at the target and blew it up. Sound picked up another ship running at full speed, but there was no opportunity to attack it. Trout was credited with sinking a small patrol ship of approximately 200 tons. When she reached Pearl Harbor on 3 March 1942, the submarine transferred her valuable ballast to the cruiser . Trout received a Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol. Fenno received both the Navy Cross and Army Distinguished Service Cross, and all crew members were awarded the Army Silver Star by Hawaiian Department commanding general Delos C. Emmons in a shipboard ceremony on 18 March 1942. 3rd patrol — into Japanese waters  The submarine's third war patrol, conducted from 24 March to 17 May 1942 took her to Japanese home waters. On 9 April, Trout was patrolling between Ichie-Zaki and Shioni-Misaki when she sighted two small cargo ships. She launched two torpedoes at each target, but all missed. The next day, she launched one torpedo at a small steamer and missed again. On 11 April, she attacked a large freighter with two torpedoes. One hit the target but did not sink it. Between 16 April and 23 April Trout provided cover for the Doolittle Raid task force. Finally, on 24 April, the submarine hit a 10,000 ton tanker with two torpedoes off Cape Shiono, and it headed for the beach. A sweep of the periscope showed a cargo ship going to the aid of the tanker. Trout launched one torpedo and missed. She then closed to and fired another torpedo that hit with a tremendous explosion. When last seen, the cargo ship, too, was heading for shallow water. Four days later, the submarine attacked a 1,000 ton patrol vessel or minesweeper with a torpedo which sank it in two minutes. On 30 April, Trout attacked two ships off Shimo Misaki but missed both. On 2 May, the submarine sank the 5014 ton cargo ship Uzan Maru. Two days later, she fired a spread of two torpedoes at what was thought to be a freighter. The first torpedo missed, but the second hit forward of the bridge, sinking the converted gunboat Kongōsan Maru. The submarine was then subjected to a six- hour depth charge attack before she could clear the area. For this patrol Trout received her second Presidential Unit Citation and Fenno his second award of the Navy Cross. 4th patrol — Task Group 7.1  Trout stood out of Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1942, as a unit of Task Group 7.1, the Midway Island Patrol Group consisting of 12 submarines. Her station was south of the island as nine of the submarines were positioned fan-like to the west of Midway in preparation for the Japanese attack. At 08:12 on 4 June, Trout sighted a Japanese fighter plane preparing to attack from astern. She went deep and heard a series of light explosions. On 9 June, Trout passed through a large oil slick and some debris before rescuing two Japanese from a large wooden hatch cover. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June without firing a torpedo and began a major refit that included installation of search radars and JP sonar in preparation for deployment to Australia. The Trout also carried two POWs (Chief Radioman Hatsuichi Yoshida and Fireman 3rd Class Kenichi Ishikawa) from the sunken Japanese cruiser Mikuma. 5th patrol — the South Pacific  On 27 August,Trout, now under the command of Lt. Cdr. Lawson Paterson \\"Red\\" Ramage, proceeded to Australia via the Marshall and Caroline Islands. She began patrolling the southern approaches to Truk on 7 September and was detected by three patrol craft on 10 September, apparently triangulating her position using radar. Forced to go deep for one and a half hours, Trout was attacked by 45 depth charges. The next day, she sighted a large transport but escorts forced her to go deep and clear the area. On 21 September, the submarine fired three stern torpedoes at a naval auxiliary. The first torpedo broke the ship in half and the next two hit the aft section. The victim was subsequently identified as Koei Maru, a converted net tender of 900 tons. A week later, Trout picked up a carrier group consisting of an escort carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers. The submarine closed to and fired a spread of five torpedoes. She heard two timed explosions and saw the carrier Taiyō slow, with smoke pouring out of her starboard side near the water line. Trout heard high-speed screws approaching and went to as a pattern of ten depth charges shook her severely. On 3 October, with one week remaining in her patrol area, Trout approached to reconnoiter Otta Pass, the southern deepwater entrance to Truk Lagoon. Six miles west of South Islands, she came to periscope depth to obtain a navigational fix. Just as the periscope was lowered, there was a violent explosion close aboard that shook the ship violently. The entire crew was stunned by the shock. One man was thrown from his bunk, and another was knocked off his feet. Trout emergency dived to . As she passed on the way down, another bomb exploded without effect. Since both periscopes were out of commission, the submarine headed for Brisbane for emergency repairs and arrived at Capricorn Wharf, New Farm on 13 October 1942. Trout received her third Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol. 6th patrol — the Solomon Islands Trouts sixth war patrol began on 26 October 1942 and took her to waters around the New Georgia Islands. On 13 November, she was patrolling north of Indispensable Strait when she was ordered to intercept the Kongō-class battleship Kirishima en route to shell Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. On the morning of 14 November Trout located Kirishima and its escort force in the process of refueling but was unable to maneuver into an attack position. Stalking the force, Trout attacked when the Japanese came under air attack in the afternoon and fired a spread of five torpedoes with a depth setting of ; all missed or failed to detonate and she cleared the area. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Brisbane ten days later. After provisioning and off-loading her torpedoes, Trout departed Brisbane on 25 November for Fremantle, Western Australia, where her squadron was then based, arriving 2 December 1942. 7th patrol — Borneo  On 29 December 1942, Trout stood out to sea to patrol the South China Sea off North Borneo. The submarine contacted a large tanker off Miri on 11 January 1943 and launched three torpedoes from a range of . The first two hit the target amidships but the third exploded prematurely. Four minutes later, there was a heavy explosion from the direction of the target. Since postwar examination of Japanese records shows no sinking, the damaged ship must have managed to limp back to port. Ten days later off Indochina, Trout launched two torpedoes at a cargo ship from and watched as the unidentified ship sank immediately. On 29 January, the submarine launched three torpedoes at a destroyer believed to be the Thai Phra Ruang (the former R-class destroyer HMS Radiant) and watched each run true to the target. However, all proved to be duds. On 7 February, she sighted tanker Nisshin Maru No. 2 moored off Lutong, Borneo. She made a submerged approach, launched two torpedoes at the target, heard one explosion, and observed smoke rise from the stern of the tanker. However, no sinking upon this occasion was confirmed. The Nisshin Maru No. 2 was then towed and scrapped South of Ishigaki Island on 16 April 1943. One week later Trout launched two torpedoes at what she thought to be a tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943. 8th patrol — laying mines  Trout was next ordered to plant naval mines in Api Passage, off the northwest coast of Borneo. She got underway on 22 March 1943 and on 4 April, while en route from Balabac Strait to Miri, fired a spread of three torpedoes at a naval auxiliary. One hit the target amidships, raising a plume of water into the air, but the warhead did not explode. Trout fired a fourth torpedo but the ship saw its wake, turned, and dodged it. The next day, Trout launched three torpedoes at another ship with no results. She planted 23 naval mines in Api Passage on 7 and 8 April and then began patrolling the Singapore trade route. On 19 April, she launched four torpedoes at a freighter but scored no hits. Later in the day she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a tanker and missed. Trout sighted two trawlers on 23 April and battle surfaced. Her deck guns soon stopped the first ship dead in the water and set it on fire; they then turned the second one into a burning wreck. Since there was only one torpedo remaining, the submarine headed for Fremantle, where she arrived on 3 May 1943. 9th patrol — special missions  The Trout was now under the command of her former executive officer, Lt. Cdr. Albert Hobbs Clark, a \\"plank owner\\" (member of original ship's complement). From 27 May to 20 July 1943, Trout performed a special mission during an offensive war patrol to the southern Philippines. On 9 June, she missed a transport with three torpedoes. She then landed a five-man U.S. Army team at Labangan, Mindanao. On 15 July, the submarine fired a three-torpedo spread which destroyed the tanker Sanraku Maru. She contacted three small coastal steamers on 26 June and sank two of them with her deck guns. On 1 July, she sank Isuzu Maru with four torpedoes. Eight days later, Trout picked up a party of five American officers including Lt. Cdr. Charles \\"Chick\\" Parsons and AAF Lt. Col. William E. Dyess at Pagadian Bay on Mindanao and headed for Fremantle. 10th patrol — sub to sub  Trout stood out to sea on 12 August to patrol the Surigao Strait and San Bernardino Strait en route back to Pearl Harbor. On 25 August, she battled a cargo-fisherman with her deck guns and then sent a boarding party on board the Japanese vessel. After they had returned to the submarine with the prize's crew, papers, charts, and other material for study by intelligence officers, the submarine sank the vessel. Three of the five prisoners were later embarked in a dinghy off Tifore Island. On 9 September, she fired three bow tubes at a Kaidai-class submarine off Surigao Strait. Thirty-five seconds later, there was a loud explosion which apparently stopped the target's screws. Trouts sound crew reported a torpedo approaching her port beam, and she went to . After she heard a second explosion, Trout came to periscope level, but found no sign of I-182 which she had sunk. On 22 September, one of the remaining Japanese prisoners died of self-imposed starvation and was buried at sea. The next day, the submarine sighted two ships with an escort. One was a freighter with a deck load of planes, and the other was a passenger-cargo. Trout fired a spread of three torpedoes at each of the targets. She saw and heard two hits on each. The freighter Ryotoku Maru sank stern first. Though depth charged afterwards and kept down for five hours, Trout surfaced and gave chase to the damaged transport, finding and attacking it with three more torpedoes before her escort could return. As the transport was being abandoned Trout proceeded close aboard and passed 12 to 15 life boats. The enemy ship was ablaze and low in the water with her bow nearly awash. Sound heard a heavy explosion from Yamashiro Maru and, seven minutes later, Trout could see no trace of her. That night, the submarine set a course for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 October 1943. The submarine was then routed back to the United States for a modernization overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard that included a complete rebuild of her conning tower, reduction of her silhouette by cutting down the fairwater, replacement of the 3\\"/50 deck gun with a larger piece, and installation of 18 additional bunks. She was ready for sea in January 1944 and returned to Submarine Division 162 at Pearl Harbor late that month. Final patrol and loss On 8 February 1944, the submarine began her 11th and final war patrol. Trout topped off with fuel at Midway Island and, on 16 February, headed via a great circle route toward the East China Sea. Japanese records examined after the war indicate that one of their convoys, Matsu No. 1, was attacked by a submarine on 29 February 1944 in the patrol area assigned to Trout. Carrying the 29th Infantry Division of the Kwantung Army from Manchuria to Guam, Matsu No. 1 consisted of four large transports escorted by three Yūgumo-class destroyers of Destroyer Division 31: Asashimo, Kishinami, and Okinami. The submarine badly damaged one large passenger-cargo ship and sank the 7,126-ton transport Sakito Maru, which was carrying the Japanese 18th Infantry Regiment. Asashimo detected the submarine and dropped 19 depth charges. Oil and debris came to the surface and the destroyer dropped a final depth charge on that spot, at the position . The submarine was using Mk. XVIII electric torpedoes, and it was also possible that one of those had made a circular run and sunk the boat, as happened with Tang. According to the US Navy Muster Reports in the National Archives, On 7 April 1944, Trout was declared presumed Missing in Action with all 81 hands. On 8 April 1945, Trout was declared presumed lost with all 81 hands including Clark and his executive officer, Lt. Harry Eades Woodworth, both of whom had made all 11 war patrols. In culture Trout is the subject of the second episode of the syndicated television anthology series The Silent Service. The episode entitled \\"The Trout at the Rainbow's End\\" aired 5 Apr 1957 and was about the Corregidor mission.

Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932. The freedom to roam, or \\"everyman's right\\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for recreation and exercise. The right is sometimes called the right of public access to the wilderness or the \\"right to roam\\". In Scotland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Czech Republic and Switzerland, the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of Northern Europe and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles. In England and Wales public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land. Europe= Nordic countries  Ancient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm. Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right. Camping in a forest in Femundsmarka National Park, Norway Today these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking wildflowers, mushrooms and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage wildlife or crops. Access rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions). Making noise is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a tent in the forest for one night is allowed, but not the use of a caravan. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as houses, gardens) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission. There are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In Denmark, there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only. = Finland = In Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called \\"\\" in Finnish and \\"\\" in Swedish (lit. \\"the everyman's right\\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example. One may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species). One may fish with a rod and line (only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain restrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can walk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from selling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free. Picking cloudberry may be temporarily restricted to local residents in parts of Lapland. In the autonomous province of Åland the right to camp's inclusion in the right to roam was disputed, but since 2013 this is no longer the case. One may not disturb others or damage property, disturb breeding birds (or their nests or young), or disturb reindeer or game animals. One may not cut down or damage living trees, or collect wood, moss or lichen on other people's property, nor may one light open fires without the landowner's permission (except in an emergency). It is acceptable, however, to use an alcohol burner, wood stove or similar device that has no hot parts touching the ground. One may not disturb the privacy of people's homes by camping too near to them or making too much noise, nor litter, drive motor vehicles off-road without the landowner's permission, or fish (excluding angling) or hunt without the relevant permits. If horse riding causes more than a minor inconvenience or disturbance, an agreement for the long term use of the route must be made with the landowner. A horse may also be taken to swim in a water body without the consent of the owner of the water area (excluding public beaches). The right is a positive right in the respect that only the government is allowed to restrict it as in the case of strict nature reserves. However, the exact definition remains mostly uncodified and based on the principle of nulla poena sine lege (what is not illegal cannot be punished). = Norway = Everyone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through, uncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old consuetudinary law called the allemannsrett (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act. It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms utmark and innmark divide areas where the right to roam is valid (utmark, literally something like \\"land outside [the boundaries]\\"/\\"[Out Field]\\") and where it is invalid or restricted (innmark, \\"land inside [the boundaries]\\"/\\"[In Field]\\"). The law specifies innmark thoroughly, and all areas not covered by this definition are defined as utmark, generally speaking uninhabited and uncultivated areas. Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow. There are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway: * People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage. * Campfires are not allowed in the forest areas between 15 April to 15 September, unless it obviously can not lead to a fire. * Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks. In later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the Oslo Fjord and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines). Canoeing, kayaking, rowing and sailing in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming – with the exception of lakes that are drinking water reservoirs (see for instance Maridalsvannet). Wild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway. Hunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. In salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more. = Sweden = In Sweden (lit. \\"the everyman's right\\") is a freedom granted by the Constitution of Sweden. Since 1994 the Instrument of Government says that notwithstanding the right to own property \\"everyone shall have access to nature in accordance with allemansrätten\\".Regeringsformen. 2 kap, Grundläggande fri- och rättigheter § 18, Regeringen \\"Alla skall ha tillgång till naturen enligt allemansrätten oberoende av vad som föreskrivits ovan.\\" What this means is not further explicated on in the constitution, and only sparsely in other legislation. In practice, allemansrätten is defined as actions that are not crimes, will not make a person liable to pay damages, nor can be prohibited by any authority.Ebbesson, Jonas (2003):Miljörätt. As in other Nordic countries, the Swedish right to roam comes with an equal emphasis being placed upon the responsibility to look after the countryside; the maxim is \\"do not disturb, do not destroy\\". Allemansrätten gives a person the right to access, walk, cycle, ride, ski, and camp on any land—with the exception of private gardens, the immediate vicinity of a dwelling house and land under cultivation. Restrictions apply for nature reserves and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the hemfridszon). The hemfridszon's size depends on conditions but can be as large as 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house. To better protect access to water and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not permitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or shoreline. Fishing remains essentially private—apart from on the biggest five lakes and the coast of the Baltic Sea, the Sound, Kattegat and Skagerrak. It is permitted to drive a car on a private road unless explicitly signposted otherwise. Small camp fires are generally permitted, but in some periods banned by local authorities due to wild fire risk. It is allowed to put up a tent on any uncultivated land for a night or two. There has been some controversy on commercial use of the berry picking rights, when companies legally contract people to pick berries in the forests. Exercise of the rights is overseen by the County Administrative Boards—which can, for example, force the removal of a fence if it obstructs access to areas that are important to the allemansrätt. Many Swedish people consider this to be a form of legacy or human right. =Iceland= Like other Nordic countries Icelandic law contains a version of the freedom to roam, the right to access uncultivated land, camp there, pick berries, and in some months even light a campfire. \\"It is permissible to cross uncultivated private property without seeking any special permission, but landowners may limit routes with signs or other marks. State-owned land such as conservation areas and forestry areas are open to everyone with few exceptions. These exceptions include – but are not limited to – access during breeding seasons or during sensitive growth periods\\". Hikers should, however, \\"avoid taking shortcuts over fenced areas, pastures and private plots\\", and follow the rules in conservation areas. Footpaths should also be followed, if they exist, to help protect the landscape. Furthermore, \\"landowners may not hinder passage of walkers alongside rivers, lakes and ocean, or on tracks and paths'.The Environment Agency of Iceland Cycling may be restricted on some paths. Equestrians must keep to bridleways where they exist and in other places show \\"consideration for the land\\". Fishing requires a license but collecting \\"berries, mushrooms, seaweed and other plants for immediate consumption\\" is permitted on \\"public lands and highland pastures\\".  Estonia  In Estonia, it is permitted to access natural and cultural landscapes on foot, by bicycle, ski, boat, or on horseback. Private property may be accessed at any time. If the private property is fenced or posted against trespassing, the permission of the owner is required to proceed. The owner of the private property is also required to post signs stating the ownership of the land, and contact numbers, to avoid legal issues. Land owners may not block access to land, roads or bodies of water that are public or designated for public use, including ice and shore paths. All bodies of water that are public or designated for public use have public shore paths that are up to 4 m wide. The shore path along a navigable body of water may extend to a distance of 10 m of the water line. The owner may not close this path even if the private property is posted or marked with no-trespassing signs. Grazing areas and other enclosed areas along the shore paths must have stiles. Ponds with no outlet located entirely on the land of one land owner and lakes smaller than five hectares located on land belonging to more than one land owner shall not be in public use. Permission from the landowner is required to access such bodies of water. Neither do bodies of water protected as sources of drinking water or which are in use by aquaculture or are in other special use have a shore path. All of the rights and responsibilities regarding humans’ interaction with nature are collectively termed everyman's right. Everyman's right does not pertain to the organizing of sporting events or other public events in open country. To organize these, the permission of the landowners or other possessors of land, and if necessary, of the local government, must be sought. The following is permitted in nature: * accessing areas by foot, on bicycle, skis, boat or horseback in all places not prohibited on the basis of law(s); * being present in any area where access is permitted; * gathering wild berries, mushrooms, flowers, medicinal plants, hazelnuts and other natural products not under nature protection; * fishing bodies of water that are public or designated for public use with a simple hand line. The following is prohibited: * accessing the immediate proximity of a person's yard, plantations, apiaries, sown crops, grain field and other cropland where damage is thereby incurred by the owner; * lighting fires and camping without permission from the land owner or possessor; * hunting and fishing without relevant license, except for simple hand line; * injuring trees and bushes; * disrupting the peace of local inhabitants; * damaging the habitats and nests of forest animals and birds, gathering or removing their eggs, or otherwise doing harm to them; * damaging nature protection objects and protected species; * using motor vehicles where prohibited; * polluting nature. Belarus Article 13 of Section I of the Constitution of Belarus guarantees that all forest and farm land is publicly owned. Forty percent of the country's territory is covered by forest, and approximately the same amount devoted to agriculture. According to the Forest Code (Article 13) \\"citizens have the right to freely stay in the forest and collect wild fruits, berries, nuts, mushrooms, other food, forest resources and medicinal plants to meet their own needs.\\" Austria The right to roam in Austria, particularly in forests and mountainous areas, is called Wegefreiheit. Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission. A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the Österreichische Bundesforste, but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as Carinthia, Styria, and Salzburg guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria. Czech Republic Czech Hiking Markers System for trail blazing has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere The old legal institute of \\"right of the way\\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in Austria-Hungary law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land. The Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\\"veřejná přístupnost krajiny\\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness – excluding parcels owned by a natural person). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing. In national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.). According to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\\"obecné užívání lesa\\", common use of forest – including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest – because they are not considered as \\"forest land\\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc. The Road Act defines obecné užívání pozemních komunikací (common use of roads – some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \\"obecné užívání povrchových vod\\" (common use of surface waters). Switzerland  The freedom to roam is guaranteed in Switzerland by the Swiss Civil Code. However, some cantons have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people. The Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or biotopes it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests). Germany In Germany a limited right to roam, called Jedermannsrecht, is guaranteed by federal law. The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law. =Bavaria= The Constitution of Bavaria guarantees everyone \\"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\\". The right is nicknamed Schwammerlparagraph (mushroom clause). The article also obliges \\"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\\". \\"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\\".  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in most of Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The Ramblers' Association, which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation. = England and Wales = In England and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited right to roam, without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally downland, moorland, heathland and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the Forestry Commission. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature. The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established public footpaths and bridleways, on common land and on the foreshore, and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access). Angling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as swimmers and canoeists with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The British Canoe Union is running the Rivers Access Campaign, to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales. Much of the Dartmoor National Park has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 on the OPSI website Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers. = Scotland = In Scotland the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 comprehensively codified into Scots law the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland. The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse- riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming. The rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW). =Northern Ireland= Access rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \\"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes used to reach … mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments pass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be there.\\" The Access to the Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 gave some rights, but access is generally modelled on the restrictive 1949 English/Welsh law. The absence of a tradition of access, political influence of landowners and problems of governance have been blamed for the lack of freedom to roam. Republic of Ireland Keep Ireland Open is a voluntary campaign organisation with the aim of improving access to the countryside. Journalist Fintan O'Toole called Irish law \\"perhaps the most negative and mean-minded regime for walkers in Europe\\". Access rights in Ireland have been described as being \\"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes used to reach our mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments pass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be there.\\" The national parks are described by Keep Ireland Open as \\"the only places in Ireland where freedom to roam exists\\", but they only cover 0.9% of the country. Comhairle na Tuaithe was established by Éamon Ó Cuív, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2004 to mediate between landowners, state agencies and recreational users of the countryside. North America= United States Property rights within the United States include the right to exclude others. But under some circumstances, long-term use of a path across private property may legally establish a prescriptive easement for the public. On federally owned property, the property clause of the constitution grants the United States Congress the authority to regulate federal property \\"without limitations\\". In the United States governmental entities including cities, counties, states, and the federal government all manage land which are referred to as either public lands or the public domain. The majority of public lands in the United States are held in trust for the American people by the federal government and include about 640 million acres of land, about 28% of the total land area of 2.27 billion acres.Lipton, Eric, and Clifford Krauss, Giving Reins to the States Over Drilling, New York Times, August 24, 2012.Carol Hardy Vincent, Carla N. Argueta, & Laura A. Hanson, Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data, Congress Research Service (March 3, 2017). Any person, including non- citizens, can legally access and recreate on these lands lawfully. This is often referred to as the North American model of land conservation. California's \\"California Coastal Act\\" provides a similar right for its beaches, and is successfully suing littoral property owners who try to use trespassing laws to restrict public access to the public portions of a beach. Florida's state constitution establishes a public trust of \\"sovereignty lands\\", including wet beaches \\"below mean high water lines … for all the people,\\" respecting a freedom to roam there, regardless of any private neighboring dry beach. Local ordinances typically limit this freedom strictly to roaming on foot, and prohibit driving motor vehicles or beaching boats. Article X, Section 11. The Oregon Beach Bill (House Bill 1601, 1967) was a piece of landmark legislation in the U.S. state of Oregon, passed by the 1967 session of the Oregon Legislature. It established public ownership of land along the Oregon Coast from the water up to sixteen vertical feet above the low tide mark. In Pennsylvania, the 1966 Recreational Use of Land and Water Act (RULWA) limits landowners' liability for personal injury and property damage if they make their land available to the public for recreation. The statute encourages landowners to open their undeveloped land for recreational use. Canada Much of Canada is Crown land owned by the provinces. Some is leased for commercial activity, such as forestry or mining, but on much of it there is free access for recreational activities like hiking, cycling, canoeing, cross-country skiing, horse back riding, and licensed hunting and fishing, etc. At the same time access can be restricted or limited for various reasons (e.g., to protect public safety or resources, including the protection of wild plants and animals).; › DNR › Crown Land In the Canadian Territories Crown land is administered by the Canadian Federal Government. Canadian National Parks have been created from Crown land and are also administered by the Federal Government. There are also provincial parks and nature reserves that have been similarly created. The aboriginal peoples in Canada may have specific rights on Crown land established under treaties signed when Canada was a British colony, and have claimed ownership of some Crown land. In Ontario, Canadian citizens and people who have lived in Canada for at least 7 months of the preceding 12-month period are allowed to camp for free up to 21 days on any one site in a calendar year, on crown land/conservation reserves . Australia Although formerly a British colony, Australians only have limited access to the land, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.Peter Hancock, \\"How did we lose Britain's freedoms?\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, July 8, 2013 (http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-did-we-lose-britains- freedoms-20130704-2pdus.html) However, much of Australia's land area is Crown land, which is administered by the Australian states, and while a lot of this consists of pastoral leases, and land owned and run by Aboriginal people (e.g. APY lands), access is normally permitted for recreational purposes to “unallocated” Crown land; though motorized vehicles are required to follow roads. New Zealand There is extensive public access in New Zealand, including waterways and the coast, but it is \\"often fragmented and difficult to locate\\". The \\"Queen's Chain\\" is a concept in New Zealand property law. It is a strip of public land, usually 20 metres (or one chain in pre-metric measure) wide along rivers, lakes and the coast line. It was designed to prevent land upriver or along a coast being inaccessible to any prospective buyers. The strips are incomplete and their exact modern location can be complex to determine. These strips exist in various forms (including road reserves, esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, marginal strips and reserves of various types) but not as extensively and consistently as is often assumed. In 2007 the government of New Zealand reviewed the rights of public access for outdoor recreation. However, unlike the United Kingdom, \\"the New Zealand review recommended no increase in the public's right to access private property\\".Campion, R., & Stephenson, J. (2010). \\"The ‘right to roam’: Lessons for New Zealand from Sweden’s allemansrätt\\". Australasian Journal of Environmental Management, 17(1), 18–26. doi:10.1080/14486563.2010.9725245  Criticism  In recent years population growth has increased pressure on some areas popular for hiking and increased mobility and affluence has made previously remote areas more accessible. There is some concern that without ecological education, some recreational users have limited understanding of the economic and natural systems they are exploring, though significant harm or damage is unusual, the main concerns being disturbance of sensitive species of wildlife (particularly by dogs), and litter. The 1992 Rio Convention on Biodiversity (subscribed to by 189 countries) expressed some caution about the potential effect of unlimited access, especially in tropical forests, where slash and burn practices undermine biodiversity. For this reason, broad public access rights are challenged in some countries' resulting Biodiversity Action Plan. Critics from defenders of proprietorship sometimes assert that the All People's Right threatens the essence of ownership and the \\"management practices\\" of property owners, who may or may not have created and preserved environmentally important qualities Claimed among others by LRF – The Federation of Swedish Farmers (in Swedish on their web-site May 2011) Private owners and their representatives have also argued that newly created access rights ought to lead to financial compensation for private landowners.

Educated in the major cultural center of Nishapur, and employed at the court of the famous Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud, Bayhaqi was a highly cultured man, whose magnum opus—the Tarikh-i Bayhaqi, is seen as the most reliable source of valid information about the Ghaznavid era, which was written in an exquisite and vivid Persian prose that would become an ideal model for several eras. Bayhaqi is praised by modern scholars for his frankness, precision, and elegant style in his book, which he had spent 22 years to write, finishing it in thirty volumes, of which however only five volumes and half of the sixth exist today. Julie Scott Meisami places Bayhaqi among the historians of the Islamic Golden Age.  Life =Youth and early career Bayhaqi was born in the village of Harethabad in Bayhaq in the Khorasan Province, then under the rule of the declining Samanid emirate; in 998, the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud of Ghazni (r. 998-1030) declared independence from the Samanids, and eventually divided the Samanid state with the Karakhanids, ending the Samanid dynasty. In his youth Bayhaqi studied in the major cultural center of Nishapur, and later in 1020/1 joined the secretariat (dīvān-e resālat) of Mahmud, where he worked as an assistant and pupil under the chief secretary Abu Nasr Mushkan for 19 years. After Mushkan's death in 1039/40, Mas'ud I (r. 1030–1040) appointed Bayhaqi as minister to Abu Sahl Zawzani, who had succeeded Muskhan as the chief secretary of the empire. Muskhan substantially urged the Sultan that Bayhaqi should be his successor, and the Persian vizier Ahmad Shirazi had also commended Bayhaqi in the Sultan's attendance. Bayhaqi (who was at that time 46 years old) was supposedly told by Mas'ud I that he was too young to be appointed the new chief secretary. Later career Zawzani was not as accomplished in the management of the secretariat as his predecessor had been, and his methods were completely dissimilar. Furthermore, Bayhaqi was often a victim of his bad temper, which made the latter send a secret letter of relinquishment of his responsibility to the Sultan, who, however, heartened Bayhaqi to continue serving in his post, whilst ordering his vizier to inform that Zawzani should behave properly towards Bayhaqi at the secretariat. This he did, however; Mas'ud I died shortly afterwards being deserted by his army after a disastrous defeat against the Seljuq Turks, who then conquered Khorasan. Mas'ud's death made Zawzani resume his bad treatment of Bayhaqi once more. Bayhaqi experienced several problems after Mas'ud I's death, probably partly due to his own failings, which he himself often recognizes. During the reign of Abd al-Rashid (r. 1049-1052) Bayhaqi was finally selected as the chief secretary. He was, however, after a short period removed from the post. According to Ibn Funduq, he was jailed by the judge (qāżī) of Ghazni on the complaint of having failed to meet the unpaid obligatory fee to a wife, but according to Aufi, the reason behind his imprisonment was due to the ploys of his enemies. A slave named Tuman (or Nuyan) was afterwards ordered by the Sultan to seize Bayhaqi's possessions. In 1052, the rebellious slave-soldier (ghulam) Toghrul seized Ghazni, had Abd al-Rashid killed, and had the sultan's men jailed in a stronghold, where Bayhaqi was also moved. However, Toghrul's reign lasted only 15 days; he was defeated and killed by Ghaznavid loyalists, who put Farrukh- zad (r. 1053–1059) on the throne. Bayhaqi was then released from imprisonment. The writing of Tarikh-i Bayhaqi and death Coin of Sultan Farrukh-zad (r. 1053-1059). According to Ibn Funduq, Bayhaqi served as secretary under Farrukh-zad and at the end of the latter's reign withdrew from bureaucratic life and settled in Ghazni, where he started to write the Tarikh-i Bayhaqi. However, judging from Bayhaqi's few comments in his book on Farrukh-zad's rule, it appears that he did not take part in Farrukh-zad's court. Indeed, he evidently reports that during those years he was occupied on writing his history. According to the Aḵbār al-dawla al-saljūqīya (Chronicles of the Seljuq state), Bayhaqi formulated the peace treaty between the Seljuqs and Ghaznavids in 1058. He accordingly may have been called back to work after his dishonor and imprisonment during the rule of Abd al-Rashid. Anyhow the information of the Tarikh-i Bayhaqi evidently show that Bayhaqi in his old age, until his death in 1077, had committed himself completely to the writing of the book. His tomb is located in his birthplace, Harethabad. ReferencesSources   E.G. Browne. Literary History of Persia.

Lineage He was the only surviving son of 4th earl of the second creation and his first wife, Elizabeth de Bohun. When he was 16 his father was executed (1397) and his lands and titles forfeited. Fitzalan was a royal ward of King Richard's half-brother John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter, along with a large part of the Arundel estates. Holland greatly mistreated him, a matter Fitzalan would cruelly repay many years later. Escape, exile, return and restoration Eventually Fitzalan escaped from his guardian and joined his uncle Thomas Arundel, the deposed Archbishop of Canterbury, in exile. The two eventually joined with another exile, the King's cousin Henry Bolingbroke. Fitzalan followed Henry in his return to England in July 1399, and in the following events which led to the deposition of King Richard II and Henry's crowning as King Henry IV. He functioned as butler at the coronation, and shortly afterward the new King restored him to his titles and estates. These included two notable Earldoms; those of Earl of Arundel and Earl of Surrey, and large estates in the Welsh Marches. The Epiphany Rising Early the next year a group of Barons who had been close to the deposed King Richard II revolted--known as the Epiphany Rising--amongst them Fitzalan's former guardian John Holland. The latter was captured by followers of Fitzalan's aunt Joan, Countess of Hereford, and at Fitzalan's behest was soon executed (some claim he was tortured first). The rebellion of Owain Glyndwr in Wales The next few years Fitzalan was much occupied by events in the Welsh marches, where he had to help deal with the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr which ran in full from 1400 to maybe 1412 but gained a great deal of early momentum until 1405. After the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 he was appointed to defend the Marches from further attacks along its full length and then focused on defeating Glyndwr in the northern March adjacent to North Wales. Revolt in the North In 1405 there was a revolt in the north of England, led by the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, and the Earl of Norfolk, Thomas de Mowbray. Fitzalan was the head of the Commission which condemned the pair to death. This apparently led to a falling out between Fitzalan and his uncle, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, who objected to the execution of a fellow prelate. Portuguese alliance and marriages King Henry's sister, Philippa of Lancaster, had married King John I of Portugal, and to further cement the alliance between England and Portugal, Fitzalan married Beatrice, the illegitimate daughter of King John. The wedding took place in London on 26 November 1405, with King Henry IV in attendance. Welsh conflicts and alliance with Burgundy In the following years Fitzalan again had to help suppress revolts in Wales and the Welsh Marches. Politically, Fitzalan allied himself with the King's half-brothers the Beauforts, and when Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor in 1410, Fitzalan became one of the King's principal councillors. Beaufort favored an alliance with Burgundy, and Fitzalan was one of the leaders of those sent to help fight the rival Armagnac faction in France. Sometime in this period Fitzalan was made a Knight of the Garter. Henry IV fell seriously ill in 1411, but was determined to forge an alliance with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. The King announced his intention that a fleet would be sailing to Calais, and issued instructions to ambassadors to go to Burgundy's offer of a military aid against Orleans. But two days before the fleet was due to sail, the king changed his mind, and on 21 September 1411 declared Parliament would meet in November. Instead Arundel set sail with a private fleet and a mercenary force hired by the Burgundians from the Prince of Wales. Arundel found himself in a difficult dilemma: the king wanted an Armagnac alliance, but the prince preferred to deal with Burgundy. A double-dealing policy commenced negotiating with the duke of Berry while continuing to reinforce Burgundy. But the old king recovered at the November Parliament, and the prince's Regency council was dismissed. On 9 November, Arundel led 1000 archers to aid the Burgundians to victory before the bridge at the Battle of St Cloud, near Paris. Some of Arundel's men fought in the ranks of Duke's bodyguard.; . The Peace of Chartres signed by Henry IV in 1409 was broken. His policy of pro-Valois Armagnac diplomacy was enshrined in the Treaty of Bourges. But no sooner had it been signed on 20 May, the friends of the Burgundian elites declared it illegal, because it was. John the Fearless raised a royal army forcing Berry to surrender Bourges in the name of Charles VI on 15 July. The very next day the peace was renewed by the French nobility in a promissory letter to Henry IV signed by the dukes of Berry, Orleans, Bourbon and Burgundy. On 10 August 1412, the peace was again threatened by Thomas, Duke of Clarence who extorted an humiliating ransom from the Armagnacs after he had landed at St Vaast-le- Hogue. The King favoured Clarence over his older brother, so the Beauforts lost influence, and Arundel retired to his estates. Clarence was instructed to proceed to Gascony to await; the next spring King Henry IV died.  Great friend and soldier of Henry V  Arundel was with Henry at Westminster for Christmas 1414. One of the king's close friends he displayed the cardinal virtues of loyalty to the Lancastrian monarchy, as well as enjoying the honour of personal comradeship. Some lords remained loyal to Richard II and threatened rebellion throughout the north. There were those on the Welsh Marches, such as the Chamberlain of Chester who had deserted to Owain Glendower.} The new King Henry V restored the Earl of Arundel to a place of influence, immediately appointing him Lord Treasurer, as well as constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. On 19 March 1415 The Lord Warden was ordered to summon and array seamen for a forthcoming fleet operations: 57 ships from the Cinque Ports in 40 days were expected to assemble. No ship more than 20 tuns was permitted to leave port. All requisitioned vessels were to be taken to Southampton by 8 May. On St George's Day at Windsor Arundel was made a Knight of the Garter with precedence. He was among 16 of the 25 knights preparing for war that summer. The following day 24 April, the king rewarded his friend with an additional £300 on top of a modest salary as Lord Treasurer of £100 per annum. Arundel's experience deploying massed ranks of longbowmen was vital to Henry's strategy to succeed; as many as 2000 had been used at St Cloud. But the invasion date was put back to 1 July, at the end of April. On 15 June a service was held at St Paul's; Arundel could not have known he would not return in triumph, so he lingered at least until 24 June. Meanwhile, he was despatched on an expedition \\"into parts of Wales\\" to raise more archers to add complement to existing units. The royal household paid him £18 12s expenses, but the coffers being bare, Arundel's troops did not receive all their wages. On 27 May 1415, Arundel and Thomas Beaufort had been put in charge of provisioning Calais and the army in Normandy.Calendar of Pipe Rolls, pp. 336, 338. This included a scheme devised by the Keeper of the Privy Seal to extort money out of Italian merchants in London that raised nearly £2000. As they were about to leave (8 August) Southampton by ship, King Henry replaced Arundel with a new Treasurer, Sir John Rothenhale; Arundel was on the campaign to fight. He wrote a will signing over his estates to trustees for his wife, Beatrice, Countess Arundel and the children for which he gained the King's consent.Calendar of Pipe Rolls, p.396; ; Noblesse oblige was one of Arundel's personal chivalric codes. When it was revealed the earl of March was inveigled into the Southampton Plot, Arundel and Lord Scrope provided the bulk of 10,000 marks fine imposed by Henry for this illegal marriage to Anne Stafford. Arundel's astute business dealings saved March and the King at the Michaelmas Council, which was in uproar. Bishop Richard Countenay of Norwich had died, the duke of Clarence was ill, but Arundel remained the King's \\"great friend\\". The Southampton plotters attempted to implicate Arundel, but as their testimony unravelled it became clear Sir Thomas Gray was speaking spiteful lies, and the young earl was held to be without blame.Pugh, pp.169-170; . Arundel was one of the initial commanders of Henry V's 1415 French campaign, he sailed with a minimum one hundred men-at-arms, and three hundred archers. Of his own retinue two men-at-arms and thirteen archers died at the siege of Harfleur. At least fourteen men-at-arms and sixty-eight archers were sick, and sent home on the Feast of St Wenceslas (29 Sept); Arundel was among them with five men-at-arms to help him.; ; . The Council advised the king against a proposed march to Calais; but Arundel had to return to Sussex on 10 October 1415. He was nursed by a faithful retainer's wife, Elizabeth Ryman. In his will made on 10 October, he asked to be buried in the church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel. He left 200 marks for a funeral, and required a statue be erected over his father's grave. He had pledged a vow to pray to St John of Bridlington when he was a servant of Prince Hal; and now at Mary Gate, Arundel, a chapel was to be built dedicated to the Virgin. Arundel wanted all the wages arrears to be paid by his heirs that were owed to soldiery.; ; . AncestrySuccession Fitzalan left no legitimate children. The castle and lordship of Arundel was inherited by his cousin John Fitzalan, 6th Earl of Arundel. The Earldom of Surrey fell into abeyance (or became extinct; authorities differ on this matter). The rest of his property was split amongst his three surviving sisters.

Premiered on 11 September 1998 at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival and distributed in over 30 countries, the film brought international recognition to Kore-eda's work. The film was also shown at the 1998 San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize \\"for its universal theme, its empathy for nostalgia and its homage to cinema as transcending life\\". The film received seven awards and eight nominations worldwide.  Plot  A small, mid-20th century social-service-style structure is a way station between life and death. Every Monday, a group of recently deceased people check-in: the social workers in the lodge ask them to go back over their life and choose one single memory to take into the afterlife. They are given just a couple of days to identify their happiest memory, after which the workers design, stage and film them. In this way, the souls will be able to re-experience this moment for eternity, forgetting the rest of their life. Twenty-two souls of different ages and backgrounds arrive and are received by the counsellors, who explain them their situation. Lengthy interviews take place in the lodge, with each person having different perspectives of their lives, some being more reluctant in indicating a significant memory. The story pays most attention to the two younger counsellors, Takashi and Shiori. Takashi has been assigned to help an old man, Ichiro Watanabe, pick a significant memory in his ordinary life. Reviewing the videotapes of Mr Watanabe's life, Takashi discovers that the old man had married his former fiancée, Kyoko, after Takashi had been killed during World War II while he was 22. Takashi has Watanabe assigned to another counsellor but is still troubled by his memories, causing both him and Shiori to re-examine their lives. Near the end of the week, Mr Watanabe decides which memory to keep. Takashi reveals to him that all the counsellors staying in the lodge are souls who refused or were unable to choose a memory. On Saturday, the hosted souls watch the films of their recreated memories in a screening room and, as soon as each person sees their own, they vanish. Takashi, after talking Shiori about his life and watching his fiancée's selected memory from the archive, eventually decides to have his sliver of life filmed and abandon the way station forever.  Cast  Themes and techniques  Kore-eda conceived the film from a childhood experience he had with his grandfather, who suffered from a neurodegenerative disease in a time this kind of syndromes were yet not well known. Remembering his gradual loss of memory, which led him not to recognize the faces of his relatives and eventually his own, he commented that \\"I comprehended little of what I saw, but I remember thinking that people forgot everything when they died. I now understand how critical memories are to our identity, to a sense of self\\". In the development phase of the script, the director interviewed more than five hundred people from disparate social backgrounds, asking them to tell him about their memories and choose the single one they would keep. Kore-eda was \\"intrigued by how often people chose upsetting experiences\\". The film alternates real footage of these interviews with acting, some based on improvisation, some on a specific script; the interviews were shot on 16 mm film stock by Yutaka Yamazaki, a recognized documentary cinematographer. With this method, Kore-eda combined documentary with a fictional narrative. In the film, memories themselves are altered by people when they recall them and are subjectively revised, enhanced and reinterpreted when they are staged and recreated. About this ambiguous, fleeting nature of nature memory, Kore-eda reflects: For the memory sequences, shot both in colour and black and white on a mixture of 8 mm and 16 mm film, Kore-eda involved the still photographer Masayoshi Sukita (best known at the time for his work on the set of Mystery Train).  Reception  After Life received positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.21/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"After Life is an offbeat and tender exploration of memory, love, and life after death\\". Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 91 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". On AllMovie, Keith Phipps talks about the film as \\"a peculiar and uniquely moving examination of life after death\\", observing how \\"almost incidentally [it] serves as a meditation on filmmaking\\". \\"Its unhurried pace and lack of melodrama, like its subject, may linger in the memory long afterwards\\", adds Jonathan Crow in the same review. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars, describing After Life as \\"a film that reaches out gently to the audience\\" and concluding that Kore-eda, with this and his previous film Maborosi, \\"has earned the right to be considered with Kurosawa, Bergman and other great humanists of the cinema\\".

A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor. A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale. Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol. Application Since ethanol boils at a much lower temperature than water, simple distillation can separate ethanol from water by applying heat to the mixture. Historically, a copper vessel was used for this purpose, since copper removes undesirable sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol. However, many modern stills are made of stainless steel pipes with copper linings to prevent erosion of the entire vessel and lower copper levels in the waste product (which in large distilleries is processed to become animal feed). Copper is the preferred material for stills because it yields an overall better tasting spirit. The taste is improved by the chemical reaction between the copper in the still and the sulfur compounds created by the yeast during fermentation. These unwanted and flavor changing sulfur compounds are chemically removed from the final product resulting in a smoother, better-tasting drink. All copper stills will require repairs about every eight years due to the precipitation of copper-sulfur compounds. The beverage industry was the first to implement a modern distillation apparatus and led the way in developing equipment standards which are now widely accepted in the chemical industry. Old Ukrainian vodka still Zambian artisanal Kachasu still and cooler There is also an increasing usage of the distillation of gin under glass and PTFE, and even at reduced pressures, to facilitate a fresher product. This is irrelevant to alcohol quality because the process starts with triple distilled grain alcohol, and the distillation is used solely to harvest botanical flavors such as limonene and other terpene like compounds. The ethyl alcohol is relatively unchanged. The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol. A pot still incorporates only one condensation, whereas other types of distillation equipment have multiple stages which result in higher purification of the more volatile component (alcohol). Pot still distillation gives an incomplete separation, but this can be desirable for the flavor of some distilled beverages. If a purer distillate is desired, a reflux still is the most common solution. Reflux stills incorporate a fractionating column, commonly created by filling copper vessels with glass beads to maximize available surface area. As alcohol boils, condenses, and reboils through the column, the effective number of distillations greatly increases. Vodka and gin and other neutral grain spirits are distilled by this method, then diluted to concentrations appropriate for human consumption. Alcoholic products from home distilleries are common throughout the world but are sometimes in violation of local statutes. The product of illegal stills in the United States is commonly referred to as moonshine and in Ireland, poitín. However, poitín, although made illegal in 1661 has been legal for export in Ireland since 1997. Note that the term moonshine itself is often misused as many believe it to be a specific kind of high-proof alcohol that was distilled from corn, but the term can refer to any illicitly distilled alcohol.

Constructed during World War II as part of the War Emergency Programme, Queenborough was laid down in 1940 and launched in 1942, serving in the Arctic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theatres. After the war ended, the ship was transferred on loan to the RAN in exchange for an N-class destroyer, then given to Australia as a gift in 1950. Queenborough was converted to an anti-submarine frigate, and served with the RAN until 1966. During this time, she was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve on multiple occasions, participated in numerous fleet exercises, and took on a partial training role. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve, but reactivated in 1969 as a training ship. Queenborough remained in service for another three years, until a series of mechanical and structural faults required that she be retired, decommissioning in 1972 and being scrapped in Hong Kong in 1975. Design and construction The sixth RN ship to be named after the town of Queenborough in Kent, England, Queenborough was laid down by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne on 6 November 1940.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 157Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 92 She was launched on 16 January 1942, commissioned into the RN on 15 September, and completed on 10 December. She cost £725,000 to complete.Gillett, Warships of Australia, p. 163 HMS Queenborough, shortly after her 1942 commissioning The main armament for Queenborough consisted of four single 4.7-inch QF Mark IX guns, two before and two aft of the main superstructure. Secondary weapons included a quadruple-mounting QF 2-pounder Mark VIII pom-pom located just aft of the funnel, and six single Oerlikon 20 mm cannons provided anti-air capability, while eight Mark VIII torpedo tubes (4 forward, 4 aft) firing Mark IX torpedoes for anti-ship engagements. RN service HMS Queenborough served in the Arctic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean during World War II. She was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, which was made up of Q-class destroyers.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, p. 347 Arctic convoys Following commissioning, Queenborough was assigned to the British Home Fleet and spent the end of 1942 and the early part of 1943 as an Arctic convoy escort. On 31 December 1942, Queenborough was one of ten ships taken by Home Fleet commander Admiral Tovey to reinforce the ships covering Arctic convoy JW 51B, following the Battle of the Barents Sea.Pope, 73 North, p. 263 She was briefly deployed to the waters off South Africa before the 4th Destroyer Flotilla was assigned to Force H and the Mediterranean theatre in mid-1943. Italian landings Queenborough was involved in numerous Allied landings of the Italian Campaign. She was part of the British covering force for the Allied invasion of Sicily on 10 July.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, pp. 338–39 The destroyer was involved in the leadup to the British landings at Calabria from 31 August to 3 September, including preparatory shelling of the landing site on 31 August and 2 September. A week later, she supported the United States troop landings at Salerno, remaining on station until 16 September.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, pp. 350–51 British Eastern Fleet The 4th Destroyer Flotilla was ordered to depart the Mediterranean theatre and sail for the Indian Ocean in March 1944, to join the British Eastern Fleet. Near the end of March, Queenborough commenced involvement in Operation Diplomat.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945, p. 391 Leaving Trincomalee, on 21 March, the 18-ship fleet practiced refuelling south of Ceylon. On 27 March, the fleet met United States reinforcements— and three escorts—with the combined force arriving back in Trincomalee on 31 March. From 16 to 24 April, Queenborough was assigned to Task Force 70 of Operation Cockpit as one of the ships escorting aircraft carriers and USS Saratoga.Waters, The Royal New Zealand Navy, pp. 358–59 On her return to Trincomalee, the destroyer joined Task Force 66 for Operation Transom, a carrier-based air raid on Surabaya.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, pp. 411–12 The task force replenished from tankers at Exmouth Bay on 15 May, before attacking on 17 May. Queenborough returned to Trincomalee on 27 May. Queenborough departed Trincomalee on 15 October as part of Task Force 63, a British Eastern Fleet operation to focus Japanese attention on the west coast of Malaya as a diversion for American amphibious landings in the Philippines.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, p. 460 The diversionary attacks, known as Operation Millet, included a series of bombardments and air raids against Japanese installations and ships in Malacca and Car Nicobar, and were intended to appear as if the Allies were preparing an invasion of Malaya. Queenborough was attached to Group 1, consisting of the battleship and her escorts, and bombarded Car Nicobar on 17 and 18 October.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945, p. 505 Despite heavy damage to the target areas, Operation Millet failed to attract a significant reaction from the Japanese, as available resources were already en route to defend Leyte from invasion. British Pacific Fleet At the end of 1944, the heavily-reinforced British Eastern Fleet was split into two forces, The smaller East Indies Fleet remained in the Indian Ocean, while the larger British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was redeployed to the Pacific Ocean, to increase the British and Commonwealth presence in the war against Japan. Queenborough and the 4th Destroyer Flotilla were assigned to the latter at the end of November 1944. As part of this deployment, ship numbers and designations were changed from the British pennant system to the American hull number system to facilitate operation with the United States Navy; Queenboroughs pennant was changed from G70 to D19. From 23 March to 29 May 1945, Queenborough was part of the escort screen protecting British carriers as their aircraft attacked Japanese airfields in the Ryukyu Islands.Rohwer & Hümmelchen, Chronology of the war at sea, 1939–1945, pgs. 501-02, 516 The destroyer received five battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Arctic 1942–43\\", \\"Sicily 1943\\", \\"Salerno 1943\\", \\"Mediterranean 1943\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\".Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 93 Transfer to RAN Following the conclusion of World War II, Queenborough was one of three RN Q-class destroyers transferred to the RAN on loan. Another two had been loaned to the RAN since commissioning. This arrangement allowed the four N-class destroyers loaned to the RAN during the war to be returned.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 28 Queenborough was the last ship to commission into the RAN, in September 1945, in trade for . Frigate conversion In early 1950, the decision was made to convert all five Q-class destroyers in RAN service to anti-submarine warfare frigates, similar to the Type 15 frigate conversions performed on several War Emergency Programme destroyers of the RN.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 168 A proposal was made by the Australian government to pay for the upgrade to the five on-loan vessels, at the predicted cost of AU₤400,000 each. Instead, the British Admiralty presented the ships to the RAN on 1 June as gifts.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 316 The conversions were part of an overall plan to improve the anti-submarine warfare capability of the RAN, although Queenborough and the other ships were only a 'stopgap' measure until purpose-built ASW frigates could be constructed. Queenborough was the second ship to be converted, and was rebuilt as a frigate at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney. The modernisation began in May 1950, and despite predictions that work would finish within 18 months, Queenborough was not recommissioned until 7 December 1954.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 67 The conversion started with the removal of the ship's entire armament. The entire superstructure was cut off, and replaced with a larger, aluminium construction.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 33 The quality of accommodation was improved. Fuel stowage was reduced, in turn cutting the ship's range from at to at . The bridge was enclosed, and a dedicated operations room was installed, in order to coordinate the great quantity and type of data collected by the ship's sensors. Queenborough was fitted with new guns: a twin 4 inch high angle/low angle gun aft of the superstructure, and a twin 40 mm Bofors gun forward of the bridge. The reduction in gun armament was justified by the inclusion of a Limbo anti- submarine mortar.Stevens (ed.) The Royal Australian Navy, p 168 The conversion resulted in a 315-ton increase in standard displacement.Comparison of statistics in Gillett, Warships of Australia, pgs 163, 182 The ship's draught increased from to . The converted ships were formed as the 1st Australian Frigate Squadron. Post-conversion service=As frigate On 24 February 1955, Queenborough departed Sydney for England, to participate in anti- submarine warfare training with the Royal Navy. After repairs to damage sustained during the journey, Queenborough was assigned to the RN Training Squadron, attached to the Joint Anti-Submarine School in Derry, Northern Ireland. The ship was attached to the 6th Frigate Squadron during this period. In addition to the squadron's badge depicting the Red Hand of Ulster, Queenborough added a red kangaroo design to her funnel to depict the ship's Australian allegiance; one of the earliest instances of using a red kangaroo to identify an Australian warship. Queenborough was first deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve in early 1956. After returning to Darwin on 10 April, the ship was made lead vessel of the 1st Frigate Squadron. Queenborough and sister ship were sent to the Strategic Reserve at the end of January 1959. During the four-month assignment, the ships were assigned to the royal escort of for the visit of Prince Philip to Singapore, and participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Demon. The frigate returned to Sydney on 16 May 1959. In October 1962 Queenborough together with rescued 25 survivors from the Panamanian merchant steamer Kawi, which sank after being caught in a storm in the South China Sea. In December 1962, again with HMAS Quiberon, Queenborough rescued the crew of SS Tuscany, which had run aground on a reef in the South China Sea. On 8 May 1963 Queenborough collided with British submarine off Jervis Bay during anti-submarine training exercises.Lind, Royal Australian Navy – Historic Naval Events Year by Year, p 241 Tabards fin and conning tower were damaged, and minor damage was inflicted to the underside of Queenborough, but both vessels were able to return to Sydney unaided.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 222 In September, Queenborough and sister ship Quiberon were deployed to the FESR. On 26 October, the two ships were involved in the rescue of survivors from MV Kawi,Lind, Royal Australian Navy – Historic Naval Events Year by Year, p. 243 The ships visited Calcutta in December, before returning to Hong Kong for Christmas. In January 1963 Queenborough was replaced as the lead vessel of the 1st Frigate Squadron by . From 31 January to 4 February, Queenborough and Quiberon were in Saigon for a diplomatic visit; they were the last RAN ships to visit Vietnam before Australia's military became involved in the Vietnam War.Grey, Up Top, pp. 74–5 Following the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Australia in March and April 1963, Queenborough was stationed between Australia and New Caledonia as a precautionary air-sea rescue ship for the first leg of the Queen's departure flight. Queenborough was decommissioned into reserve on 10 July 1963.Gillett, Warships of Australia, p. 183 As training ship After spending three years in reserve, a need for expanded training capabilities saw Queenborough recommissioned on 28 July 1966 as a dedicated anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training ship. While being prepared for her new duties, the 4-inch guns and gunnery radar were removed (although the turret would remain until early 1968).Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, pp. 162–3 An improved Type 978 radar was installed. In October 1966, Queenborough was deployed to Tasmania on a training cruise.Forbes, RAN Activities in the Southern Ocean An Australian researcher on Macquarie Island required a medical evacuation: as the closest Australian vessel, Queenborough changed course for the island. The ship encountered seas, winds, hail, and snow en route, and arrived in time to collect the scientist before worse weather set in.\\"The Real Heroine\\", in Navy News At the start of 1969, the RAN's ship designation and numbering system was changed from the British system to the US system.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 317 Queenborough was reclassified as a destroyer escort, and received the number 57 (without any prefix letter). The similarity of the new number to the \\"57 Varieties\\" advertising slogan of the H. J. Heinz Company, led to a relationship between the ship and the Australian branch of the company.Editor, Mystery ship, p. 6 On 22 July 1969, Queenborough completed her 400,000th nautical mile of sailing since launching. On 16 April 1970, Queenborough was part of a 45-ship, 13-nation fleet assembled in Sydney Harbour as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations.Lind, Royal Australian Navy – Historic Naval Events Year by Year, pp 274–75 In June 1971, Queenborough left Sydney to visit Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand. Heavy weather between Fiji and New Zealand created cracks in the bow. These were detected in New Zealand waters, with Queenborough docking in Auckland until 5 July for repairs. Decommissioning and fate Queenborough was decommissioned on 7 April 1972. Tenders for purchase of the ship closed in February 1975, and on 8 April 1975 Queenborough was sold to Willtop (Asia) Ltd. The ship was towed to Hong Kong, arriving on 20 June, to be broken up for scrap. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, Queenborough was retroactively awarded the honour \\"Malaya 1957\\" for her service during the Malayn Emergency.

A pinnacle is an architectural ornament originally forming the cap or crown of a buttress or small turret, but afterwards used on parapets at the corners of towers and in many other situations. The pinnacle looks like a small spire. It was mainly used in Gothic architecture. The pinnacle had two purposes: # Ornamental – adding to the loftiness and verticity of the structure. They sometimes ended with statues, such as in Milan Cathedral. # Structural – the pinnacles were very heavy and often rectified with lead, in order to enable the flying buttresses to contain the stress of the structure vaults and roof. This was done by adding compressive stress (a result of the pinnacle weight) to the thrust vector and thus shifting it downwards rather than sideways.  History  The accounts of Jesus' temptations in Matthew's and Luke's gospels both suggest that the Second Temple in Jerusalem had one or more pinnacles ():On the uncertainty of the meaning of this Greek phrase, see Joachim Jeremias, “Die ,Zinne‘ des Tempels (Mt. 4,5; Lk. 4,9),” Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palästina 59.3/4 (1936): 195-208 (for an English translation of this article, click here). :Then he (Satan) brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here. Some have stated that there were no pinnacles in the Romanesque style, but conical caps to circular buttresses, with finial terminations, are not uncommon in France at very early periods. Eugène Viollet-le-Duc gives examples from Saint-Germer-de-Fly Abbey and the Basilica of Saint-Remi, and there is one of similar form at the west front of Rochester Cathedral. In the 12th-century Romanesque two examples have been cited, one from Bredon in Worcestershire, and the other from Cleeve in Gloucestershire. In these the buttresses run up, forming a sort of square turret, and crowned with a pyramidal cap, very much like those of the next period, the Early English. Pinnacles on the top of walls and the corner of flying buttresses In this and the following styles, mainly in Gothic architecture, the pinnacle seems generally to have had its appropriate uses. It was a weight to counteract the thrust of the vaults, particularly where there were flying buttresses; it stopped the tendency to slip of the stone copings of the gables, and counterpoised the thrust of spires; it formed a pier to steady the elegant perforated parapets of later periods; and in France especially served to counterbalance the weight of overhanging corbel tables, huge gargoyles, etc. In the Early English period the small buttresses frequently finished with gablets, and the more important with pinnacles supported with clustered shafts. At this period the pinnacles were often supported on these shafts alone, and were open below; and in larger work in this and the subsequent periods they frequently form niches and contain statues. About the Transition and during the Decorated Gothic period, the different faces above the angle shafts often finish with gablets. Those of the last-named period are much richer, and are generally decorated with crockets and finials, and sometimes with ball flowers. Very fine groups are found at Beverley Minster and at the rise of the spire of St Mary's, Oxford. Perpendicular pinnacles differ but little from Decorated, except that the crockets and finials are of later character. They are also often set angle-ways, particularly on parapets, and the shafts are panelled. In France pinnacles, like spires, seem to have been in use earlier than in England. There are small pinnacles at the angles of the tower in the Saintes Cathedral. At Roullet-Saint-Estèphe there are pinnacles in a similar position, each composed of four small shafts, with caps and bases surmounted with small pyramidal spires. In all these examples the towers have semicircular-headed windows. File:Notre-Dame de Paris composite transverse section.svgThe early-Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris. Arrows show forces (black:forces of cathedral on the ground, green: forces of ground on cathedral). The weight of pinnacles helps keep the line of thrust inside the buttress.

(2006), p. 191.정몽주 鄭夢周 (in Korean) Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture Biography Jeong Mong-ju was born in Yeongcheon, Gyeongsang province to a family from the Yeonil Jeong clan. At the age of 23, he took three different civil service literary examinations (Gwageo) and received the highest marks possible on each of them. In 1367, he became an instructor in Neo-Confucianism at the Gukjagam, then called Songgyungwan, whilst simultaneously holding a government position, and was a faithful public servant to King U. The king had great confidence in his wide knowledge and good judgment, and so he participated in various national projects and his scholarly works earned him great respect in the Goryeo court. In 1372, Jeong Mong-ju visited Ming Dynasty, as a diplomatic envoy. Around the time, as Waegu (왜구/ 倭寇) (Japanese pirate)'s invasions to the Korean Peninsula were extreme, Jeong Mong-ju was dispatched as a delegate to Kyūshū in Japan, in 1377.Titsingh, (1834). p. 313. His negotiations led to promises of Japanese aid in defeating the pirates. He traveled to the Ming Dynasty's capital city in 1384Kang, p. 159. and the negotiations with the Chinese led to peace with the Ming Dynasty in 1385. He also founded an institute devoted to the theories of Confucianism. Following a banquet held for him, Jeong Mong-ju was assassinated in 1392 by five men on the Sonjuk Bridge in Gaeseong. Politically motivated, the murder was ordered by Yi Bang- won (later Taejong of Joseon), the fifth son of Yi Seong-gye, who overthrew the Goryeo Dynasty in order to establish the Joseon Dynasty. Jeong Mong-ju was murdered because he refused to betray his loyalty to the Goryeo Dynasty. Yi Bang-won recited a poem (Hayeoga, 하여가 / 何如歌) to dissuade Jeong Mong-ju from remaining loyal to the Goryeo court, but Jeong Mong-ju answered with another poem (Dansimga, 단심가 / 丹心歌) that affirmed his loyalty. Yi Seong-gye is said to have lamented Jeong Mong-ju's death and rebuked his son because Jeong Mong-ju was a highly regarded politician by the common people. The bridge where Jeong Mong-ju was murdered, nowadays in North Korea, has now become a national monument of that country. A brown spot on one of the stones is said to be Jeong Mong-ju's bloodstain and is said to become red whenever it rains. Currently, his direct surviving descendants are his 28th and 29th generation, all of whom reside in South Korea, the United States, Canada, Portugal, Germany and the United Kingdom. The 474-year-old Goryeo Dynasty symbolically ended with Jeong Mong-ju's death and was followed by the Joseon Dynasty for 505 years (1392-1897). Jeong Mong-ju's noble death symbolizes his faithful allegiance to the king, and he was later venerated even by Joseon monarchs. In 1517, 125 years after his death, he was canonized into Sungkyunkwan (the National Academy) alongside other Korean sages such as Yi Hwang (Toegye, 1501-1570) and Yi I (Yulgok, 1536-1584). The 11th pattern of ITF Taekwondo is named after Poeun. The pattern is performed as part of the testing syllabus for the level of 2nd-degree black belt. The diagram ( - ) represents Jeong Mong-ju's unerring loyalty to his king and his country towards the end of the Goryeo Dynasty.

It offers professional, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees affiliated with training clergy and deaconesses for the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. History In 1844, Frederick C. D. Wyneken, pastor of the Lutheran church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, began pastoral training of two young men. Wyneken took a call in 1845 to a congregation in Baltimore, Maryland, and was replaced by Wilhelm Sihler, who continued the training. Wyneken had earlier written to Wilhelm Loehe in Germany, requesting help in providing pastors for German Lutheran immigrants to the United States, and in August 1846 eleven theological students and their instructor arrived in Fort Wayne, having been sent by Loehe. The seminary was formally organized at that time, with Sihler becoming the first president. Classes were held in the parsonage, and a four-room house was rented for use as a dormitory. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod was organized in 1847, and in response to the new synod's request, Loehe transferred ownership of the seminary to the synod. He continued to support the seminary by sending money, books, and students from Germany. Two years later the seminary purchased about east of Fort Wayne and erected the first building on its new campus. Within the synod the seminary was referred to as the \\"practical seminary\\" because its purpose was to quickly provide pastors for congregations. It provided both pre-seminary and seminary instruction. The pre-seminary course of work was similar to that of a high school, and the seminary classes provided enough theological training to enable the graduates to serve the congregations. However, the seminary did not require knowledge of the Biblical languages (Greek and Hebrew). To protect its students from the draft during the American Civil War, the seminary moved, in 1861, to the campus of the synod's academic seminary, Concordia Seminary, in St. Louis, Missouri. C. F. W. Walther, who was already the president of the St. Louis seminary, became president of the practical seminary as well. However, there was friction between the two institutions, both faculty and students, in part due to the differences in academic rigor and purposes. In addition, the growth in enrollment in both seminaries led to overcrowding of the campus. In 1874 the 29 pre-seminary students of the practical seminary, along with one instructor, were moved to the campus of the former Illinois State University in Springfield, Illinois. The next year, 1875, the practical seminary itself moved to the Springfield campus, with president F. A. Craemer and the pre-seminary instructor serving as the faculty. A third faculty member joined the staff in 1876. At that time there were no particular entrance requirements. It was not until 1918 that completion of eighth grade was required of prospective students, the same year that an additional year of instruction was added to the pre-seminary course of study. The additional courses made it possible for pastors to obtain teaching certificates in states where pastors were not automatically eligible to teach in parochial schools. However, even in the 1920s the pastors graduating from the seminary generally had, except for the pastoral training, only the equivalent of a high school education. In view of the relatively low level of academic training provided by the seminary, resolutions to close the seminary were introduced in the 1932 and 1935 synodical conventions; the one in 1935 initially passed by a 266 to 265 vote, but was then reconsidered and defeated, 283 to 256. Nevertheless, the seminary began making changes: Greek was made a required course; new students had to have had at least two years of high school, and accreditation by the state of Illinois was sought. Starting in 1941, all entering students had to be high school graduates, allowing the seminary to discontinue all high school classes. Academic requirements were further strengthened in subsequent years. Entrance requirements were again raised, first to completion of two years of college, and again to prefer college graduates. Expectations for the faculty were also increased with the aim that all professors would have doctoral degrees. The American Association of Theological Schools accepted the seminary as a member in the fall of 1968. The Bachelor of Divinity degree which the seminary had awarded its graduates become fully accredited, and was replaced by the Master of Divinity degree in 1973. The seminary remained in Springfield until the synod reorganized its system of pastoral training and merged the program of Concordia Senior College of Fort Wayne with Concordia College in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1976, the seminary returned to Fort Wayne, where it inherited the Senior College's award-winning campus, designed by Eero Saarinen.

The first parcel of land was purchased for $40,200 in 1916, when Indiana's state park system was established during the state's centennial anniversary of its statehood. Note: This includes and Accompanying maps and photographs. The origin of the name \\"Turkey Run\\" is unknown, but the most accepted theory is that wild turkeys would congregate for warmth in the gorges (or \\"runs\\"), where early settlers could easily trap and hunt them. The Lusk Home and Mill Site and the Richard Lieber Log Cabin within the park's grounds were included as individual sites on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and 2001, respectively. The park itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Turkey Run also includes a system of trails, Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve, a suspension bridge across Sugar Creek, camping sites and other recreational areas. The Turkey Run Inn was built in 1919. Several guest cabins near the inn date from the 1930s and 1940s. History Map of the local area Early settlement Although the area in northern Parke County, Indiana, was once called Bloomingdale Glens, it is better known as Turkey Run. The origins of the nickname is uncertain, but it is believed to be due to the large number of wild turkeys in the area that took refuge for warmth in the gorges (or \\"runs\\"), which made it easy for early settlers to trap and hunt them. The first white occupants of this wooded area was the Captain Salmon Lusk family. Salmon Lusk was a native of Vermont who served under William Henry Harrison at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Captain Lusk received a tract of land at Turkey Run for his military service. His son, John, later inherited the property. Over the years, John Lusk received offers from lumber companies to sell the forested land, but he was a nature-lover and refused their offers. In 1882, however, he allowed the Indianapolis, Decatur, and Springfield Railroad to establish a summer resort on the property. The resort remained in operation until John Lusk's death in 1915.Hoy, pp. 253–54. Preservation In April 1915, after learning that the forested area at Turkey Run would be sold at public auction in May, Parke County resident Juliet V. Strauss, who was a newspaper and magazine columnist for the Rockville Tribune, the Indianapolis News, and the Ladies' Home Journal, reportedly wrote a letter to Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston urging him to save from timber harvesting. Strauss's letter to Governor Ralston is believed to have prompted his decision to establish a Turkey Run Commission, which was assigned the task of preserving the forest. On April 27, 1915, the governor appointed Strauss to serve as a member of the commission along with William W. Woollen of Indianapolis and Vida Newsom of Columbus, Indiana. Richard Lieber, who was appointed chairman of the State Parks Memorial Committee of the Indiana Historical Commission, also became interested in preserving Turkey Run as part of a new state park system.\\"Narrative Statement of Significance,\\" section 7, page 3, and section 8, page 6, in In November 1915, Lieber met with Governor Ralston to discuss the idea of creating a state parks system as a permanent memorial to Indiana's centennial anniversary of statehood. Governor Ralston agreed to the proposal and appointed Lieber to the Turkey Run Commission in January 1916. (The Turkey Run Commission later merged with the Indiana Historical Commission's State Parks Memorial Committee.) The state parks committee agreed to take on the task of establishing a state parks system in 1916 as part of Indiana's centennial celebrations and hoped to raise funds from private donations to purchase three tracts of land. With the support of state government officials and the Indiana Historical Commission, state parks supporters launched a public campaign to increase awareness and persuade members of the public to donate funds to purchase the land at Turkey Run. (The state legislature had not appropriated funds for land acquisition.) The Indiana Historical Commission and the state parks committee set a target goal of obtaining $25,000 from private citizens and Governor Ralston designated the week of April 24, 1916, to collect the donated funds. The effort acquired about $20,000 in private donations for the purchase of the Turkey Run land.Hoy, pp. 255 and 266. State park Despite its efforts, state park advocates failed in their initial attempt to secure the Turkey Run property for the new state park system. When the public auction took place on May 18, 1916, the Hoosier Veneer Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, made the successful bid to acquire the land for $30,200, surpassing the Indiana Historical Commission's final bid of $30,100. Undeterred, Richard Lieber began negotiations with the lumber company and reached an agreement to purchase the land for $40,200 on November 11, 1916. Money to buy the land from the lumber company largely came from private donations that included a $5,065 contribution from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Association. Auto racing enthusiast Arthur C. Newby gave another $5,000 to assist with the purchase. While negotiations with the Hoosier Veneer Company were underway, Lieber and the state parks committee bought McCormick's Creek Canyon in Owen County, Indiana, at auction on May 25, 1906. McCormick's Creek State Park became Indiana's first state park. When the state finally acquired Turkey Run in November 1916, the Parke County property became Indiana's second state park.Hoy, p. 258, and Silver, p. 53.

Both parks are located along Sugar Creek, and both feature a gorge system formed by the drainage of the creek as it cuts down through sandstone bedrock. Mansfield sandstone is the specific type seen at Turkey Run, named after Mansfield, Indiana. Travel between the two parks crosses a flat glacial till plain and enters the gorge system. The Punchbowl on Turkey Run's Trail 3 is an example of a pothole that was scoured out by glacial erratics caught in swirling backwash. Trails Ladders of Trail 3 A system of trails offers hikers plenty of outing opportunities during the summer months when the drainage is relatively free of water. A suspension footbridge across Sugar Creek, the main drainage for Turkey Run and Shades state parks, provides pedestrian access to trails on the far side. Turkey Run's Trail 3 is particularly noted for its ruggedness, including ladders and narrow but deep gorges. Floating down Sugar Creek through the park in either inner tubes, canoes, or kayaks is very popular in the summer months. There are , , and trips down Sugar Creek. In the spring, when heavy rains and snow melt flood the narrow gorges, more adventurous hikers go \\"creek stomping\\" through the narrow gorges; however, the fast-moving current, steep gorge walls, and unpredictable contours of the creek beds make this activity dangerous if the water level is high. Park geology Sandstone gorges are a common sight at Turkey Run The major features of the park are formed from erosion in Mansfield sandstone from the Mansfield formation. This formation was deposited during the Carboniferous period at the mouth of the ancient riverbed, where sediments collected and compacted. This swampy environment formed coal deposits that were mined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A collapsed entrance to a coal mine is still a major feature of the park. During the Pleistocene Epoch, glacial meltwaters and their associated erosion carved the Mansfield sandstone bedrock into its distinct, present-day formations. Turkey Run's terrain also includes many common features of glaciation such as glacial erratics, till, and scoured canyons caused by erosion from melting glacial waters. Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve Rocky Hollow Nature Preserve Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve is a series of canyons cut into the sandstone. Rocky Hollow is the longest canyon and Falls Canyon has the only existing waterfall (seasonal) in the park. There are six designated trails through the preserve, each with its own unique micro-climate. Depending on the season, these trails may be impassable, muddy, or refreshing on a hot afternoon.Turkey Run State Park map, Indiana Department of Natural Resources The park's suspension footbridge, originally built in 1917–18 across Sugar Creek, leads to the Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve. Rocky Hollow begins at above sea level on the northeast border of the park (County Road 280E) and drops to at Sugar Creek just above the suspension bridge. Bear Hollow and Falls Canyon drop a similar distance but in one-half or one-third of the length, respectively. The nature preserve was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. Lusk Home and Mill Site The Lusk Home The Lusk Home and Mill Site is one of the individual sites within the park that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The initial area that became Turkey Run State Park developed around the Lusk home, which was built in 1841 by Salmon Lusk. He also built a mill on the site in 1826. The Lusk home and mill site were added to the National Register on October 29, 1974.\\"Site Assessment\\" in \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory–Nomination Form: Lusk Home and Mill Site.\\" See: Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Lieber Log Cabin The Richard Lieber Log Cabin is another of the individual sites at Turkey Run that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1848 from native tulip trees, the oldest of its kind in Indiana. Lieber Cabin was added to the National register on May 4, 2001.\\"No. 13, Sunset Point Cabin\\" in supporting document for the National Register of Historic Places nomination of the Richard Lieber Log Cabin. See Note: This includes The cabin is named in honor of Colonel Richard Lieber, the first director of Indiana's state parks system and the conservationist who advocated for its creation as a permanent memorial to Indiana'scentennial anniversary of statehood. Lieber discovered the cabin during a thunderstorm in 1918 and convinced the owner to have it moved so it could serve as the administration building for the state park. All but the chimney was salvageable. Fortunately, an elderly man familiar with the chimney's \\"cat and clay\\" style gave directions for making a new one using stone from an old bridge. The supports were originally of butternut, but are now of sassafras. The present-day cabin houses a museum honoring Lieber and the Indiana state park system. Lieber died at McCormicks Creek State Park in 1944 and his ashes were buried at the base of the Colonel Richard Lieber Memorial at Turkey Run.\\"Narrative Description,\\" section 7, page 14, in \\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Turkey Run State Park.\\" Other features Campsites at Turkey Run were first developed in 1964. The state park also includes Turkey Run Inn and cabins for overnight guests. The two-story inn was designed by Bishop, Knowlton and Carson architects and constructed circa 1919. Additions were completed in 1930, 1940, and circa 1970. The Civilian Conservation Corps built five double cabins near the inn in 1941; two family cabins were built near a maintenance shed on the property and date from the 1930s. The CCC also built a Nature Center at Turkey Run in 1942. The center originally served as a commissary. Its exterior was remodeled in 1986.\\"Narrative Description,\\" section 7, pages 8, 12–13 and 16, in \\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Turkey Run State Park.\\" Gallery Image:Cox_Ford_Bridge,_IN_2.jpgCox Ford Covered Bridge at Turkey Run Image:Turkey Run.jpgRock Formations along Turkey Run Image:Turkey Run Gorge.JPGRocky Hollow, a gorge at Turkey Run See also * Arch in the Town of Marshall * Beeson Covered Bridge * Parke County Covered Bridges * National Register of Historic Places listings in Parke County, Indiana * Parke County Covered Bridge Festival ReferencesExternal links *\\"Turkey Run State Park\\", official website, Indiana Department of Natural Resources *\\"Historic Turkey Run State Park\\", The Technological Edge, Inc. *\\"Turkey Run Online\\" Category:Protected areas established in 1916 Category:Houses in Parke County, Indiana Category:State parks of Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Parke County, Indiana Category:Canyons and gorges of Indiana Category:Museums in Parke County, Indiana Category:Biographical museums in Indiana Category:Protected areas of Parke County, Indiana Category:1916 establishments in Indiana Category:Nature centers in Indiana Category:Waterfalls of Indiana Category:Landforms of Parke County, Indiana Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Log buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:National Natural Landmarks in Indiana ","title":"Turkey Run State Park"},{"id":"430411","text":"Interior elevation of a Gothic cathedral, with clerestory highlighted. St. Nicolai, Stralsund - the clerestory is the level between the two green roofs, reinforced here by flying buttresses In architecture, a clerestory ( ; lit. clear storey, also clearstory, clearstorey, or overstorey) is a high section of wall that contains windows above eye level. The purpose is to admit light, fresh air, or both. Historically, clerestory denoted an upper level of a Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church, the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower aisles and are pierced with windows. Similar structures have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting, ventilation, or headroom. History basilica-shaped cathedral of Monreale, Italy are covered with mosaic Ancient world The technology of the clerestory appears to originate in the temples of ancient Egypt. The term \\"clerestory\\" is applicable to Egyptian temples, where the lighting of the hall of columns was obtained over the stone roofs of the adjoining aisles, through slits pierced in vertical slabs of stone. Clerestory appeared in Egypt at least as early as the Amarna period.Gwendolyn Leick and Francis J. Kirk, A Dictionary of Ancient Near Eastern Architecture, 1988, Routledge, 261 pages In the Minoan palaces of Crete such as Knossos, by contrast, lightwells were employed in addition to clerestories.C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (2007) According to Biblical accounts, the Hebrew temple built by King Solomon featured clerestory windows made possible by the use of a tall, angled roof and a central ridgepole. The clerestory was used in the Hellenistic architecture of the later periods of ancient Greek civilization. The Romans applied clerestories to basilicas of justice and to the basilica-like bath-houses and palaces. Early Christian and Byzantine basilicas Early Christian churches and some Byzantine churches, particularly in Italy, are based closely on the Roman basilica, and maintained the form of a central nave flanked by lower aisles on each side. The nave and aisles are separated by columns or piers, above which rises a wall pierced by clerestory windows. Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire, England. The nave wall is divided into three stages: the upper stage with windows is the clerestory, beneath it is the triforium, and the lowest stage is the arcade. Romanesque period During the Romanesque period, many churches of the basilica form were constructed all over Europe. Many of these churches have wooden roofs with clerestories below them. Some Romanesque churches have barrel vaulted ceilings with no clerestory. The development of the groin vault and ribbed vault made possible the insertion of clerestory windows. Initially the nave of a large aisled and clerestoried church was of two levels, arcade and clerestory. During the Romanesque period a third level was inserted between them, a gallery called the \\"triforium\\". The triforium generally opens into space beneath the sloping roof of the aisle. This became a standard feature of later Romanesque and Gothic large abbey and cathedral churches. Sometimes another gallery set into the wall space above the triforium and below the clerestory. This feature is found in some late Romanesque and early Gothic buildings in France. The oldest glass clerestory windows still in place are from the late eleventh century, found in the Augsburg Cathedral Gothic period The clerestory of Amiens Cathedral In smaller churches, clerestory windows may be trefoils or quatrefoils. In some Italian churches they are ocular. In most large churches, they are an important feature, both for beauty and for utility. The ribbed vaulting and flying buttresses of Gothic architecture concentrated the weight and thrust of the roof, freeing wall- space for larger clerestory fenestration. Generally, in Gothic masterpieces the clerestory is divided into bays by the vaulting shafts that continue the same tall columns that form the arcade separating the aisles from the nave. The tendency from the early Romanesque period to the late Gothic period was for the clerestory level to become progressively taller and the size of the windows to get proportionally larger in relation to wall surface, emerging in works such as the Gothic architecture of Amiens Cathedral or Westminster Abbey where their clerestories account for nearly a third of the height of the interior.  Modern clerestory windows for energy-efficient buildings  Modern clerestories often are defined as vertical windows, located on high walls, extending up from the roofline, designed to allow light and breezes into a space, without compromising privacy. Factory buildings often are built with clerestory windows; modern housing designs sometimes include them as well. Modern clerestory windows may have another especially important role, besides daylighting and ventilation: they can be part of passive solar strategies, in very energy efficient buildings (Passive House Buildings, Zero Energy Buildings).\\"Siting with the Sun: Passive Heating and Daylighting\\". GreenBuildingAdvisor.com To that end, clerestories are used in conjunction with stone, brick, concrete, and other high-mass walls and floors, properly positioned to store solar heat gains during the hotter parts of the day – allowing the walls and the floor to act as a heat bank during the cooler parts of the day.\\"Clerestory Windows: Advantages and Downsides\\". House-energy.com. Clerestories – in passive solar strategies – should be properly located (typically in the sunny side of the building) and protected from the summer’s sun by rooflines, overhangs, recessed thick walls, or other architectural elements, in order to prevent overheating during the cooling season. Transportation Barney and Smith Car Company clerestory cars on display at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum in North Freedom, Wisconsin Clerestory roofs were used on railway carriages (known as \\"clerestory carriages\\") from the mid- nineteenth century to the 1930s. The first Pullman coaches in England had clerestory roofs, and were imported and assembled at Derby, where Pullman set up an assembly plant in conjunction with the Midland Railway, a predecessor of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The first coach, a sleeping car named \\"Midland\\", was assembled and ready for trial-running in January 1874. The last clerestory-roofed trains on the London Underground were the 'Q' stock, which were withdrawn from operation in 1971. Clerestories were also used in early double-decker buses, giving better ventilation and headroom in the centre corridor, as well as better illumination. The Volkswagen Type 2 Kombi, or Transport, commonly called the Microbus, came in a deluxe version with clerestory windows. VW made the Samba from 1961-67 in several versions, which had as many as 23 windows, and it is highly prized by collectors. The clerestory is known as \\"Mollycroft Roof\\", as well, especially in Romany and other caravans.

Early years Choe Yeong was born into the prestigious Cheolwon (more recently known as Dongju) Choe noble clan as the fifth descendant of Choe Yu- cheong, the Grand Scholar of Jiphyeonjeon, the Royal Academy, and the son of Choe Won-jik. He was raised in a strict austere lifestyle, befitting a noble aristocratic family of Goryeo. He paid little heed to what he wore and ate, and eschewed fine garments and other comforts even after becoming famous and successful. He disliked men who desired expensive articles, and he viewed simplicity as a virtue. Choe Yeong's motto, left to him by his father, was to regard gold as nothing but mere rocks. Military career Based on his character and beliefs, Choe Yeong was well-suited for the military. In the military, Choe Yeong quickly gained the confidence of both his men and the king due to numerous victories against Japanese pirates who began raiding the Korean coast around 1350. In 1352, at the age of 36, Choe Yeong became a national hero after he successfully put down a rebellion by Jo Il-shin when insurgents surrounded the royal palace, killed many officials, and proclaimed Jo Il-shin as the new ruler. As Goryeo was a tributary, or \\"Bumaguk (son-in- law nation)\\", to the Mongol Yuan dynasty since 1259, Choe Yeong was sent to help the Yuan forces quash the native Han Chinese insurgents during the Red Turban Rebellion in northern China. In 1354, at the age of 39, he deployed to northern China with 2,000 Korean mounted archers, and was reinforced in Kanbaluk by 20,000 veterans of the Goryeo Tumens. Together they suppressed the Red Turban Rebellion successfully, and returned home to Goryeo. Choe Yeong's success in nearly 30 different battles won him even more fame and favor at home. Upon returning to Korea, he dutifully reported to Gongmin about the internal problems troubling the waning Yuan dynasty, which gave the king the idea that the time was opportune to reclaim some of the northern territories previously lost to the Mongols. General Choe fought to recover various towns west of the Yalu River to the great delight of Gongmin. In 1356, he attacked and received the surrender of the Mongol-Korean Darughachi of Ssangseong Chonggwanbu in what is now Wonsan, where the former Goryeo ruling aristocrats had surrendered their fiefdoms to the Mongols prior to Goryeo's national surrender of sovereignty in 1259. The surrendering darughachi of Ssangseong was none other than Yi Jachun, whose son, the deputy darhughachi, was Yi Seong-gye, the future founder of the Joseon dynasty. In 1360, Choe Yeong defeated the Red Turbans during the Red Turban invasions of Goryeo. Choe Yeong served briefly as the mayor of Pyongyang, where his efforts at increasing crop production and mitigating famine won him even more attention as a national hero. In 1364, he distinguished himself further when he defeated a powerful minister named Deok Heung-gun who tried to overthrow the government of Goryeo for asserting independence from the Yuan dynasty. Choe Yu, appointed by Empress Gi of Yuan, invaded Korea with 10,000 Mongol cavalry to overthrow the rebellious king, but Choe Yeong gathered up his forces and defeated the Mongol Tumen of 10,000, solidifying the final defiance and independence of Goryeo dynasty from the Mongols in 1364. In 1368, when the new Ming dynasty of China offered an alliance against the Mongols, King Gongmin of Goryeo ordered Choe Yeong to invade the remaining Mongol garrisons in Manchuria. Choe Yeong maneuvered north of the Yalu River and captured and the city of Liaoyang in 1370, but this did not lead to a permanent settlement. Betrayal and redemption Following a dream that he thought predicted that a Buddhist monk would save his life, King Gongmin promoted a monk named Shin Don to a lofty position within his court and allowed him considerable influence. At first, Shin Don toiled to improve the lives of the peasants despite great opposition from the ministers; however, with the king's support Shin Don grew increasingly ruthless and corrupt. Choe Yeong, who vigorously opposed corruption in the kingdom, found himself at odds with the monk, and subsequently, Shin Don engineered false accusations of misconduct against Choe Yeong that resulted in a punishment of six years in exile and brought him dangerously close to execution. However, after Shin Don's death in 1374, Gongmin restored Choe Yeong to his previous position and immediately asked him to prepare a fleet to fight Japanese pirates and eliminate the remaining Mongol forces on Jeju Island. Choe Yeong engaged the Mongols first, who fought tenaciously, but Choe's forces eventually freed the island. Then, in 1376, the Japanese pirates advanced into Goryeo and captured the city of Gongju. With the new gunpowder recipe obtained by scientist Choe Mu-seon, General Choe and his subordinate, Yi Seong-gye, routed and defeated the pirates, and reclaimed Gongju. Final years In 1388, General Yi Seong-gye was ordered to use his armies to push the Ming forces out of the Liaodong peninsula, which Goryeo considered as its lost territory from the Goguryeo period. Yi Seong-gye opposed the northern expedition, citing four reasons which have become historical: # A smaller nation should not attack a larger nation, as it goes against the Confucian order of the world # It is harsh to campaign during the summer farming season, as it will result in a poor harvest for the populace # With the bulk of the men away to the north, Japanese pirates will have free rein in the south # Monsoon rains will reduce the effectiveness of composite bows, the army's main weapon, and will encourage the spread of infectious diseases in the camps. General Choe ordered the invasion nevertheless, supported by the King. However, knowing the support he enjoyed from high- ranking government officials and the general populace, Yi Seong-gye decided to return to the capital, Gaegyeong, and trigger a coup d'état. This incident later became famous as the Wihwado Retreat and became the first sign of the change of dynasty. When Yi Seong-gye returned to the capital, Choe Young put up a gallant defense at the palace, but was outnumbered and overwhelmed. General Choe was defeated, captured, and banished to Goyang and was later beheaded in the name of the government controlled by Yi Seong-gye. Before the execution, Choe was famously known to have predicted that due to his unjust demise, grass would never grow on his grave. Grass did not grow on his grave until 1976 and it became known as Jeokbun (적분), which means red grave, because of the red soil.

He is considered as one of the directors who brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema.Katz, Ephraim, \\"Italy,\\" The Film Encyclopedia (New York: HarperResource, 2001), pp. 682-685. In a career spanning over 30 years he is best known for directing and writing drama films such as Everybody's Fine, The Legend of 1900, Malèna, Baarìa and The Best Offer. Probably his most noted film is Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, for which Tornatore won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has also directed several advertising campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana. Tornatore is also known for his long-standing association with composer Ennio Morricone, who composed music for thirteen Tornatore feature films since 1988. Life and career Born in Bagheria near Palermo, Tornatore developed an interest in acting and the theatre from at least the age of 16 and put on works by Luigi Pirandello and Eduardo De Filippo. He worked initially as a freelance photographer. Then, switching to cinema, he made his debut with Le minoranze etniche in Sicilia (The Ethnic Minorities in Sicily), a collaborative documentary film which won a Salerno Festival prize. He then worked for RAI before releasing his first full-length film, Il Camorrista, in 1985. This evoked a positive response from audience and critics alike and Tornatore was awarded the Silver Ribbon for best new director. Tornatore's best known screen work was released in 1988: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film narrating the life of a successful film director who has returned to his native town in Sicily for the funeral of his mentor. This obtained worldwide success and won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Subsequently, Tornatore released several other films. In 2007 he won the Silver George for Best Director at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival for The Unknown Woman.

Early life and political career Karzai was born in 1961 in the village of Karz in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. He is the son of Abdul Ahad Karzai and brother of Hamid Karzai, Mahmud Karzai and Qayum Karzai. He attended Habibia High School in Kabul but was not able to finish his studies due to the Soviet–Afghan War. He travelled to neighbouring Pakistan and then immigrated to the United States.Wali Karzai laid to rest. Pajhwok.com. Retrieved 14 July 2011. Wali Karzai managed an Afghan restaurant in Chicago that was owned by his family. Ahmad Wali returned to Pakistan in the late 1980s to help his father, Abdul Ahad. He came to political prominence in Afghanistan following the US occupation of the country in 2001, where he was a key ally of the US military in the country's south. He was elected to the Kandahar Provincial Council in 2005 and exercised influence in the province to the extent that he was described as \\"effectively the governor\\". At the time of his death, he was the Council's chairman. A few days before his death, Ahmed Wali Karzai appeared on a British television programme, \\"Afghanistan: The Unknown Country,\\" presented by Lyse Doucet, at his home in Kandahar, talking about public perceptions of him.BBC News: \\"Ahmad Wali Karzai: Meeting Kandahar's Mr Fix-it\\", 12 July 2011.

Doucet said: \\"Like most strong men, he depended on family and fellow tribesmen to protect him.\\" Allegations of corruption A June 2009 U.S. embassy cable alleged that much of the actual business of running the Afghan city of Kandahar \\"takes place out of public sight, where Ahmed Wali Karzai operates, parallel to formal government structures, through a network of political clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises.\\"US convinced Karzai half-brother is corrupt, WikiLeaks cables say by Jonathan Steele, The Guardian, 2 December 2010 In addition, James Risen of The New York Times and others stated that Ahmed Wali Karzai may have been involved in the Afghan opium and heroin trade. This was denied by Karzai, who called the charges political propaganda and stated he was a \\"victim of vicious politics.\\" In meetings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, including a 2006 session with former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ronald E. Neumann, the CIA's station chief and their British counterparts, American officials talked about the rumors in hopes that the president might move his brother out of the country, said several people who took part in or were briefed on the talks. \\"We thought the concern expressed to Karzai might be enough to get him out of there,\\" one official said. President Karzai has resisted, however, demanding clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing, several officials said. \\"We don't have the kind of hard, direct evidence that you could take to get a criminal indictment,\\" a White House official said. Ahmed Wali Karzai dismissed the allegations as politically motivated attacks by longtime rival groups in his country. Before the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Wali Karzai and Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, former governor of the Helmand Province and a member of the Upper House of the Afghan parliament, were accused of vote rigging. After the election, reports mentioned that all those running in the election were involved in electoral fraud. CIA connections In October 2009 The New York Times reported that Ahmed Wali Karzai received payments from the CIA for \\"a variety of services\\", including the recruitment of the Kandahar Strike Force, an Afghan paramilitary force run by the CIA in the Kandahar region. It also stated that he was paid for allowing the CIA and U.S. special forces to rent the former residence of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar.

US General David Petraeus as well as other top NATO personnel serving in Afghanistan, officials at the White House and many world leaders condemned the assassination. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed that one of their agents was behind the assassination saying, \\"Today in Kandahar city, Hamid Karzai's brother was killed during the Operation al-Badr... We hired a person by the name of Sadar Mohammad, who was hired for this job for some time now. Ahmed Wali Karzai was punished for all his wrongdoings.\\" However, according to The Christian Science Monitor, the Taliban has \\"a dubious record of claiming responsibility for attacks it had nothing to do with\\",What Ahmed Wali Karzai's assassination could mean for Afghanistan, by Tom A. Peter, The Christian Science Monitor, 12 July 2011 and its claim has been denied by several sources.

Following the killing, police were mobilised in Kandahar and helicopters were seen overhead as checkpoints were locked down leading towards the hospital his body was taken to. Investigations Investigators believe that Sardar Mohammad may have been a Taliban sleeper agent or a government defector. Mahmud Karzai, Karzai's other brother, stated that Sardar Mohammad traveled to the Pakistani city of Quetta within the past three months to meet with the Shura Council of the Taliban. Mahmoud Karzai claimed that he has been acting very erratically in recent weeks, including sleeping poorly, moving from house to house during nights, acting suspiciously toward his men and demanding to know who they were talking to on their mobile phones. It suggests that he may have been using narcotics since the area is well known for opium production.http://in.news.yahoo.com/karzais-killer-traveled-pak-meet-taliban- insurgents-weeks-120015970.html References *See also Astri Suhrke, When More Is Less: The International Project in Afghanistan (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 135, 137.

Habash served as Secretary-General of the PFLP until 2000, when ill health forced him to resign. Early life George Habash received an undergraduate degree in medicine from the American University of Beirut, 1951. Habash was born in Lydda (today's Lod) to an Eastern Orthodox Palestinian family in 1926.Arab Gateway: Palestine Who's Who (C-M) As a child, he sang in the church choir. Habash, a medical student at the American University of Beirut, was visiting his family during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. In July 1948, the Israeli Defence Force captured Lydda from Jordanian and Arab Liberation Army forces, resulting in all of the town's Arab residents leaving and killing Habash's sister. Habash and his remaining family became refugees and were not allowed to return home. Political thinkers who were influences on Habash at this period included Constantin Zureiq, whose lectures at AUB on 'Arab nationalism and the Zionist danger' in the late 1940s and early 1950s Habash had attended, and Sati' al-Husri an Arab Muslim intellectual who emphasized national cohesiveness, territorial patriotism, and loyalty to the state, and gave priority to Arab unity over Islamic unity.Harold Cubert, The PFLP's Changing Role in the Middle East, p.30 In 1951, after graduating first in his class from medical school, Habash worked in refugee camps in Jordan and ran a clinic with Wadie Haddad in Amman. He firmly believed that the state of Israel should be ended by all possible means, including political violence. In an effort to recruit the Arab world to this cause, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) in 1951 and aligned the organization with Gamal Abdel Nasser's Arab nationalist ideology. He was implicated in the 1957 coup attempt in Jordan, which had originated among Palestinian members of the National Guard. Habash was convicted in absentia, after having gone underground when King Hussein proclaimed martial law and banned all political parties. In 1958 he fled to Syria (then part of the United Arab Republic), but was forced to return to Beirut in 1961 by the tumultuous breakup of the UAR. Habash was a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organization until 1967 when he was sidelined by Fatah leader Yasser Arafat. In response, Habash founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine In 1964 he began reorganizing the ANM, regrouping the Palestinian members of the organization into a \\"regional command.\\" After the Six-Day War in 1967, disillusion with Nasser became widespread. This prompted the foundation, led by Habash, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as a front of several Palestinian factions, like the \\"heroes of return\\" and \\"Palestinian Liberation Front\\", along with the ANM on 11 December, when he also became its first Secretary-General. Habash was briefly imprisoned in Syria in 1968 but escaped. In the same year, he also came into conflict with long-time ally Wadie Haddad, but both remained in the PFLP. At a 1969 congress, the PFLP re-designated itself a Marxist–Leninist movement and has remained a Communist organization ever since. Its pan-Arab leanings have been diminished since the ANM days, but popular support for a united Arab front has remained, especially in regard to Israeli and western political pressures. It holds a firm position regarding Israel, demanding its complete eradication as a racist state through military struggle and promotes a one-state solution (one secular, democratic, non-denominational state). Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Darwish & George Habash in Syria The 1969 congress also saw an ultra-leftist faction under Nayef Hawatmeh and Yasser Abd Rabbo split off as the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), later to become the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). During Habash's time as Secretary-General, the PFLP became known as one of the most radical and militant Palestinian factions and gained world notoriety after a string of aircraft hijackings and attacks against Israel affiliated companies as well as Israeli ambassadors in Europe mostly planned by Haddad. The PFLP's pioneering of modern international terror operations brought the group, and the Palestinian issue, onto newspaper front pages worldwide, but it also provoked intense criticism from other parts of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1970, Habash was evicted from Jordan due to the key role of the Popular Front in the Black September clashes. In 1974, the Palestinian National Council adopted a resolution recognizing a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Habash, who opposed this, formed the Rejectionist Front from several other opposition parties. Habash aligned the PFLP with the PLO and the Lebanese National Movement, but stayed neutral during the Lebanese Civil War in the late 1970s. After a stroke in 1980, when he was living in Damascus, his health declined and other PFLP members rose to the top. After the Oslo Agreements, Habash formed another opposition alliance of Rejectionists, including Islamist organizations such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, that became prominent during the First Intifada. In 2000, he resigned from his leadership post of the PFLP due to poor health and was succeeded by Abu Ali Mustafa. He continued to be an activist for the group until 2008 when he died of a heart attack in Amman. Black September The PFLP ignored tensions with the mainstream leadership of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, and instead focused on bringing about revolutionary change in Jordan. Habash expressed the opinion that what proceeded was not \\"only military but also psychological warfare\\" and one had to \\"hold the Israelis under permanent pressure\\".‘’Aziya i Afrika segodnya’’ - cited in edition ‘’Välispanoraam 1972’’, Tallinn, 1973, lk 129 (‘’Foreign Panorama 1972’’) In the 1970 Dawson's Field hijackings, Habash masterminded the hijackings of four Western airliners over the United States, Europe, the Far East and the Persian Gulf. The aircraft were forced to fly to a World War II airfield in Jordan, the passengers and crews were disembarked and the planes were then blown up. The Dawson's Field hijackings were instrumental in provoking the Black September crackdown, which came close to destroying the PLO. The hijackings led King Hussein of Jordan to carry out a major offensive against militant strongholds in his kingdom resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. In autumn 1970, Habash visited Beijing. After Black September, the PLO fedayeen relocated to Lebanon. In 1972, Habash experienced failing health and gradually began to lose influence within the organization. The Palestinian National Council's (PNC) adoption of a resolution viewed by the PFLP as a two-state solution in 1974, prompted Habash to lead his organization out of active participation in the PLO and to join the Iraqi- backed Rejectionist Front. Only in 1977 would the PFLP opt to rejoin, as the Palestinian factions rallied their forces in opposition to Anwar Sadat's overtures towards Israel, pro-U.S. policies and fragmentation of the Arab world. During the Lebanese Civil War that broke out in 1975, PFLP forces were decimated in the battle against Syria. Later, the PFLP would draw close to Syria, as Syria's government shifted, but PFLP involvement in the Lebanese war remained strong until the U.S.-negotiated evacuation of PLO units from Beirut in 1982 and continued on a smaller scale after that. Oslo agreement After the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993, Habash and the PFLP again broke completely with Arafat, accusing him of selling out the Palestinian revolution. The group set up an anti-Arafat and anti-Oslo alliance in Damascus, for the first time joined by non-PLO Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which had grown to prominence during the First Intifada. After finding the position sterile, with Palestinian political dynamics playing out on the West Bank and Gaza areas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Habash carefully sought to repair ties to Arafat, and gain a hold in post-Oslo politics without compromising PFLP principles. However, there is no indication that he ever accepted the two-state solution. This balancing act could not save the PFLP from being eclipsed by the militant Islamist factions on the one hand, and the resource-rich Fatah with its PNA patronage network on the other. The significance of the PFLP in Palestinian politics has diminished considerably since the mid-90s. The PFLP participated in the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006 as Ahmad Sa'adat won 4.2% of the popular vote. In the late 1990s, Habash's medical condition worsened. In 2000 he resigned from the post as Secretary-General, citing health reasons. He was succeeded as head of the PFLP by Abu Ali Mustafa who was assassinated by Israel during the Second Intifada. Habash went on to set up a PFLP-affiliated research center, but he remained active in the PFLP's internal politics. Until his death he was still popular among many Palestinians, who appreciate his revolutionary ideology, his determination and principles, the rejection of the Oslo Agreements and his intellectual style. Death George Habash Square, Ramallah Habash died on 26 January 2008, at the age of 81 of a heart attack in the Jordan Hospital, Amman where Habash was a cancer patient. The President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of national mourning. Habash was buried in a suburban cemetery of Amman with processions by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Abbas said Habash was a \\"historic leader\\" and called for Palestinian flags to be flown half-mast. Abdel Raheem Mallouh, PFLP deputy Secretary-General, called Habash a \\"distinguished leader... who struggled for more than 60 years without a stop for the rights and the interests of his people\\". Hamas leader and dismissed Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh sent his condolences, saying Habash \\"spent his life defending Palestine\\".

The college is named after the Grizedale Forest area of Lancashire North of the Sands. When it was built it was situated at the southern extremity of the Bailrigg campus. The development of the south west campus has meant that college is now considered to be one of the more centrally located colleges. It is currently the fifth largest in terms of number of students. History Depravo the Rat, former school mascot Grizedale was one of the last colleges to be built on the Bailrigg campus in 1974. It initially shared accommodation and administration with Pendle College. Grizedale was in the old 'E' Block and Pendle in the old 'J' block. This arrangement continued until Grizedale took over 'J Block' in 1993, and new accommodation to the south of Grizedale, originally intended for Grizedale itself, was completed for Pendle in 1994. The Grizedale boar was only recently inaugurated as the college mascot. Originally, Depravo the rat, a character invented by Michael Palin in his book ‘Bert Fegg's Nasty book for boys and girls’, represented the college. An early member of college staff was friendly with Mr Palin who granted the College the rights to the character and Depravo the Rat became Grizedale’s mascot.http://domino.lancs.ac.uk/Info/lunews.nsf/I/BB991C2CDBBAD05380256F2E003C2D7F Domino Article The boar became the second mascot in the late 1980s when a number of parents questioned the relevance of Depravo and the Grizedale boar was created.http://www.lancs.ac.uk/unihistory/growth/gzcollegelink.htm Grizedale History Site Since 2000 the boar has become the main mascot of the college, although the bar still retained the name 'Depravos' until it was demolished in 2007. Redevelopment Grizedale's New Accommodation - Town house on the site of the former 'J' Block The original college accommodation 'E' and 'J' blocks were demolished in summer 2006. Problems with other building projects on campus meant that the site of the former buildings laid vacant for almost all of the 2006/07 academic year. As a result of these delays college students were housed in other buildings around campus including Pendle's George Fox Building, Pendle Main, Graduate College and Bowland Tower. The new buildings were finally completed in time for Michaelmas term of the 2008/09 academic year. These new buildings are composed of 12 person townhouses and 6 person apartments as opposed to the corridor block arrangements of the original accommodation. Depravo's, along with the College's offices and porters' lodge, was demolished after the graduation party for the 2007 graduates in July 2007. It was rebuilt and reopened at the start of the 2009 academic year, and stripped of its former name and mascot, renamed simply 'Grizedale Café Bar'. Facilities The College houses a recently renovated bar, junior and senior common rooms and accommodation blocks and a laundrette. Central to the college has always been the college bar, originally known as 'The World's End' as Grizedale was the southernmost college on campus and later as 'Depravos'. This was home to a number of famous campus events, including the 'Shite' Disco, the gZ Centurion and many others, getting Grizedale the reputation as the Social College. The college bar was redeveloped and reopened in 2009. The original, iconic mural that had adorned the old bar's staircase was relocated to the University Chaplaincy Centre, and was replaced with photos taken in Grizedale Forest by former College Principal Andrew Okey. Symbols The official college song, adopted as the result of a vote by the JCR membership, is \\"Never Forget\\" as performed by Take That. The college has two mascots - Depravo the rat, the rights to which were granted to the college by Michael Palin and, since 2000, the Grizedale Boar. Social Events Grizedale college has a reputation for being a sociable college, attracting students from other colleges in the evening for events often held at Grizedale Bar. Events are organised by the JCR - Events such as Take Me Out, Quizzes and Extrav; as well as many socials throughout the University hosting events at the bar. Currently, there is a permanent 2-for-1 all-day everyday cocktail menu, including Sex on the Beach, Long Island Iced Tea, Cosmopolitan, White Russian, Lynchburg Lemonade, Woo Woo and Blue Lagoon, which costs £6.95 for two of any type. However, through the week there are also different cocktail offers depending on the day of the week. Mondays have gin offers, Tuesdays are hardshakes including a range of milkshake cocktails, Wednesday is Captain Gilligan’s Rumshack, Thursdays are martinis, Fridays are prosecco cocktails and Saturdays are sours. In terms of food, currently, the bar sells a range of different types of nachos, such as cheesy, barbeque, Mexican vegetarian and have begun selling Frenchos, which includes pita bread, cranberry sauce and camembert. At present, the bar is open for service from 4 pm until close, depending on how busy the bar is, from Monday-Saturday, being closed on Sundays/ However, students can enter the bar in mornings to play pool or darts and use the tables.  Governance  Grizedale, like many of her sister colleges, has found redevelopment and inconsistent Presidencies a major cause for concern. In 2009 reform was passed through the student union to allow the Vice-President to sit alongside the President in Union Council, the senior student council. All Presidents sit on both Senate and Court, only two of the nine college Vice-Presidents who are elected as Senate representatives through Academic Council, may also hold full seats on both Senate and Court. This role is completely autonomous from their College role and as such may mandate their Presidents should a vote be requested on Court matters. All members of the Executive sit on Student Union sub-committees including: President's Committee Vice-President's Committee both sit on UnionCouncil, Extrav Sub etc. Academic Council Chair Committee/Elections Sub-committee Wel- Comm Inter College Sport i.e. George Wyatt Grizedale College has proven itself to be a powerful college in the transition of JCR Executive Presidents to the Student Union with Chris Cottam, Graeme Poulton and Dwayne Branch all successfully running for office. In the summer term of 2009 former social secretary Victoria (Torri) Crapper was elected Vice President for Welfare in the new LUSU Sabbatical make-up. In 2010 former President Chaz Ginn and former VP Paul Lynch were candidates for the Welfare and Academic Vice-Presidencies, but both lost in close elections. Grizedale prides itself on the activism of its members, with the former bar depicting the storming of University House in an elaborate mural that lined the stairs to the JCR space, based on a World War II photograph. It is expected that once restored to its former glory, the college will once again be one of the most politically vocal on the Campus. Sport The Inter-College Carter Shield has been won on two occasions, in 2005 and 2009. With many of the college JCR members representing their both University and College teams, with the support of the SCR, the first Grizedale College Colours for sport were awarded at the Christmas Ball of 2006 and the tradition has carried on, with the Sports Reps choosing a suitable candidate for both Colours for Excellence and Extraordinary Commitment. In addition to the Colours the Victoria Stockton memorial cup is awarded to a student displaying the most commitment to college sport. The cup was presented by Victoria's parents to Fr. Hugh Pollock in memory of their daughter who was the first sports representative in the college to win the coveted Carter Shield; and who died in the summer of 2006. The recipients are nominated by the Sports Reps before being approved by College Council. A number of former College Colours recipients have gone on to receive University full colours and an England shirt belonging to rugby league player Tom Lever is on display alongside the former president's board in the Porter's Lodge of the college. In 2018 the first Grizedale college member won the sportswoman of the year award. Moreover, Grizedale’s football and netball teams are some of the best in the university.

J. Simpson, to whom she was married from 1985 to 1992, and the mother of their two children, Sydney and Justin. She was murdered at her home in Los Angeles, California, on June 12, 1994, along with her friend, restaurant waiter Ron Goldman, two years after her divorce from Simpson. Simpson, who had a legal history of physically abusing, stalking and making death threats toward Brown, was arrested and charged with both murders. After a controversial and highly publicized criminal trial, Simpson was acquitted of all charges, but found liable for both deaths in a civil lawsuit in 1997. Early life Brown was born on May 19, 1959, in Frankfurt, West Germany, to Juditha Anne \\"Judy\\" Brown (née Baur, ) and Louis Hezekiel \\"Lou\\" Brown (1923–2014). Her mother was German and her father was American. After moving to the US she attended Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove, California, and later Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, California, where she graduated in 1977. Relationship with O. J. Simpson Brown met Simpson in 1977 when she was eighteen years old and working as a waitress at a Beverly Hills private club called The Daisy. Although Simpson was still married to his first wife, Marguerite, the two began dating. Simpson and Marguerite divorced in March 1979. Simpson and Brown were married on February 2, 1985, five years after his retirement from professional football. The marriage lasted seven years, during which time they had two children, Sydney (b. 1985) and Justin (b. 1988). Simpson was investigated multiple times by the police for domestic violence and pleaded no contest to spousal abuse in 1989. Brown filed for divorce on February 25, 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. Following the divorce, Simpson and Brown got back together. Audio released during the murder trial of O. J. Simpson revealed that Brown called 9-1-1 on October 25, 1993, crying and saying that \\"He [Simpson] is going to beat the shit out of me.\\" When the police arrived, Brown was secretly recorded by Sgt. Craig Lally. \\"He gets a very animalistic look in him,\\" Brown stated. \\"All his veins pop out, his eyes are black and just black, I mean cold, like an animal. I mean very, very weird. And when I see it, it just scares me.\\" Brown also stated Simpson hadn’t hit her in four years. Several months after this incident, the relationship would end for a second and final time. Death Brown lived at 875 South Bundy Drive in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, with her two children. On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Brown, aged 35, was stabbed to death outside her home along with her friend, 25-year-old restaurant waiter Ron Goldman. Her body was found shortly after midnight on June 13. She was lying in the fetal position in a pool of blood. An autopsy determined that Brown had been stabbed seven times in the neck and scalp, and had a 14 cm-long (5.5 inches) gash across her throat, which had severed both her left and right carotid arteries and breached her right and left jugular veins. The wound on Brown's neck was so severe it had penetrated a depth of 1.9 cm (0.75 inches) into her cervical vertebrae, nearly decapitating her. She also had defensive wounds on her hands. Brown's funeral was held on June 16 at the St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Brentwood, with mourners including Simpson and their children, Cited in . members of Brown's family, Al Cowlings, house guest Kato Kaelin, and Steve Garvey. Brown is buried in Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California. Aftermath Simpson was tried for the murders of both Brown and Goldman. In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months, he was acquitted. In a 1997 civil trial, a jury found him liable for the wrongful deaths of Brown and Goldman and awarded $19.5 million in damages to their families. Simpson would later be jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008. In 1996, after the conclusion of the trial, a judge granted Simpson's petition to give him full custody of Sydney and Justin. Brown's parents continued unsuccessfully to fight for custody. Following the deaths of Brown and Goldman, the townhouse at the site of their killing, 875 South Bundy Drive, sat empty for two years, until the next owner extensively remodeled it and had the address changed. Filmmaker Ezra Edelman, who directed the documentary O.J.: Made in America, dedicated his Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature to both Brown and Goldman in his acceptance speech. Foundation A foundation, Nicole Simpson Foundation, was established in 1994 in her memory. Later renamed the Nicole Brown Charitable Foundation, it reportedly cut back on grantmaking in 1999 due to a drop in donations and questionable management practices.

Originally, any computer data were considered as something internal -- the final data output was always on paper. However, the development of computer networks has made it so that in most cases it is much more convenient to distribute electronic documents than printed ones. The improvements in electronic visual display technologies made it possible to view documents on screen instead of printing them (thus saving paper and the space required to store the printed copies). However, using electronic documents for final presentation instead of paper has created the problem of multiple incompatible file formats. Even plain text computer files are not free from this problem -- e.g. under MS-DOS, most programs could not work correctly with UNIX-style text files (see newline), and for non-English speakers, the different code pages always have been a source of trouble. Even more problems are connected with complex file formats of various word processors, spreadsheets, and graphics software. To alleviate the problem, many software companies distribute free file viewers for their proprietary file formats (one example is Adobe's Acrobat Reader). The other solution is the development of standardized non-proprietary file formats (such as HTML and OpenDocument), and electronic documents for specialized uses have specialized formats - the specialized electronic articles in physics use TeX or PostScript.

J. Simpson. He was murdered along with Brown at her home in Los Angeles, California, on June 12, 1994. Simpson was acquitted of their murders in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a 1997 civil lawsuit. Early life Goldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, near Chicago. His parents divorced in 1974 when he was six and, after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon (Fohrman) Rufo, he was raised by his father, Fred Goldman, and lived with him and his younger sister, Kim Goldman. Goldman grew up Jewish. He attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester (where he planned to major in psychology) and a pledge to Sigma Nu fraternity before he followed his family to southern California at age 18. When younger, Goldman had worked as a camp counselor and had volunteered to help children with cerebral palsy. In California While living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College. He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, and nightclubbing. Upon arriving in California, he lived independently from his family and supported himself by working as an employment headhunter and tennis instructor. He then had a string of waiter jobs. He also occasionally worked as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of Z90049 (the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in Brentwood Gardens, where he had worked before Mezzaluna). Not long before his death, he had earned an Emergency Medical Technician's license but decided not to pursue that career. Instead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area. He had shared with friends his vision of opening a future restaurant or bar characterized not by a name, but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that matched the tattoo on his shoulder. According to his friend, Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business, and occasionally worked as a promoter at a Century City dance club called Tripps. For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Goldman had also expressed aspirations to act and to be on a show, and he appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Studs in 1992. He had dated Jacqui Bell for nearly two years before she broke off their relationship three months before his death. Friendship with Nicole Brown According to a June 15, 1994 Los Angeles Times article published three days after his death, Goldman probably met Brown six weeks before they were killed, when he borrowed her Ferrari. They grew increasingly friendly, accompanying each other to dance clubs, and meeting for coffee and dinner during the month-and-a-half before they died. According to police and friends, their relationship was platonic. According to the article, he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, he told him it was her car, but that he did not say she was his girlfriend. \\"He said they were friends.\\" Death On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman worked a server shift at Mezzaluna Trattoria, a restaurant at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. Brown called to report that her mother accidentally left her sunglasses on the table when they dined there earlier in the day. Goldman was not their server. After a search turned up the glasses in a street gutter outside the restaurant, Goldman agreed to drop them at her home after work. The Los Angeles Times reported that Goldman “punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have bottled water at the bar.” Before returning the sunglasses, he stopped by his Brentwood apartment at 11663 Gorham Avenue and spoke briefly to his roommate, Mezzaluna's bartender Stewart Tanner, before he left. The two had plans to go out later that evening. Goldman and Brown were stabbed to death on the walkway leading to the condominium at 875 South Bundy Drive. Police found their bodies shortly after midnight. During a reconstruction of the events, the police came to believe he had arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death. Goldman's family believe that Goldman died trying to save Brown from her attacker and that he was the man whom eyewitnesses heard shouting that night.The People v. O.J.

He is often numbered among the greatest heroes in the military history of Korea.  Background  Eulji Mundeok was born in the mid-6th century and died sometime after 618, although the exact date is unknown. Haedong Myeongjangjeon, known as the \\"Biographies of Famed Korean Generals\\", written in the 18th century, states that he was from Seokda Mountain () near Pyongyang. At the time of his birth, Goguryeo was a powerful state, frequently at war with its neighbors. In 589, the Sui Dynasty conquered several surrounding states and launched several large military campaigns against Goguryeo which was unwilling to submit to its dominance. Eulji Mundeok was a cultured man, skilled in both the martial and literary arts. He eventually rose to become the supreme commander of Goguryeo. The name Eulji may actually be a Goguryeo title. The Battle of Salsu River After the founding of Sui in 589, a precarious peace was maintained for several years between the new Chinese dynasty and Goguryeo. However, in 597, Yeongyang launched an attack on the Sui at the Battle of Linyuguan. In response, Sui invaded Goguryeo, but the invasion was defeated due to constant ambushes and unfavorable weather. In the early 7th century, Emperor Yang learned of a secret correspondence between Goguryeo and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Emperor Yang demanded Yeongyang come and submit personally to him or face an \\"imperial tour of his territories\\". When Yeongyang failed to do so, Emperor Yang prepared for war. He mustered an army of over 1,133,000 troops and more than 2 million auxiliaries and personally led them against Goguryeo in 612. The Sui army quickly overran Goguryeo's border defenses, then camped on the banks of the Liao River and prepared to bridge it. Eulji Mundeok, commissioned as the Field Marshal, was called upon to defend the nation. He prepared his troops to meet the numerically superior Sui forces with a strategy of deception, using feigned retreats and sudden attacks. After the Sui forces crossed the Liao River, a small contingent was sent to attack the city of Yodong, but was repulsed by Eulji Mundeok's forces. As the rainy season progressed, the Sui forces launched other small probing attacks, but held off from making any large moves before the end of the rainy season. When the rains stopped, Emperor Yang moved his forces to the banks of the Yalu River in northwestern Korea and prepared for a major battle. Fighting only small engagements at times and places of his choosing, Eulji Mundeok drew the Sui forces further and further from their supply centers. Emperor Yang sent an advance force of over 305,000 troops to take the city of Pyongyang. After allowing the force to approach the city, Field Marshal Eulji Mundeok ambushed it. His forces attacked from all sides, driving the Sui troops back in utter confusion. His troops pursued the retreating army, slaughtering them at will. Records claim that only 2,800 men of the massive force returned alive to the main Chinese army. This battle, the Battle of Salsu, came to be known as one of the most glorious military triumphs in Korea's national history. After the battle, winter began to set in and the Sui forces, short on provisions, were forced to return home in defeat.  Death  Eulji Mundeok managed to protect Sin Fortress from another Sui invasion force, but he died not long after. The Sui dynasty was beginning to disintegrate and Emperor Yang decided that he urgently needed to expand his empire in order to regain power, but two more attacks on Goguryeo in the following spring were met with similar disasters, and eventually internal rebellion in China forced him to abandon his desire for Goguryeo. By 618, the relatively short-lived Sui dynasty was replaced by the Tang dynasty. Field Marshal Eulji Mundeok's strategy and leadership had protected Goguryeo from Chinese expansion into the Korean peninsula.  Legacy  One of the most distinguished military leaders of the Goguryeo period, Eulji Mundeok's leadership and tactical acumen were the decisive factors in defeating the Sui invasion. Facing numerically superior forces, he developed a strategy that allowed him to secure a decisive victory. Such brilliant tactical success earned him a permanent place among Korea's most famous leaders. Kim Bu-sik, the author of the Samguk Sagi, also attributed the victory over Sui to Eulji Mundeok. In Korea, Eulji Mundeok is recognized as one of the greatest figures in its national history. During the reign of Hyeonjong in the Goryeo period, a shrine to Eulji Mundeok was built near Pyongyang. In the succeeding Joseon period, he remained just as revered a figure. Yang Seong-ji, a scholar and high-ranking bureaucrat of 15th century Joseon, and An Jeong-bok, a Silhak historian of 18th century Joseon, both thought highly of him. Furthermore, King Sukjong ordered the construction of another shrine in honor of Eulji Mundeok in 1680. At a time when Korea was suffering under the yoke of Japanese Imperialism, a fuller assessment of Eulji Mundeok was commenced by the Korean historian Shin Chaeho, who published a biography of the famed general in 1908 and held him out as an example of Korea's traditional nationalist spirit. Eulji Mundeok is still celebrated as a national hero. One of the most preeminent Korean scholars of the 20th century, Lee Ki-baik, noted that Eulji Mundeok's efforts in halting the Sui attempt at conquest stand as one of the earliest examples of Korean attempts to fend off foreign domination. In South Korea, a main thoroughfare in downtown Seoul, Euljiro, is named after Eulji Mundeok. The second highest military decoration of South Korea is named after Eulji Mundeok. The Republic of Korea Navy named a Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyer in honor of Eulji Mundeok. Eulji Mundeok's literary work, the Eulji Mundeok Hansi, is one of the oldest surviving poems in Korean literature. One of the biannual Combined Forces Command exercises between South Korea and the United States was called Ulchi- Focus Lens (UFL) in honor of Eulji Mundeok. It was renamed to Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) in 2015. UFG is the world's largest computerized command and control exercise, focusing on how US and ROK forces would defend against a North Korean attack.

Witnesses recalled that one of its engines exploded and caught fire just seconds after takeoff. The landing gear was still extended when this happened. It then rose sharply and stalled. The final report concluded that the cause of the crash was engine failure on take- off. The accident was the deadliest plane crash to occur on Algerian soil until being surpassed by the Algerian Air Force Il-76 crash in 2018. It was also Air Algérie's deadliest plane crash until it was surpassed 11 years later by Air Algérie Flight 5017, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 that crashed in Mali killing all 116 people on board.

The aircraft was a Boeing 737-2T4, named Monts du Daia, and was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17A engines. The aircraft entered service on 9 December 1983, and flew for more than 40,000 hours before the crash. The unnamed male captain, aged 48, allegedly had 10,760 hours and 10 minutes of flight experience, including 1,087 hours and 46 minutes on the Boeing 737-200 as captain. Meanwhile, Yousfi Fatima, the female first officer, aged 44, allegedly had 5,219 hours and 10 minutes of flight experience, including 1,292 hours and 42 minutes on the Boeing 737-200. Fatima was also Algeria's first female airline pilot. The first officer was the pilot flying (PF), while the captain was the pilot not flying (PNF). Both switched roles the moment the engine failure occurred.  Timeline  At about 14:08 UTC, Air Traffic Control cleared the plane to taxi to Runway 02 and the plane left the gate. At 14:12, Air Traffic Control cleared the plane to line up and take off on Runway 02. At 14:13, the plane took off, and the first officer requested landing gear retraction. The request was immediately followed by a loud thumping noise recorded on the aircraft's Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), apparently caused by the rupture of the left engine. The plane veered left, and the first officer let out a chain of exclamations. At 14:15, the captain told the first officer that he was taking over control of the aircraft and insisted she let go of the controls so that he could control the plane. The first officer then handed the controls over to the captain and offered to retract the landing gear. The captain did not respond. The first officer alerted air traffic control about the situation, saying \\"we have a small problem\\". The stick shaker then activated and de-activated twice. The Ground proximity warning system (GPWS) then sounded a \\"don't sink\\" alarm and was followed by the stick shaker activating a third time and continued operating until the CVR stopped recording. The GPWS then sounded a second \\"don't sink\\" alarm and the CVR stopped recording, along with the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The aircraft was still airborne when the recordings ended. Without the landing gear being retracted, additional drag was apparently created and the plane began to lose speed at a high rate. Eventually, the plane stalled and crashed. Upon impact, fuel was spilled and ignited, causing the aircraft to burst into flames. It then skidded along the ground, striking the airport's perimeter fence, and crossing a road, before coming to a stop. Air traffic control immediately declared an emergency. Aftermath 96 of the 97 passengers and all of the six crew members perished, a total of 102 people. The sole survivor of the accident was a 28-year-old male Algerian soldier. He was seated in the last row with his seat belt unfastened (as indicated in his statement), and was ejected from the plane upon impact, escaping from the accident. The man was found in a coma with multiple injuries. However, he regained consciousness the next day. Doctors said that his injuries were not life-threatening.  Investigation  Before the accident flight, the aircraft's weight and balance and fuel load were both examined and no problems were reported. Two of the witnesses, a ground engineer who worked on the accident aircraft, and an air traffic controller who was in the tower at the time of the accident gave statements to the investigators. The ground engineer said: The air traffic controller stated: The flight instruments and flight recorders were investigated in the BEA laboratory in Paris, France. The aircraft's engines were sent to Belgium for investigation. The last FDR parameters indicated that the aircraft was above ground level (AGL) and was traveling at a speed of . Investigators determined that the left engine's HP (high pressure) turbine had ruptured, damaging the LP (low pressure) turbine in the process. This caused a drop in power to the engine, though it did not shut down completely according to the flight recorders.  Crew resource management  The engine failure suddenly created a heavy workload for the flight crew. The captain took control only of the aircraft eight seconds after the engine failed. As he had done this at a critical phase, the captain could not initiate any emergency procedures. In addition, he used non-standard terminology. The first officer failed to properly perform her PNF duties, and even had her hands on the controls when the stall warning sounded, indicated by the captain saying telling her to let go of \\"let go\\" and \\"take your hand off\\". The \\"gear up\\" callout is supposed to be made by the PF, and carried out by the PNF. While still the PF, first officer made the \\"gear up\\" callout as required, but after becoming PNF, the first officer continued to ask the captain if the landing gear should be retracted and could even have performed the action herself because of the transfer of control, however the first officer did not retract the gear as captain did not respond to her request, presumably because he had a heavier workload as he was now the PF. The first officer had also failed to monitor the speed. The aircraft crashed into the ground tail-first. The flight crew's actions following the engine failure were informal, did not adhere to standard operating procedures (SOP), and did not utilize crew resource management (CRM).

Publication  Marinetti wrote the manifesto in the autumn of 1908 and it first appeared as a preface to a volume of his poems, published in Milan in January 1909.Lynton, Norbert (1994). \\"Futurism\\". In Nikos Stangos, ed. Concepts of Modern Art: From Fauvism to Postmodernism. 3rd edition. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 97. . It was published in the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dell'Emilia in Bologna on 5 February 1909, then in French as Manifeste du futurisme (Manifesto of Futurism) in the newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909.Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. \\"I manifesti del futurismo\\".

Contents  The limits of Italian literature at the end of the so-called Ottocento (19th century), its lack of strong contents, its quiet and passive laissez-faire, are fought by futurists (see article 1, 2 and 3) and their reaction includes the use of excesses intended to prove the existence of a dynamic surviving Italian intellectual class. In this period in which industry is of growing importance in all Europe futurists need to confirm that Italy is present, has an industry, has the power to take part in the new experience and will find the superior essence of progress in its major symbols like the car and its speed (see article 4). Nationalism is never openly declared, but it is evident. Futurists insist that literature will not be overtaken by progress, rather it will absorb progress in its evolution and will demonstrate that such progress must manifest in this manner because man will use this progress to sincerely let his instinctive nature explode. Man is reacting against the potentially overwhelming strength of progress and shouts out his centrality. Man will use speed, not the opposite (see articles 5 and 6). Poetry will help man to consent his soul be part of all that (see articles 6 and 7), indicating a new concept of beauty that will refer to the human instinct of aggression. The sense of history cannot be neglected as this is a special moment, many things are going to change into new forms and new contents, but man will be able to pass through these variations (see article 8), bringing with himself what comes from the beginning of civilization. In article 9, war is defined as a necessity for the health of human spirit, a purification that allows and benefits idealism. Their explicit glorification of war and its \\"hygienic\\" properties influenced the ideology of fascism. Marinetti was very active in fascist politics until he withdrew in protest of the \\"Roman Grandeur\\" which had come to dominate fascist aesthetics. Article 10 states: \\"We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice\\".  Meaning  This manifesto was published well before the occurrence of any of the 20th-century events which are commonly suggested as a potential meaning of this text. Many of them could not even be imagined yet. For example, the Russian Revolutions of 1917 were the first successfully maintained revolution of the sort described by article 11. The series of smaller scale peasant uprisings that had been known as the Russian Revolution previous to the occurrences of 1917 took place in the years immediately before the manifesto's publication and instigated the State Duma's creation of a Russian constitution in 1906. The effect of the manifesto is even more evident in the Italian version. Not one of the words used is casual; if not the precise form, at least the roots of these words recall those more frequently used during the Middle Ages, particularly during the Rinascimento. The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting (1914).\\"I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914\\". This committed them to a \\"universal dynamism\\", which was to be directly represented in painting. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: \\"The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places. ... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it\\".

It originally covered 13,000 acres (53 km²) of present-day Adams and Jay counties. Parts of it were known as the Loblolly Marsh, based on a word by local Native Americans for the sulphur smell of the marsh gas. The wetlands had mixed vegetation and supported a rich biodiversity, significant for local and migrating birds and insects, as well as other animals and life. European Americans drained the Limberlost for agricultural development early in the 20th century, destroying the rich habitat. Since 1997, parts of it have been restored. Observers have documented a return of insects, birds, and wildlife of all sorts to the restored area of wetlands. Approximately had been restored as of 2015. Several groups supported purchase of lands for what is now known as the Loblolly Marsh Nature Preserve, which was turned over to the state and is held by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Origin of name According to the History of Jay County by M.W. Montgomery, published in 1864, the name Limberlost came from the following event: > A man named James Miller, while hunting along the banks of the swamp, became > lost. After various fruitless efforts to find his way home, in which he > would always come around to the place of starting, he determined to go in a > straight course, and so, every few rods he would blaze a tree. While doing > this, he was found by friends. Being an agile man, he was known as 'limber > Jim,' and, after this, the stream was called 'Limberlost.' The Indiana State Museum contends, \\"The swamp received its name from the fate of 'Limber Jim' Corbus, who went hunting in the swamp and never returned. When the locals asked where Jim Corbus was, the familiar cry was 'Limber's lost!'\\"\\"Land of the Limberlost\\", Indiana State Museum, accessed 27 February 2015 Draining, development, and restoration After being drained from 1888 to 1910 by a steam-powered dredge, the area was cultivated as farmland for 80 years. In 1991, local citizen Ken Brunswick established \\"Limberlost Swamp Remembered,\\" a group organized to restore some of the wetlands, because of their importance as habitat. The work has included removing or blocking drainage tiles, allowing water back on the land, and planting native species of trees, bushes and flowers. As of 2015, The Loblolly Marsh had been entered into Indiana's Wetland Reserve Program by five owners; it was purchased with funds from The Indiana Heritage Trust, ACRES Land Trust, Ropchan Foundation, M.E. Raker Foundation, and Friends of the Limberlost/Limberlost Swamp Remembered Committee. An alternate name for the area was Loblolly Marsh. This name has been said to have been derived from a Miami language word for \\"stinking river,\\" related to the sulfur smell of marsh gas\\"Limberlost and Found\\" , Audubon Magazine, accessed 27 Feb 2015). However, the Oxford English Dictionary says that \\"loblolly\\" means a thick gruel or porridge, and that it occurs in the US as a colloquialism for a mud-hole. One quotation given by the OED, from The Log of a Cowboy by the Western writer Andy Adams, is \\"His ineffectual struggles caused him to sink farther to the flanks in the loblolly which the tramping of the cattle had caused.\\" The restored marsh has already attracted numerous species of insects, birds, and animals as the first major section has been restored. The 428-acre restoration project was dedicated as the Loblolly Marsh Wetland Preserve in 1997. Activists have included students from Ball State University, who participated in restoration activities such as planting native habitat. Approximately have been purchased and restored.\\"Limberlost Restoration\\" , Our Land, Our Literature, Ball State University, accessed 7 January 2012 As of 2015, the Loblolly Marsh Nature Preserve is held by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. It has a parking area and walking trails, including Veronica’s Trail--0.25 mile wheelchair-accessible wooden boardwalk built to honor the Americans with Disabilities Act. The preserve's floodplains connect to the Wabash River and support river bulrush, sedges, prairie cord grass, burr reed and cattails. The upland area contains a 25-acre mature woodland of hardwood trees. Representation in media * Indiana-born author Gene Stratton-Porter helped make the Limberlost Swamp famous in the early 20th century. She lived for years on its periphery and lobbied unsuccessfully against its ongoing destruction. The swamp served as the setting for two of her novels, Freckles (1904) and A Girl of the Limberlost (1909). Her novel The Harvester (1911) includes the names of many of the plants found in the swamp around the time the book was written. Stratton-Porter was also an accomplished artist and wildlife photographer who specialized in making close-up photographs of the birds and moths in their natural habitat. Several of her nonfiction nature books, including Moths of the Limberlost (1912), feature the swamp's wildlife. Her residences in the area became the laboratories for her research. They are preserved today as the Limberlost Cabin, the Limberlost State Historic Site in Geneva, and the Cabin at Wildflower Woods. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates Stratton-Porter's former homes as state historic sites, which are open to the public.

He is also noted for his pioneering work concerning fractals and a method for solving a system of linear equations known as modified Richardson iteration. Early life Lewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838–1919) and David Richardson (1835–1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather-manufacturing business.Hunt, p. xiv At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham SchoolOxford Dictionary of National Biography in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. He proceeded in 1900 to King’s College, Cambridge, where he was taught physics in the natural sciences tripos by (among others) J. J. Thomson and graduated with a first-class degree in 1903.Hunt, p. xv At age 47 he received a doctorate in mathematical psychology from the University of London. Career Richardson's working life represented his eclectic interests:Ashford 1985, Ch 3–7 * National Physical Laboratory (1903–1904). * University College Aberystwyth (1905–1906). * chemist, National Peat Industries (1906–1907). * National Physical Laboratory (1907–1909). * manager of the physical and chemical laboratory, Sunbeam Lamp Company (1909–1912). * Manchester College of Technology (1912–1913). * Meteorological Office – as superintendent of Eskdalemuir Observatory (1913–1916). * Friends Ambulance Unit in France (1916–1919). * Meteorological Office at Benson, Oxfordshire (1919–1920). * Head of the Physics Department at Westminster Training College (1920–1929). * Principal, Paisley Technical College, now part of the University of the West of Scotland (1929–1940). In 1926, he was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society Pacifism Richardson's Quaker beliefs entailed an ardent pacifism that exempted him from military service during World War I as a conscientious objector, though this subsequently disqualified him from having any academic post. Richardson worked from 1916 to 1919 for the Friends' Ambulance Unit attached to the 16th French Infantry Division. After the war, he rejoined the Meteorological Office but was compelled to resign on grounds of conscience when it was amalgamated into the Air Ministry in 1920. He subsequently pursued a career on the fringes of the academic world before retiring in 1940 to research his own ideas. His pacifism had direct consequences on his research interests. According to Thomas Körner,Körner, T.W. (1996). \\"A Quaker mathematician\\" and \\"Richardson on war\\", Ch 8 and 9 in The Pleasures of Counting (Cambridge U.P.) the discovery that his meteorological work was of value to chemical weapons designers caused him to abandon all his efforts in this field, and destroy findings that he had yet to publish. Weather forecasting Richardson's interest in meteorology led him to propose a scheme for weather forecasting by solution of differential equations, the method used nowadays, though when he published Weather Prediction by Numerical Process in 1922, suitable fast computing was unavailable. He described his ideas thus (his \\"computers\\" are human beings): > \\"After so much hard reasoning, may one play with a fantasy? Imagine a large > hall like a theatre, except that the circles and galleries go right round > through the space usually occupied by the stage. The walls of this chamber > are painted to form a map of the globe. The ceiling represents the north > polar regions, England is in the gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, > Australia on the dress circle and the Antarctic in the pit. > A myriad computers are at work upon the weather of the part of the map where > each sits, but each computer attends only to one equation or part of an > equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher > rank. Numerous little \\"night signs\\" display the instantaneous values so that > neighbouring computers can read them. Each number is thus displayed in three > adjacent zones so as to maintain communication to the North and South on the > map. > From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the > hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits the man in charge > of the whole theatre; he is surrounded by several assistants and messengers. > One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of > the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which > the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of > waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running > ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand. > Four senior clerks in the central pulpit are collecting the future weather > as fast as it is being computed, and despatching it by pneumatic carrier to > a quiet room.

In another > building are all the usual financial, correspondence and administrative > offices. Outside are playing fields, houses, mountains and lakes, for it was > thought that those who compute the weather should breathe of it freely.\\" > (Richardson 1922) (The word \\"computers\\" is used here in its original sense – people who did computations, not machines. \\"Calculator\\" also referred to people at this time.) When news of the first weather forecast by the first modern computer, ENIAC, was received by Richardson in 1950, he responded that the results were an \\"enormous scientific advance.\\" The first calculations for a 24-hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24 hours to produce. He was also interested in atmospheric turbulence and performed many terrestrial experiments. The Richardson number, a dimensionless parameter of the theory of turbulence is named for him. He famously summarised turbulence in rhyming verse in Weather Prediction by Numerical Process (p 66): > Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity, :and little > whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity. [A play on Siphonaptera, Augustus De Morgan's rewording of Jonathan Swift, \\"Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em, And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.\\" (A Budget of Paradoxes, 1915)]. Richardson's attempt at numerical forecast One of Richardson's most celebrated achievements is his retroactive attempt to forecast the weather during a single day—20 May 1910—by direct computation. At the time, meteorologists performed forecasts principally by looking for similar weather patterns from past records, and then extrapolating forward. Richardson attempted to use a mathematical model of the principal features of the atmosphere, and use data taken at a specific time (7 AM) to calculate the weather six hours later ab initio. As meteorologist Peter Lynch makes clear,Lynch, P. (2006) The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction (Cambridge U.P.) Richardson's forecast failed dramatically, predicting a huge rise in pressure over six hours when the pressure actually was more or less static. However, detailed analysis by Lynch has shown that the cause was a failure to apply smoothing techniques to the data, which rule out unphysical surges in pressure. When these are applied, Richardson's forecast is revealed to be essentially accurate—a remarkable achievement considering the calculations were done by hand, and while Richardson was serving with the Quaker ambulance unit in northern France. Mathematical analysis of war Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict—an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations. He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \\"There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.\\" In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, there are many more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones that kill many. While no conflict's size can be predicted beforehand—indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the series—overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores). Research on the length of coastlines and borders Richardson decided to search for a relation between the probability of two countries going to war and the length of their common border. However, while collecting data, he found that there was considerable variation in the various published lengths of international borders. For example, that between Spain and Portugal was variously quoted as 987 or 1214 km, and that between the Netherlands and Belgium as 380 or 449 km. The reason for these inconsistencies is the \\"coastline paradox\\". Suppose the coast of Britain is measured using a 200 km ruler, specifying that both ends of the ruler must touch the coast. Now cut the ruler in half and repeat the measurement, then repeat: 150px 150px 150px Notice that the smaller the ruler, the longer the resulting coastline. It might be supposed that these values would converge to a finite number representing the true length of the coastline. However, Richardson demonstrated that this is not the case: the measured length of coastlines, and other natural features, increases without limit as the unit of measurement is made smaller.Fractals and the Fractal Dimension (Vanderbilt University website, accessed 30 January 2008) This is known nowadays as the Richardson effect. At the time, Richardson's research was ignored by the scientific community. Today, it is considered an element of the beginning of the modern study of fractals. Richardson's research was quoted by mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot in his 1967 paper How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Richardson identified a value (between 1 and 2) that would describe the changes (with increasing measurement detail) in observed complexity for a particular coastline; this value served as a model for the concept of fractal dimension.P. G. Drazin, \\"Fractals\\"; Collected Papers of Lewis Fry Richardson, Volume 1; Cambridge University Press, 1993; p. 45. Patents for detection of icebergs In April 1912, soon after the loss of the ship Titanic, Richardson registered a patent for iceberg detection using acoustic echolocation in air. A month later he registered a similar patent for acoustic echolocation in water, anticipating the invention of sonar by Paul Langevin and Robert Boyle 6 years later.Michael A. Ainslie Principles of Sonar Performance Modelling, Springer, 2010 , page 10 In popular culture A fictional version of Richardson, named Wallace Ryman, plays a pivotal role in Giles Foden's novel Turbulence.Foden Richardson is mentioned in John Brunner's work, Stand on Zanzibar where Statistics of Deadly Quarrels is used as an argument that wars are inevitable. Richardson's work is also mentioned in Poul Anderson's speculative fiction novelette, Kings Who Die. Richardson’s famous quote, \\"Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity; little whirls have lesser whirls & so on to viscosity\\" is mentioned in the critically acclaimed song \\"Dots & Lines\\" written and performed by Grammy-winning lyricist/rapper Lupe Fiasco. Personal life In 1909 he married Dorothy Garnett (1885–1956), daughter of the mathematician and physicist William Garnett.William Garnett (1850–1932) – Brief biography on the British Society for the History of Mathematics website (accessed 21 January 2008) They were unable to have children due to an incompatibility of blood types, but they adopted two sons and a daughter between 1920 and 1927.Ashford (2004) Richardson's nephew Ralph Richardson became a noted actor. His great-nephew (through his wife Dorothy's eldest brother, (James Clerk) Maxwell Garnett, C.B.E.), Julian Hunt, went on to become a meteorologist and director general and chief executive of the British Meteorological Office from 1992 to 1997.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/lewis-fry-richardsons-weather- forecasts-changed-the-world-but-could-his-predictions-of-war-do- the-9679295.html A great-niece – of the same line of descent – is the former politician Virginia Bottomley, now Baroness Bottomley.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-john- garnett-1239782.html Legacy Since 1997, the Lewis Fry Richardson Medal has been awarded by the European Geosciences Union for \\"exceptional contributions to nonlinear geophysics in general\\" (by EGS until 2003http://www.egu.eu/egs/award6s.htm and by EGU since 2004).http://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/lewis-fry-richardson Winners have been: * 2015 : Daniel Schertzer * 2014 : Olivier Talagrand * 2013 : Jürgen Kurths * 2012 : Harry Swinney * 2011 : Catherine Nicolis * 2010 : Klaus Fraedrich * 2009 : Stéphan Fauve * 2008 : Akiva Yaglom * 2007 : Ulrich SchumannText of lecture \\"From little whorls to the global atmosphere\\" given by 2007 prizewinner * 2006 : Roberto Benzi * 2005 : Henk A.

The neighborhood is low density, with a 70.7% white, highly educated, older-aged population of 10,600+ people. There are four private and two public schools in the area. History Hancock Park was developed in the 1920s by the Hancock family with profits earned from oil drilling in the former Rancho La Brea. The area owes its name to developer-philanthropist George Allan Hancock, who subdivided the property in the 1920s. Hancock, born and raised in a home at what is now the La Brea tar pits, inherited , which his father, Major Henry Hancock had acquired from the Rancho La Brea property owned by the family of Jose Jorge Rocha. Hancock Park activists were instrumental in the passage of a 1986 Congressional ban on tunneling through the neighborhood. The ban, sponsored by Congressman Henry Waxman, prevented the Red Line Subway from being routed along Wilshire Boulevard through the neighborhood. Geography Hancock Park is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard on the south, Melrose Avenue on the north, both sides of North and South Highland Avenue on the west, and both sides of North and South Rossmore Avenue on the east.About Our Neighborhood Neighboring communities are central Hollywood to the northeast, Melrose to the northwest, Citrus Square and La Brea–Hancock to the west, Brookside to the southwest, Fremont Place to the southeast, and Larchmont and Windsor Square to the east.Map, Greater Wilshire Neighborhood Council. As of 2007, the Hancock Park homeowners association counted about 1,200 homes within the boundaries of Melrose Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard, and both sides of Highland and Rossmore avenues. The Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, which defines neighborhoods by merging together neighboring census tracts, has Hancock Park flanked by Hollywood to the north, Larchmont and Windsor Square to the east, Koreatown to the southeast, Mid-Wilshire to the south and southwest and Fairfax to the west.\\"Central L.A.\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A. street boundaries are Melrose Avenue on the north, Arden Boulevard on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south and La Brea Avenue on the west—thus including the neighborhoods of Citrus Square, La Brea–Hancock, and a portion of Melrose, which are not served by the Hancock Park Homeowners Association. The neighborhood surrounds the grounds of the Wilshire Country Club.\\"Hancock Park\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles TimesThomas Guide, Los Angeles County, 2004, pages 593 and 633 Demographics El Royale Apts. in Hancock Park The 2000 U.S. census counted 9,804 residents in the 1.59-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 6,459 people per square mile, including the expanse of the Wilshire Country Club. That figure gave Hancock Park one of the lowest densities in Los Angeles. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 10,671. The median age for residents was 37, considered old when compared with the city as a whole; the percentages of residents aged 35 and above were among the county's highest. Hancock Park was moderately diverse ethnically. The breakdown was whites, 70.7%; Asians, 13.1%; Latinos, 8.5%; blacks, 3.8%, and others, 3.9%. Korea and the Philippines were the most common places of birth for the 26.3% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered low compared to rest of the city. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $85,277, a relatively high figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $125,000 or more. The average household size of 2.1 people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 52.7% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners 47.3%. The percentages of never-married men and women, 41.3% and 34.4%, respectively, were among the county's highest. The 2000 census found 203 families headed by single parents, a low rate for both the city and the county.

As was common for monks in this time, he travelled from place to place, living in a succession of monasteries. Buddhist monks had been forced to keep a low profile since General Yi Seonggye had been forced to eject Buddhism from its state of total permeation of government in order to gain the support of Neo-Confucian scholar-officials to consolidate his position against his Buddhist political opponents when he overthrew Gongyang of Goryeo in 1392 to become King Taejo of Joseon. Before ever having tested his hand as a military commander, Hyujeong was a first-rate Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is probably his Seongagwigam (), a guide to Seon practice studied by Korean monks even today. Like most monks of the Joseon period, Hyujeong had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, though, he wandered through the mountain monasteries. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Seon school by Myeongjong of Joseon, who was sympathetic towards Buddhism. He soon resigned from this responsibility, though, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Seon studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea. At the beginning of the 1590s, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, after stabilising Sengoku-era Japan under his rule, made preparations for a large-scale invasion of Joseon. Joseon was unaware and was unprepared for the Japanese invasion. In 1592, after Japan’s request for aid conquering Ming China was rebuffed, approximately 200,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Joseon, and the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) began. At the beginning of the first invasion, Seonjo of Joseon fled the capital, leaving a weak, poorly trained army to defend the country. In desperation he called on Hyujeong to organise monks into guerilla units. Even at 73 years of age he managed to recruit and deploy some 5,000 of these warrior monks, who enjoyed some instrumental successes. At first, the government armies of Joseon suffered repeated defeats, and the Japanese armies marched north up to Pyongyang and Hamgyong Province. At sea, however, the Joseon navy, under the command of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, enjoyed successive victories. Throughout the country, loyal volunteer armies formed and fought against the Japanese together with the warrior monks and the government armies of Joseon. The presence of Hyujeong's monk army, operating out of the Heungguksa deep in the mountain of Yeongchwisan, was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders in 1593 and again in 1598. The Taekwon-Do pattern Seo- San is named in his honor. References 韓國佛敎人名辭典(1993). Lee, Jeong(ed.) (The Korean Buddhist Biographical Dictionary,) Bulgyosidaesa(publisher), p. 366\\\\.

This is also known as terminology science. Terms are words and compound words or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts are given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or subject. Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from lexicography, as it involves the study of concepts, conceptual systems and their labels (terms), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings. Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the \\"labelling or designating of concepts\\" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, \\"multilingual terminology\\" and \\"bilingual terminology\\"), or may have an interdisciplinarity focus on the use of terms in different fields. Overview The discipline of terminology consists primarily of the following aspects: * analyzing the concepts and concept structures used in a field or domain of activity * identifying the terms assigned to the concepts * in the case of bilingual or multilingual terminology, establishing correspondences between terms in the various languages * compiling the terminology on paper or in databases * managing terminology databases * creating new terms, as required. Types of terminology A distinction is made between two types of terminology work: * Ad hoc work on terminology, which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms * Systematic collection of terminology, which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured ontology of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships. Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the translation profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem. Terminology as a discipline A terminologist intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and standardization institutes compile their own glossaries. This provides the consistency needed in the various areas--fields and branches, movements and specialties--to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline's traditional and doctrinal literature. Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and social epistemology. Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. Translators research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a Terminology section. Terminological theories Terminological theories include general theory of terminology, socioterminology, communicative theory of terminology, sociocognitive terminology, and frame-based terminology.

The term came into use in the 1880s, when there were about 25,000 Jews living across the Land of Israel, then comprising the southern part of Ottoman Syria, and continued to be used until 1948, by which time there were some 630,000 Jews there.Ethnicity, Religion and Class in Israeli Society, Eliezer Ben-Rafael and Stephen Sharo, Cambridge University Press, pages 26–27 The term is used in Hebrew even nowadays to denote the pre-1948 Jewish residents in the Land of Israel. A distinction is sometimes drawn between the Old Yishuv and the New Yishuv. The Old Yishuv refers to all the Jews living there before the first aliyah (immigration wave) of 1882 by the Zionist movement. The Old Yishuv residents were religious Jews, living mainly in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias and Hebron. Smaller communities were in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki'in, Acre, Nablus, Shfaram and until 1779[citation needed] also in Gaza. In the final centuries before modern Zionism, a large part of the Old Yishuv spent their time studying the Torah and lived off charity (halukka), donated by Jews in the Diaspora.From Empire To Empire: Jerusalem Between Ottoman and British Rule, Abigail Jacobson, Syracuse University Press, page 51 The New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s, to the founders of the Moshava of Petah Tikva and the First Aliyah of 1882, followed by the founding of neighbourhoods and villages until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.  Ottoman rule  Kotel, 1870s  Old Yishuv  The Old Yishuv were the Jewish communities of southern Ottoman Syria in the Ottoman Empire,Destruction and Reconstruction – the Jewish Quarter. For the 400 years of Ottoman rule in Jerusalem there was a Jewish community living inside the walls of the Old City. The community, which we call the “Old Yishuv,” was not a single, cohesive unit. Until the early 19th century the community consisted mainly of Sephardic Jews, descendants of the exiles from Spain with Ashkenazi (Hassidic and Mitnagdim) and Mizrahi Jews in minority representation. Beginning with the mid-18th century Ashkenazi Jews begin to settle in the city, but not for extended periods. up to the onset of Zionist aliyah and the consolidation of the New Yishuv by the end of World War I in 1918 and the establishment of the British Mandate of Palestine. The Old Yishuv had continuously resided in or had come to Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel) in the earlier centuries and were largely ultra-orthodox Jews dependent on external donations (Halukka) for living, as opposed to the later Zionist aliyah and the New Yishuv, who more socialist and secular emphasizing labor and self-sufficiency. The Old Yishuv developed after a period of severe decline in Jewish communities of the Southern Levant during the early Middle Ages, and was composed of three clusters. The oldest group consisted of the Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jewish communities in Galilee and the Judeo-Arabic speaking Musta'arabi Jews who settled in Eretz Yisrael in the Ottoman and late Mamluk period. A second group was composed of Ashkenazi and Hassidic Jews who had emigrated from Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. A third wave was constituted by Yishuv members who arrived in the late 19th century.Gudrun Krämer, A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel, Princeton University Press, 2008 p.104 The Old Yishuv was thus generally divided into two independent communities – the Sephardi Jews (including Musta'arabim), mainly constituting the remains of Jewish communities of Galilee and the Four Holy Cities of Judaism, which had flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; and the Ashkenazi Jews, whose immigration from Europe was primarily since the 18th century.Abraham P. Bloch, One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries for every day of the year, KTAV Publishing House, 1987, , M1 p. 278. The Old Yishuv term was coined by members of the 'New Yishuv' in the late 19th century to distinguish themselves from the economically dependent and generally earlier Jewish communities, who mainly resided in the four holy cities, and unlike the New Yishuv, had not embraced land ownership and agriculture. Apart from the Old Yishuv centres in the four holy cities of Judaism, namely Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed, smaller communities also existed in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki'in, Acre, Nablus and Shfaram. Petah Tikva, although established in 1878 by the Old Yishuv, nevertheless was also supported by the arriving Zionists. Rishon LeZion, the first settlement founded by the Hovevei Zion in 1882, could be considered the true beginning of the New Yishuv.  Beginning of modern Aliyah  The Ottoman government was not supportive of the new settlers from the First and Second Aliyah, as the Ottoman government officially restricted Jewish immigration. The Yishuv relied on money from abroad to support their settlements. In 1908 the Zionist Organization founded the Palestine Office, under Arthur Ruppin, for land acquisition, agricultural settlement and training,Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, p153 and later for urban expansion. The first Hebrew high schools were opened in Palestine as well as the Technion, the first institution for higher learning. Hashomer, a Zionist self-defence group, was created to protect the Jewish settlements. Labor organizations were created along with health and cultural services, all later coordinated by the Jewish National Council. By 1914, the old Yishuv was a minority and the new Yishuv began to express itself and its Zionist goals. The Zionist movement tried to find work for the new immigrants who arrived in the Second Aliyah. However, most were middle class and were not physically fit or knowledgeable in agricultural work. The Jewish plantation owners had previously hired Arab workers who accepted low wages and were very familiar with agriculture. The leaders of the Zionist movement insisted that plantation owners (those who arrived in the First Aliyah) only hire Jewish workers and grant higher wages. The conquest of labor was a major Zionist goal. However, this caused some turmoil in the Yishuv for there were those who felt that they were discriminating against the Arabs just as they had been discriminated against in Russia. The Arabs became bitter from the discrimination despite the small number of Arabs that were affected by this. The First Aliyah was the very beginning of the creation of the New Yishuv. More than 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. The immigrants were inspired by the notion of creating a national home for Jews. Most of the Jewish immigrants came from Russia, escaping the pogroms, while some arrived from Yemen. Many of the immigrants were affiliated with Hovevei Zion. Hovevei Tzion purchased land from Arabs and other Ottoman subjects and created various settlements such as Yesud HaMa'ala, Rosh Pinna, Gedera, Rishon LeZion, Nes Tziona and Rechovot. These agricultural settlements were supported by philanthropists from abroad, chiefly Edmond James de Rothschild.Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. Jewish Virtual Library. and Alphonse James de Rothschild.Baron Edmond De Rothschild 86. August 20, 1931 JTA Archive, The Global Jewish News Source Eliezer Ben- Yehuda also immigrated during the first Aliyah. Ben-Yehuda took it upon himself to revive the Hebrew language, and along with Nissim Bechar started a school for teaching Hebrew, later on founding the first Hebrew newspaper. During the Second Aliyah, between 1903 and 1914, there were 35,000 new immigrants, primarily from Russia. During World War I, the conditions for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire worsened. All those Jews who were of an enemy nationality were exiled and others were drafted into the Ottoman army. Many of those exiled fled to Egypt and the United States. Those who remained in the Ottoman ruled Palestine faced hard economic times. There was disagreement whether to support the British or the Turks. A clandestine group, Nili, was established to pass information to the British in the hope of defeating the Ottomans and ending their rule over Palestine. The purpose and members of the Nili were discovered. All involved were executed by the Ottomans except its founder, Aaron Aaronsohn, who escaped to Egypt. During World War I, the Jewish population in Palestine diminished by a third due to deportations, immigration, economic trouble and disease. During World War I, there were two British battalions of Jews, called the Zion Mule Corps, who were to fight on the front of Palestine. They helped in the British capture of Ottoman Syria (including Palestine), leading to the Turkish surrender. The members of the Zion Mule Corps later made up the Yishuv's defence groups that would fight against the British.  During the British Mandate  World War I ended, along with the Ottoman Empire. Britain gained control of Palestine through the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which partitioned Ottoman Syria into French-ruled Syria and Lebanon and British-controlled Palestine and Transjordan. There was a hope that British control would allow the creation of a Jewish national homeland as promised in the Balfour Declaration. The British Mandate was formalized in 1922 based on the Balfour Declaration. The British were supposed to help the Jews build a national home and promote the creation of self-governing institutions. The mandate provided for an agency in which the Jews could represent Jewish interests and promote Jewish immigration. It was called the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and was only created ten years later, serving as the de facto government of the Yishuv. Along with a Jewish agency there was to be a general self-governing institution created in Palestine including Jews and Arabs. The Yishuv feared such an institution due to the Arab majority, but none was created in the end due to the Arabs' refusal to cooperate with the Jews or British. The optimism that existed in the beginning of the British mandate soon diminished due to continued hardships in the Yishuv. Most of the European funds that supported the Jewish settlements before World War I ended. The Arabs, opposed to the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate, instigated riots against the Jews. The British limited immigration through yearly quotas; only those who received \\"certificates\\" could make Aliyah.  Women's rights  Many women who immigrated to Israel came out of national Zionist motives who wanted the same rights as men and wanted to rebuild their land. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. The constituent assembly was voted upon in 1920 and 14 women were elected out of the three hundred and fourteen delegates. As well as the increase in the number of women filling public positions, the rate of women participating in the labor force increased steadily during the British mandate period in the Yishuv. With that being said, the employment opportunities at the beginning of the mandate period were very low and women were mainly limited to typical female occupations because the only other option would be to work in construction, which only pioneer women committed to as part of their feminist-nationalist outlook because those roles were considered inappropriate for women. Women were consistently more unemployed when compared to their male counterparts, regardless of cyclical fluctuations.The wages for working women were constantly lower than the wages of their male counterparts, and throughout the Yishuv period, the average wage for women were 50 to 70 percent of male's wage. Not only were non-religious women fighting for equality, but so were religious women. Female religious Zionists were faced with double the amount of barriers of non-religious female Zionists because they were rejected from religious society because of their gender and they were rejected from secular society because of their religiosity In 1926 the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming \\"equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv – civil, political, and economic.\\" In 1935, the establishment of the national organization of religious pioneer women emerged. Its main goal was to improve the material status and spiritual welfare of the religious women workers and gain admittance to the Ha-Po'el ha-Mizrachi. This organization grew from eight-hundred members in 1935 to six-thousand members in 1948. Women gained rights with the establishment of the religious kibbutz movement by participating in Torah studies with men and by taking part in the co-ed activities that the Kibbutz offered.  History  There were Arab riots throughout 1920–21 in opposition to the Balfour Declaration. The Arabs tried to show the British the instability of Palestine and that a Jewish homeland was ungovernable. Riots increased in 1929 after the fourth Aliyah – 133 Jews were killed by Arab mobs during the 1929 riots. The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigration and land purchases were displacing them and taking their jobs away. These riots were also instigated by false rumours that the Jews were planning on building a synagogue near the Western Wall. These riots led to the evacuation of Hebron's indigenous – largely non-Zionist – Jewish population. = White papers = The British responded to the Arab riots with the White Paper of 1939. It was based on the Hope Simpson Report, which stated that Palestine after economic development could support only 20,000 more immigrant families without infringing on the Arab population's placement and employment. It therefore attempted to curtail immigration to Palestine. Upon Jewish criticism of this policy, it was clarified that immigration would not be stopped entirely but would be restricted by quotas. There were many Jewish immigrants that arrived throughout the 1930s in the fifth Aliyah, despite the immigration quotas. Many who came were fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe. Those that came from Nazi Germany were able to come because of the Haavara Agreement. This allowed Jews to escape from Germany to Palestine in return for paying a ransom to the Reich. By then, the Yishuv had a population of about 400,000. = The 1936–39 Arab revolt = The increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants and land purchases, unchallenged by the British Mandate, angered and radicalized many Arabs. In April 1936, Arabs attacked a Jewish bus, leading to a series of incidents that escalated into a major Arab rebellion. The British were caught by surprise and were unable to prevent the deaths of thousands of Arabs and hundreds of Jews in the revolt. The Haganah protected the Yishuv's settlements while the Irgun, a more radical group, attacked Arab settlements. A coalition of recently formed Arab political parties formed the Arab Higher Committee (AHC). It declared a national strike in support of three basic demands: cessation of Jewish immigration, an end to all further land sales to the Jews, and the establishment of an Arab national government. The Arabs threatened that if the British didn't comply with their demands then they would join the adversaries of the British. This concerned the British for World War II was just beginning and they knew they would need Middle Eastern oil. The British worked with their Arab allies to bring a halt to the AHC riots. The Peel Commission reported, in July 1937, that the British obligations to the Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and the mandate unworkable. It suggested the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the British mandate governing over Nazareth, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem along with a corridor from Jerusalem to the coast. The Jews accepted the general principle of a partition while the Arabs refused any partition plan. The British government sent a technical team called the Woodhead Commission to detail the plan. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to \\"political, administrative and financial difficulties\\".Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. The Arab Revolt broke out again in the autumn of 1937. The British ended the revolt using harsh measures, deporting many Palestinian Arab leaders and shutting down the AHC. In the Yishuv, the Arab Revolt reinforced the already firm belief in the need for a strong Jewish defence network. Finally, the Arab agricultural boycott that began in 1936 forced the Jewish economy into even greater self-sufficiency. The Haganah during this period changed from being a small clandestine militia to a large military force. The British security forces at this time cooperated with the Haganah to respond to the Arabs. In 1938 Captain Orde Wingate created the Special Night Squads (SNS) that were composed mostly of Haganah members. SNS used the element of surprise in night raids to protect the Jewish settlements and attack the Arabs. = White Paper of 1939 = The British suppressed the Arab revolt and published the White Paper of 1939. It allowed for a total of only 75,000 Jews to enter Palestine over a five-year period. During this time the Yishuv entered a period of relative peace with the Arabs. = During World War II = The Yishuv wanted to help their fellow Jews, who were being murdered by the Nazis in Europe. Many Jews from Europe were prevented from fleeing to Mandatory Palestine by strict immigration quotas established by the white papers. The Jewish Agency organized illegal immigration from 1939 through 1942 with the help of the Haganah. Those who arrived illegally to Israel during this time were part of the Aliyah Bet. This was a dangerous operation, for these illegal immigrants arrived by boat and had to be careful not to be caught by the British or Nazis. Many of these ships sank or were caught, such as the Patria, Struma and . Compared with the number of attempts, few ships actually arrived successfully to Mandatory Palestine, but tens of thousands of Jews were saved by the illegal immigration. The Yishuv also wanted to help on the front lines in Europe to try to save Jews from the Nazi atrocities. In 1942 the Jewish agency turned to the British to offer their assistance by sending Jewish volunteers to Europe as emissaries of the Yishuv to organize local resistance and rescue operations among the Jewish communities. The British accepted the proposal but on a much smaller scale than the Jewish agency had hoped. They only took Jewish parachutists who were recent immigrants from certain targeted countries that they wanted to infiltrate. The British Special Forces and military intelligence both consented to the volunteers' dual role as British agents and Jewish emissaries. 110 Yishuv members were trained; however only 32 were deployed. Many of them succeeded in helping the POWs and uprisings in the Jewish communities, while others were caught. There were two periods during the war when the Yishuv faced a direct threat from Nazi forces. The first occurred following Germany's conquest of France in 1940, since the pro-Nazi Vichy regime controlled the northern Levant, from which an invasion of Palestine could take place. However, in 1941 British forces successfully fought Vichy forces for control of Syria and Lebanon, thus removing the threat of invasion from the north, at least as long as German armies in Eastern Europe could be held back by the Red Army and thus unable to easily advance towards the Near East from the north. In 1942 however, as Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps swept across North Africa with the intent of capturing the Suez Canal, the likelihood of a German invasion from the south became a real possibility, causing great anxiety in the Yishuv and prompting plans to be drawn for its defense. Knowing that Nazi control of Palestine meant certain annihilation of the Yishuv, a debate raged among Yishuv leadership whether, in the event Nazi occupation was to take place, the inhabitants of the Yishuv should evacuate together with British forces eastwards towards British possessions in Iraq and India or undertake a Masada-like last stand in Palestine, likely doing so in a fortified zone to be hastily constructed around the Carmel Mountains. This military operation was officially named Palestine Final Fortress. Fortunately for the Yishuv, the advance of German forces eastwards in Egypt was halted during the Second Battle of El Alamein, thus lifting the threat of invasion from the south. The anxious time leading to the Nazi loss at El Alamein became known as the 200 days of dread.  The Biltmore declaration  Despite the reports of Nazi atrocities and the desperation of Jews needing a safe haven the British kept the gates of Palestine almost closed to Jewish immigration. The Zionist leaders met at the Biltmore Hotel in New York in May 1942 and called for unrestricted Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth. = Mandatory Palestine post World War II = Hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors were being held in Displaced Persons Camp (DP Camps) aching to go to Mandatory Palestine. The British received much international pressure, specifically from U.S. president Harry Truman, to change their policy on immigration. Despite Britain's dependence on American economic aid, the British refused, claiming that they were experiencing too much resistance from the Arabs and Jews already in Palestine and feared what would happen if more were allowed to enter. The refusal to remove the white paper policy angered and radicalized the Yishuv. The Yishuv's militia groups set out to sabotage the British infrastructure in Palestine and continue in their illegal immigration efforts. In 1946, the British responded to the Yishuv's efforts and began a two-week search for Jews suspected of anti-British activities, arresting many of the Haganah's leaders. While the British were busy looking for the Haganah, the Irgun and Lehi carried out attacks on British forces. The most famous of their attacks was on the King David Hotel, the site of the British military command and the British Criminal Investigation Division. This location was chosen because a few weeks before a large quantity of documents was confiscated from the Haganah and brought there. Despite being warned by the Yishuv and told to evacuate the building the British officials decided not to cave in to the pressure. The Yishuv attacked anyway, resulting in 91 deaths, 28 of who were British and 17 who were Palestinian Jews. By 1947 the British had 100,000 troops in Palestine trying to maintain order and protect themselves. The British mandate was a major expense to the Exchequer, forcing them to present the Palestine problem to the United Nations on May 15, 1947. The United Nations proposed a partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into 2 states—Arab and Jewish (UN Resolution 181). The Jews accepted it, while the Arabs stated that they would do everything in their power to prevent it. The AHC, determined to prevent Resolution 181 from coming into effect, began to attack and besiege the Jews. The British sided with the Arabs in an attempt to prevent the Yishuv from arming themselves. Jerusalem was held under a siege with no access to weapons, food or water. The Provisional Government seemed helpless until it received a large shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia. The Haganah started fighting offensively from April through May. The Haganah mounted a full-scale military plan, Operation Nachson. After much fighting and the crucial construction of a new road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the siege of Jerusalem was broken, allowing supplies to be brought into the city. This operation's success helped Harry S. Truman recognize that the Jews would be able to protect themselves. The United States decided therefore, it would support the establishment of a Jewish state. On May 14, 1948 the Jews proclaimed the independent state of Israel and the British withdrew from Palestine.  Evacuations and expulsions of Jews under the British Mandate  The 1920 Nabi Musa riots left four Arabs and five Jews killed, with 216 Jews and 23 Arabs wounded. The majority of the victims were members of the old Yishuv. About 300 Jews from the Old City were evacuated following the riots., pp. 127–144. During the Jaffa riots in 1921, thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had previously been lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food and services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city.

During the Arab revolt of 1936–1939, the Jewish residents of Akko were ousted from the city by local Arab residents. The same fate was forced on the ancient Jewish community of Peki'in.

Karelia (Finnish: Karjala, Swedish: Karelen) is a historical province of Finland which Finland partly ceded to Russia after the Winter War of 1939–40. The Finnish Karelians include the present-day inhabitants of North and South Karelia and the still-surviving evacuees from the ceded territories. Present-day Finnish Karelia has 315,000 inhabitants. The more than 400,000 evacuees from the ceded territories re- settled in various parts of Finland. Finnish Karelia historically came under western influence, religiously and politically, and was separate from East Karelia, which was dominated by Novgorod and its successor states from the Middle Ages onwards. History Historical Finnish Karelia (territory in modern-day Finland shown as dark blue, territory in modern-day Russia shown as lighter blue). Drawing of Karelian Iron Age sword hilts by Theodor Schwindt made in 1893, which he had excavated earlier in Käkisalmi. First indications of human settlement in Karelia are from the Mesolithic period. The oldest find from the area is the over 9000 years old Antrea Net which is a fishing net of willow bast. The number of finds from the area is lower towards the end of the Stone Age. Archeological finds from Karelia are relatively rare between the years 400–800. From the Merovingian period onwards finds from Karelia display a distinct features of West Finnish influences which has been interpreted to result at least partly from a colonisation. At least 50 sites of Iron Age settlements and 40 hillforts are known from Karelia. According to archeological record and historical data most of the hillforts in Karelia were erected between 1100 and 1323. Particular Karelian culture including axes, brooches and ornamental culture flourished approximately between the years 1000–1400. The River Kymi formed a boundary between the eastern and western cultural spheres by the beginning of the Bronze Age at the latest and is also said to be the boundary between the Häme Finns and the Karelians during the Middle Ages. The 15th and 16th centuries saw the River Kymi become a more official border between the Häme Finns and the Karelians, with Naulasaari (located in Mäntyharju) serving as the meeting point of the borders between the Häme Finns, Savonians, and Karelians. During the 12th and 13th century, Karelians fought against Swedes and other Finnic tribes situated in western Finland, such as Tavastians and Finns proper. Karelians were listed as Novgorodian allies in the mid-12th century in Russian Chronicles. Historical records describe Karelians pillaging Sigtuna in Sweden in 1187 and making another expedition in 1257 which lead Pope Alexander IV to call out a crusade against Karelians at the request of Valdemar, the king of Sweden. The Third Swedish crusade, led by the marshal Torgils Knutsson took place between 1293 and 1295. As a result of the crusade the western parts of Karelia fell under Swedish rule and the building of the Castle of Viborg on the site of destroyed Karelian fort started. According to Eric Chronicles invading Swedes conquered 14 hundreds from Karelians during the crusade. Hostilities between Novgorod and the kingdom of Sweden continued in 1300 when a Swedish force attacked the mouth of the River Neva and built a fort near the current location of Saint Petersburg. The fort was destroyed the following year by the Novgorodians. Indecisive fighting in 1321 and 1322 led to negotiations and peace by the Treaty of Nöteborg which for the first time decided the border between Sweden and Novgorod. Sweden got territory around Viborg, the western Karelian Isthmus and South Karelia; and Novgorod got the eastern Karelian Isthmus, Ingria, Ladoga Karelia, North Karelia and East Karelia. In 1617, Sweden seized Kexholm County (eastern Karelian Isthmus, Ladoga Karelia, and North Karelia) from Russia. In 1634 Savonia and old Swedish Karelia were incorporated in the Viborg and Nyslott County. After the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 eastern parts of the Viborg and Nyslott County and the Kexholm County were ceded to Russia. The rest of these counties were incorporated into the Kymmenegård and Nyslott County. The southeastern part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo of 1743. After the conquest in 1809 of the rest of Finland, Russia's 18th century gains, called \\"Old Finland\\", were in 1812 joined to the Grand Duchy of Finland as a gesture of good will (see Viipuri Province). A large part of Finnish Karelia was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union in 1940 after the Soviet aggression known as the Winter War, when the new border was established close to that of 1721. During the Continuation War of 1941–44, most of the ceded area was liberated by Finnish troops, but in 1944 was occupied again by the Red Army. After the war, the remains of the Province of Viipuri were made into the Province of Kymi. In 1997 the province was incorporated within the province of Southern Finland. Western Karelia, as a historical Province of Sweden, was religiously and politically distinct from the eastern parts that were under the Russian Orthodox Church. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the long-silenced debate over returning Karelia from Russia to Finland resurfaced in Finland. Inhabitants Drawing of a Karelian Iron Age knife with a sheath made by Theodor Schvindt in 1893 illustrating the one he excavated in Käkisalmi, Karelia. The inhabitants of Karelian provinces historically belonging to Finland are known as Karelians. Confusingly, the same name is used also of a closely related but distinct ethnic group living mostly in East Karelia, earlier also in some of the territories Finland ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. The Finnish Karelians include the present-day inhabitants of North and South Karelia and the still- surviving evacuees from the ceded territories. Present Finnish Karelia has 315,000 inhabitants. The more than 400,000 evacuees from the ceded territories were re-settled in various parts of Finland. (The displacement of the Finnish Karelians in 1940–44 as a result of the Winter War and the Continuation War, according to official Finnish statistics resulted the total number of 415,000 evacuees from the territories ceded to the Soviet Union while 5.000 Finnish Karelians remained in the Soviet controlled territory.) Finnish Karelians are considered as a regional and cultural sub-group of the ethnic Finns. They speak the eastern or south-eastern dialects of the Finnish language. The Finnish Karelians include also people of East Karelian origin or roots, but these have been linguistically and ethnically assimilated with closely related Finns after the Second World War. However, the Orthodox religion is still maintained by many Finnish Karelians with East Karelian background, especially in North Karelia; the majority of the Finnish Karelians are predominantly Lutheran. Culture 211x211px The traditional culture of \\"Ladoga-Karelia\\", or Finnish Karelia according to the pre-Winter War borders, was by and large similar to that of Eastern Karelia, or Russian Karelia. Karelians live, and did even more so before Stalinism and the Great Purges, also in vast areas east of Finland (in Eastern Karelia, not marked on the map above), where folklore, language and architecture during the 19th century was in the center of the Finns' interest (see Karelianism), representing a \\"purer\\" Finnish culture than that of Southern and Western Finland, which had been for thousands of years in more contact with (or \\"contaminated by\\") Germanic and Scandinavian culture, of which the Kalevala and Finnish Art Nouveau are expressions. The dialect spoken in the South Karelian Region of Finland is part of the South Eastern dialects of the Finnish language. The dialect spoken in the Karelian Isthmus before World War II and the Ingrian language are also part of this dialect group. The Karelian language, spoken in East Karelia, is very closely related to the Finnish language.1.7 Kaakkoismurteiden alue The dialect that is spoken in North Karelia is considered to be one of the Savonian dialects.1.6 Savolaismurteiden alue People * Martti Ahtisaari * Anna Easteden * Ansa Ikonen * Aarne Juutilainen * Eino Luukkanen * Veijo Meri * Masa Niemi * Aaro Pajari * Lauri Törni, born in Viipuri, Törni was a soldier and winner of the Mannerheim Cross during the Continuation War, who later served with the German and American armies. * Riitta Uosukainen * Tatu Vanhanen * Johannes Virolainen See also List of Karelians Heraldry The arms is crowned by a ducal coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish count's coronet.

The event occurred on March 1, 1919, hence the movement's name, literally meaning \\"Three-One Movement\\" or \\"March First Movement\\" in Korean. It is also sometimes referred to as the Man-se Demonstrations (). Background The Samil Movement arose in reaction to the repressive nature of colonial occupation under the de facto military rule of the Japanese Empire following 1910, and was inspired by the \\"Fourteen Points\\" outlining the right of national \\"self-determination\\", which was proclaimed by President Woodrow Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1918. After hearing news of Wilson's speech, Korean students studying in Tokyo published a statement demanding freedom from colonial rule. Former Emperor Gojong died on January 21, 1919. There was widespread suspicion that he had been poisoned, which was credible since previous attempts (the \\"coffee plot\\") were well-known, and other leaders had been assassinated by Japanese agents. Events in Korea The March 1st Movement monument. Japanese barricade at the entrance of Pagoda Park in Seoul to prevent the peaceful demonstration. A Korean house burnt by Japanese. At 2 p.m. on March 1, 1919, 33 activists who formed the core of the Samil Movement convened at Taehwagwan Restaurant in Seoul; they read out loud the Korean Declaration of Independence, which had been drawn up by historian Choe Nam-seon. The activists initially planned to assemble at Tapgol Park in downtown Seoul, but chose a more private location out of fear that the gathering might turn into a riot. The leaders of the movement signed the document and sent a copy to the Governor General. The movement leaders telephoned the central police station to inform them of their actions and were publicly arrested afterwards. Before the formal declaration, Korea also published and broadcast the following complaints, in order to be heard by the Japanese people through papers and media: * Discrimination by the government when employing Koreans versus Japanese people; they claimed that no Koreans held important positions in the government. * A disparity in the quality of education being offered to Korean and Japanese people. * Mistreatment and open disregard of Koreans by the Japanese occupiers. * Political officials, both Korean and Japanese, were arrogant. * No special treatment for the Korean upper class or scholars. * The administrative processes were too complicated and new laws were passed too frequently for the general public to follow. * Too much forced labor that was not desired by the public. * Taxes were too heavy and the Korean people were paying more than before, while getting the same amount of services. * Land continued to be confiscated by the Japanese people for personal reasons. * Korean village teachers were being forced out of their jobs because the Japanese were trying to suppress Korean culture and teachings. * Korea's resources and labor had been exploited for the benefit for the Japanese. They argued that while Koreans were working towards development, they did not reap the benefits of their own work. These grievances were highly influenced by Wilson's declaration of the principle of self determination as outlined in his \\"Fourteen Points\\" speech. Massive crowds assembled in Pagoda Park to hear a student, Chung Jae-yong, read the declaration publicly. Afterwards, the gathering formed into a peaceable procession, which the Japanese military police attempted to suppress. Special delegates associated with the movement also read copies of the independence proclamation from appointed places throughout the country at 2 p.m. on that same day. As the processions continued to grow, the Japanese local and military police could not control the crowds. The panicked Japanese officials called in military forces to quell the crowds, including the naval forces. As the public protests continued to grow, the suppression turned to violence, resulting in Japanese massacres of Koreans and other atrocities. Approximately 2,000,000 Koreans had participated in the more than 1,500 demonstrations. Several thousand were massacred by the Japanese police force and army.March First Movement - Britannica Online Encyclopedia The frequently cited The Bloody History of the Korean Independence Movement () by Park Eun-sik reported 7,509 people killed, 15,849 wounded, and 46,303 arrested. From March 1 to April 11, Japanese officials reported 553 people killed, and more than 12,000 arrested. They said that 8 policemen and military were killed, and 158 wounded. As punishment, some of the arrested demonstrators were executed in public. In June 1920, the Battle of Bongo-dong was the first large-scale battle between the Korean independence militias and the Japanese Army in Manchuria. In October 1920, the Battle of Cheongsanri broke out in Manchuria between exiled Korean independence fighters and the Japanese Army. Effects March 1st Movement celebrations in Seoul, 2013 The March 1st Movement provided a catalyst for the Korean Independence Movement, which was crucial to the spread of Korea's independence movement to other local governments, including Hoengseong. Given the ensuing suppression and hunting down of activists by the Japanese, many Korean leaders went into exile in Manchuria, Shanghai and other parts of China, where they continued their activities. The Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in April 1919. It also influenced the growth of nonviolent resistance in India and many other countries. The Korean Liberation Army was subsequently formed and allowed to operate in China by the Nationalist Government of China. During this period, there was a mobilization of Catholic and Protestant activists in Korea, with activism encouraged among the diaspora in the U.S., China, and Russia. The Japanese government reacted to the March 1st Movement by heightening its suppression of dissent and dismissing the Movement as the \\"Chosun Manse Violent Public Disorder Incident\\" (조선 공공 만세 폭력 사건). Governor-General Hasegawa Yoshimichi accepted responsibility for the loss of control (although most of the repressive measures leading to the uprising had been put into place by his predecessors); he was replaced by Saito Makoto. The military police were replaced by a civilian force. Limited press freedom was permitted under what was termed the 'cultural policy'. Many of these lenient policies were reversed during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. On May 24, 1949, South Korea designated March 1st as a national holiday. General Choe Hong-hui dedicated the first of the three patterns (삼일 틀 – Sam-il teul) trained by III- degree black belts of taekwon-do to the Sam-il Movement. International reaction=United States and Korea President Woodrow Wilson issued his Fourteen Points in January 1918. The points included… in terms of US relations with Korea, \\"a free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims.\\"Hart-Landsberg, Martin (1998). Korea: Division, Reunification, & U.S. Foreign Policy. Monthly Review Press. p. 30. However, as manifested at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Wilson was not interested in challenging global power relations. Since Japan was one of the victors and Korea was its colony, a discussion of the status of Korea was not undertaken. In April 1919, the US State Department told the ambassador to Japan that \\"the consulate [in Seoul] should be extremely careful not to encourage any belief that the United States will assist the Korean nationalists in carrying out their plans and that it should not do anything which may cause Japanese authorities to suspect [the] American Government sympathizes with the Korean nationalist movement.\\" From April 12 to 14, 1919 the First Korean Congress was convened in Philadelphia by Philip Jaisohn in support of the independence of Korea. Delegation Japan violently suppressed the March First Movement. The United States remained silent. Despite this, the Korean National Association planned a three-man delegation in the United States to attend the Paris Peace Conference and attempt to represent Korea's interests. Dr. Rhee (representing Hawai'i), Rev. Chan Ho Min (representing the West Coast) and Dr. Henry Han Kyung Chung (representing the Midwest) were selected, but they were unable to attend. They encountered visa problems and feared that the delegates may not be allowed to reenter the United States.Chang, Roberta (2003). The Koreans in Hawai'i: A Pictorial History, 1903-2003. University of Hawaii Press, p. 100. A delegation of overseas Koreans, from Japan, China, and Hawai'i, did make it to Paris. Included in this delegation was Kim Kyu-sik (김규식), a representative from the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai. After considerable effort, he managed to arrange passage with members of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference. He traveled on a Chinese passport and under a Chinese name in order to evade the Japanese police. The Chinese were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum, and several top Chinese leaders at the time, including Sun Yat-sen, told U.S. diplomats that the peace conference should take up the question of Korean independence. Beyond that, however, the Chinese, locked in a struggle themselves against the Japanese, could do little for Korea.Manela, Erez (2007). The Wilsonian Moment. Oxford. P. 119-135, 197-213. The United States did not pay substantial attention to these individuals, and the delegation was blocked from official participation as Korea was classified as a Japanese colony.Kim, Seung-Young (2009). American Diplomacy and Strategy Toward Korea and Northeast Asia, 1882-1950 and After. Palgrave Macmillan. P. 64-65.

Many species have stinging hairs and may be called nettles or stinging nettles, although the latter name applies particularly to Urtica dioica. Urtica species are food for the caterpillars of numerous Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), such as the tortrix moth Syricoris lacunana and several Nymphalidae, such as Vanessa atalanta, one of the red admiral butterflies. Description Urtica species grow as annuals or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs. They can reach, depending on the type, location and nutrient status, a height of . The perennial species have underground rhizomes. The green parts have stinging hairs. Their often quadrangular stems are unbranched or branched, erect, ascending or spreading. Most leaves and stalks are arranged across opposite sides of the stem. The leaf blades are elliptic, lanceolate, ovate or circular. The leaf blades usually have three to five, rarely up to seven veins. The leaf margin is usually serrate to more or less coarsely toothed. The often-lasting bracts are free or fused to each other. The cystoliths are extended to more or less rounded. In 1874, while in Collioure (south of France), French botanist Charles Naudin discovered that strong winds during 24 hours made the stinging hairs of Urtica harmless for a whole week.

Uses Fabric woven of nettle fiber was found in burial sites dating to the Bronze Age, and in clothing fabric, sailcloth, fishing nets, and paper by indigenous communities. In New Zealand, U. ferox is classified among poisonous plants, most commonly upon skin contact. Urtica, called kopriva in Bulgarian and Slovenian, and urzica in Romanian, is an ingredient in soups, omelettes, banitsa, purée, and other dishes. In Mazandaran, northern Iran, a soup (Āsh) is made using this plant. Nettles were used in traditional practices to make nettle tea, juice, and ale, and to preserve cheeses, such as in Cornish Yarg. In folklore Nettles have many folklore traditions associated with them. The folklore mainly relates to the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). LiteratureAsian= Milarepa, the great Tibetan ascetic and saint, was reputed to have survived his decades of solitary meditation by subsisting on nothing but nettles; his hair and skin turned green and he lived to the age of 83. =Caribbean= The Caribbean trickster figure Anansi appears in a story about nettles, in which he has to chop down a huge nettle patch in order to win the hand of the king's daughter.Caribbean folktales =European= An old Scots rhyme about the nettle: :\\"Gin ye be for lang kail coo the nettle, stoo the nettle :Gin ye be for lang kail coo the nettle early :Coo it laich, coo it sune, coo it in the month o' June :Stoo it ere it's in the bloom, coo the nettle early :Coo it by the auld wa's, coo it where the sun ne'er fa's :Stoo it when the day daws, coo the nettle early.\\" :(Old Wives Lore for Gardeners, M & B Boland) Coo, cow, and stoo are all Scottish for cut back or crop (although, curiously, another meaning of \\"stoo\\" is to throb or ache), while \\"laich\\" means short or low to the ground.Dictionary of the Scots Language (online) Given the repetition of \\"early,\\" presumably this is advice to harvest nettles first thing in the morning and to cut them back hard [which seems to contradict the advice of the Royal Horticultural Society]. A well- known English rhyme about the stinging nettle is: :Tender-handed, stroke a nettle, :And it stings you for your pains. :Grasp it like a man of mettle, :And it soft as silk remains. In Hans Christian Andersen's fairy-tale \\"The Wild Swans,\\" the princess had to weave coats of nettles to break the spell on her brothers.

He was born in Cheongju, in Chungcheong province. In 1884 he heard of the Donghak religion and its ideals of supporting the nation and comforting the people, and decided to become a member. After joining Donghak, Son entered into a period of profound training that included reading and reciting the Donghak \\"Incantation of Twenty-One Letters\\" thirty thousand times a day. In addition he made straw sandals, which he sold at the market in Cheongju. He is thought to have lived in this manner for roughly three years. After this period, Son Byong-Hi became the student of Choe Si-hyeong, who was the second leader of Donghak, and entered a life of devoted study. In 1894 Choe Si-hyeong led the Donghak Peasant Revolution in protest at the corruption of the Joseon government, and Son Byong-Hi served as a commander. This revolution quickly grew into a resistance struggle against foreign invasion and occupation, in which Japan was the principal target. Choe's forces met defeat in 1895, however, and the revolution was put down at the hands of Japan's superior modern weaponry. After living for some years as a fugitive, Choe Si-hyeong was captured by pursuing government troops in 1898 and executed, although he had foreseen that his time was marked, and on December 24, 1897 he ordained Son Byong-Hi as the 3rd Great Leader of Donghak. In 1898, following the execution of Choe Si-hyeong, Son Byong-Hi sought political asylum in Japan. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, he returned to Korea and established the Jinbohoe (\\"progressive society\\"), a new cultural and reformist movement designed to reverse the declining fortunes of the nation and to create a new society. Through Donghak he conducted a nationwide movement that aimed at social improvement through the renovation of old customs and ways of life. Hundreds of thousands members of Donghak cut their long hair short and initiated the wearing of simple, modest clothing. Non- violent demonstrations for social improvement organised by members of Donghak took place throughout 1904. This coordinated series of activities was known as the Gapjin reform movement. Members of Donghak were severely persecuted by the Japanese government, and so, on December 1, 1905, Son decided to modernise the religion and usher in an era of openness and transparency in order to legitimise it in the eyes of the Japanese. As a result, he officially changed the name of Dong Hak to Cheondogyo (\\"Heavenly Way\\"). The following year, Cheondogyo was established as a modern religious organisation. Its central headquarters were in Seoul. Over the years of Japanese colonial rule since the annexation in 1910, Son Byong-Hi, like all Koreans, longed for freedom and independence. As a result of these years of oppression, he helped to set up a systematic underground anti-Japanese movement throughout 1918 which saw unprecedented cooperation between Cheondogyo, Christians and Buddhists as they united under a common cause. Son's Cheondogyo gave financial support to the whole movement, and he insisted that the independence movement must be popular in nature and non-violent. A Declaration of Independence was prepared and 33 national leaders selected, 15 of which were members of Cheondogyo. Son Byong- Hi was the most prominent of these. The climax came on March 1, 1919 when, during a period of public mourning for the recently deceased Emperor Gojong, the Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed at Pagoda Park in Seoul--this was known as the March 1st Movement, or Samil Movement. This spark ignited the public, who took to the streets and demonstrated, calling for Korean independence. This initiated a nationwide movement in which many people took part, regardless of locality and social status, but the Japanese immediately mobilised their police and army and brutally put down the demonstrations, despite their peaceful nature. More than 7,500 Koreans were killed, nearly 17,000 wounded, and around 47,000 arrested, including Son Byong-Hi. While in prison, Son became ill and was eventually released from custody on sick bail. His illness worsened, however, and in 1922 he died at home in Sangchunwon, just outside the Dongdaemun gate. The Taekwondo pattern Eui-Am was named in honor of Son Byong-Hi after his respectful title of Eui-am Seong-sa.

WoodburyMax A. Woodbury, Inverting modified matrices, Memorandum Rept. 42, Statistical Research Group, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 1950, 4pp Max A. Woodbury, The Stability of Out-Input Matrices. Chicago, Ill., 1949. 5 pp. , says that the inverse of a rank-k correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a rank-k correction to the inverse of the original matrix. Alternative names for this formula are the matrix inversion lemma, Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula or just Woodbury formula. However, the identity appeared in several papers before the Woodbury report. The Woodbury matrix identity is : \\\\left(A + UCV \\\\right)^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1}, where A, U, C and V all denote matrices of the correct (conformable) sizes. Specifically, A is n-by-n, U is n-by-k, C is k-by-k and V is k-by-n. This can be derived using blockwise matrix inversion. While the identity is primarily used on matrices, it holds in a general ring or in an Ab-category.  Discussion  To prove this result, we will start by proving a simpler one. Replacing A and C with the identity matrix I, we obtain another identity which is a bit simpler: : \\\\left(I + UV \\\\right)^{-1} = I - U \\\\left(I + VU \\\\right)^{-1} V. To recover the original equation from this reduced identity, set U = A^{-1}X and V = CY. This identity itself can be viewed as the combination of two simpler identities. We obtain the first identity from : I=(I + P)^{-1}\\\\cdot(I + P)=(I + P)^{-1}+(I + P)^{-1}P, thus, : (I + P)^{-1}=I-(I + P)^{-1}P, and similarly : (I + P)^{-1} = I - P (I + P)^{-1}. The second identity is the so-called push-through identity : (I + UV)^{-1} U = U (I + VU)^{-1} that we obtain from : U(I + VU)=(I + UV)U after multiplying by (I + VU)^{-1} on the right and by (I + UV)^{-1} on the left.  Special cases  When V, U are vectors, the identity reduces to the Sherman–Morrison formula. In the scalar case it (the reduced version) is simply : \\\\frac{1}{1 + uv} = 1 - \\\\frac{uv}{1 + uv}. = Inverse of a sum = If p = q and U = V = Ip is the identity matrix, then : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left({A} + {B}\\\\right)^{-1} &= A^{-1} - A^{-1} (B^{-1} + A^{-1})^{-1} A^{-1}\\\\ &= {A}^{-1} - {A}^{-1}\\\\left({A}{B}^{-1} + {I}\\\\right)^{-1}. \\\\end{align} Continuing with the merging of the terms of the far right-hand side of the above equation results in Hua's identity :\\\\left({A} + {B}\\\\right)^{-1} = {A}^{-1} - \\\\left({A} + {A}{B}^{-1}{A}\\\\right)^{-1}. Another useful form of the same identity is :\\\\left({A} - {B}\\\\right)^{-1} = {A}^{-1} + {A}^{-1}{B}\\\\left({A} - {B}\\\\right)^{-1}, which has a recursive structure that yields :\\\\left({A} - {B}\\\\right)^{-1} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left({A}^{-1}{B}\\\\right)^k{A}^{-1}. This form can be used in perturbative expansions where B is a perturbation of A.  Variations  Binomial inverse theorem = If A, U, B, V are matrices of sizes p×p, p×q, q×q, q×p, respectively, then : \\\\left(A + UBV\\\\right)^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}UB\\\\left(B+BVA^{-1}UB\\\\right)^{-1}BVA^{-1} provided A and B + BVA−1UB are nonsingular. Nonsingularity of the latter requires that B−1 exist since it equals and the rank of the latter cannot exceed the rank of B. Since B is invertible, the two B terms flanking the parenthetical quantity inverse in the right-hand side can be replaced with which results in the original Woodbury identity. A variation for when B is singular and possibly even non-square: :(A + UBV)^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}U(I + BVA^{-1}U)^{-1}BVA^{-1}. Formulas also exist for certain cases in which A is singular.Kurt S. Riedel, \\"A Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury Identity for Rank Augmenting Matrices with Application to Centering\\", SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 13 (1992)659-662, preprint  Derivations = Direct proof  The formula can be proven by checking that (A + UCV) times its alleged inverse on the right side of the Woodbury identity gives the identity matrix: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\left(A + UCV \\\\right) \\\\left[ A^{-1} - A^{-1}U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1} \\\\right] \\\\ ={} & \\\\left{ I - U\\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} \\\\right} + \\\\left{ UCVA^{-1} - UCVA^{-1}U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1} \\\\right} \\\\ ={} & \\\\left{ I + UCVA^{-1} \\\\right} - \\\\left{ U\\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} + UCVA^{-1}U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1} \\\\right} \\\\ ={} & I + UCVA^{-1} - \\\\left(U + UCVA^{-1}U\\\\right) \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} \\\\ ={} & I + UCVA^{-1} - UC \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right) \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} \\\\ ={} & I + UCVA^{-1} - UCVA^{-1} \\\\ ={} & I. \\\\end{align}  Alternative proofs  First consider these useful identities, : \\\\begin{align} U + UCV A^{-1} U &= UC \\\\left(C^{-1} + V A^{-1} U\\\\right) = \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right) A^{-1} U \\\\ \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1} U C &= A^{-1}U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1} U\\\\right) ^{-1} \\\\end{align} Now, : \\\\begin{align} A^{-1} &= \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right) A^{-1}\\\\ &= \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left(I + UCVA^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\ &= \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1} + \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1} UCVA^{-1} \\\\ &= \\\\left(A + UCV\\\\right)^{-1} + A^{-1} U \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U \\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1}. \\\\end{align} Deriving the Woodbury matrix identity is easily done by solving the following block matrix inversion problem : \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & -C^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} I \\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Expanding, we can see that the above reduces to :\\\\begin{cases} AX + UY = I \\\\ VX - C^{-1}Y = 0\\\\end{cases} which is equivalent to (A + UCV)X = I. Eliminating the first equation, we find that X = A^{-1}(I - UY), which can be substituted into the second to find VA^{-1}(I - UY) = C^{-1}Y. Expanding and rearranging, we have VA^{-1} = \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)Y, or \\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} = Y. Finally, we substitute into our AX + UY = I, and we have AX + U\\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} = I. Thus, :(A + UCV)^{-1} = X = A^{-1} - A^{-1}U\\\\left(C^{-1} + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1}. We have derived the Woodbury matrix identity. We start by the matrix :\\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix} By eliminating the entry under the A (given that A is invertible) we get :\\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ -VA^{-1} & I \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ 0 & C - VA^{-1}U \\\\end{bmatrix} Likewise, eliminating the entry above C gives :\\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & -A^{-1}U \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ V & C-VA^{-1}U \\\\end{bmatrix} Now combining the above two, we get : \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ -VA^{-1} & I \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} I & -A^{-1}U \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ 0 & C - VA^{-1}U \\\\end{bmatrix} Moving to the right side gives :\\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ VA^{-1} & I \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ 0 & C - VA^{-1}U \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & A^{-1}U \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} which is the LDU decomposition of the block matrix into an upper triangular, diagonal, and lower triangular matrices. Now inverting both sides gives : \\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & A^{-1}U \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\\\ 0 & C - VA^{-1}U \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ VA^{-1} & I \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} [8pt] &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & -A^{-1}U \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ -VA^{-1} & I \\\\end{bmatrix} [8pt] &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A^{-1} + A^{-1}U\\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} & -A^{-1}U\\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\ -\\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1} & \\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(1)} \\\\end{align} We could equally well have done it the other way (provided that C is invertible) i.e. : \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & UC^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A - UC^{-1}V & 0 \\\\ 0 & C \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ C^{-1}V & I\\\\end{bmatrix} Now again inverting both sides, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & U \\\\ V & C \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ C^{-1}V & I\\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A - UC^{-1}V & 0 \\\\ 0 & C \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & UC^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} [8pt] &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ -C^{-1}V & I\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & C^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I & -UC^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I \\\\end{bmatrix} [8pt] &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1} & -\\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1}UC^{-1} \\\\ -C^{-1}V\\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1} & C^{-1} + C^{-1}V\\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1}UC^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(2)} \\\\end{align} Now comparing elements (1, 1) of the RHS of (1) and (2) above gives the Woodbury formula :\\\\left(A - UC^{-1}V\\\\right)^{-1} = A^{-1} + A^{-1}U\\\\left(C - VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1}VA^{-1}.  Applications  This identity is useful in certain numerical computations where A−1 has already been computed and it is desired to compute (A + UCV)−1. With the inverse of A available, it is only necessary to find the inverse of C−1 + VA−1U in order to obtain the result using the right-hand side of the identity. If C has a much smaller dimension than A, this is more efficient than inverting A + UCV directly. A common case is finding the inverse of a low-rank update A + UCV of A (where U only has a few columns and V only a few rows), or finding an approximation of the inverse of the matrix A + B where the matrix B can be approximated by a low-rank matrix UCV, for example using the singular value decomposition. This is applied, e.g., in the Kalman filter and recursive least squares methods, to replace the parametric solution, requiring inversion of a state vector sized matrix, with a condition equations based solution. In case of the Kalman filter this matrix has the dimensions of the vector of observations, i.e., as small as 1 in case only one new observation is processed at a time. This significantly speeds up the often real time calculations of the filter. In the case when C is the identity matrix I, the matrix I+VA^{-1}U is known in numerical linear algebra and numerical partial differential equations as the capacitance matrix.

The Donghak movement arose as a reaction to seohak (, \\"Western learning\\"), and called for a return to the \\"Way of Heaven\\". While Donghak originated as a reform movement and revival of Confucian teachings, it gradually evolved into a religion known today as Cheondoism in Korea under the third patriarch.  History  Joseon, which patronized Neo-Confucianism as the state ideology, saw an increasing polarization between orthodox Confucian scholars and efforts by other Confucian scholars to revive social ethics and reform society. The increasing presence and pressure from the West created a greater sense of urgency among reformers, and thus Choe Je-u first penned his treatise, Comprehensive Book of Eastern Learning, or Dongkyeong Daejoen (동경대전, 東經大全). This treatise marked the first use of the term \\"Eastern Learning\\" and called for a rejection of God (in the Christian sense), and other aspects of Christian theology. Choe was alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity (, Cheonjugyo; Catholicism), and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democracy, establish human rights and create a paradise on Earth independent of foreign interference. In 1892 the small groups of the Donghak movement were united into a single Peasant Guerrilla Army or Donghak Peasants' Army. The peasants worked in the fields during the day, but during the night, they armed themselves and raided government offices and killed rich landlords, traders, and foreigners. They confiscated their victims' properties for redistribution. Choe Je-u was executed as a criminal by the government. The movement was continued by Choe Si-Hyeong (1829–1898), who systematized its doctrine. He too was executed. In 1898, following the execution of Choe Si-Hyeong, the leader of Donghak, Son Byong-Hi, sought political asylum in Japan. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, he returned to Korea and established the Chinbohoe (\\"progressive society\\"), a new cultural and reformist movement designed to reverse the declining fortunes of the nation and to create a new society. Through Donghak he conducted a nationwide movement that aimed at social improvement through the renovation of old customs and ways of life. Hundreds of thousands of members of Donghak cut their long hair short and initiated the wearing of simple, modest clothing. Non-violent demonstrations for social improvement organized by members of Donghak took place throughout 1904. Under the third patriarch of the Donghak movement, Son Byeong-hui, the movement became a religion called Cheondogyo, or Cheondoism, which is followed today in both North and South Korea.  Choe Je-u  Choe Je-u's treatise argued a return to the Confucian understanding of Heaven, with emphasis on self-cultivation and improving one's nature. As Choe wrote, the Way of Heaven was within one's own mind, and so by improving one's nature, one also attained the Way of Heaven. Donghak was not accompanied by a specific agenda or systematic doctrine. Choe believed in improvising as events occurred. He had no practical plans or visions of how one would go about establishing a paradise on Earth, let alone what paradise meant except that all people were equal. Nevertheless, Choe's advocacy of democracy, human rights and Korean nationalism struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas and Donghak spread across Korea rapidly. Progressive revolutionaries waded in and organized the peasants into a cohesive fighting unit.

It is located in an agriculture area between Wolvega and Noordwolde. De Hoeve has approximately 410 inhabitants (2017).Villages - Weststellingwerf municipality  History  De Hoeve is not a very old village. For the first time it was mentioned by its name in 1938. On a map of 1664 the territory was only heather. Shortly after that people built two farmhouses: an Oosterhoeve (East Hoeve) and a Westerhoeve (West Hoeve). A new map, drawn in 1718 shows both farmhouses. The area around it is also called Vinkegahoeve and Steggerdahoeve because they are in the neighbourhood of the small villages Vinkega and Steggerda. In 1908 Commissie Plaatselijk Belang (Committee Local Interest) was founded. During the first meetings with the people it was decided to improve the dirtroads by putting rubble on it. Also they decide to make all kinds of other improvements. These meetings were also used as entertainment with recitals, songs and hot chocolate, made of the milk that was donated by the farmers. The committeemembers made sure that there would be enough milk left for the pupils the next day.  Famous inhabitants  An important person for De Hoeve was Albert H. Kuipers. He was a farmer, and owner of moor and the founder of the first school in De Hoeve. On behalf of 68 people he wrote a request to the province. He himself donated the land necessary to build the school. The county of Weststellingwerf did not agree with the plan of building a school. They were afraid that less pupils would go to the newly built school in Steggerda. Also finances were a big problem. The province of Friesland knew that this school had to be built. At that moment 70 pupils between 5 and 12 years old had to walk more than 3 to 5 hours to school through the mud and dirt.  Present day  In 2005 there are several clubs and committees in De Hoeve. The school has a new name now. It is called \\"De Klaeter\\". De Klaeter is doing very well with its approximately 55 pupils. De Hoeve has its own monthly newspaper called \\"De OosterWester\\".

The area is best known for sightings of the Min Min lights, mysterious shimmering lights that appear at night. The lights are said to be caused by atmospheric refraction that occurs when cold air is trapped below warmer air, a phenomenon known as Fata Morgana.  Geography  Boulia is in the Central West Queensland and is located approximately by road south of Mount Isa. Boulia is at the crossroads of a number of outback routes, including the Boulia Mount Isa Road (which goes north-west towards Mount Isa), the Selwyn Road (which goes north-east to Selwyn), the Winton Road, which goes east toward Winton), and the Boulia Bedourie Road (which goes south-west to Bedourie). The Donohue Highway coming from the Northern Territory joins the Boulia Mount Isa Road just outside of Boulia, which together with the Winton Road forms part of the Outback Way billed as \\"Australia's Longest Shortcut\\", a gravel-and-bitumen road which runs between Laverton in Western Australia and Winton in Queensland.

Boulia lies on the Burke River, which was named after the explorer Robert O'Hara Burke who passed through the area with the Burke and Wills expedition in 1860. The river flows from the north- east to the south-east through the locality Although it is contrary to the locality boundary principles of the Queensland Government, the locality of Boulia is an \\"island\\" entirely surrounded by the locality of Wills. Extensive grazing of beef cattle on native vegetation is the predominant industry. Boulia is at the heart of the Channel Country of western Queensland where, during rain events, channels running between the rivers and creeks of the region fill with water and spread that water over expansive areas. When it does rain heavily, the Mitchell grass plains respond magnificently and result in the Channel country around Boulia, being among the finest beef producing country in Australia. The town has a grid layout with 6 roads running east- west and 5 running north-south. Herbert Street is the main street where most of the civic and commercial premises are located. History left The town was named by surveyor Frederick Arthur Hartnell in 1882 and was derived from the name of the waterhole near the township called \\"bool-yo\\" in the Pitta Pitta language. The township was gazetted in 1879. Boulia Post Office opened on 1 July 1879. Boulia Provisional School opened on 7 October 1889. It became Boulia State School on 1 January 1909. At the 2011 census, Boulia had a population of 230, up from 205 in 2006. Climate The climate is very hot and dry, with on average over 200 days per year over . Although even in June and July the average maximum is a very warm , frosts are not unknown in the morning during these months. Annual rainfall is extraordinarily erratic: it has been as low as in 1905 and in 1963. However, when the monsoon is strong rainfall can be heavy: in January 1974 Boulia received of rain and in March 1950 . Maximum annual rainfall totals are in 1950 and in 1974, but the median annual rainfall is only .Bureau of Meteorology Events The town hosts the Boulia Desert Sands Camel Races, the longest camel race (running a 1500m cup final) on the Australian camel racing circuit. Each year at Easter, the Boulia Racecourse reserve plays host to a rodeo, campdrafting, and horse racing event which is a social highlight for the district. During August drag races are held at the Boulia Airport which attracts an enthusiastic crowd. Facilities Min Min Encounter, 2016 Boulia has a range of public facilities open to the community. These include a public library, public hall, sports complex, racecourse, the Min Min encounter tourist centre, museum, visitor information centre, and camel races. The Boulia Shire Council operates a public library at 18 Burke Street. An 18-hole golf course with sand greens is located on the Boulia Winton Road. Greens fees are not charged for the use of this course and a clubhouse with bar facilities is available. Boulia has Australia's first three-dimensional zebra crossing which is based on an optical illusion. It is to improve road safety and also to be a tourist attraction. It was introduced in 2018 after Boulia Shire Council mayor Rick Britton saw similar crossings in Iceland, Malaysia, India, New Zealand and the United States on social media. The Boulia branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association has its rooms at 61 Moonah Street.  Education  Boulia State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at Templeton Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 27 students with 4 teachers and 4 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent). There are no secondary schools in Boulia. The nearest secondary schools are in Mount Isa and Winton, but these are too distant for a daily commute. The Spinifex State College in Mount Isa offers boarding facilities. Other boarding schools or distance education would be options for secondary schooling. Mars The name Boulia is used as a name for a crater on the planet Mars, specifically commemorating the town.

It was named by John James Audubon in honor of John Stevens Henslow. It was originally classified in the genus Emberiza and called Henslow's bunting. Description Adults have streaked brown upperparts with a light brown breast with streaks, a white belly and a white throat. They have a pale stripe on the crown with a dark stripe on each side, an olive face and neck, rust-coloured wings and a short dark forked tail. Measurements: * Length: 4.3-5.1 in (11-13 cm) * Weight: 0.4-0.5 oz (11-15 g) * Wingspan: 6.3-7.9 in (16-20 cm) Distribution and habitat Their breeding habitat is shrubby fields, often wet, in southern Canada, the northeastern United States, and the midwestern United States. The nest is a well-concealed open cup on or close to the ground in a grassy location; these birds often nest in small colonies. They migrate to marshes and open pine woods in the southeastern United States. These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects and seeds. Their song is a quick se-lick. The range and numbers of this bird are decreasing, probably due to habitat loss of the grasslands that it depends on. However, it has heavily benefited from the Conservation Reserve Program formed by the United States Department of Agriculture, which has helped to stabilize its population. Following this, it was downlisted to Least Concern from Near Threatened in 2018. The Texas population was solely known from a brushfield near Houston and disappeared after devegetation due to industrial development in the 1980s. It was considered a distinct subspecies (P. h. houstonensis: Arnold, 1983) but is today considered to fall into the range of variation of the nominate subspecies (Browning, 1990). Likewise, the South Dakotan population formerly known as P. h. occidentalis has been synonymized with the nominate. The only remaining subspecies generally (but not universally) accepted are the eastern Henslow's sparrow and the western Henslow's sparrow, whose ranges are for the most part separated by the Appalachian Mountains.

Its landing strip measured 600 m long. Project Habakkuk or Habbakuk (spelling varies) was a plan by the British during the Second World War to construct an aircraft carrier out of pykrete (a mixture of wood pulp and ice) for use against German U-boats in the mid-Atlantic, which were beyond the flight range of land-based planes at that time. The idea came from Geoffrey Pyke, who worked for Combined Operations Headquarters. After promising scale tests and the creation of a prototype on a lake (Patricia Lake, Jasper National Park) in Alberta, Canada, the project was shelved due to rising costs, added requirements, and the availability of longer-range aircraft and escort carriers which closed the Mid-Atlantic gap the project was intended to address.  History = Initial concept  Geoffrey Pyke was an old friend of J.D. Bernal and had been recommended to Lord Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations, by the Cabinet minister Leopold Amery. Pyke worked at Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) alongside Bernal and was regarded as a genius by Mountbatten. Pyke conceived the idea of Habakkuk while he was in the United States organising the production of M29 Weasels for Project Plough, a scheme to assemble an elite unit for winter operations in Norway, Romania and the Italian Alps. He had been considering the problem of how to protect seaborne landings and Atlantic convoys out of reach of aircraft cover. The problem was that steel and aluminium were in short supply, and were required for other purposes. Pyke decided that the answer was ice, which could be manufactured for only 1 percent of the energy needed to make an equivalent mass of steel. He proposed that an iceberg, natural or artificial, be levelled to provide a runway and hollowed out to shelter aircraft. From New York Pyke sent the proposal via diplomatic bag to COHQ, with a label forbidding anyone apart from Mountbatten from opening the package. Mountbatten in turn passed Pyke's proposal on to Churchill, who was enthusiastic about it. Pyke was not the first to suggest a floating mid-ocean stopping point for aircraft, nor even the first to suggest that such a floating island could be made of ice. A German scientist, Dr. A. Gerke from Waldenburg, had proposed the idea and carried out some preliminary experiments on Lake Zurich in 1930. The idea was a recurring one: in 1940 an idea for an ice island was circulated around the Admiralty, but was treated as a joke by officers, including Nevil Shute, who circulated a memorandum that gathered ever more caustic comments. The document had to be retrieved just before it reached the First Sea Lord's inbox.Terrell, Edward, Admiralty Brief: The Story of Inventions that Contributed to Victory in the Battle of the Atlantic. London: Harrap, 1958, p. 27  Code name and spelling  The project's code name was often incorrectly spelled Habbakuk in official documents at the time. This may have been Pyke's own error, as at least one early document apparently written by him (though unsigned) spells it that way. However, post-war publications by people concerned with the project, such as Perutz and Goodeve, all restore the proper spelling, with one \\"b\\" and three \\"k\\"s. The name is a reference to the project's ambitious goal: \\"Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.\\" David Lampe, in his book, Pyke, the Unknown Genius, states that the name was derived from Voltaire's Candide and was misspelled by his Canadian secretary. However, the word does not actually appear in that text,Voltaire's Candide at gutenberg.org so this is probably inaccurate.  Pykrete  A block of pykrete In early 1942 Pyke and Bernal called in Max Perutz to determine whether an icefloe large enough to withstand Atlantic conditions could be built up fast enough. Perutz pointed out that natural icebergs have too small a surface above water for an airstrip, and are prone to suddenly rolling over. The project would have been abandoned if it had not been for the invention of pykrete, a mixture of water and woodpulp that when frozen was stronger than plain ice, was slower-melting and would not sink. Developed by his government group and named after Pyke, It has been suggested that Pyke was inspired by Inuit sleds reinforced with moss. This is probably apocryphal, as the material was originally described in a paper by Mark and HohensteinWalter Peter Hohenstein (1908–1987), bio in Brooklyn. Pykrete could be machined like wood and cast into shapes like metal, and when immersed in water formed an insulating shell of wet wood pulp on its surface that protected its interior from further melting. However, Perutz found a problem: ice flows slowly, in what is known as plastic flow, and his tests showed that a pykrete ship would slowly sag unless it was cooled to . To accomplish this the ship's surface would have to be protected by insulation, and it would need a refrigeration plant and a complicated system of ducts. Perutz proceeded to conduct experiments on the viability of pykrete and its optimum composition in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London. The research took place in a refrigerated meat locker behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses.  Scale model  The decision was made to build a large-scale model at Jasper National Park in Canada to examine insulation and refrigeration techniques, and to see how pykrete would stand up to artillery and explosives. Large ice blocks were constructed at Lake Louise, Alberta, and a small prototype was constructed at Patricia Lake, Alberta, measuring only 60 by 30 feet (18 metres by 9 metres), weighing 1,000 tons and kept frozen by a one-horsepower motor. The work was done by conscientious objectors who did alternative service of various kinds instead of military service. They were never told what they were building. Bernal informed COHQ that the Canadians were building a 1,000-ton model, and that it was expected to take eight men fourteen days to build it. The Chief of Combined Operations (CCO) responded that Churchill had invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to arrange for an order to be placed for one complete ship at once, with the highest priority, and that further ships were to be ordered immediately if it appeared that the scheme was certain of success. The Canadians were confident about constructing a vessel for 1944. The necessary materials were available to them in the form of 300,000 tons of wood pulp, 25,000 tons of fibreboard insulation, 35,000 tons of timber and 10,000 tons of steel. The cost was estimated at £700,000. Meanwhile Perutz had determined via his experiments at Smithfield Market that the optimum structural properties were given by a mixture of 14 per cent wood pulp and 86 per cent water. He wrote to Pyke in early April 1943 and pointed out that if certain tests were not completed in May, there would be no chance of delivering a completed ship in 1944. By May the problem of cold flow had become serious and it was obvious that more steel reinforcement would be needed, as well as a more effective insulating skin around the vessel's hull. This caused the cost estimate to increase to £2.5 million. In addition, the Canadians had decided that it was impractical to attempt the project \\"this coming season\\". Bernal and Pyke were forced to conclude that no Habakkuk vessel would be ready in 1944. Pyke was excluded from the planning for Habakkuk in an effort to secure American participation, a decision that Bernal supported. Pyke's earlier disagreements with American personnel on Project Plough, which had caused his removal from that project, were the main factor in this decision. Naval architects and engineers continued to work on Habakkuk with Bernal and Perutz during the summer of 1943. The requirements for the vessel became more demanding: it had to have a range of and be able to withstand the largest waves recorded, and the Admiralty wanted it to be torpedo-proof, which meant that the hull had to be at least thick. The Fleet Air Arm decided that heavy bombers should be able to take off from it, which meant that the deck had to be long. Steering also raised problems; it was initially projected that the ship would be steered by varying the speed of the motors on either side, but the Royal Navy decided that a rudder was essential. However, the problem of mounting and controlling a rudder over high was never solved.  Variants  Naval architects produced three alternative versions of Pyke's original concept, which were discussed at a meeting with the Chiefs of Staff in August 1943: * Habakkuk I (soon discarded) would have been made of wood. * Habakkuk II was closest to the COHQ model and would have been a very large, slow, self-propelled vessel made of pykrete with steel reinforcement. The size would have been a length of 1200 meters and a width of 180 meters.spiegel.de: Groteskes Kriegsgerät: Waffen des Wahnsinns, retrieved 19 January 2015 * Habakkuk III was a smaller, faster version of Habakkuk II. { Aircraft carrier drawings. Cross section, showing 40 ft (12 m) thick walls made of pykrete } Air Chief Marshal Portal asked about potential bomb damage to Habakkuk III, and Bernal suggested that a certain amount of deck covering might be ripped off, but could be repaired by some kind of flexible matting. It would be more difficult to deal with bomb holes in the centre portion, though the roof over the aircraft hangars would be made blast proof against 1,000 kg bombs. Bernal considered that no one could say whether the larger Habakkuk II was a practical proposition until a large-scale model could be completed and tested in Canada in the spring of 1944. He had no doubts about the suitability of pykrete as a material, but said that constructional and navigational difficulties remained to be overcome. The final design of Habakkuk II gave the bergship (as it was called) a displacement of 2.2 million tons. Steam turbogenerators were to supply for 26 electric motors mounted in separate external nacelles (normal, internal ship engines would have generated too much heat for an ice craft). Its armament would have included 40 dual-barrelled 4.5\\" DP (dual-purpose) turrets and numerous light anti-aircraft guns, and it would have housed an airstrip and up to 150 twin-engined bombers or fighters.  Shooting incident  According to some accounts, at the Quebec Conference in 1943 Lord Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the admirals and generals who accompanied Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground. One was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete. He then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block. It shattered and splintered. Next he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles. The bullet ricocheted off the block, grazing the trouser leg of Admiral Ernest King, and ended up in the wall. Sir Alan Brooke's diaries. support this account, telling how Mountbatten brought two blocks, one of ice and one of pykrete. After first shooting at the ice, with a warning to beware of splinters, Mountbatten said \\"I shall fire at the block on the right to show you the difference\\". Brooke reported that \\"the bullet rebounded out of the block and buzzed round our legs like an angry bee\\". Max Perutz gave an account of a similar incident in his book I Wish I Made You Angry Earlier. A demonstration of pykrete was given at Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) by a naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Douglas Adshead-Grant, who was provided by Perutz with rods of ice and pykrete packed with dry ice in thermos flasks and large blocks of ice and pykrete. Grant demonstrated the comparative strength of ice and pykrete by firing bullets into both blocks: the ice shattered, but the bullet rebounded from the pykrete and hit the Chief of Imperial General Staff (Sir Alan Brooke) in the shoulder. Brooke was unhurt.  End of project  By the time of the 1943 Quebec Conference the Habakkuk project had won the support of both Churchill and Mountbatten, and was assigned to the National Research Council of Canada because of the cold Canadian winters and Canadians' prior familiarity with ice physics. The small prototype built in 1944 on a Patricia Lake near Jasper, Alberta, confirmed the researchers' forecast that the full-size vessel would cost more money and machinery than a whole fleet of conventional aircraft carriers. NRC President C.J. Mackenzie later said British promoters of Habakkuk were so intimidated by Prime Minister Churchill that they kept this information from him until the Canadian's next visit to Britain.Susan B.M. Langley, 'Project Habbakuk: World War II Prototype Vessel' in \\"Scientia Canadensis\\" #31 (1986). Mountbatten later listed several points: * Demand for steel for other purposes was too great. * Permission had been received from Portugal to use airfields in the Azores, which facilitated the hunting of U-boats in the Atlantic * The introduction of long-range fuel tanks allowed British-based aircraft extra patrol time over the Atlantic * The numbers of escort carriers were being increased. In addition, Mountbatten himself withdrew from the project. The final meeting of the Habakkuk board took place in December 1943. It was officially concluded that \\"The large Habbakuk II made of pykrete has been found to be impractical because of the enormous production resources required and technical difficulties involved.\\" The use of ice had actually been falling out of favour before that, and other ideas for \\"floating islands\\" had been considered, such as welding Liberty Ships or landing craft together (Project TENTACLE). It took three hot summers to completely melt the prototype constructed in Canada. Perutz wrote that he stayed in Washington D.C. while U.S. Navy engineers evaluated the viability of Habakkuk. He concluded: \\"The U.S. Navy finally decided that Habakkuk was a false prophet. One reason was [that] the enormous amount of steel needed for the refrigeration plant that was to freeze the pykrete was greater than that needed to build the entire carrier of steel, but the crucial argument was that the rapidly increasing range of land-based aircraft rendered floating islands unnecessary.\\"  Criticism  The Habakkuk design received criticism, notably from Sir Charles F. Goodeve, Assistant Controller of Research and Development for the Admiralty during the Second World War. In an article published after the war Goodeve pointed out the large amount of wood pulp that would be required was enough to affect paper production significantly. He also claimed that each ship would require 40,000 tons of cork insulation, thousands of miles of steel tubing for brine circulation and four power stations, but that for all those resources (some of which could be used to manufacture conventional ships of more effective fighting power) Habakkuk would be capable of travelling at only six knots of speed. His article also contained extensive derisive comments about the properties of ice as used for ship construction.  Recent recreations  In the 15 April 2009 episode of the U.S. TV show MythBusters Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage built a small flat-bottomed boat dubbed Yesterday's News out of a modified version of pykrete, using whole sheets of wet newspaper instead of wood pulp. They successfully piloted the boat in Alaskan waters at a speed of , but it began to leak through the melting pykrete in 20 minutes and after attempting to flash freeze leaks with a fire extinguisher and bailing the water with a hand pump, 10 minutes later Hyneman determined that the boat was taking on more water than the pump could remove and they headed back to shore, trailing sloughed portions of newspaper in their wake. They later inferred that it is possible to build a boat out of pykrete, and that pykrete lived up to its purported properties of being bullet-proof, stronger than ice and taking longer to melt than ice. However, they expressed doubt that an aircraft carrier made of pykrete could have survived for long. The conclusion was \\"Plausible, but ludicrous.\\" In September 2010 the BBC programme Bang Goes The Theory also attempted to recreate a pykrete boat. A rough hull using 5,000 kg of hemp fibre pykrete was frozen in a coldstore, then launched in Portsmouth Harbour for a planned trip across the Solent to Cowes. The hull immediately started to leak because of the holes that had been cut in its rear to mount an outboard motor; the weight of the motor itself caused these holes to drop below the waterline.

It initially complemented and then replaced the Ford Köln. It was itself replaced by the Ford Taunus. Between 1937 and 1939 it was also assembled in Hungary and Denmark. The Eifel was derived from the Ford Model C (Europe) 1934 platform, and is also related to the Dagenham built 1938 Ford Prefect 1939 Ford Anglia. The model was named after the Eifel mountain range in western Germany. Body The car was offered with many different body types, including a two- door sedan, a two-door cabrio coach, two- and four-seat cabriolet, two-seater roadster and a light truck. The mainstream \\"limousine\\" (saloon) steel bodies were bought in from the Ambi Budd factory in Berlin, while the \\"cabrio- Limousine\\" (soft-top saloons/sedans) were built by Drauz coachbuilders of Heilbronn. Several other body builders such as Gläser coachbuilders of Dresden provided the less mainstream bodies. Engine and transmission The engine was a four-cylinder, four-stroke side-valve 1172 cc unit, giving a claimed maximum power output of 34 hp (25 kW) at 4250 rpm. The three-speed manual gear box featured synchromesh on the top two ratios. Commercial Ford Eifel roadster 1936 (pre-face-lift) Ford Eifel roadster 1937 (post-face-lift) 61,495 Ford Eifels were produced in Germany, representing more than half of the output of the company's Cologne factory between production of the plant's first car in 1933 and the cessation of passenger car manufacture in 1942, following the outbreak, in 1939, of widespread European war. It was therefore in large measure due to this car's popularity that Ford Germany moved from eighth place in terms of German passenger car sales in 1933 to fourth place in 1938, in the process overtaking Adler, Hanomag, Wanderer and BMW. The car's popularity in Germany increased after a minor face-lift in 1937 which coincided with an extension of the variety of body styles on offer, and which visually distanced the look of the car a little from its British origins, replacing the earlier car's spoked wheels with modern steel wheels and applying the eye catching wrap-around front grill which was becoming a feature of German Fords in the later 1930s.

Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of congestion is that an incremental increase in offered load leads either only to a small increase or even a decrease in network throughput.(Al-Bahadili, 2012, p. 282) Al-Bahadili, H. (2012). Simulation in computer network design and modeling: Use and analysis. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. Network protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss due to congestion can increase congestion, even after the initial load has been reduced to a level that would not normally have induced network congestion. Such networks exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse. Networks use congestion control and congestion avoidance techniques to try to avoid collapse. These include: exponential backoff in protocols such as CSMA/CA in 802.11 and the similar CSMA/CD in the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers and network switches. Other techniques that address congestion include priority schemes which transmit some packets with higher priority ahead of others and the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows through the use of admission control. Network capacity Network resources are limited, including router processing time and link throughput. Resource contention may occur on networks in a number of common circumstances. A wireless LAN is easily filled by a single personal computer.den Hartog, F., Raschella, A., Bouhafs, F., Kempker, P., Boltjes, B., & Seyedebrahimi, M. (2017, November). A Pathway to solving the Wi-Fi Tragedy of the Commons in apartment blocks. In 2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC) (pp. 1-6). IEEE. Even on fast computer networks, the backbone can easily be congested by a few servers and client PCs. Denial-of-service attacks by botnets are capable of filling even the largest Internet backbone network links, generating large-scale network congestion. In telephone networks, a mass call event can overwhelm digital telephone circuits. Congestive collapse Congestive collapse (or congestion collapse) is the condition in which congestion prevents or limits useful communication. Congestion collapse generally occurs at choke points in the network, where incoming traffic exceeds outgoing bandwidth. Connection points between a local area network and a wide area network are common choke points. When a network is in this condition, it settles into a stable state where traffic demand is high but little useful throughput is available, during which packet delay and loss occur and quality of service is extremely poor. Congestive collapse was identified as a possible problem by 1984. It was first observed on the early Internet in October 1986, when the NSFnet phase-I backbone dropped three orders of magnitude from its capacity of 32 kbit/s to 40 bit/s, which continued until end nodes started implementing Van Jacobson and Sally Floyd's congestion control between 1987 and 1988. When more packets were sent than could be handled by intermediate routers, the intermediate routers discarded many packets, expecting the end points of the network to retransmit the information. However, early TCP implementations had poor retransmission behavior. When this packet loss occurred, the endpoints sent extra packets that repeated the information lost, doubling the incoming rate. Congestion control Congestion control modulates traffic entry into a telecommunications network in order to avoid congestive collapse resulting from oversubscription. This is typically accomplished by reducing the rate of packets. Whereas congestion control prevents senders from overwhelming the network, flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver. Theory of congestion control The theory on congestion control was pioneered by Frank Kelly, who applied microeconomic theory and convex optimization theory to describe how individuals controlling their own rates can interact to achieve an optimal network-wide rate allocation. Examples of optimal rate allocation are max-min fair allocation and Kelly's suggestion of proportionally fair allocation, although many others are possible. Let x_i be the rate of flow i, c_l be the capacity of link l, and r_{li} be 1 if flow i uses link l and 0 otherwise. Let x, c and R be the corresponding vectors and matrix. Let U(x) be an increasing, strictly concave function, called the utility, which measures how much benefit a user obtains by transmitting at rate x. The optimal rate allocation then satisfies : \\\\max\\\\limits_x \\\\sum_i U(x_i) : such that Rx \\\\le c The Lagrange dual of this problem decouples, so that each flow sets its own rate, based only on a price signalled by the network. Each link capacity imposes a constraint, which gives rise to a Lagrange multiplier, p_l. The sum of these multipliers, y_i=\\\\sum_l p_l r_{li}, is the price to which the flow responds. Congestion control then becomes a distributed optimisation algorithm. Many current congestion control algorithms can be modelled in this framework, with p_l being either the loss probability or the queueing delay at link l. A major weakness is that it assigns the same price to all flows, while sliding window flow control causes burstiness that causes different flows to observe different loss or delay at a given link. Classification of congestion control algorithms Among the ways to classify congestion control algorithms are: *By type and amount of feedback received from the network: Loss; delay; single-bit or multi-bit explicit signals *By incremental deployability: Only sender needs modification; sender and receiver need modification; only router needs modification; sender, receiver and routers need modification. *By performance aspect: high bandwidth-delay product networks; lossy links; fairness; advantage to short flows; variable-rate links *By fairness criterion: Max-min fairness; proportionally fair; controlled delay Mitigation Mechanisms have been invented to prevent network congestion or to deal with a network collapse: * Network scheduler active queue management which reorders or selectively drops network packets in the presence of congestion * Explicit Congestion Notification an extension to IP and TCP communications protocols that adds a flow control mechanism * TCP congestion control various implementations of efforts to deal with network congestion The correct endpoint behavior is usually to repeat dropped information, but progressively slow the repetition rate. Provided all endpoints do this, the congestion lifts and the network resumes normal behavior. Other strategies such as slow-start ensure that new connections don't overwhelm the router before congestion detection initiates. Common router congestion avoidance mechanisms include fair queuing and other scheduling algorithms, and random early detection (RED) where packets are randomly dropped as congestion is detected. This proactively triggers the endpoints to slow transmission before congestion collapse occurs. Some end-to- end protocols are designed behave well under congested conditions; TCP is a well known example. The first TCP implementations to handle congestion were described in 1984, but Van Jacobson's inclusion of an open source solution in the Berkeley Standard Distribution UNIX (\\"BSD\\") in 1988 first provided good behavior. UDP does not control congestion. Protocols built atop UDP must handle congestion independently. Protocols that transmit at a fixed rate, independent of congestion, can be problematic. Real-time streaming protocols, including many Voice over IP protocols, have this property. Thus, special measures, such as quality of service, must be taken to keep packets from being dropped in the presence of congestion. Practical network congestion avoidance Connection-oriented protocols, such as the widely used TCP protocol watch for packet loss, or queuing delay to adjust their transmission rate. Various network congestion avoidance processes support different trade- offs. TCP/IP congestion avoidance The TCP congestion avoidance algorithm is the primary basis for congestion control on the Internet.Van Jacobson, Michael J. Karels. Congestion Avoidance and Control (1988). Proceedings of the Sigcomm '88 Symposium, vol.18(4): pp.314-329\\\\. Stanford, CA. August, 1988. This paper originated many of the congestion avoidance algorithms used in TCP/IP.RFC 2001 - TCP Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery AlgorithmsRFC 2581 - TCP Congestion ControlRFC 3390 - TCP Increasing TCP's Initial WindowTCP Congestion Avoidance Explained via a Sequence Diagram Problems occur when concurrent TCP flows experience tail- drops, especially when bufferbloat is present. This delayed packet loss interferes with TCP's automatic congestion avoidance. All flows that experience this packet loss begin a TCP retrain at the same moment – this is called TCP global synchronization. Active queue management Active queue management (AQM) is the reordering or dropping of network packets inside a transmit buffer that is associated with a network interface controller (NIC). This task is performed by the network scheduler. =Random early detection= One solution is to use random early detection (RED) on the network equipment's egress queue.Sally Floyd: RED (Random Early Detection) Queue ManagementSally Floyd, Van Jacobson. Random Early Detection Gateways for Congestion Avoidance (1993). IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, vol.1(4): pp.397-413\\\\. Invented Random Early Detection (RED) gateways. On networking hardware ports with more than one egress queue, weighted random early detection (WRED) can be used. RED indirectly signals TCP sender and receiver by dropping some packets, e.g. when the average queue length is more than a threshold (e.g. 50%) and deletes linearly or cubically more packets, up to e.g. 100%, as the queue fills further. =Robust random early detection= The robust random early detection (RRED) algorithm was proposed to improve the TCP throughput against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, particularly low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attacks. Experiments confirmed that RED-like algorithms were vulnerable under LDoS attacks due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks. =Flow-based WRED= Some network equipment is equipped with ports that can follow and measure each flow and are thereby able to signal a too big bandwidth flow according to some quality of service policy. A policy could then divide the bandwidth among all flows by some criteria. =Explicit Congestion Notification= Another approach is to use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).RFC 3168 - The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP ECN is used only when two hosts signal that they want to use it. With this method, a protocol bit is used to signal explicit congestion. This is better than the indirect congestion notification signaled by packet loss by the RED/WRED algorithms, but it requires support by both hosts.Comparative study of RED, ECN and TCP Rate Control (1999) When a router receives a packet marked as ECN-capable and the router anticipates congestion, it sets the ECN flag, notifying the sender of congestion. The sender should respond by decreasing its transmission bandwidth, e.g., by decreasing its sending rate by reducing the TCP window size or by other means. =TCP window shaping= Congestion avoidance can be achieved efficiently by reducing traffic. When an application requests a large file, graphic or web page, it usually advertises a \\"window\\" of between 32K and 64K. This results in the server sending a full window of data (assuming the file is larger than the window). When many applications simultaneously request downloads, this data creates a congestion point at an upstream provider by flooding the queue. By using a device to reduce the window advertisement, the remote servers send less data, thus reducing the congestion. This technique can reduce network congestion by a factor of 40. = Backward ECN = Backward ECN (BECN) is another proposed congestion mechanism. It uses ICMP source quench messages as an IP signalling mechanism to implement a basic ECN mechanism for IP networks, keeping congestion notifications at the IP level and requiring no negotiation between network endpoints. Effective congestion notifications can be propagated to transport layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP, for the appropriate adjustments.A proposal for Backward ECN for the Internet Protocol Side effects of congestive collapse avoidance=Radio links The protocols that avoid congestive collapse are often based on the idea that data loss is caused by congestion. This is true in nearly all cases; errors during transmission are rare. However, this causes WiFi, 3G or other networks with a radio layer to have poor throughput in some cases since wireless networks are susceptible to data loss due to interference. The TCP connections running over a radio based physical layer see the data loss and tend to erroneously believe that congestion is occurring. Short-lived connections The slow-start protocol performs badly for short connections. Older web browsers created many short-lived connections and opened and closed the connection for each file. This kept most connections in the slow start mode, which slowed response times. To avoid this problem, modern browsers either open multiple connections simultaneously or reuse one connection for all files requested from a particular server. Initial performance can be poor, and many connections never get out of the slow-start regime, significantly increasing latency. Admission control Admission control requires devices to receive permission before establishing new network connections. If the new connection risks creating congestion, permission can be denied. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area networking over varying wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).

The couple married in 1988. Cornelia is the granddaughter of Democratic Representative Martin J. Kennedy.  Articles  In 2002, Suskind wrote two articles in Esquire on the workings of the George W. Bush White House. The first article, in June 2002, focused on presidential adviser Karen Hughes. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said that the pragmatic Hughes was \\"the beauty to Karl's beast\\", referring to Bush's advisor Karl Rove. According to Card, her resignation signified a political shift in the administration further to the right. Suskind's second Esquire story about Rove, in December 2002, carried the comments and a long memo from Bush's former head of the White House Office of Faith-based and Community initiatives John DiIulio, an official who left the White House and spoke about his experiences. DiIulio criticized the Bush administration for having \\"no policy apparatus\\" and fixating on political calculation, and was quoted as saying \\"it's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis,\\" a comment he then explained in a 3,000-word, on-the-record memo to Suskind about his time in the administration. DiIulio later attempted to recant some of his characterizations. An October 2004 cover story by Suskind in the New York Times Magazine stated that the president was planning to partially privatize Social Security as his first initiative if re-elected—a disclosure that prompted controversy in the final two weeks of the campaign. In the article, Suskind quoted an unnamed advisor to Bush (later identified as Rove) as saying that  Books = A Hope in the Unseen  In 1995 Suskind wrote a series of articles on the struggles of inner-city honors students in Washington, D.C, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Parts of these articles were used in his first book, A Hope in the Unseen (Doubleday/Broadway, 1998). The story chronicles the two-year journey of Cedric L. Jennings, an honor student who aspires to escape his blighted D.C. upbringing by going to an Ivy League university. The book was chosen by The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Monthly and Booklist as one of the best books of the year. The New York Times Book Review called it an \\"extraordinary, formula-shattering book\\". David Halberstam called it a \\"beautiful book of a heroic American struggle.\\" The book has been a selection in college courses on American culture, education, sociology and creative writing, and has been a required reading for incoming freshmen at some universities. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the \\"One Maryland, One Book\\" program. In a review of the book, CNN declared: \\"As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as a well-intentioned anachronism, A Hope in the Unseen should be required reading for would-be opinion-mongers.\\" In his review for Newsday, Bill Reel stated \\"I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book—A Hope in the Unseen by Ron Suskind.\\" The book has been a favorite of Bill Clinton and school reformer Michelle Rhee, and Barack Obama. Suskind says his writing style for this book was to use exhaustive reporting to place readers inside the heads of characters. Suskind stated that this \\"writing style\\" was a delving into motive and intent in an effort to understand the \\"good enough reasons\\" that underlie actions, which allowed for a fuller, more accurate—and often emotionally powerful—rendering of characters. The Chicago Tribune called the book \\"the new, new nonfiction.Chicago Tribune\\"  The Price of Loyalty  The Price of Loyalty was published on January 13, 2004. The book, which chronicled the two-year tenure of United States Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, was about the conduct and character of the Bush presidency. While the book covered a number of foreign and domestic issues, it is focussed on events that culminated in the Iraq War. Among the disclosures in the book, which drew from numerous sources and more than 19,000 internal government documents, one was that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the U.S. occupation of Iraq was planned from Bush's first U.S. National Security Council meeting in January 2001, soon after Bush took office.Suskind, Ron. The Price of Loyalty Simon & Schuster. 2004 This lay in contrast to the perception that concerns over Iraq came to the forefront after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Administration officials have contended that O'Neill confused contingency plans with actual plans for invasion.Cabinet members defend Bush from O'Neill CNN. January 12, 2004 Rather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O'Neill's credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However, O'Neill's claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq occupation to the post-9/11 War on Terrorism. After the cover sheet of a packet containing classified information was shown during a 60 Minutes interview of O'Neill and Suskind, the United States Department of Treasury investigated whether both men had improperly received classified materials. It concluded in March 2004 that no laws were violated, but that inadequate document handling policies at the Treasury had allowed 140 documents which should have been marked classified to be entered into a computer system for unclassified documents. The documents were among those subsequently released to O'Neill in response to a legal document request and then given to Suskind. In domestic affairs, the statements by O'Neill about the administration's allegedly chaotic and politically driven policy-making process supported the claims of John DiIulio. O'Neill stated that Vice President Cheney had become part of \\"a co-presidency\\" with George W. Bush. One of the book's disclosures involved the conflict between O'Neill and Cheney over what would become the 2003 tax cut. O'Neill, in a November 2002 meeting with Cheney and other senior officials, said that it was unprecedented to cut taxes at a time of war and that the cuts—which included the wealthiest Americans—would eventually push the government toward \\"fiscal crisis.\\" Cheney's response was, \\"Reagan proved deficits don't matter. We won the midterms. This is our due.\\" O'Neill opposed this policy.  The One Percent Doctrine  The One Percent Doctrine is Suskind's third book, published in 2006. The book is about the evolution of the foreign policy of the younger Bush's Administration especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Excerpts of book were published in the June 18, 2006, issue of Time. Based on interviews with more than a hundred sources, including several cabinet officials, the book concluded that U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 was driven by the Bush Doctrine, which is described by a quote from Vice President Dick Cheney saying that it was important for the U.S. to think of \\"low probability, high impact events\\"—like terrorists or rogue states getting their hands on WMD—\\"in a new way.\\" The doctrine, Suskind asserts, freed the administration from the dictates of evidence and allowed suspicion to be a guide for action in both its battles against terrorists and against rogue states, like Iraq under Saddam Hussein. One of Suskind's assertions—that a suspect in the London subway bombings was on a US \\"no fly\\" list and attempted to enter the US—has been challenged by the US government. The FBI described Suskind's reporting on this single matter as \\"inaccurate\\", and issued a statement saying \\"the author has intertwined facts ... causing some confusion.\\"Press release.FBI Responds to Report on London Bomber Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Among these stories are the tales of an intelligence official working to combat nuclear terrorism, a detainee lawyer fighting for rights at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a young Pakistani man interrogated under the White House, an Afghan teenager who spends a year in American high school, and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto as she returns to Pakistan to challenge President Pervez Musharraf.Jenkins, Simon. Sunday Times book review Sunday Times (London). August 24, 2008. In his assessment for the Literary Review, Michael Burleigh said: \\"Using a series of interwoven stories, some hopeful, others disturbing, Suskind explores whether the United States and the Muslim world will ever be able to find mutual respect and understanding. ... This is a hugely important field that has never been so well examined.\\"Michael Burleigh, Literary Review The Sunday Times declared \\"Suskind is never unsympathetic to his characters, who he appears to have debriefed intensively. He is a romantic, a writer who clearly believes that his country has betrayed its past, its values and its moral compass by failing to tell the truth about the war.\\" The New York Observer said: \\"Moving. ... Mr. Suskind is a prodigiously talented craftsman. ... It's all here: a cast of characters that sprawls across class and circumstance to represent the totality of a historical moment. ... These hard times, Mr. Suskind's book suggests, call for a nonfiction Dickens.\\"New York Observer Mark Danner, reviewing the book for The New York Times, writes that \\"these narratives and others perform, in Mr. Suskind's hands, an intricate arabesque and manage, to a rather remarkable degree, to show us, in this age of terror, 'the true way of the world.'\\"Danner, Mark. Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other Imaginative Acts The New York Times. August 27, 2008. It is around the stories of these characters that the book frames the debate about how America lost much of its moral authority in recent years and how it is struggling, often through the actions and initiative of individuals, to restore it.Ron Suskind interview on The Washington Posts Book World Live. August 12, 2008. The Way of the World made a series of disclosures centered on Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, the head of Iraqi intelligence under Saddam Hussein. The book said that British and American intelligence entered into a dialogue with Habbush before the invasion of Iraq, in which Habbush revealed that Saddam possessed no weapons of mass destruction and did not take an American invasion seriously. The book also contends that the Central Intelligence Agency resettled Habbush, paid him $5 million, and forged a document in his name alleging that 9/11 hijacker Mohammad Atta trained in Iraq.Ron Suskind interview on Democracy Now! August 14, 2008. The White House, former CIA director George Tenet, and former CIA officer Robert Richer, a figure in the book, denied involvement in the illegal act of fabricating the Habbush letter, denials that were echoed in an official CIA statement, saying of Suskind's claim that the White House ordered the agency to forge a letter from Habbush: \\"It did not happen.\\"Warrick, Joby. CIA More Fully Denies Deception About Iraq The Washington Post. August 23, 2008. Suskind responded to the Rob Richer's denial, circulated by the White House, by posting on his website a partial transcript of a taped conversation with Richer in which the two discuss the Habbush forgery. In response to the official CIA statement, Suskind told The Washington Post that the disclosures and details in his book are backed up by hours of interviews and that there is \\"not a shred of doubt about any of it.\\"Warrick, Joby. CIA More Fully Denies Deception About Iraq. The Washington Post. August 23, 2008. On August 11, House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers announced that his committee would look into the matter of the Habbush letter and a variety of other disclosures in the book.Conyers announces review of allegations in Ron Suskind's The Way of the World The Way of the World debuted at number 3 on The New York Times Best Seller list, but some remarked that its revelations did not produce the outrage or scandal that would seem to attend a White House-run disinformation campaign aimed at U.S. public opinion.Crook, Clive. Whispers of Watergate for Bush Financial Times. August 11, 2008. The layers of the controversy have nonetheless deepened with the revelation that Ayad Allawi, the initial source of the Habbush letter, was at CIA headquarters the week before the letter emerged,Conason, Joe. New evidence suggests Ron Suskind is right. Salon. August 8, 2008 and a piece in The American Conservative by Philip Giraldi that claims an \\"extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community\\" confirmed that the Vice President's Office was behind the Habbush letter, but that \\"Doug Feith's Office of Special Plans\\", not the CIA, carried out the forgery.Giraldi, Philip. Suskind Revisited. The American Conservative. August 7, 2008. Some disclosures in The Way of the World received less attention than the Habbush controversy, but the story the book tells about Pervez Musharraf's actions toward Benazir Bhutto during the last months of her life was picked up in the Pakistani press and dovetailed with a movement calling for the impeachment of the (now former) Pakistani president.Loudon, Bruce. Musharraf defies calls to quit The Australian. August 11, 2008. Speaking to another aspect of the book, Mark Danner, in his review for The New York Times, writes that \\"the revelation of an effort to steal and sell fissile material in Georgia's now celebrated 'breakaway region' of South Ossetia ... is only the most terrifying of a dozen or more newsworthy disclosures in this book.\\"Danner, Mark. Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other Imaginative Acts. The New York Times. August 27, 2008. Suskind cites the battle against nuclear terrorism as the most pressing crisis the United States needs to combat in order to restore its moral authority, and details an ambitious attempt to infiltrate the worldwide nuclear black market, called the \\"Armageddon Test.\\"Rosenberg, Alyssa. Speed Reading Suskind: War Games. The New Republic. August 7, 2008.  Confidence Men  Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President was published on September 20, 2011, by HarperCollins. It describes the financial crisis that began in the U.S. in 2008, and the attempts by President Barack Obama's White House to combat it. On September 15, 2011, news of the book began to leak to the press. The New York Times, having obtained an advanced copy, wrote: \\"The book offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president, including Mr. Summers; Mr. Geithner; the former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag. An article in The Washington Post on September 16 elaborated on the content of the book, citing the allegation that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ignored a directive from the president to draw up plans for restructuring Citibank in the spring of 2009. The article also notes that in an interview in the book, Geithner denies the account saying \\"I don't slow-walk the president on anything\\". The White House pushed back against the book in spite of having granted Ron Suskind an interview with the president. Communications director Dan Pfeiffer said that books like these \\"tend to take the normal day-to-day activities of governing and infuse them with drama, palace intrigue and salacious details\\". While some faulted Suskind for giving greater credence to the views of sources who gave him more journalistic access others praised him for doing the opposite. In his review for The New York Times Book Review, Joe Nocera wrote \\"to his everlasting credit, Suskind savages several people he clearly spent time interviewing, starting with Obama's former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner, his Treasury secretary. And he's more than willing to step outside his re-created scenes to conduct interviews, in which Obama aides and allies tell truths that are genuinely painful to hear.\\" In his first television appearance, on the Today Show, Suskind was interviewed by anchor Ann Curry, who cited the White House pushback in her questioning. Suskind maintained that the book represented an accurate depiction of what he had found in his reporting. Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in his review of the book for The New Yorker that it would offer \\"support for some of today's standard progressive gripes about the President\\" being stymied by his conservative, Wall Street-attentive advisers, \\"and for a few of the conservative ones,\\" namely assertions that Obama arrived in office unprepared to lead. In his review of the book for The New York Times, Joe Nocera noted that the book had \\"an omniscient quality\\" of fly-on-the-wall scenes from inside the White House, much like the books of Bob Woodward, but \\"doesn't really go for phony omniscience\\" where the sources who are most cooperative are rendered most favorably. In a New Republic review, John B. Judis wrote, \\"Suskind's book is being widely portrayed as critical of the Obama administration, but if you read the entire book, its message is that during Obama's first two years he was foiled by his own inexperience as a manager and by a staff that didn't do good by him, but that after the Democratic defeat in 2010 he learned from his failure.\\" Both Summers and Geithner, who responded to disclosures in the book's pages, pushed back against their characterizations after publication. A week after publication, the book debuted at No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Nonfiction. According to the book President Obama supported a financial transaction tax on trades of stocks, derivatives, and other financial instruments, but he was blocked by Summers. Confidence Men was cited on various \\"best book\\" lists, and named an Esquire 2011 Best Book of the Year, with David Granger commenting: \\"Journalism like this is all too rare.\\"http://www.esquire.com/fiction/best-books-2011-1211-2 In the March 2012 issue of The Atlantic, James Fallows cited Confidence Men in his article \\"Obama, Explained,\\" writing that the Obama administration's \\"early failure of accountability\\" in its \\"apparent coddling of Wall Street in 2009 ... is the main theme of Ron Suskind's Confidence Men ... it created a substantive and symbolic problem the administration has never fully recovered from. Substantive, because of the moral hazard created by using public money to guarantee the bonuses and repay the losses of people who had been so recklessly destructive. Symbolic, for all the reasons that eventually came to a head with last year's Occupy movement. An official familiar with the administration's economic policy told me: 'The recapitalization of the banks was a good idea, and necessary. But we did not put enough conditions on [their] getting the money. Ultimately not being tougher with the guys that got the money is the thing that overthrows the government twice—in 2008 [in a reaction against Bush's TARP plan] and again in 2010.'\\"  Life, Animated  Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism was published on April 1, 2014, by Kingswell (an imprint of Disney Publishing Worldwide). It is the number 1 best seller under the category of \\"Special Needs Biographies\\" on Amazon, and also made The New York Times Best Seller list under Science Books. The memoir describes the Suskind family's two-decade journey in connecting with their youngest son Owen, who was diagnosed at age 3 with regressive autism, lost his ability to speak, and then developed an obsessive interest in Disney movies. Once the family discovered this, they began to play the roles of animated characters and conversing in Disney dialogue – a method that over years helped their son regain speech. Suskind chose to publish the book through a Disney imprint because of his son's frequent quotation of Disney movies in the book; otherwise, he would have had to pay licensing fees for each line of dialogue used. However, Disney agreed to exert no influence over any of the contents of the book.Suskind, Ron. \\"Author's Note.\\" Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism. Glendale, CA: Kingswell, 2014. In the memoir, Suskind explains how the family and therapists helped Owen use the Disney stories to relate to real situations, develop \\"inner speech\\" capacities, and gradually connect to others. He calls this intense interest in Disney an example of an autism \\"affinity,\\" referring to the propensity for individuals with autism to develop sustained, self-directed passions in one or a few subject areas. The Suskinds found that these deep interests – long viewed as unproductive obsessions that should be curtailed – are more \\"pathway than prison\\" for individuals with autism or other untraditional learners, insofar they use them \\"like an enigma machine to crack the codes of the wider world and find their way forward.\\" The New York Times book review of Life, Animated wrote that Suskind \\"charts Owen's remarkable journey back to connection through the unlikely vehicle of the Disney cartoons that are his only passion.\\" USA Today called Owen \\"every reader's son,\\" writing that \\"For Owen and his family, Disney evolved into his translator of reality. He memorized every line of dialogue in the films and learned, in his own way, how to re-enact each scene, fully loaded with the emotions and the moral lessons embedded in them. And his family, despite the misgivings of their doctors, learned to connect with Owen through Disney as well.\\" The St. Louis Post- Dispatch called it a \\"wonderful book, whether or not you know a person with autism,\\" and asserted that, \\"without delving into too much statistical and informational overload, Suskind explains in a straightforward way many of the differences in how people with autism perceive and process information.\\" A chapter that was excerpted in the March 9th issue of the New York Times Magazine became the most emailed piece of the month. Suskind describes the positive response as a \\"giant warm wave\\" that differentiates this \\"personal\\" narrative from his others. He has since spoken to audiences at the United Nations and the NIH; testified in front of the United States Congress; and appeared on numerous TV and radio shows, including ABC's Good Morning America, NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams, CBS's Sunday Morning, NPR and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. On April 2, 2014, for World Autism Awareness Day, Ron spoke to the UN about his family's experience, stressing the need for government-funded research and support around the world. On April 7, The New York Times reported the methodology the family created, which they called \\"Affinity Therapy,\\" will be studied by researchers from MIT, Yale, and Cambridge University to try to understand the neural mechanisms at work and develop a manualized, therapeutic model harnessing affinities for those with autism. On October 17, 2014, in a feature column for The New York Times about her own autistic son's relationship with Siri, Apple's personal assistant software for iPhone, Judith Newman stated that Suskind \\"is talking to SRI (Stanford Research Institute) about having assistants for those with autism that can be programmed to speak in the voice of the character that reaches them.\\"  Films = Life, Animated  A&E; Indie Films announced in August 2014 that it is producing a documentary, directed by Academy Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams, on Owen and the Suskinds' story. This documentary, Life, Animated, was based on his book of the same name. It is co- produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Suskind executive produced the film. The film won two Emmy awards, and was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature.

He is a columnist with The Irish Times and The Sunday Business Post and a non- practising barrister. From 1996 until 2007, he presented a nightly talk-show on RTÉ Radio, Tonight with Vincent Browne, which focused on politics, the proceedings of tribunals on political corruption and police misconduct. From 2007 to 2017 he presented Tonight with Vincent Browne on TV3, which was broadcast from Monday to Thursday at 11:00pm.White, Michael. \\"An Irish election in a time of staggering debt and quiet rage\\".

He ducked last week's leaders debate on TV, ostensibly because its acerbic host, Vincent Browne, Ireland's Jeremy Paxman, had suggested he shoot himself, but actually because he's hopeless on TV.\\" Early life Born in 1944, he grew up in Broadford, County Limerick, where he attended the local national school. He spent a year at the Irish language college, Coláiste na Rinne in An Rinn, County Waterford, then a year at St. Mary's secondary school in Dromcolliher, County Limerick, before going to Castleknock College (1957–1962). He graduated from University College Dublin with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics and Economics. He also founded the oldest surviving UCD newspaper, the College Tribune, in 1989. He also served as UCD Young Fine Gael's Chairperson in 1968. Career He worked on RTÉ's The Late Late Show for five months in 1967–68. He reported on the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 for The Irish Times and then edited a monthly news magazine, Nusight in 1969–1970. He was appointed Northern news editor of The Irish Press group in 1970 (working for all three newspapers in the group, The Irish Press, the Evening Press and The Sunday Press) and covered the most intense and violent period of the Northern Ireland conflict. In 1974, he joined Independent Newspapers and, after a brief period in the Evening Herald, worked for the Sunday Independent, then edited by Conor O'Brien and later by Michael Hand. He launched Magill magazine in September 1977 with Noel Pearson and Mary Holland. Magill became Ireland's foremost investigative publication. Among its writers were Gene Kerrigan, Pat Brennan and Paddy Agnew. He remained editor of Magill until 1983, when he became involved in the relaunch of the Sunday Tribune with Tony Ryan, then of GPA and later of Ryanair. A series of articles he published in Magill highlighting the links between the Workers' Party of Ireland and the Official IRA in the 1980s caused him and other journalists to receive death threats. After the publication of \\"The Lost Revolution: the Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party\\" it was revealed that the Official IRA had planned to assassinate him by planting a bomb on his boat, but the operation was called off at the last minute. He was editor of the Sunday Tribune until 1994. He has written a weekly column for The Irish Times since then, and since 2000, has written weekly for The Sunday Business Post. He started broadcasting on RTÉ radio in 1996. In 1997, he relaunched Magill magazine, which had ceased publication in 1990. In the 13 issues he published then, the magazine broke several major stories. One led to the establishment of the Planning Tribunal, originally chaired by Mr Justice Fergus Flood; another caused a committee of the Oireachtas to examine the DIRT scandal; another caused an investigation of insurance \\"churning\\" by Irish Life, a leading Irish insurance company. He sold the Magill title to Hosen publisher, Mike Hogan, in November 1998. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1997 and for a while practised as a barrister. He no longer practices law. In October 2004, he launched a current affairs magazine, Village, of which he was editor. Village ceased publication in August 2008 before being re-launched under a new editor, Michael Smith. Browne now writes a column for Village magazine. He was involved in a controversy over the tapping of his telephone by the Irish state from February 1975 to February 1983. When this was disclosed by former minister for justice Seán Doherty, Browne sued the State. He made a settlement with the State in early 1997 which included an agreement to publish a statement on the settlement, stating, inter alia, that the State had intercepted his telephone conversations for reasons of State security — Browne had written much about the IRA in the early- to mid-1970s — while accepting that Browne had himself never been involved in subversion or crime. On being given access to the transcripts from 1981, Browne claimed that it was apparent the motivation for the interception of his telephone conversations for the eight-year period had little to do with the security of the State — it was aimed at garnering information on his work as a journalist, entirely aside from his reporting of the IRA. Browne sought to have the agreement altered to permit a public acknowledgement that the intercepts were not done for security reasons. The Fine Gael–Labour-Democratic Left coalition government refused. He subsequently disclosed this himself on television and later in print. For ten years he presented the programme Tonight with Vincent Browne on RTÉ Radio 1. In August 2000, he substituted for John Bowman on the RTÉ television programme Questions and Answers. He also presented Prime Time on RTÉ One. From 14 January 2007, he presented Tonight with Vincent Browne, a nightly current affairs television show on TV3 before stepping down from this role on 27 July 2017. Despite airing on what is usually considered a graveyard slot, the show was highly successful drawing up to 166,000 viewers.Nielsen Figures Confirm Tv3 Is the Only Terrestrial Channel to Grow Share TV3, 2010-03-02. In June 2012, Denis O'Brien wrote to Browne threatening to sue him. Browne disclosed this letter to the general public. Browne later wrote a piece for The Irish Times on why O'Brien \\"is not a fit person to control INM [Independent News & Media]\\". In it he questioned O'Brien's previous threats to sue Sam Smyth and asked \\"[H]ow plausible is it that the removal of Sam Smyth from a Sunday morning radio programme on Today FM, which Denis O'Brien controls, and his ostracisation now within the Irish Independent to which he is contracted (not one article by him has been published for some months), isn't part of the same campaign which Denis O'Brien and [one of his then representatives on the board of INM] Leslie Buckley, conducted against Sam Smyth in 2010?\\" In 2015, after asking were other members of the media wimps, he led a posse of journalists and camera crews into Gorse Hill, the up-market house at the centre of a legal battle. Politics Vincent Browne speaks as Richard Boyd Barrett watches on. In 1994, he sought a nomination for the Fine Gael party in that year's European elections or the possible general election of that year (it was thought a general election might follow the collapse of the Albert Reynolds' government). He was rebuffed by the leader of Fine Gael and future Taoiseach, John Bruton. He then became a vocal critic of the party.Our politicians and reality TV make unlikely bedfellows Sunday Independent, 2007-01-14.

He voted \\"No\\" in the 2012 Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum. In October 2012, while presenting Tonight with Vincent Browne, he said of Israel that it \\"polarises the Islamic community of the world against the rest of the world\\" and that it had stolen land from the Arabs. Israel's deputy ambassador to Ireland concluded these to be \\"racist, anti-Semitic remarks\\". Browne in turn said he was not anti-Semitic, but a critic of Israel, and himself criticised \\"the suggestion that because you're critical of Israel, you're automatically anti-Semitic. I don't think that's acceptable\\". Furthermore, Browne said it was \\"blackmail\\" to try to dismiss every critic of Israel as anti-Semitic. The BAI threw out the accusation of antisemitism, though it asked Browne to deliver an apology on TV3. He was a wedding guest of Fine Gael senator Jerry Buttimer. Personal life Browne is married and has two daughters.

A spin-off of the Final Fantasy series, the game shares several traits with 1997's Final Fantasy Tactics, although it is not a direct sequel. The player assembles a clan of characters, and controls their actions over grid-like battlefields. Players are mostly free to decide the classes, abilities, and statistics of their characters. The game's story centers on four children; Marche, Mewt, Ritz, and Doned, who live in a small town named St. Ivalice. The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town, \\"Ivalice\\", after discovering an ancient magical book. The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him. Tactics Advance is one of the initial products from the cooperation of Square and Nintendo made for the Game Boy Advance console; it was developed by the team brought over from the game company Quest Corporation. Following its release, Tactics Advance-themed merchandise was introduced. The game was positively received. It has a sequel, Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift for the Nintendo DS. Tactics Advance was re-released for the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console on January 28, 2016 for Europe, Australia and North America with Japan on March 30, 2016. Gameplay A screenshot of an early battle in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance In Tactics Advance, turn-based tactical battles take place on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly. Missions are tasks undertaken by a clan. There are four types of missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops. Some missions, typically dispatch missions, require a special item to be in possession in order to accept the mission. Others require a dispatch character to have a specific job class. In regards to items, this may mean another mission must be done to get an item that would allow you to perform the later mission. The world map is initially empty except for the starting location; it is customized as the player wins location \\"tokens\\" after certain missions. These tokens represent different terrains and settlements, such as plains, mountains, deserts, forests, and towns, that can be placed in slots on the world map. Items are rewarded to the player depending on the placement of the tokens. Ivalice also introduces areas called , lawless slums that Judges avoid. is a German word which means the hunt. are the only places in the game in which a character can die; everywhere else, they are protected from death by the Judges and are simply knocked out. Tactics Advance also offers multiplayer capability for two players. Players may cooperate or compete using a link-cable peripheral, and also trade items and party members. Additional missions and items are also offered when players link. Job system There are 34 \\"jobs\\" in Tactics Advance that govern a character's stats, equipment, and abilities. Most items that can be equipped have various abilities assigned to them, each available for use by characters of a certain job while the item is equipped. When a battle is completed, characters will receive Ability Points (AP) distributed over their currently equipped weapons or items (such as armor). Once a target amount of AP has been accumulated for a given ability, the character will master that ability, allowing the character to use them at any time, regardless of items equipped and job chosen. Mastery of abilities in different jobs will eventually allow the character access to more jobs. For example, if a human unit wishes to change jobs to Paladin, it needs to master at least two \\"action\\" abilities from the Soldier job. Units have a primary job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level up and the attributes associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, will not be allowed for use if the character has a Katana equipped. Tactics Advance also introduces five playable races: Humans, the small rodentlike Moogles, the strong lizard-like Bangaa, the agile rabbit-like Viera, and the magically- skilled Nu Mou. Certain jobs are only available to certain races. Along with the abilities obtained with experience, each race has a guardian beast called a \\"Totema\\" to represent whom and which can be summoned to whose aid when a member of that race has 10 Judge Points, that is after your clan has defeated that Totema as part of the main story line. Laws One arbitrary game mechanic of Tactics Advance is the Laws system. Laws are set by Judges, invincible arbiters present at each battle, with some exceptions. Laws may forbid the use of certain weapons, items, elemental spells, or status changes. Breaking a law results in punishment by Carding, the receipt of a red or yellow card. Imprisonment happens if a character infringes a law twice or knocks out another unit with a forbidden ability or weapon. However, have no Judges or laws; units knocked out in the will die and permanently leave the clan if they are not revived by the end of the battle. To offset the difficulty of having things forbidden for use, there are certain things that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains the ability to use law cards, which can add laws, and anti- law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect. Plot=Characters The story of Tactics Advance revolves around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, the main character who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world into the world of Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice. Within Ivalice, there are other characters that help advance the plot. Some characters befriended Marche, such as the moogles Montblanc and Nono; Ezel Berbier, a Nu Mou troublemaker and self-proclaimed genius; and Shara, a Viera archer who befriends Ritz. There are other characters who antagonize Marche, including Babus Swain, a Nu Mou Royal mage in Mewt's service; Llednar Twem, a mysterious enforcer who replaces the Judges when they become independent of the Palace; and Queen Remedi, who is the ruler of Ivalice and was in the Gran Grimoire itself in a form modeled after Mewt's deceased mother. Story Ivalice is a world created by four ordinary children: Marche Radiuju, a new student and resident of St. Ivalice and its school; Mewt Randell, a shy boy still attached to the memory of his late mother; Ritz Malheur, an assertive and outspoken classmate of Marche and Mewt; and Doned Radiuju, Marche's younger, handicapped brother and a big fan of fantasy novels and video games. Mewt comes across a dusty old tome in a local used bookstore and eagerly wishes to show it to his friends. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the book over to Marche's house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have ever seen before, and a single inscription reads: \\"Alta oron, Sondus kameela\\".Marche: I can't read these letters at all! Maybe they're some kind of magic spell! / [...] / Mewt: .....Alta oron. Sondus kameela...It sure sounds like magic! The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt's memories from a Final Fantasy game.Marche: Well, it's just...I've seen a bangaa, but in a computer game, not real life! / Moogle: Kupo? / Marche: It's called \\"Final Fantasy.\\" It's not real. Not really. It's like a pretend world, with heroes and monsters... / Moogle: So you're saying here is just like your pretend world? / Marche: Yeah, come to think of it, it's just like in the game! Marche is separated from the others, and immediately begins a quest to return home. Even after realizing how much better his life is in the new Ivalice, he believes that none of it is real and is even more determined to return to his home when he realizes that everyone in town has been dragged into the dream as well, many of whom are now suffering under Mewt's rule or are being slaughtered by the adventuring Clans that populate the world.Marche: What? You mean you'd rather stay here? / Ritz: Yeah. I like this world. Don't you, Marche? / Marche: Well, I... / Ritz: If you want to turn everything back to normal... Go ahead. But don't expect me to help you. The other children, and Mewt's father Cid, slowly realize through Marche's efforts that the world has been shaped according to their wishes. Mewt is no longer being teased, is reunited with his deceased mother, and is now the Prince of Ivalice; Ritz no longer has her white albinic hair, instead having the silky red hair which she always wanted; Doned can now walk and is no longer sickly; Marche is suddenly athletic and popular; Cid is the highest-ranking official in the nation; and all of them now live in Final Fantasy, the video game the children all love.Marche: Mewt? Prince Mewt? \\"My world\\"? This world must be a reflection of Mewt's desires! His mom's still alive, everyone does what he says..... I'm living in Mewt's dream! So if I change the world back to the way it was... I'm destroying his dream world! No wonder he doesn't want me here... Eventually Marche succeeds in his quest to return Ivalice to normal. He achieves this by destroying the crystals, or world threads, of Ivalice, defeating Llednar Twem (the manifestation of Mewt's negative emotions), and killing the Li-Grim, the physical manifestation of the book's wish-based magic that had been masquerading as Mewt's mother, Queen Remedi.Marche: I came to destroy that crystal... or World-Thread or whatever you call it. And I'm not leaving until I do! He teaches the other children in the process that they cannot live in fantasy but must learn to live with their misfortunes in reality. The other children are wiser from the experience, as the ending reveals them all to have become happy with themselves. In addition to the main plot, there are two side plots: the Redwing Arc and the Judge Arc. The Redwing Arc centers around the Redwings clan, a foreign crime ring, their subordinate clan Borzoi, and their smuggled foreign monsters. The other is the Judge Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions. This serves as an alternative ending where Marche never goes on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt judges, and becomes next in line for Cid's judge sword.Marche: It's over. / Cid: Thank you, Marche. You went above and beyond the call of duty. Marche: Not at all! I was glad I was able to help. / Cid: You know... / Marche: What? / Cid: I would give you my judge sword. Development Rumors of the game's development began when Square announced its publishing agreement with Nintendo, and it was later confirmed by the producer Matsuno. The development team of Tactics Advance, Square's Product Development Division 4, was constructed from employees of Quest Corporation, and work began in February 2002. This comes after Quest announced the handover of its software development team to Square, of which the former is famed for its Tactics Ogre series. Initially thought of as a port of Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Advance is developed with an entirely new storyline and setting, and received significant changes to make it more user-friendly for the GBA handheld console; e.g. a quick-save function. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance uses the gameplay of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain changes such as a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance's graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames have been given to create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work. In Japan, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance's story was expanded and broadcast in Japanese radio stations. The radio drama entitled Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Radio Edition was broadcast in four radio stations within Japan from early January 2003 to late March 2003. Music The music in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was primarily composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album was released by DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as it sounds through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into MIDI file format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, and there are no voices or speech within the game. Reception Final Fantasy Tactics Advance sold over 440,000 copies during its year of release in Japan, with nearly 225,000 units being sold in its first week alone. By August 6, 2004, more than 1 million units of the game were sold in North America and Europe together. In the United States alone, the game sold 660,000 copies and earned $22 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 40th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country. The game was well received among the gaming community, widely regarded to feature an outstanding combination of music, graphics, gameplay, and storyline. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance won Best Handheld Game at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2004. It was also rated as outstanding by IGN (9.0 out of 10) and given 5 out of 5 by GameSpy. In 2007, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was named 14th best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's long lifespan. It was also rated the 67th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list. Reviewers were pleased with graphics and visuals of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; GameSpot adding that the battles are \\"clear and colorful\\", and character jobs are easily identified, though gameplay becomes slow when too many character sprites are in one screen. The gameplay is also lauded for retaining the elements of Tactics Ogre yet offers freedom to players to develop characters as they wish. GameNOW said that the game \\"lives up to its legacy—and then some\\", and called it \\"easily one of the best GBA games around\\". Criticism was thrown to the game's menu, which was cluttered with complicated options in organizing the clan members, and did not detail out statistics for characters and equipment. Some reviewers thought there are too many character jobs since some jobs overlap one another and certain abilities are redundant. Legacy In 2007, a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was released for the Nintendo DS as part of the Ivalice Alliance series, Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift. While the story focuses on different characters than Advance, several characters from the game appear in cameo roles, such as Montblanc and Mewt. Montblanc also appears in Final Fantasy XII as the leader of Clan Centurio. To commemorate the release of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance in Japan, several pieces of merchandise were introduced exclusive for the region: web money cards, posters, character card collections and a set of twenty pin badges. Square and Nintendo also announced a limited-edition Final Fantasy Tactics Advance-themed Game Boy Advance SP package to commemorate the game and the console's launching in February 2003. A Japanese-exclusive adaptation of the game's story in radio drama form was also released. It was aired in January to March 2003. The series was released by DigiCube on CD in four separate parts, with some changes to plot details.

His most famous work is 'Gunslinger'. Overview Dorn was born in Villa Grove, Illinois. He grew up in rural poverty during the Great Depression. He attended a one-room schoolhouse for his first eight grades. He later studied at the University of Illinois and at Black Mountain College (1950–55). At Black Mountain he came into contact with Charles Olson, who greatly influenced his literary worldview and his sense of himself as poet. Dorn's final examiner at Black Mountain was Robert Creeley, with whom, along with the poet Robert Duncan, Dorn became included as one of a trio of younger poets later associated with Black Mountain and with Charles Olson.The Lost America of Love, by Sherman Paul, celebrates this relationship, as did the Charles Olson conference held under Paul's direction at the University of Iowa in 1978, in which Dorn, Duncan, and Creeley were the only poets participating among a flurry of academic literary scholars. Dorn is now considered by some commentators to be the inheritor of Olson's bardic mantle, the transmittee of the lamp. In 1951, Dorn left Black Mountain and traveled to the Pacific Northwest, where he did manual labor and met his first wife, Helene; they returned to the school in late 1954. After graduation and two years of travel, Dorn's family settled in Washington state, the setting for his autobiographical novel By the Sound (originally published as Rites of Passage), which describes the grinding poverty of life in \\"the basement stratum of society.\\" In 1961 he accepted his first teaching job at Idaho State University, where he published the magazine Wild Dog. His first book of poetry, The Newly Fallen, was published by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961. In 1965, with the photographer Leroy Lucas, Dorn spent the summer visiting Indian reservations for a book commissioned by William Morrow & Co. Press, The Shoshoneans. That fall, British poet and scholar Donald Davie invited him to join the faculty at the Literature Department he was creating at the new University of Essex. He spent most of the next five years in England, where he published several collections of poems and wrote Book 1 of Gunslinger. He also started working with Gordon Brotherston on translations from Latin American texts, solidified his close friendship with British poet J.H. Prynne, and met his second wife, Jennifer Dunbar. On returning to the United States, Dorn spent the 1970s as an academic migrant, teaching at over half a dozen universities across the country. In San Francisco, he collaborated with the printer and artist team of (Holbrook) Teter and (Michael) Myers on a number of projects, including the Bean News, the comic book format of Recollections of Gran Apachería', and the typesetting of the complete Gunslinger in 1974. In 1977 Dorn accepted a professorship at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he taught for the rest of his life, directing the Creative Writing Program and editing the literary newspaper Rolling Stock (motto: “If It Moves Print It”) with his wife Jennifer. During the 1990s, after a teaching exchange visit to Paul Valery University in Montpellier inspired an interest in the Cathars of Southern France, he started working on Languedoc Variorum: A Defense of Heresy and Heretics. He was also writing another long narrative poem Westward Haut. During the last two and a half years of his life, he wrote the poems for the posthumously published Chemo Sabe, reporting on his cancer treatments. Dorn's main work, his magnum opus, is 'Gunslinger'. Gunslinger is a long poem in five sections. Part 1 was first published in 1968, and the final complete text appeared in 1974. Other important publications include The Collected Poems: 1956-1974 (1975), Recollections of Gran Apacheria (1975), Abhorrences (1989), High West Rendezvous: A Sampler (1997), and [Way More West: New and Selected Poems] (2008). Popular horror novelist Stephen King admired Dorn, describing his poetry as \\"talismans of perfect writing\\" and even naming the first novel of The Dark Tower series, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" in honor of Dorn's poem.The Dark Tower (series), jacketmagazine.com; accessed July 22, 2015. King opened both the prologue and epilogue of \\"The Stand\\" with Dorn's line, \\"We need help, the Poet reckoned.\\"King, Stephen. The Stand. New York; New American Library Publishing, 1990 Unabridged Paperback Edition. pp xix, 1136. Death Dorn died of pancreatic cancer on December 10, 1999 in Denver, Colorado. His papers are collected at the University of Connecticut as well as at Indiana University at Bloomington. Dorn's teaching career During his life, Dorn taught at a number of institutions of higher learning, including Idaho State University at Pocatello (1961–65); the University of Essex in England (1965-1970) as a Fulbright lecturer; Northeastern Illinois University at Chicago (1970-1971); Kent State University, Ohio (1973–74); and the University of Colorado (1977-1999). His second wife, Jennifer Dunbar Dorn, is an Englishwoman he met during his Essex-years. In the early 1970s, as a visiting poet at Kent State University, Dorn, along with British poet and editor Eric Mottram, was a mentor and supporter of the musical group Devo, and its founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis.

It has a population of about 42,000 and is mainly influenced by the small distance to the more industrial and commercially important cities nearby, Brunswick and Wolfsburg. Further, Gifhorn is part of the Hanover-Brunswick-Göttingen-Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. The Municipality Gifhorn includes the villages of Gamsen, Gifhorn, Kästorf, Neubokel, Wilsche and Winkel. The oldest verifiable source attests the existence of the city in the year 1196. Gifhorn is home to the International Wind- and Watermill Museum, which contains a comprehensive collection and working replicas of the world's most common windmills. Geography Gifhorn lies at the confluence of the Rivers Ise and Aller. Gifhorn is situated about north of the city of Brunswick and about west of Wolfsburg. In the city, the Bundesstraße 4 and 188 meet. At the northern end of the city, the Lüneburg Heath starts. History Gifhorn was first mentioned in 1196. It was located at the crossing of two then important merchant routes: the salt street () being a main trading route for salt between Lüneburg and Brunswick, and the grain street () transporting grain between Celle and Magdeburg. Education Schools in Gifhorn include the Humboldt Gymnasium, the Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium, Fritz-Reuter-Realschule, Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Realschule, Albert-Schweitzer- Hauptschule and the Berufsbildenden Schulen I and II.

He was Jets' owner Sonny Werblin's first coup, prior to his 1965 acquisition of Joe Namath. A powerful fullback out of Ohio State University, Snell's 1964 signing jolted the crosstown Giants, who didn't draft Snell until the fourth round, and offered him a fraction of what the Jets gave him as their first-round choice. Early career Born to Isaac and Annie, Snell attended Carle Place High School in the one-square-mile town of Carle Place, New York, where his picture resides in the Carle Place High School Athletic Hall of Fame. Snell played right halfback on a team that lost only two games while he started. He was awarded Newsdays Thorp Award for 1959 as the outstanding high school football player in Nassau County. At Ohio State University, Snell was a three-year starter and a consummate team player, active on both sides of the ball. In 1961, he played right halfback, often blocking for fullback Bob Ferguson or left halfback Paul Warfield. In 1962, Snell was moved to defensive end. In 1963, Snell's senior year, he was named starting fullback. At the end of his senior season, Snell was named his team's most valuable player. Snell was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000 as a defensive end. Football career In his rookie year with the New York Jets, Snell rushed for a team-record 180 yards against the Houston Oilers on his way to a 945-yard season and AFL Rookie of the Year honors. Snell went on to become an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1964 and 1966, and the Sporting News All-AFL fullback in 1969. Snell's defining moment came in Super Bowl III when the AFL champion Jets played the heavily-favored NFL champion Baltimore Colts. Although slowed by knee injuries, Snell was a key player in the Jets' ball-control offense during the 16–7 upset victory. He carried the ball 30 times for a then-Super Bowl record 121 yards, and in the second quarter went four yards around left end to score the Jets' only touchdown, a score that marked the first time an AFL team had led in a Super Bowl. He also helped set up a trio of Jim Turner field goals that finally put the game away for the Jets in the second half, securing the AFL's first Super Bowl win in the league's penultimate season. During his career, Snell was well known for his rushing, but also became an important part of the Jets' pass- blocking scheme. Toward the end of his career, Snell became one of the first third-down specialty backs, primarily because he was so good at protecting Joe Namath. He was also reported to have helped teach pass-blocking to Jets running backs during his career. Snell suffered multiple injuries in his career, including torn knee cartilage in 1967 and a torn Achilles tendon in 1970. In 1971, he hurt his knee in the preseason and was diagnosed with a severe \\"knee bruise\\" and missed nine games. In 1972, in Week 4 versus the Miami Dolphins, he suffered a ruptured spleen. The injury was so severe that his spleen had to be removed, ending his season. He decided right then that he couldn't play anymore, though he didn't formally announce his retirement until the following March. He only played in a total of 12 games in what would be his final three seasons. Post-football In 1973, Snell appeared in the first Miller Lite beer commercial. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"The campaign would feature a collection of middle-aged sports stars and become something of a status symbol for retired athletes for the next 17 years.\\" After his playing career in 1973, he sold his restaurant, Matt Snell's Fifth Down, to focus on his new company, Defco Securities, Inc. (of which he is one of the four partners). Snell and Emerson Boozer were inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor on November 29, 2015 because they were partners in each other's success and that of the team. Snell has not accepted the Jets' invitation to participate in the ceremony at MetLife Stadium, just as he consistently has refused the club's invitations to other alumni events for unspecified reasons ever since he retired. In 2018, Snell revealed that the reason he hasn't spoken to the Jets was because the team's owner at the time he left, Leon Hess, refused to give him a reference for a future job in spite of both being promised he would receive one, and in spite of his work to build the team's success over his professional football career. Personal life Snell lives in New Rochelle, New York with his wife Sharon, son Beau and daughter Jada. His grandson Donte is currently the starting safety for Holy Cross High School. He is a partner in DEFCO Securities, Inc. and owns a restaurant in New York City. He is the first cousin, twice removed of running back Benny Snell Jr., with Benny Snell's grandfather being his first cousin.

It involves the calculation of the mean after discarding given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end, and typically discarding an equal amount of both. This number of points to be discarded is usually given as a percentage of the total number of points, but may also be given as a fixed number of points. For most statistical applications, 5 to 25 percent of the ends are discarded. For example, given a set of 8 points, trimming by 12.5% would discard the minimum and maximum value in the sample: the smallest and largest values, and would compute the mean of the remaining 6 points. The 25% trimmed mean (when the lowest 25% and the highest 25% are discarded) is known as the interquartile mean. The median can be regarded as a fully truncated mean and is most robust. As with other trimmed estimators, the main advantage of the trimmed mean is robustness and higher efficiency for mixed distributions and heavy-tailed distribution (like the Cauchy distribution), at the cost of lower efficiency for some other less heavily-tailed distributions (such as the normal distribution). For intermediate distributions the differences between the efficiency of the mean and the median are not very big, e.g. for the student-t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom the variances for mean and median are nearly equal. Terminology In some regions of Central Europe it is also known as a Windsor mean, but this name should not be confused with the Winsorized mean: in the latter, the observations that the trimmed mean would discard are instead replaced by the largest/smallest of the remaining values. Discarding only the maximum and minimum is known as the ', particularly in management statistics.Arulmozhi, G.; Statistics For Management, 2nd Edition, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2009, p. 458 This is also known as the ' (for example in US agriculture, like the Average Crop Revenue Election), due to its use in Olympic events, such as the ISU Judging System in figure skating, to make the score robust to a single outlier judge. Interpolation When the percentage of points to discard does not yield a whole number, the trimmed mean may be defined by interpolation, generally linear interpolation, between the nearest whole numbers. For example, if you need to calculate the 15% trimmed mean of a sample containing 10 entries, strictly this would mean discarding 1 point from each end (equivalent to the 10% trimmed mean). If interpolating, one would instead compute the 10% trimmed mean (discarding 1 point from each end) and the 20% trimmed mean (discarding 2 points from each end), and then interpolating, in this case averaging these two values. Similarly, if interpolating the 12% trimmed mean, one would take the weighted average: weight the 10% trimmed mean by 0.8 and the 20% trimmed mean by 0.2. Advantages The truncated mean is a useful estimator because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean but will still give a reasonable estimate of central tendency or mean for many statistical models. In this regard it is referred to as a robust estimator. For example, in its use in Olympic judging, truncating the maximum and minimum prevents a single judge from increasing or lowering the overall score by giving an exceptionally high or low score. One situation in which it can be advantageous to use a truncated mean is when estimating the location parameter of a Cauchy distribution, a bell shaped probability distribution with (much) fatter tails than a normal distribution. It can be shown that the truncated mean of the middle 24% sample order statistics (i.e., truncate the sample by 38% at each end) produces an estimate for the population location parameter that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean. However, due to the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases as more of the sample gets used in the estimate. Note that for the Cauchy distribution, neither the truncated mean, full sample mean or sample median represents a maximum likelihood estimator, nor are any as asymptotically efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator; however, the maximum likelihood estimate is more difficult to compute, leaving the truncated mean as a useful alternative. Drawbacks The truncated mean uses more information from the distribution or sample than the median, but unless the underlying distribution is symmetric, the truncated mean of a sample is unlikely to produce an unbiased estimator for either the mean or the median. Statistical tests It is possible to perform a Student's t-test based on the truncated mean, which is called Yuen's t-test Yuen, K.K. (1974) The two-sample trimmed t for unequal population variances.

Academic Press., which also has several implementations in R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WRS2/https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DescTools/ Examples The scoring method used in many sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges is a truncated mean: discard the lowest and the highest scores; calculate the mean value of the remaining scores. The Libor benchmark interest rate is calculated as a trimmed mean: given 18 response, the top 4 and bottom 4 are discarded, and the remaining 10 are averaged (yielding trim factor of 4/18 ≈ 22%). Consider the data set consisting of: :{92, 19, 101, 58, 1053, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, −40, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, −5, 41} (N = 20, mean = 101.5) The 5th percentile (−6.75) lies between −40 and −5, while the 95th percentile (148.6) lies between 101 and 1053 (values shown in bold). Then, a 5% trimmed mean would result in the following: :{92, 19, 101, 58, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, −5, 41} (N = 18, mean = 56.5) This example can be compared with the one using the Winsorising procedure.

He is considered one of the most important Brazilian painters as well as a prominent and influential practitioner of the neo-realism style in painting. Portinari painted more than five thousand canvases, from small sketches to monumental works such as the Guerra e Paz panels, which were donated to the United Nations Headquarters in 1956. Portinari developed a social preoccupation throughout his oeuvre and maintained an active life in the Brazilian cultural and political worlds. Life and career Born to Giovan Battista Portinari and Domenica Torquato, Italian immigrants from Chiampo Vicenza, Veneto, in a coffee plantation near Brodowski, in São Paulo. Growing up on a coffee plantation of dark soil and blue sky, Portinari gained his inspiration from the homeland he loved. In the majority of his later paintings, murals and frescoes, he used the colour blue and many browns and reds because this was the color of his home. One of Portinari's beginner jobs was drawing photographs where he closely captured the exact image using paints and then enlarging the photos. These sold successfully because the resemblance was astounding. Portinari then studied at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (National School of Fine Arts) in Rio de Janeiro. In 1923, 1925 and 1927 Portinari won prizes at the Salon, and in 1928 he got a scholarship offered by the Brazilian government to study in Europe for three years. These visits significantly influenced Portinari. Portinari studied various European artwork, visited museums and during his travels met his future wife, Maria Martinelli. Throughout his time traveling, he didn't paint much but studied and possibly seeing life elsewhere, hoped to better his homeland as well. He came back to Brazil fully set on conveying the true Brazilian lifestyle and capturing the pain and struggles of his people through his art.http://www.portinari.org.br/#/pagina/candido-portinari/apresentacao After his return, Portinari began portraying the reality of Brazil, from its natural beauties to the harsh lives of the country's most impoverished populations, pursuing an amalgamation of his academic formation with the modernist avant- gardes. Portinari remained himself and didn't allow his new experiences and new outlooks change him. His roots remained important to him and he strove to portray this in his paintings; the true Brazilian spirit. He wanted the world to see the harsh reality of living conditions in Brazil and the struggle for survival. Strength, hard work, independence and authenticity shows through in almost every one of his works. In 1939, Portinari exposed at the New York World's Fair. In the following year, Portinari had for the first time a canvas exposed at the Museum of Modern Art. The rise of fascism in Europe, the wars and the close contact with Brazilian problematic society, reaffirmed the social character of his work, as well as conducting him to political engagement. He joined the Brazilian Communist Party and stood for deputy in 1945ABREU, Alzira Alves de. Dicionário Histórico-Biográfico Brasileiro. Rio de Janeiro; Fundação Getúlio Vargas; 2004. and for senator in 1947,Candido Portinari[1]Galeria de Arte André. but had to flee for Uruguay due to the persecution of communists during the government of Eurico Gaspar Dutra. In 1951, the first São Paulo Art Biennial dedicated a special room for his works. He returned to Brazil in the following year, after a declaration of general amnesty from the government. In 1956, after the United Nations had appealed to its affiliated countries for the donation of a work of art to the organization's new headquarters. Brazil designated Portinari for the task, who took four years and around 180 studies to complete the painting. Dag Hammarskjöld, UN Secretary-General, named the work \\"the most important monumental work of art donated to the UN\\". Even after being warned by the doctor of the risks of the toxins and poisoning, he didn't give up and continued to paint. Portinari suffered from ill health during the last decade of his life. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1962 in result of lead poisoning from his paints. On December 20, 2007, his painting ' was stolen from the São Paulo Museum of Art along with Pablo Picasso's Portrait of Suzanne Bloch. The paintings remained missing until January 8, 2008, when they were recovered in Ferraz de Vasconcelos by the Police of São Paulo. The paintings were returned, undamaged, to the São Paulo Museum of Art. There were a number of commemorative events in the centenary of his birth in 2003, including an exhibition of his work in London. Style Study for Discovery of the Land mural at the United States Library of Congress A 1989 Brazilian banknote featuring Portinari on both sides Portinari's works comprehend a strong will to represent Brazilian people and their traits. Portinari himself said he would \\"paint that people with that clothing and that color\\". According to Antonio Callado, Portinari's oeuvre demonstrate a \\"monumental book of art which teaches Brazilians to love more their land\\". Portinari was capable of transcending his original academic formation by experiencing with and absorbing modernist techniques and styles, which fundamentally created his painting personality. The range and sweep of his output includes paintings depicting rural and urban labour, refugees fleeing the hardships of Brazil's rural north-east; and, despite these major and better known aspects of his work, treatments of the key events in the history of Brazil since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, images of childhood, portraits of members of his family and leading Brazilian intellectuals, illustrations for books and tiles decorating the Church of São Francisco at Pampulha, Belo Horizonte. His career coincided with and included collaboration with Oscar Niemeyer amongst others. Portinari's works can be found in galleries and settings in Brazil and abroad, ranging from the family chapel in his childhood home in Brodowski to his panels Guerra e Paz (War and Peace) in the United Nations building in New York and four murals in the Hispanic Reading Room of the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.  Contribution to Brazilian modernism  As previously mentioned, Candido Portinari came from a poor immigrant family.Bento, Antônio. Portinari. Rio de Janeiro: Léo Christiano Editorial, 1982. This allowed him to have a unique perspective on Brazilian culture and what it meant to truly Brazilian. This is important because he was a prominent artist during the Brazilian Modernism era.Barnitz, Jacqueline, and Patrick Frank. Twentieth- century art of Latin America. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2015. As such, his perspective gave a more proud and dignified view of the workers at that time. While other artists like Lasar Segall with Bananal and Tarsila do Amaral with Workers provided a picture of the workers that removed personality and made each individual anonymous, Portinari did the opposite. For example, in his painting, The Mestizo, he paints a character that looks strong, competent, and noble. In this, he is demonstrating that the workers were not broken. Instead, they were proud and independent. Portinari used his culture and life experience to add to the explanation of what Brazil is in a distinctive style.  Murals  In Cocoa (1938) Portinari depicts workers on the coffee plantations. A woman is seen in the back balancing a crate on her head and there is a child in the painting. This was meant to signify that children were present during this hard work as well, and were encouraged to help the parents. Land was given to families in return for their labor on the plantations where they took care of their share. Here too is included the use of blues and oranges to truly capture the significance of Brazil, which was Portinari's desire. This artwork was described by saying “Brazil is being rescued from obscurity by ‘Portinari’s Coffee’.” Coffee (National Museum of Fine Arts, 1935) represents strong and resourceful workers. Their big hands and feet show they were strong and did not fear hard work. The people worked together to preserve their lands and survive. This painting is also a great depiction of “realism” because of how he captures his people with the short bodies, rounder heads and the brown and red hues of the land. In The Mestizo (1934) he tries to present not just a portrait but an individual type of person. Portinari shows that Brazilian workers were tough and proud of their work because in the background of the Mestizo are seen the fields and all their hard work; his proud stance portrays confidence and strength. War and Peace (Guerra and Paz; Gustavo Capanema Palace in Rio de Janeiro; 1952–56) was a mural created when the United Nations asked Brazil to donate a work of art. Portinari created two murals to show war, agony, fear and pain that showed how the people suffered and were affected during the war. His use of blue hues in War created a contrast between the lighter yellows in Peace. The second was meant to express peace and happiness. Bento Antonio in his book Portinari, describes this work as, “a sort of innocent vision of paradise.” With this mural, he also meant to connect different racial groups and show peace among the variety of individuals. There was a large variety of ethnicities that lived in Brazil at this time. His works were meant to create a bridge between the multicultural individuals. This work is located in the United Nations General Assembly building in New York which was created in remembrance to World War II and its horrors. It was meant to resemble something that should never occur again. Here, visitors come witnessing an epitome of war and leave realizing that peace is indeed attainable. “Guerra and Paz are the synthesis of an entire life committed to human beings. His painting, like his militant political views, spoke out against injustice, violence and misery in the world per his son, João Candido Portinari. In the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress, Washington D.C. are located four murals that Portinari did in 1941 depicting the struggles of the Hispanic Americans. Discovery of the Land, Entry into the Forest, Teaching of the Indians, and Discovery of Gold are all meant to represent the coming of the Spaniards and Portuguese to America and took him two months to complete with the help of his brother Luiz. The Discovery of the Land is meant to show common sailors that sailed the boats. Entry in the Forest is the “reminiscent of frescoes” where he also doesn't fail to capture his style of enlarging the figures’ arms and legs to show their strength. In the Teaching of the Indians, Portinari tries to create a scene of a priest or Spanish “Jesuit father” with Indians and obvious unity. Also the presence of the red Brazilian soil. The last mural, Discovery of Gold the artist chooses to paint just a single boat and specific people to represent that they had found gold. The Brazilian government paid for Portinari to travel to Washington to create the murals and represent their country.  Legacy  Portinari once said, “I am the Son of the Red Earth. I decided to paint the Brazilian reality, naked and crude as it is.” Life in Brazil wasn't easy for Portinari, especially considering he was never wealthy, but his desire to show proof of this reality is evident in all his artworks. Poor housing, inadequate nutrition, no education, little or no healthcare access and various diseases created desperate situations for the Brazilian people who struggled to survive. This led to Portinari's desire to raise global awareness of the human pain which he tried to depict in almost every painting. Portinari also greatly affected the future Brazilian generation of artists, musicians, poets and composers. Having vastly traveled Europe, studying their art, their technique and styles, he came back to Brazil hoping to create his personal method and interpret his own style. Instead of continuing to imitate the European appearance, Portinari painted what he experienced and his life. Portinari's works urged emerging artists to pursue their own, unique style particular to their lives, experiences and reality in their country. This is also another reason blues, reds, and oranges were so commonly used in his art; the colors of his homeland. Projeto Portinari, begun in 1979 is dedicated to Candido Portinari by his son Joao Candido to revive his works, make them more known and preserve the history. Not only was his son able to locate more than 5,000 paintings, he also found thousands of drawings, sketches, and documents related to Portinari's life and travels and interactions. The Catalogue Raisonné of Portinari's complete works was published in 2004. It was the first Raisonné covering the complete works of a Latin American painter. “Projeto Portinari” also curated the first retrospective exhibition of Portinari's oeuvre, at the “Museu de Arte de São Paulo - MASP”, in 1997. Nicolás Guillén’s and Horacio Salinas’s ‘Un son para Portinari’, famously performed by Mercedes Sosa, is dedicated to the artist. Candido Portinari name continues to be seen today.

The series was based upon a concept created by Edward Packard and originally published by Constance Cappel's and R. A. Montgomery's Vermont Crossroads Press as the \\"Adventures of You\\" series, starting with Packard's Sugarcane Island in 1976. Choose Your Own Adventure, as published by Bantam Books, was one of the most popular children's series during the 1980s and 1990s, selling more than 250 million copies between 1979 and 1998. When Bantam, now owned by Random House, allowed the Choose Your Own Adventure trademark to lapse, the series was relaunched by Chooseco, which now owns the trademark. Chooseco does not reissue titles by Packard, who has started his own imprint, U-Ventures. In June 2018, Z-Man Games issued a licensed co-operative board game called Choose Your Own Adventure: House of Danger inspired by R. A. Montgomery's book in the series. On January 11, 2019, Chooseco initiated a trademark infringement legal challenge against Netflix for the film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.  Format  Originally created for 7- to 14-year-olds, the books are written in the second person. The protagonist—that is, the reader—takes on a role relevant to the adventure, such as a private investigator, mountain climber, race car driver, doctor, or spy. Stories are generally gender- and race-neutral, though in some cases, particularly in illustrations, there is the presumption of a male reader (the target demographic group). In some stories, the protagonist is implied to be a child, whereas in other stories, they are an adult. The stories are formatted so that, after a couple of pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings. The number of endings is not set, and varies from as many as 44 in the early titles to as few as 8 in later adventures. Likewise, there is no clear pattern among the various titles regarding the number of pages per ending, the ratio of good to bad endings, or the reader's progression backwards and forwards through the pages of the book. This allows for a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings, which is one of the distinguishing features of the books. As the series progressed, both Packard and Montgomery experimented with the gamebook format, sometimes introducing unexpected twists such as endless page loops or trick endings. Examples include the \\"paradise planet\\" ending in Inside UFO 54-40, which can only be reached by cheating or turning to the wrong page by accident, and the potentially endless storyline in The Race Forever.  History  According to Packard, the core idea for the series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, revolving around a character named Pete and his adventures. Packard stated, \\"I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But that night I was running out of things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do.\\" His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending for each of the paths. \\"What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'\\" Packard soon developed this basic premise into a manuscript titled The Adventures of You on Sugar Cane Island. He set out in 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, he was able to convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed to Pocket Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able to make a contract for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to write books for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors. The famous phrase “Choose Your Own Adventure” was born when Ed Packard sold his second and third books. The second, Deadwood City, was a Western saga, and junior editor Dinah Stevenson was given the assignment to create a jacket line that would explain this unfamiliar narrative style to readers; Stevenson came up with “Choose your own adventure in the Wild West.” The phrase was adapted for the next title with the tag line, The Third Planet from Altair: Choose your own adventure in outer space. The series was highly successful after it began printing with Bantam Books. It prompted the creation of three other series by authors with Bantam Books that worked with the same format. Nineteen other series of the same format began being published by rival publishing houses. The large popularity of the concept led to the titling of a new genre of writing for the format, which was called the gamebook.

History The Athens News Agency (ANA) is the national news agency of Greece. Founded in 1895 as a private company, the Stefanopoli Telegraphic Agency, the Greek State assumed its subsidisation in 1905, at which time it acquired its present name. In 1994 the ANA became a Societe Anonyme with a 7-member Board of Directors, three of whom are appointed by the government and one each by the journalist unions of Athens and Thessaloniki, the publishers' union and the ANA employees. ANA collaborates with the international news agencies Reuters, Agence France-Presse, DPA, ITAR-TASS and a number of national news agencies, as well as the EPA photograph agency. All the ANA services are on-line, with an estimated 350 news items in Greek and 60-70 items in English updated daily. It also publishes an English 'Electronic Daily News Bulletin' containing all the Greek news.

Prior to the war the ship operated as a passenger and cargo vessel traveling mainly between Asia and South America. Ship history Montevideo Maru was one of three ships (along with Santos Maru and La Plata Maru) of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK) shipping line built for their trans-Pacific service to South America. The 7,267 ton ship was constructed at the Mitsubishi Zosen Kakoki Kaisha shipyard at Nagasaki, and launched in 1926. At in length, and in the beam, she was powered by two Mitsubishi-Sulzer 6ST60 six-cylinder diesel engines delivering a total of and giving her a speed of . Sinking On 22 June 1942, some weeks after the fall of Rabaul to the Japanese, many Australian prisoners were embarked from Rabaul's port onto Montevideo Maru. Unmarked as a POW ship, she was proceeding without escort to the Chinese island of Hainan when she was sighted by the American submarine near the northern Philippine coast on 30 June. Sturgeon pursued, but was unable to fire, as the target was traveling at . However, it slowed to about at midnight; according to crewman Yoshiaki Yamaji, it was to rendezvous with an escort of two destroyers. Unaware that it was carrying Allied prisoners of war and civilians, Sturgeon fired four torpedoes at Montevideo Maru before dawn of 1 July, causing the vessel to sink in only 11 minutes. According to Yamaji, Australians in the water sang \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" to their trapped mates as the ship sank beneath the waves. The sinking is considered the worst maritime disaster in Australia's history. A nominal list made available by the Japanese government in 2012 revealed that a total of 1054 prisoners (178 non-commissioned officers, 667 soldiers and 209 civilians) died on the Montevideo Maru; there were no survivors among the prisoners. Of the ship's total complement, approximately twenty Japanese crew survived, out of an original 88 guards and crew. Among the missing prisoners were: *Harold Page, deputy administrator of New Guinea and brother of Australian prime minister Earle Page. *Reverend Syd Beazley of the Methodist Mission, the uncle of future Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley. * Tom Vernon Garrett, the grandfather of Midnight Oil lead singer and government minister Peter Garrett. * 22 Salvation Army bandsmen, the majority being members of the Brunswick Citadel band.One Bloke's Story, Rob Mitchell, page 22 The bandsmen had enlisted together and comprised the majority of the band of the 2/22nd Battalion. Memorials A memorial to those who lost their lives was erected at the Repatriation Hospital, Bell Street, Heidelberg, Melbourne, Victoria (Australia). A Montevideo Maru memorial has also been erected near the centre of the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat, Victoria. A commemoration service was held at the unveiling of the memorial on 7 February 2004.Montevideo Maru, Lost Lives quoting Margaret Reeson, A Very Long War: The Families Who Waited, MUP, 2000. Retrieved 29 January 2010 In late January 2010, Federal Member of Parliament, Stuart Robert, called upon the then Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, to back the search for Montevideo Maru, in the same way that he had supported the search for AHS Centaur. The song \\"In the Valley\\" from the album Earth and Sun and Moon by Australian pop/rock band Midnight Oil opens with the autobiographical line, \\"My grandfather went down with the Montevideo/The Rising Sun sent him floating to his rest,\\" sung by Peter Garrett. Controversies=Cause of deaths The memorial to the Australians killed in the defence of Rabaul and the sinking of the MV Montevideo Maru on the eastern side of the Australian War Memorial in November 2012 Some have questioned whether some or all of the POWs were aboard the ship and not massacred earlier. Others believe that some of the Australians survived, only to die later. Of the known survivors, the only one to ever be questioned was former merchant seaman Yoshiaki Yamaji. In a 2003 The 7:30 Report interview, he stated that he was told that some of the POWs had been picked up and taken to Kobe. Veteran Albert Speer, who served in New Guinea, believes that survivors were transported to Sado Island, only to perish days before the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan. Professor Hank Nelson considers it unlikely that any Japanese ship would have stopped to rescue prisoners with a hostile submarine nearby. The Rabaul garrison has been described as a \\"sacrificial lamb\\" by biographer David Day. Lark Force was left without reinforcements, and instructed not to withdraw in accordance with official War Cabinet policy at the time in regards to small garrisons. Harold Page, the senior government official in the territory, was instructed to evacuate only \\"unnecessary\\" civilians and was refused permission to evacuate any administrative staff; he was listed among those killed on the Montevideo Maru. Number of casualties It has been historically difficult to determine a definitive number of the dead. As late as 2010, Australia's Minister for Defence Personnel, Alan Griffin, stated that \\"there is no absolutely confirmed roll\\". Australian Army officer Major Harold S Williams' 1945 list of the Australian dead was lost, along with the original Japanese list in Katakana it had been compiled from; these challenges have been exacerbated by the forensic difficulties of recovering remains lost at sea. In 2012, the Japanese government handed over thousands of POW documents to the Australian government and Montevideo Marus manifest, which contained the names of all the Australians on board, was found to be among them. The translation of the manifest was released in June 2012, confirming a total of 1,054 Australians, of which 845 were from Lark Force. The new translation also corrected a longstanding historical error in the number of civilians who went down with the ship. There were 209, not 208 as previously thought. This is not an additional casualty; rather the historical number was simply inaccurate. Sources also continue to contradict each other regarding the number of Japanese crew who survived. Some reports indicate 18 survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards. Other sources indicate that 17 Japanese seamen and three guards survived.Margaret Reeson, A Very Long War, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 2000, 200 pp. p.60 See also *List by death toll of ships sunk by submarines ReferencesExternal links *People of the Plaque, a tribute to civilians from New Ireland who died in the war *A Story of the Salvos, Compass, ABC television, 20 April 2008 *Lark Force, part of the Australian Army garrison on Rabaul *\\"Montevideo Maru remembered 70 years on\\" – Australian Broadcasting Corporation Category:1926 ships Category:World War II merchant ships of Japan Category:Ships sunk by American submarines Category:World War II shipwrecks in the South China Sea Category:Maritime incidents in July 1942 Category:Ships built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Category:Japanese hell ships ","title":"SS Montevideo Maru"},{"id":"430626","text":"John Phillips John Phillips FRS (25 December 1800 – 24 April 1874) was an English geologist. During 1841 he published the first global geologic time scale based on the correlation of fossils in rock strata, thereby helping to standardize terminology including the term Mesozoic, which he invented.  Life and work  Phillips was born at Marden in Wiltshire. His father belonged to an old Welsh family, but settled in England as an officer of excise and married the sister of William Smith, a renowned English geologist. When both parents died when he was a child, Phillips's custody was assumed by Smith and Phillips was brought into Smith's London home during early 1815. During the next few years he attended various schools and helped his uncle with his geological research and writing; he also developed an interest in lithography (printing from prepared slabs of stone), and was among the earliest English practitioners of the process, experimenting with it between about 1816 and 1819.Michael Twyman, editor, John Phillips's lithographic notebook: reproduced in facsimile from the original at the Oxford Museum of Natural History. London: Printing Historical Society, 2016. After ending school, Phillips accompanied Smith on his wanderings in connection with his preparation of geological maps. During the spring of 1824 Smith went to York to deliver a course of lectures on geology, and his nephew Phillips accompanied him. Phillips accepted engagements in the principal Yorkshire towns to arrange their museums and give courses of lectures on the collections contained therein. York became his residence, and he obtained during 1826 the situation of keeper of the Yorkshire museum and secretary of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society at the same time as Henry Robinson was Librarian of the YPS. From that centre Phillips extended his operations to towns beyond the county, and by 1831 he included University College London within the sphere of his activity. During that year the British Association for the Advancement of Science was initiated at York, and Phillips was one of the people who organized it. He became the first assistant secretary during 1832, a job which he had until 1859. During 1834 he accepted the professorship of geology at King's College London, but retained his job at York. During 1834 Phillips was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. During later years he received honorary degrees of LL.D. from Dublin and Cambridge, and D.C.L. from Oxford; while during 1845 he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London. During 1840 he resigned his charge of the York museum and was appointed to the staff of the geological survey of Great Britain managed by Henry De la Beche. Phillips spent some time studying the Palaeozoic fossils of Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset, of which he published a descriptive memoir (in 1841). During that same year, he published the first global geologic time scale, which ordered rock strata according to the types of fossils found within. This helped standardize the usage of the terms Paleozoic period, which he extended to a longer period than it had had by previous usage, and Mesozoic period, the latter being his own invention.Rudwick, Martin Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform (2008) pp. 539-545 He also made a detailed survey of the region of the Malvern Hills, of which he prepared the elaborate account that appears in vol. ii. of the Memoirs of the Survey (1848). During 1844 he became professor of geology for the University of Dublin. Bust of John Phillips in the Oxford University Museum. Nine years later, on the death of Hugh Edwin Strickland, who had acted as substitute for Dean Buckland in the readership of geology in the University of Oxford, Phillips succeeded to the post of deputy. At the dean's death during 1856, Phillips became himself reader, a post which he had to the time of his death. During his residence in Oxford he had a major part in the foundation and arrangement of the University Museum established during 1859 (see his Notices of Rocks and Fossils in the University Museum, 1863; and The Oxford Museum, by H. W. Acland and J. Ruskin, 1859; reprinted with additions 1893). Phillips was also keeper of the Ashmolean Museum from 1854–1870. During 1859–1860 he was president of the Geological Society of London, and during 1865 president of the British Association. Phillips also made astronomical observations of the planet Mars during its 1862 opposition. On 23 April 1874, he dined at All Souls College, but on leaving he slipped and fell down a flight of stone stairs. He died the next day, and was buried in York Cemetery, beside his sister Anne and his benefactor Thomas Gray. His coffin was accompanied to Oxford's railway station by 200 university academics. Craters on Mars and the Moon are named after him.  Selected writings  Portrait The first paper Phillips published was On the Direction of the Diluvial Currents in Yorkshire (1827). He contributed to the Philosophical Magazine, the Journal of the Geological Society, and the Geological Magazine. He was also the author of separate works, including: *Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire (in two parts, 1829 and 1836; 2nd ed. of pt. 1 in 1835; 3rd ed., edited by R. Etheridge, in 1875) Part 1 & Part 2; Full text of the 1829 edition at Archive.org *A Treatise on Geology (1837–1839); Vol I; Vol II *Memoirs of William Smith (1844); *The Rivers, Mountains and Sea-Coast of Yorkshire (1853); *Manual of Geology, Practical and Theoretical Part I; Part II(1855); *Life on the Earth: its Origin and Succession (1860); *Vesuvius (1869); *Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames (1871). To these should be added his Monograph of British Belemnitidae (1865), for the Palaeontographical Society, and his geological map of the British Isles (1847).\\\\- See the plates following page 138.

He becomes the first Ferengi to join Starfleet. He is Rom's son and Quark's nephew and is also the only grandchild of Ishka. Fictional character biography In the Star Trek universe, Nog was born to Rom and Prinadora on Ferenginar in 2353. Later, he moved with his father to Deep Space Nine and worked at his uncle Quark's bar. This time is depicted in DS9, and Nog is characterized as being very mischievous and a slight delinquent. Throughout the course of the series, Nog befriends Jake Sisko. In the first seasons of DS9 he is, though reluctantly, one of the first students in Keiko O'Brien's school. When Rom, under pressure from Quark and Grand Nagus Zek, pulls Nog out of school, Jake tutors him without Rom's knowledge (\\"The Nagus\\"). Recognizing his father's failure to capitalize on his proficiency in mechanics and electronics, and not wanting to follow in those footsteps, Nog resolves to go into a career where he can make something of himself. He requests a recommendation from Commander Benjamin Sisko to be admitted to Starfleet Academy (\\"Heart of Stone\\"). Although Sisko takes considerable convincing that this young Ferengi is serious in this uncharacteristically unprofitable ambition for his species, Nog is admitted with his recommendation and becomes the first Ferengi in Starfleet (\\"Facets\\"). Starfleet assigns Nog to Deep Space Nine as part of his cadet field training (\\"The Ascent\\"). Upon returning to the station, he and Jake become roommates. As a cadet, Nog works mainly under chief of operations Miles O'Brien. Nog receives a commission as ensign shortly before Starfleet retakes Deep Space Nine during the Dominion War (\\"Favor the Bold\\"). In the height of the Dominion War, Nog loses his leg due to a battle injury (\\"The Siege of AR-558\\"). Although a biosynthetic leg is grown for him to replace the amputated one, after months of therapy Nog still feels phantom pain in his new leg. Nog chooses a holosuite simulation of a Las Vegas nightclub as the place to recuperate from his trauma and adjust to using an artificial limb, living in the holosuite until the simulated nightclub singer Vic Fontaine forces him to leave (\\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\"). One of Sisko's final acts before joining the Prophets is to promote Nog to the rank of lieutenant junior grade (DS9: \\"What You Leave Behind\\").

Suicide bombers are normally viewed as male political radicals, but since the 1960s female suicide attacks have been on the rise. Through 1985–2006, 15% of all suicide attacks were conducted by female suicide bombers.Davis, Jessica. \\"Evolution of The Global Jihad: Female Suicide Bombers in Iraq.\\" Studies in Conflict & Terrorism 36.4 (2013): 279-291. Academic Search Complete. Web November 16, 2015. There are many organizations, such as Boko Haram (which is the first group to use females in a majority of their suicide bombings and surpassed the Tamil Tigers in using more female suicide-bombers than any other terrorist group in history), ISIS, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, that recently started using women as tools in their attacks, since they are normally viewed as less of a threat than their male counterparts. This includes women having the element of surprise, a hesitancy to search females, increased publicity for female suicide bombing attacks, and the female stereotype as non-violent. Background Women have an extensive and complex history in political violence. While the typical terrorist of the 1960s tended to be an educated male from an upper-middle-class background, many left-wing terrorist groups in the 1960s and 1970s had prominent women active within these groups. Ulrike Meinhof, a German left-wing terrorist and journalist, co- founded the Red Army Faction and participated in a range of bombings and bank robberies. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)'s Leila Khaled is considered to be the first women to hijack an airplane, drawing international attention. Fusako Shigenobu founded and led the Japanese Red Army, a communist militant group that conducted hijackings and massacres. A number of Italian women were active in Italian terrorist organizations between 1970–1984. Females played fundamental roles in Puerto Rican nationalist movements such as the Puerto Rican Armed Forces of National Liberation (FLAN) and Los Macheteros, two groups designated as terrorist organizations. Women served visible roles in American groups, such as the Symbionese Liberation Army. Women also served as mobilizing agents for Weather Underground, recruiting people into the organization. Women have been more active in left- wing groups as these groups' ideologies tend to be more conducive to women's participation in combatant and other non-traditional roles. Female bombers have emerged as an area of particular study, with the circumstances of female involvement garnering a great deal of research. The number of female suicide bombers has been steadily increasing. Existing models of terrorism emphasize that these acts begin with a group promoting, supporting, or praising acts such as martyrdom. Their decisions to engage in suicide bombings contradicts theories that dictate that women prefer peaceful conflict resolution mechanisms as compared to men. Organizations have differing stances on female suicide bombers. For example, in 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas “categorically renounced the use of women as suicide bombers.” In fact, in early 2002, he reported that “Hamas was far from enthusiastic about the inclusion of women in warfare, for reasons of modesty.” This stance shifted in 2004, when the first female suicide bomber was used. Officials exclaimed that the act was a “significant evolution in our fight. The male fighters face many obstacles...Women are like the reserve army―when there is a necessity, we use them.” The LTTE attracted thousands of women and their militarization shaped women's identity from the “traditional ideal of the auspicious, fecund wife to the androgynous Armed Virgin.” Rajini Thiranagama exclaimed, \\"One cannot but be inspired when one sees the women of the LTTE in the night with their AKs slung over the shoulder ... One cannot but admire the dedication and toughness of their training … One could see the nationalist fervor and the romantic vision of women in arms defending the nation.\\"  Characteristics of female suicide bombers  There is much variation among female suicide bombers. A number of studies have attempted to compare suicide attackers across different suicide groups. It was found that groups that used women the least were Islamist fundamentalist groups. When dealing with age, female suicide bombers followed the same age trend as males, they usually fall within the early to mid 20s. They also tend to have more secular ties than presumed. Some are married while others are widows. Socioeconomic status also varies among female attackers. Women's involvement is mediated differently than men's; they are more likely to be involved through personal contacts or family members, while men's process of involvement is more likely to stem from movement affiliation and disenchantment with nonviolent forms of political activism. Differences in men and women's need for revenge (and subsequent use of suicide attacks) has been studied, with inconsistent findings reported. Some argue men are more vengeful than women, while others find no such claims. Examples * Sana’a Mehaidli, a 17-year-old member of the Syrian Socialist Party (SSNP/PPS), a pro-Syrian Lebanese organization, is believed to have been the first female suicide bomber. On April 9, 1985, she blew up herself and a truck of explosives next to an Israeli convoy in Lebanon during the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. She worked at a video store where she recorded her will, saying \\"I am very comfortable with carrying out this operation. I choose to do this because I am fulfilling my duty towards my land and my people...Now I am loving my country, sacrificing my life and respecting the people of the south.\\" * Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu, is thought to have been a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers), and involved in the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-Prime minister of India, and sixteen other bystanders in 1991. She allegedly had been raped by Indian Peace Keeping Force soldiers and her four brothers were killed. Sri Lanka's political group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) includes the Black Tigers, and the Black Tigers are known for suicide bombing attacks, and also for the fact that mostly women execute them. * Wafa Idris Arafat was the first female suicide bomber in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict; in 2002 she detonated a 22-pound bomb in the center of Jerusalem outside a shoe store on Jaffa Road that killed her, Pinhas Tokatli (81), and injured more than 100 others.Inigo Gilmore: Woman suicide bomber shakes Israelis, Daily Telegraph, January 28, 2002 The attack took place on 27 January 2002 but the identity of the bomber wasn't confirmed until 30 January 2002. Wafa carried the bomb in a backpack, rather than strapped to her body. Since, prior to this attack, women had only helped plant bombs, the use of a backpack and the lack of the usual note or video led to confusion regarding her suicide motives and speculation that she did not intend to detonate the bomb, but that the explosion was accidental. However, after investigation of the explosion, Israel declared Wafa a suicide bomber around 9 February 2002.James Bennet: Israelis Declare Arab Woman Was in Fact a Suicide Bomber, The New York Times, 9 February 2002 (req. subscr.) Prior to this Wafa called for an \\"Army of Roses.\\" Wafa became an icon and served under Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Wafa was born in a refugee camp, and her father died in when she was a child. During the First Intifada, she served on the refugee camp's women's committee, helping prisoners’ families and distributing food. When she delivered a stillborn and was told she would never be able to carry a baby to full-term, her husband divorced her. * Muriel Degauque was a Belgian convert to Islam who performed a suicide car bomb attack on November 9, 2005 against a U.S. military convoy in Iraq. She originally worked at a bakery and after marrying a Muslim man, she moved to Iraq and became radicalized. * In Dagestan, Russia in 2010 a 17-year-old widow of a Caucasus militant wearing a suicide bomb vest approached a Ministry of the Interior office in the village of Gubden . She was apparently stopped at a security post outside the office where she detonated her explosives, killing one police officer and injuring four others. The attack was claimed by the Caucasus Emirate militant Jihadist group, Dokku Umarov. * Blasts from two female suicide bombers at a crowded fish market in Nigeria's northeastern city of Maiduguri killed at least 20 people on June 22, 2015. * On December 23, 2016, the first female suicide bomber in Bangladesh detonated her explosive during a police raid. * In 2018, Puji Kuswati became Indonesia's first female suicide bomber when she and her daughters, Fadila Sari, and Pamela Rizkita, (twelve and nine years old respectively, and thus not counted as choosing to be bombers) bombed the GKI Diponegoro church·. Causes and reasons There are a number of reasons as to why female suicide bombers are used by groups. Terrorists use bombers as they are cheaper than purchasing arms. They are considered a low risk weapon and require low technology. They do not require much training, do not leave much of a trace behind, have the element of surprise, have easier access to targeted populations as well as soft targets, and tend to frighten the general population. As female combatants are seen as less likely to engage in lethal actions and can thus avoid suspicion, they are regarded as ideal combatants. Dress and gender stereotypes are often utilized by women to bypass security defenses. For example, women who appear pregnant appropriate related expectations and stereotypes to their benefit, discouraging invasive body searchers. Women may also \\"westernize\\" their appearance in an attempt at covering their actions and avoiding detection. Women are also deployed as suicide bombers as they tend to \\"elicit greater public sympathy and publicity for an organization.\\" By some research, female bombers receive eight times more press coverage than their male counterparts. Insurgent groups also face pressure when it comes to recruiting members, causing the group to expand their bases to sustain the group's position. It has been argued that the introduction of women and girls into combat “generally came about in response to logistical demands: the mounting number of casualties, the intensified crackdowns by government, and the ability to escape detection more easily than men.” An example of this was in January 2002 when the spiritual leader of Hamas renounced the use of female bombers. Later on in the same year, Hamas wasn't enthusiastic about adding women into their ranks. Then in January 2004, Hamas used their first female suicide bomber. Hamas defense to this was evolution of their fight. Citing easier access to reach targets, Hamas stated that women are the reserve army. When there is a need they will use them. On average, it is calculated that terrorist groups that use suicide bombing as a tactic wait around 13.5 years before employing women. However, women are reported to have higher kill rates than men, on average killing four times as many people as men do. Terrorist and insurgent groups may also appropriate media coverage to benefit from the portrayal of female suicide bombers. Women's media portrayal may help various organizations recruit and motivate men, and coverage of women in the media allows groups to differentiate themselves from one another. It also may help deliver group-based messages. For example, media coverage may highlight that the group, by using women, had been driven to extreme measures. Media attention on female suicide bombers tends to examine emotional explanations for women's involvement, as opposed to ideological justifications. Another reason for the use of female suicide bombers may be based in culture. In the Middle East, use of female bombers by groups can be used as an image to emasculate males in the region. Using the idea that the situation is dire that the women have to fight. Individual motivations There are different causes and reasons as to why female suicide bombers perform these deadly actions. For one, many cite personal feelings of sacrifice in conducting such missions. The missions become more successful to the public when they are framed as forms of sacrifice. Society would be \\"hard pressed to accept, a female who offers her life in this context is seen as engaging in the most profound form of selflessness.\\" Other research suggests that women resort to terrorism to “redeem their fallen reputations, such as being barren, divorced, defiled, unchaste, and so on.” Struggling for the pursuit of freedom through the LTTE can be seen as a way in which women can redeem themselves. Tamil rape victims tend to be prohibited from marriage and childbearing. Conceptualizing female bombers as mothers allows suicide bombings to serve as offerings for women who cannot become mothers. In literature on female suicide bombers, exploitation of women is a distinctive factor that separates them from male suicide bombers. Research has examined cases of women's exploitation by their own families, often for monetary compensation. Women can also be motivated by political/and or historical contexts to take action against their enemy. For example, in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, it has been noted that Palestinian female suicide bombers are often motivated by anti-Zionism and the Israeli occupation of their homeland to take action. According to Palestinian legal scholar Noura Erakat, the \\"Israeli military occupation [is] a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women's rights.\\"Erakat, Noura. \\"Arabiya Made Invisible: Between Marginalization of Agency and Silencing of Dissent\\" in Arab & Arab American Feminisms: Gender, Violence, & Belonging. Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. November 18, 2015 They are often motivated by the politics of their environment to take action in this situation. Western feminist critic Amal Amireh notes examples of how the women exercise their political agency in the conflict, including the fact that the bomber often declares in public her political group and nationalism, as well as the fact that they commit the act in public as a spectacle to be observed.Amireh, Amal. \\"Palestinian Women's Disappearing Act: The Suicide Bomber Through Western Feminist Eyes\\" in Arab & Arab American Feminisms: Gender, Violence, & Belonging. Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. November 18, 2015 There is also a case to be made toward religion/political indoctrination. Some recruiters, like the LTTE, would concentrate on recruiting orphans due to their young age and they are much easier to indoctrinate and condition. Individual motivations to become suicide bombers vary. Motives include “to avenge a personal loss, to redeem the family name, to escape a life of sheltered monotony and achieve fame, or to equalize the patriarchal societies in which they live.” The death of a relative triggers the decision to commit a suicide attack. Some women join to seek revenge. For example, studies have shown that some women join the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam seeking revenge against crimes the government has committed against the group, from disappearances to torture. Government oppression has only emboldened the LTTE, and women have increasingly become more publicly involved. In Chechnya, female bombers originally became involved for more personal reasons, avenging the deaths of Chechen male relatives killed by Russian forces. They are referred to as \\"Black Widows\\" because many were the wives, mothers, sisters, or female relatives of men killed in battle. The activities of the Black Widows are regarded to support the theory that suicide bombings may alter societal gender norms. With militant involvement usually seen as being performed by men, engaging in violent actions counters notions of women's traditional roles, such as raising children. Clara Beyler, a counter-terrorism analyst writes that \\"There is a difference between men and women suicide attackers: women consider combat as a way to escape the predestined life that is expected of them. When women become human bombs, their intent is to make a statement not only in the name of a country, a religion, a leader, but also in the name of their gender.\\" Some argue that violence serves to empower women. In this sense, some argue that understanding women's motivations should be understood through cultural contexts. Effects=Organizations of female suicide bombers Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade is a known terrorist organization that trained many female suicide bombers since their uprising as political weapons. In January 2002, the group claimed responsibility for the first female suicide bombing attack inside of Israel, in efforts to push Israel settlers out of west bank and to form an entirely Palestinian state. The group is known to be most active in the Gaza Strip, but also attacks inside of Israel and the West Bank. Chechnya The Shahidka, commonly called the \\"Black widows\\" are a group of Islamist Chechen separatist suicide bombers. Khava Barayeva blew herself up at a Russian Army outpost on June 7, 2000. In 2001, Aiza Gazuyeva killed Russian general Gaidar Gadzhiyev in a suicide bombing, the first female suicide bomber of the Chechen insurgency. The group carried out the Moscow theater hostage crisis and some were involved in the Beslan school siege. A bombing that killed 10 people at Rizhskaya metro station in Moscow was thought to be carried out by a woman who was identified as a Beslan school captor. The 2004 Russian aircraft bombings are believed to be carried out by female bombers. Two of the perpetrators of the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were women; Dzhanet Abdullayeva, who was married to a militant, and Maryam Sharipova. The October 2013 Volgograd bus bombing was carried out by a woman. Palestinian bombers On the same day Darine Abu Aisha committed a suicide bombing, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the religious leader of Islamist militant group Hamas, issued a fatwa, or religious rule, that gave permission to women to participate in suicide attacks as well as listing the rewards in \\"Paradise\\" that these female martyrs would receive upon their deaths. He also promised Hamas will send many female suicide bombers in order to strike Israelis. Reactions to this in the Islamic world were mixed. While many hailed the female suicide bomber and urged full involvement of all in Jihad, some criticized the cruelty of tearing mothers from their children and sending them to explode themselves. Notable female Palestinian suicide bombers include *Wafa Idris - first suicide bomber (bombing date: January 27, 2002) *Darine Abu Aisha- second suicide bomber (bombing date: February 27, 2002) *Ayat al-Akhras - third suicide bomber (bombing date: March 29, 2002) *Andalib Suleiman - fourth suicide bomber (bombing date: April 12, 2002) *Hanadi Jaradat - sixth suicide bomber (bombing date: October 4, 2003) *Reem Al-Reyashi- eighth suicide bomber (bombing date: January 15, 2004). Al-Reyashi, a 22-year-old mother of two, detonated an explosive pack at the Erez crossing point on the frontier of the Gaza Strip. ReferencesFurther reading * Berko, Anat, and Elizabeth Yuval.

The melody was composed by an Old Etonian and former pupil of Cory, Captain Algernon Drummond and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell-Innes. The piano accompaniment was written by Evelyn Wodehouse.British Library Catalogue It was first performed on 4 June 1863.

The song has been the subject of significant parody over the years, and numerous obscene versions exist, the most notable being 'The Sexual Life of the Camel'. Cachet The traditional status of Eton as the training grounds for Britain's wealthy elite endowed the song with a peculiar cultural cachet. For instance, writer George Orwell, an Old Etonian himself, wrote in his autobiographical essay \\"Such, Such Were the Joys\\" that: Other uses In 1939 the tune (at a quicker than usual tempo) was used as the theme for the film A Yank at Eton. In the 1960s, the tune was adopted by Coventry City as their club anthem. The lyrics were rewritten by Jimmy Hill and Derrick Robbins in order to be relevant to the club, and the song is still regularly sung by City fans today. In his appearance on Inside The Actor's Studio, Hugh Laurie, an Old Etonian, sang, with great embarrassment, the first verse of the \\"Eton Boating Song\\". He also dryly commented on the homoeroticism that can be read into the phrase 'With your bodies between your knees.' The song appears in the 1951 comedy film The Lavender Hill Mob, sung by the schoolgirls during the school scene. The song features in the 1953 comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt and the 1959 adventure film North West Frontier. The \\"Eton Boating Song\\" features in the 1960s television series The Prisoner, in the episodes \\"The Girl Who Was Death\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time\\".Sound track collector, http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=2318, retrieved 15 April 2009. In the Thunderbirds episode \\"The Cham-Cham\\", Parker briefly sings part of the song as he prepares to go boating before being called out on a mission by Lady Penelope. It is briefly sung by the Earl of Gurney during his sanity examination in the play The Ruling Class and its 1972 film adaptation. The song is played in 1972 comedy film The Adventures of Barry McKenzie in the scene where Mr Gort, dressed as a schoolboy, urges a bewildered Barry McKenzie to whip him. The song is sung in the 1980 Dennis Potter TV drama Blade on the Feather, which takes its title from one of the lines of the song. A reworked version of the theme appears as the title music for the satirical 1989 horror movie Society. In the second-to-final chapter of The Invisibles, Sir Miles Delacourt sings the song before he hangs himself from the aisles of Westminster Abbey. During the 2010 British general election the song was parodied as \\"The Eton Voting Song\\", with reference to the fact that David Cameron, Boris Johnson and other leading politicians went to Eton. During the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony, the song was briefly played during the Isles of Wonder introductory film charting the course of the River Thames, as it flows past Eton. The melody of the song was borrowed for the song \\"Long Live Uncle Tony \\" for St. Anthony Hall ( an American fraternity also known as Delta Psi).

It is named after Larissa, a lover of Poseidon (Neptune) in Greek mythology and eponymous nymph of the city in Thessaly, Greece.  Discovery  It was first discovered by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen, based on fortuitous ground-based stellar occultation observations on May 24, 1981, given the temporary designation S/1981 N 1 and announced on May 29, 1981. The moon was recovered and confirmed to be the only object in its orbit during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989 after which it received the additional designation S/1989 N 2 on August 2, 1989. The announcement by Stephen P. Synnott spoke of “10 frames taken over 5 days”, which gives a recovery date sometime before July 28. The name was given on September 16, 1991.  Characteristics  Two views of Larissa imaged by Voyager 2 The fourth-largest satellite of Neptune, Larissa is irregular (non- spherical) in shape and appears to be heavily cratered, with no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that Larissa, like the other satellites inward of Triton, is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were disrupted by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit. Larissa's orbit is nearly circular and lies below Neptune's synchronous orbit radius, so it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching, similarly to how Triton will eventually collide with Neptune or break into a planetary ring. Exploration Map of Larissa Larissa has only been visited by Voyager 2. The probe was able to get photographs of Larissa, showing its cratered surface.

Philosophically, a 'motif' is the 'cohomology essence' of a variety. In the formulation of Grothendieck for smooth projective varieties, a motive is a triple (X, p, m), where X is a smooth projective variety, p: X \\\\vdash X is an idempotent correspondence, and m an integer, however, such a triple contains almost no information outside the context of Grothendieck's category of pure motives, where a morphism from (X, p, m) to (Y, q, n) is given by a correspondence of degree n-m. A more object focussed approach is taken by Pierre Deligne in Le Groupe Fondamental de la Droite Projective Moins Trois Points. In that article, a motive is a 'system of realisations'. That is, a tuple : \\\\left (M_B, M_{\\\\mathrm{DR}}, M_{\\\\mathbb{A}^f}, M_{\\\\operatorname{cris},p}, \\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\mathrm{DR},B}, \\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^f, B}, \\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\operatorname{cris} p,\\\\mathrm{DR}}, W, F_\\\\infty, F, \\\\phi, \\\\phi_p \\\\right ) consisting of modules :M_B, M_{\\\\mathrm{DR}}, M_{\\\\mathbb{A}^f}, M_{\\\\operatorname{cris},p} over the rings :\\\\Q, \\\\Q, \\\\mathbb{A}^f, \\\\Q_p, respectively, various comparison isomorphisms :\\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\mathrm{DR},B}, \\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^f, B}, \\\\operatorname{comp}_{\\\\operatorname{cris} p, \\\\mathrm{DR}} between the obvious base changes of these modules, filtrations W, F, a \\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\overline{\\\\Q}, \\\\Q)-action \\\\phi on M_{\\\\mathbb{A}^f}, and a \\"Frobenius\\" automorphism \\\\phi_p of M_{\\\\operatorname{cris},p}. This data is modeled on the cohomologies of a smooth projective \\\\Q-variety and the structures and compatibilities they admit, and gives an idea about what kind of information is contained a motive.  Introduction  The theory of motives was originally conjectured as an attempt to unify a rapidly multiplying array of cohomology theories, including Betti cohomology, de Rham cohomology, l-adic cohomology, and crystalline cohomology. The general hope is that equations like * [point] * [projective line] = [line] + [point] * [projective plane] = [plane] + [line] + [point] can be put on increasingly solid mathematical footing with a deep meaning. Of course, the above equations are already known to be true in many senses, such as in the sense of CW-complex where \\"+\\" corresponds to attaching cells, and in the sense of various cohomology theories, where \\"+\\" corresponds to the direct sum. From another viewpoint, motives continue the sequence of generalizations from rational functions on varieties to divisors on varieties to Chow groups of varieties. The generalization happens in more than one direction, since motives can be considered with respect to more types of equivalence than rational equivalence. The admissible equivalences are given by the definition of an adequate equivalence relation.  Definition of pure motives  The category of pure motives often proceeds in three steps. Below we describe the case of Chow motives \\\\operatorname{Chow}(k), where k is any field.  First step: category of (degree 0) correspondences, \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k)  The objects of \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) are simply smooth projective varieties over k. The morphisms are correspondences. They generalize morphisms of varieties X \\\\to Y, which can be associated with their graphs in X \\\\times Y, to fixed dimensional Chow cycles on X \\\\times Y. It will be useful to describe correspondences of arbitrary degree, although morphisms in \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) are correspondences of degree 0. In detail, let X and Y be smooth projective varieties and consider a decomposition of X into connected components: :X = \\\\coprod olimits_i X_i, \\\\qquad d_i := \\\\dim X_i. If r\\\\in \\\\Z, then the correspondences of degree r from X to Y are :\\\\operatorname{Corr}^r(k)(X, Y) := \\\\bigoplus olimits_i A^{d_i+r}(X_i \\\\times Y), where A^k(X) denotes the Chow- cycles of codimension k. Correspondences are often denoted using the \\"⊢\\"-notation, e.g., \\\\alpha : X \\\\vdash Y. For any \\\\alpha\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Corr}^r(X, Y) and \\\\beta\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Corr}^s(Y,Z), their composition is defined by :\\\\beta \\\\circ \\\\alpha := \\\\pi_{XZ*} \\\\left (\\\\pi^{*}_{XY}(\\\\alpha) \\\\cdot \\\\pi^{*}_{YZ}(\\\\beta) \\\\right ) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Corr}^{r+s}(X, Z), where the dot denotes the product in the Chow ring (i.e., intersection). Returning to constructing the category \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k), notice that the composition of degree 0 correspondences is degree 0. Hence we define morphisms of \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) to be degree 0 correspondences. The following association is a functor (here \\\\Gamma_f \\\\subseteq X\\\\times Y denotes the graph of f: X\\\\to Y): :F : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{SmProj}(k) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) \\\\ X \\\\longmapsto X \\\\ f \\\\longmapsto \\\\Gamma_f \\\\end{cases} Just like \\\\operatorname{SmProj}(k), the category \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) has direct sums (X ⊕ Y := X ∐ Y) and tensor products (X ⊗ Y := X × Y). It is a preadditive category. The sum of morphisms is defined by :\\\\alpha + \\\\beta := (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) \\\\in A^{*}(X \\\\times X) \\\\oplus A^{*}(Y \\\\times Y) \\\\hookrightarrow A^{*} \\\\left (\\\\left (X \\\\coprod Y \\\\right ) \\\\times \\\\left (X \\\\coprod Y \\\\right ) \\\\right ).  Second step: category of pure effective Chow motives, \\\\operatorname{Chow}^{\\\\operatorname{eff}}(k) The transition to motives is made by taking the pseudo-abelian envelope of \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k): :\\\\operatorname{Chow}^\\\\operatorname{eff}(k) := Split(\\\\operatorname{Corr}(k)). In other words, effective Chow motives are pairs of smooth projective varieties X and idempotent correspondences α: X ⊢ X, and morphisms are of a certain type of correspondence: :\\\\operatorname{Ob} \\\\left (\\\\operatorname{Chow}^\\\\operatorname{eff}(k) \\\\right ) := { (X, \\\\alpha)  (\\\\alpha : X \\\\vdash X) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) \\\\mbox{ such that } \\\\alpha \\\\circ \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha }. :\\\\operatorname{Mor}((X, \\\\alpha), (Y, \\\\beta)) := { f : X \\\\vdash Y  f \\\\circ \\\\alpha = f = \\\\beta \\\\circ f }. Composition is the above defined composition of correspondences, and the identity morphism of (X, α) is defined to be α : X ⊢ X. The association, :h : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{SmProj}(k) & \\\\longrightarrow \\\\operatorname{Corr}(k) \\\\ X & \\\\longmapsto [X] := (X, \\\\Delta_X) \\\\ f & \\\\longmapsto [f] := \\\\Gamma_f \\\\subset X \\\\times Y \\\\end{cases}, where ΔX := [idX] denotes the diagonal of X × X, is a functor. The motive [X] is often called the motive associated to the variety X. As intended, Choweff(k) is a pseudo-abelian category. The direct sum of effective motives is given by :([X], \\\\alpha) \\\\oplus ([Y], \\\\beta) := \\\\left ( \\\\left [X \\\\coprod Y \\\\right ], \\\\alpha + \\\\beta \\\\right ), The tensor product of effective motives is defined by :([X], \\\\alpha) \\\\otimes ([Y], \\\\beta) := (X \\\\times Y, \\\\pi_X^{*}\\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\pi_Y^{*}\\\\beta), where :\\\\pi_X : (X \\\\times Y) \\\\times (X \\\\times Y) \\\\to X \\\\times X, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\pi_Y : (X \\\\times Y) \\\\times (X \\\\times Y) \\\\to Y \\\\times Y. The tensor product of morphisms may also be defined. Let f1 : (X1, α1) → (Y1, β1) and f2 : (X2, α2) → (Y2, β2) be morphisms of motives. Then let γ1 ∈ A(X1 × Y1) and γ2 ∈ A(X2 × Y2) be representatives of f1 and f2. Then :f_1 \\\\otimes f_2 : (X_1, \\\\alpha_1) \\\\otimes (X_2, \\\\alpha_2) \\\\vdash (Y_1, \\\\beta_1) \\\\otimes (Y_2, \\\\beta_2), \\\\qquad f_1 \\\\otimes f_2 := \\\\pi^{*}_1 \\\\gamma_1 \\\\cdot \\\\pi^{*}_2 \\\\gamma_2, where πi : X1 × X2 × Y1 × Y2 → Xi × Yi are the projections.  Third step: category of pure Chow motives, Chow(k)  To proceed to motives, we adjoin to Choweff(k) a formal inverse (with respect to the tensor product) of a motive called the Lefschetz motive. The effect is that motives become triples instead of pairs. The Lefschetz motive L is :L := (\\\\mathbb{P}^1, \\\\lambda), \\\\qquad \\\\lambda := pt \\\\times \\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\in A^1(\\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{P}^1). If we define the motive 1, called the trivial Tate motive, by 1 := h(Spec(k)), then the elegant equation :[\\\\mathbb{P}^1] = \\\\mathbf{1} \\\\oplus L holds, since :\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\cong \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{P}^1, \\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\times \\\\operatorname{pt} \\\\right ). The tensor inverse of the Lefschetz motive is known as the Tate motive, T := L−1. Then we define the category of pure Chow motives by :\\\\operatorname{Chow}(k) := \\\\operatorname{Chow}^\\\\operatorname{eff}(k)[T]. A motive is then a triple :(X \\\\in \\\\operatorname{SmProj}(k), p: X \\\\vdash X, n \\\\in \\\\Z ) such that morphisms are given by correspondences :f : (X, p, m) \\\\to (Y, q, n), \\\\quad f \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Corr}^{n-m}(X, Y) \\\\mbox{ such that } f \\\\circ p = f = q \\\\circ f, and the composition of morphisms comes from composition of correspondences. As intended, \\\\operatorname{Chow}(k) is a rigid pseudo-abelian category.  Other types of motives  In order to define an intersection product, cycles must be \\"movable\\" so we can intersect them in general position. Choosing a suitable equivalence relation on cycles will guarantee that every pair of cycles has an equivalent pair in general position that we can intersect. The Chow groups are defined using rational equivalence, but other equivalences are possible, and each defines a different sort of motive. Examples of equivalences, from strongest to weakest, are * Rational equivalence * Algebraic equivalence * Smash-nilpotence equivalence (sometimes called Voevodsky equivalence) * Homological equivalence (in the sense of Weil cohomology) * Numerical equivalence The literature occasionally calls every type of pure motive a Chow motive, in which case a motive with respect to algebraic equivalence would be called a Chow motive modulo algebraic equivalence.  Mixed motives  For a fixed base field k, the category of mixed motives is a conjectural abelian tensor category MM(k), together with a contravariant functor :\\\\operatorname{Var}(k) \\\\to MM(k) taking values on all varieties (not just smooth projective ones as it was the case with pure motives). This should be such that motivic cohomology defined by :\\\\operatorname{Ext}^*_{MM}(1, ?) coincides with the one predicted by algebraic K-theory, and contains the category of Chow motives in a suitable sense (and other properties). The existence of such a category was conjectured by Alexander Beilinson. Instead of constructing such a category, it was proposed by Deligne to first construct a category DM having the properties one expects for the derived category :D^b(MM(k)). Getting MM back from DM would then be accomplished by a (conjectural) motivic t-structure. The current state of the theory is that we do have a suitable category DM. Already this category is useful in applications. Vladimir Voevodsky's Fields Medal-winning proof of the Milnor conjecture uses these motives as a key ingredient. There are different definitions due to Hanamura, Levine and Voevodsky. They are known to be equivalent in most cases and we will give Voevodsky's definition below. The category contains Chow motives as a full subcategory and gives the \\"right\\" motivic cohomology. However, Voevodsky also shows that (with integral coefficients) it does not admit a motivic t-structure.  Geometric Mixed Motives  Notation = Here we will fix a field of characteristic and let A =\\\\Q,\\\\Z be our coefficient ring. Set \\\\mathcal{Var}/k as the category of quasi-projective varieties over are separated schemes of finite type. We will also let \\\\mathcal{Sm}/k be the subcategory of smooth varieties. = Smooth varieties with correspondences = Given a smooth variety and a variety call an integral closed subscheme W \\\\subset X \\\\times Y which is finite over and surjective over a component of a prime correspondence from to . Then, we can take the set of prime correspondences from to and construct a free -module C_A(X,Y). Its elements are called finite correspondences. Then, we can form an additive category \\\\mathcal{SmCor} whose objects are smooth varieties and morphisms are given by smooth correspondences. The only non-trivial part of this \\"definition\\" is the fact that we need to describe compositions. These are given by a push-pull formula from the theory of Chow rings.  Examples  Typical examples of prime correspondences come from the graph \\\\Gamma_f \\\\subset X\\\\times Y of a morphism of varieties f:X \\\\to Y. = Localizing the homotopy category = From here we can form the homotopy category K^b(\\\\mathcal{SmCor}) of bounded complexes of smooth correspondences. Here smooth varieties will be denoted [X]. If we localize this category with respect to the smallest thick subcategory (meaning it is closed under extensions) containing morphisms :[X\\\\times\\\\mathbb{A}^1] \\\\to [X] and :[U\\\\cap V] \\\\xrightarrow{j_U' + j_V'} [U]\\\\oplus [V] \\\\xrightarrow{j_U - j_V} [X] then we can form the triangulated category of effective geometric motives \\\\mathcal{DM}_\\\\text{gm}^\\\\text{eff}(k,A). Note that the first class of morphisms are localizing \\\\mathbb{A}^1-homotopies of varieties while the second will give the category of geometric mixed motives the Mayer–Vietoris sequence. Also, note that this category has a tensor structure given by the product of varieties, so [X]\\\\otimes[Y] = [X\\\\times Y]. = Inverting the Tate motive = Using the triangulated structure we can construct a triangle :\\\\mathbb{L} \\\\to [\\\\mathbb{P}^1] \\\\to [\\\\operatorname{Spec}(k)] \\\\xrightarrow{[+1]} from the canonical map \\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k). We will set A(1) = \\\\mathbb{L}[-2] and call it the Tate motive. Taking the iterative tensor product lets us construct A(k). If we have an effective geometric motive we let M(k) denote M \\\\otimes A(k). Moreover, this behaves functorially and forms a triangulated functor. Finally, we can define the category of geometric mixed motives \\\\mathcal{DM}_{gm} as the category of pairs (M,n) for an effective geometric mixed motive and an integer representing the twist by the Tate motive. The hom-groups are then the colimit :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{DM}}((A,n),(B,m))=\\\\lim_{k\\\\geq -n,-m} \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{DM}_{gm}^\\\\operatorname{eff}}(A(k+n),B(k+m)) Explanation for non-specialists A commonly applied technique in mathematics is to study objects carrying a particular structure by introducing a category whose morphisms preserve this structure. Then one may ask, when are two given objects isomorphic and ask for a \\"particularly nice\\" representative in each isomorphism class. The classification of algebraic varieties, i.e. application of this idea in the case of algebraic varieties, is very difficult due to the highly non-linear structure of the objects. The relaxed question of studying varieties up to birational isomorphism has led to the field of birational geometry. Another way to handle the question is to attach to a given variety X an object of more linear nature, i.e. an object amenable to the techniques of linear algebra, for example a vector space. This \\"linearization\\" goes usually under the name of cohomology. There are several important cohomology theories, which reflect different structural aspects of varieties. The (partly conjectural) theory of motives is an attempt to find a universal way to linearize algebraic varieties, i.e. motives are supposed to provide a cohomology theory that embodies all these particular cohomologies. For example, the genus of a smooth projective curve C which is an interesting invariant of the curve, is an integer, which can be read off the dimension of the first Betti cohomology group of C. So, the motive of the curve should contain the genus information. Of course, the genus is a rather coarse invariant, so the motive of C is more than just this number.  The search for a universal cohomology  Each algebraic variety X has a corresponding motive [X], so the simplest examples of motives are: * [point] * [projective line] = [point] + [line] * [projective plane] = [plane] + [line] + [point] These 'equations' hold in many situations, namely for de Rham cohomology and Betti cohomology, l-adic cohomology, the number of points over any finite field, and in multiplicative notation for local zeta-functions. The general idea is that one motive has the same structure in any reasonable cohomology theory with good formal properties; in particular, any Weil cohomology theory will have such properties. There are different Weil cohomology theories, they apply in different situations and have values in different categories, and reflect different structural aspects of the variety in question: * Betti cohomology is defined for varieties over (subfields of) the complex numbers, it has the advantage of being defined over the integers and is a topological invariant * de Rham cohomology (for varieties over \\\\C) comes with a mixed Hodge structure, it is a differential-geometric invariant * l-adic cohomology (over any field of characteristic ≠ l) has a canonical Galois group action, i.e. has values in representations of the (absolute) Galois group * crystalline cohomology All these cohomology theories share common properties, e.g. existence of Mayer- Vietoris sequences, homotopy invariance H^*(X) \\\\cong H^*(X\\\\times \\\\mathbb{A}^1), the product of X with the affine line) and others. Moreover, they are linked by comparison isomorphisms, for example Betti cohomology H^*_{\\\\text{Betti}}(X, \\\\Z/n) of a smooth variety X over \\\\C with finite coefficients is isomorphic to l-adic cohomology with finite coefficients. The theory of motives is an attempt to find a universal theory which embodies all these particular cohomologies and their structures and provides a framework for \\"equations\\" like :[projective line] = [line]+[point]. In particular, calculating the motive of any variety X directly gives all the information about the several Weil cohomology theories HBetti(X), HDR(X) etc. Beginning with Grothendieck, people have tried to precisely define this theory for many years.  Motivic cohomology  Motivic cohomology itself had been invented before the creation of mixed motives by means of algebraic K-theory. The above category provides a neat way to (re)define it by :H^n(X,m) := H^n(X, \\\\Z(m)) := \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{DM}(X, \\\\Z(m)[n]), where n and m are integers and \\\\Z(m) is the m-th tensor power of the Tate object \\\\Z(1), which in Voevodsky's setting is the complex \\\\mathbb{P}^1 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{pt} shifted by –2, and [n] means the usual shift in the triangulated category.  Conjectures related to motives  The standard conjectures were first formulated in terms of the interplay of algebraic cycles and Weil cohomology theories. The category of pure motives provides a categorical framework for these conjectures. The standard conjectures are commonly considered to be very hard and are open in the general case. Grothendieck, with Bombieri, showed the depth of the motivic approach by producing a conditional (very short and elegant) proof of the Weil conjectures (which are proven by different means by Deligne), assuming the standard conjectures to hold. For example, the Künneth standard conjecture, which states the existence of algebraic cycles πi ⊂ X × X inducing the canonical projectors H(X) → Hi(X) ↣ H(X) (for any Weil cohomology H) implies that every pure motive M decomposes in graded pieces of weight n: M = ⊕GrnM. The terminology weights comes from a similar decomposition of, say, de-Rham cohomology of smooth projective varieties, see Hodge theory. Conjecture D, stating the concordance of numerical and homological equivalence, implies the equivalence of pure motives with respect to homological and numerical equivalence. (In particular the former category of motives would not depend on the choice of the Weil cohomology theory). Jannsen (1992) proved the following unconditional result: the category of (pure) motives over a field is abelian and semisimple if and only if the chosen equivalence relation is numerical equivalence. The Hodge conjecture, may be neatly reformulated using motives: it holds iff the Hodge realization mapping any pure motive with rational coefficients (over a subfield k of \\\\C) to its Hodge structure is a full functor H:M(k)_{\\\\Q} \\\\to HS_{\\\\Q} (rational Hodge structures). Here pure motive means pure motive with respect to homological equivalence. Similarly, the Tate conjecture is equivalent to: the so-called Tate realization, i.e. ℓ-adic cohomology, is a full functor H: M(k)_{\\\\Q_\\\\ell} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\ell} (\\\\operatorname{Gal}(k)) (pure motives up to homological equivalence, continuous representations of the absolute Galois group of the base field k), which takes values in semi-simple representations. (The latter part is automatic in the case of the Hodge analogue). Tannakian formalism and motivic Galois group To motivate the (conjectural) motivic Galois group, fix a field k and consider the functor :finite separable extensions K of k → non- empty finite sets with a (continuous) transitive action of the absolute Galois group of k which maps K to the (finite) set of embeddings of K into an algebraic closure of k. In Galois theory this functor is shown to be an equivalence of categories. Notice that fields are 0-dimensional. Motives of this kind are called Artin motives. By \\\\Q-linearizing the above objects, another way of expressing the above is to say that Artin motives are equivalent to finite \\\\Q-vector spaces together with an action of the Galois group. The objective of the motivic Galois group is to extend the above equivalence to higher-dimensional varieties. In order to do this, the technical machinery of Tannakian category theory (going back to Tannaka–Krein duality, but a purely algebraic theory) is used. Its purpose is to shed light on both the Hodge conjecture and the Tate conjecture, the outstanding questions in algebraic cycle theory. Fix a Weil cohomology theory H. It gives a functor from Mnum (pure motives using numerical equivalence) to finite- dimensional \\\\Q-vector spaces. It can be shown that the former category is a Tannakian category. Assuming the equivalence of homological and numerical equivalence, i.e. the above standard conjecture D, the functor H is an exact faithful tensor-functor. Applying the Tannakian formalism, one concludes that Mnum is equivalent to the category of representations of an algebraic group G, known as the motivic Galois group. The motivic Galois group is to the theory of motives what the Mumford–Tate group is to Hodge theory. Again speaking in rough terms, the Hodge and Tate conjectures are types of invariant theory (the spaces that are morally the algebraic cycles are picked out by invariance under a group, if one sets up the correct definitions). The motivic Galois group has the surrounding representation theory. (What it is not, is a Galois group; however in terms of the Tate conjecture and Galois representations on étale cohomology, it predicts the image of the Galois group, or, more accurately, its Lie algebra.)

Early life Caplet was born on a boat sailing between Le Havre (Seine-Maritime) and Honfleur (Calvados), the youngest child of a modest family. Career He exhibited an unusual talent and originality during his musical education, and won the Prix de Rome in 1901 ahead of Maurice Ravel. He became a close friend of Claude Debussy, sometimes serving as translator, and he orchestrated part of Debussy's Le Martyre de saint Sébastien.Bernac (1978): p. 221Orledge (2003) He also collaborated with Debussy in the orchestration of La boîte à joujoux. In 1911, Caplet prepared an orchestration of Debussy's Children's Corner, which, along with his orchestration of Clair de lune from the Suite bergamasque is probably the most widely performed and recorded example of his work. Caplet was a composer in his own right, whose works have been overlooked for the most part in the modern repertoire. Especially interesting is his instrumental use of voices, as in his Septuor à cordes vocales et instrumentales from 1909 and in the oratorio-like Le Miroir de Jésus from 1923, which features \\"choeur de femmes\\" in an accompanying role Caplet termed \\"voix d'accompagnement\\". He also wrote two works based on the short story The Mask of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe: Conte fantastique for harp and string quartet, and an orchestral symphonic study Le Masque de la mort rouge. Caplet served as conductor of the Boston Opera from 1910 to 1914. Death While serving in the military during the First World War, he was gassed, which resulted in the pleurisy that eventually killed him. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Hauts-de-Seine), a suburb of Paris, at the age of 46. The next year the sculptor Jacques Zwobada, a native of Neuilly, was commissioned to create a monument to Caplet. This was one of Zwobada's earliest works after he graduated from the École des Beaux- Arts.Bernard Vasseur, Jacques Zwobada – L'œuvre dessiné (Paris: Éditions Cercle d'Art, 2008) Compositions=Works for voice and piano *Viens! ...

They are native to modern Lesotho and South Africa. The Basotho have inhabited the region since around the fifth century CE and are closely related to other Bantu peoples of the region. The modern Basotho identity emerged from the accomplished diplomacy of Moshoeshoe I who unified the disparate clans of Sotho–Tswana origin that had dispersed across southern Africa in the early 19th century. Most Basotho today live in Lesotho or South Africa, as the area of the Orange Free State was originally part of Moshoeshoe's nation (now Lesotho). History =Early history Bantu- speaking peoples had settled in what is now South Africa by about 500 CE.L. Thompson, A History of South Africa (2001); James L. Newman, The Peopling of Africa: A Geographic Interpretation, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1995. Separation from the Tswana is assumed to have taken place by the 14th century. The first historical references to the Basotho date to the 19th century. By that time, a series of Basotho kingdoms covered the southern portion of the plateau (Free State Province and parts of Gauteng). Basotho society was highly decentralized, and organized on the basis of kraals, or extended clans, each of which was ruled by a chief. Fiefdoms were united into loose confederations. 19th century In the 1820s, refugees from the Zulu expansion under Shaka came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld. In 1823, pressure caused one group of Basotho, the Kololo, to migrate north. They moved past the Okavango Swamp and across the Zambezi into Barotseland, which is now part of Zambia. In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland. At about the same time, the Boers began to encroach upon Basotho territory.. After the Cape Colony was ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony were called the voortrekkers (\\"pioneers\\") and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.. At the time of these developments, Moshoeshoe I gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern highveld. Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he moulded the disparate refugee groups escaping the Difaqane into a cohesive nation. His leadership allowed his small nation to survive the obstacles that destroyed other indigenous South African kingdoms during the 19th century, such as the Zulu hegemony, the inward expansion of the voortrekkers and the plans of imperial Britain. In 1822, Moshoeshoe established the capital at Butha-Buthe, an easily defensible mountain in the northern Drakensberg mountain range, thus laying the foundations of the eventual Kingdom of Lesotho. His capital was later moved to Thaba Bosiu. To deal with the encroaching voortrekker groups, Moshoeshoe encouraged French missionary activity in his kingdom.. Missionaries sent by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society provided the King with foreign affairs counsel and helped to facilitate the purchase of modern weapons. Aside from acting as state ministers, missionaries (primarily Casalis and Arbousset) played a vital role in delineating Sesotho orthography and printing Sesotho language materials between 1837 and 1855.Casalis, E. (1992). The Basutos: or, twenty-three years in South Africa. Morija: Morija Museum & Archives. The first Sesotho translation of the Bible appeared in 1878. In 1868, after losing the western lowlands to the Boers during the Free State–Basotho Wars, Moshoeshoe successfully appealed to Queen Victoria to proclaim Basutoland (modern Lesotho) a protectorate of Britain. Accordingly, the British administration was established in Maseru, the site of Lesotho's current capital. Local chieftains retained power over internal affairs, while Britain was responsible for foreign affairs and the defense of the protectorate.. In 1869, the British sponsored a process to demarcate the borders of Basutoland. While many clans had territory within Basutoland, large numbers of Sesotho speakers resided in areas allocated to the Orange Free State, the sovereign voortrekker republic that bordered the Basotho kingdom. Cannibalism The practice of cannibalism increased among the Basotho during the times of lifaqane (literally \\"need for sustenance\\" or \\"we want\\") when there were many refugee tribes fleeing wars started by the Zulu King Shaka. According to missionary Ellenberger, tribes who practiced cannibalism were the Bakhatla of Tabane, specifically those who were ruled by the Chief Rakotsoane at Sefikeng. The district of Mangane, now known as Bloemfontein, was described as ‘infested with cannibals’ by the end of 1822. A cave at Mohale’s Hoek had a brotherhood of 27 cannibals who were under the leadership of Motleyoa. Other areas known to have cannibals included the river banks of Cornelius Spruit, where there were several villages of cannibals. According to the Basotho, cannibals are regarded as people having evil supernatural powers comparable with Satan or spirits of the dead that oppose the good spirits and Basotho ancestors. Their tradition states that the great Bakuena chief, Mohlomi, prophesied the coming of the lifaqane and cannibalism on his death bed with the words, \\"After my death, a cloud of red dust will come out of the east and consume our tribes. The father will eat his children. I greet you all, and depart to where our fathers rest.\\"*David B. Coplan. In the Time of Cannibals: The Word Music of South Africa's Basotho Migrants. University of Chicago Press, 1994Ellenberger, History of the Basuto p 97 The Basotho cannibals believed that their human victims would appease the gods. Missionaries who arrived in 1883 estimated that there were between 7,000 and 8,000 Basotho practicing cannibalism between the Orange River, the Drakensberg and the Vaal river. Moeshoeshoe and his people experienced an attack by cannibals as they moved from Butha Buthe to Thaba Bosiu seeking safety from King Shaka’s wars in 1824. During the attack, the cannibals captured and ate Moshoeshoe’s grandfather, Peete. Although cannibals were the cause of his grandfather's death, Moeshoeshoe chose not to punish captured cannibals. Instead, he decided to aid them in their rehabilitation into society by giving them food and cattle.M Prozesky (2016) Ethical leadership resources in southern Africa’s Sesotho speaking culture and in King Moshoeshoe I, Journal of Global Ethics, 12:1, 5-16, DOI: 10.1080/17449626.2016.1146789 From 1822 to 1828, there were about 300,000 victims of cannibalism. The practice stopped shortly after the arrival of Christian missionaries as cannibalism was not tolerated in the Christian lifestyle.

In 1966, Basutoland gained its independence from Britain, becoming the Kingdom of Lesotho. Sesotho is widely spoken throughout the sub- continent due to internal migration. To enter the cash economy, Basotho men often migrated to large cities in South Africa to find employment in the mining industry.. Migrant workers from the Free State and Lesotho thus helped to spread Sesotho to the urban areas of South Africa. It is generally agreed that migrant work harmed the family life of most Sesotho speakers because adults (primarily men) were required to leave their families behind in impoverished communities while they were employed in distant cities. Attempts by the apartheid government to force Sesotho speakers to relocate to designated homelands had little effect on their settlement patterns. Large numbers of workers continued to leave the traditional areas of Black settlement. Women gravitated towards employment as agricultural or domestic workers while men typically found employment in the mining sector. In terms of religion, the central role that Christian missionaries played in helping Moshoeshoe I secure his kingdom helped to ensure widespread Basotho conversion to Christianity. Today, the bulk of Sesotho speakers practice a form of Christianity that blends elements of traditional Christian dogma with local, pre-Western beliefs. Modimo (“God”) is viewed as a supreme being who cannot be approached by mortals. Ancestors are seen as intercessors between Modimo and the living, and their favor must be cultivated through worship and reverence..

Retrieved 5-01-10 from Many Sesotho speakers live in conditions of economic hardship, but people with access to land and steady employment may enjoy a higher standard of living. Landowners often participate in subsistence or small-scale commercial farming ventures. However, overgrazing and land mismanagement are growing problems. Demographics The allure of urban areas has not diminished, and internal migration continues today for many black people born in Lesotho and other Basotho heartlands.Posel, D. (2003) Have Migration Patterns in Post-Apartheid South Africa Changed? Conference on African Migration in Comparative Perspective. Johannesburg: 2003. Generally, employment patterns among the Basotho follow the same patterns as broader South African society. Historical factors cause unemployment among the Basotho and other Black South Africans to remain high. Basotho on Horses Percent of Sesotho speakers across South Africa: * Gauteng Province: 13.1% * Atteridgeville: 12.3% * City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality: 9.6% * Soweto: 15.5% * Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality: 10.02% * Katlehong: 22.4% * Sedibeng District Municipality: 46.7% * West Rand District Municipality: 10.8% * Midvaal Local Municipality: 27.9% * Free State Province: 64.2% * Bloemfontein: 33.4% Language The language of the Basotho is referred to as Sesotho,Constitution of South Africa (1996) less commonly known as Sesotho sa borwa.Zerbian, S., and Barnard, E. (2008) Phonetics of Intonation in South African Bantu Languages. Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies 26 (2): 235–50. Some texts may refer to Sesotho as \\"Southern Sotho\\" to differentiate it from Northern Sotho, also called Sepedi. Sesotho is the first language of 1.5 million people in Lesotho, or 85% of the population. It is one of the two official languages in Lesotho, the other being English. Lesotho enjoys one of Africa's highest literacy rates, with 59% of the adult population being literate, chiefly in Sesotho.United Nations Scientific and Educational Council (UNESCO)(2000) World Languages Survey. Paris: UNESCO. Sesotho is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa. According to the South African National Census of 2011, almost 4 million people speak Sesotho as a first language, including 62% of Free State inhabitants.STATISTICS SA (2001) Census 2001. Pretoria: Statistics South Africa. Approximately 13.1% of the residents of Gauteng speak Sesotho as a first language.South African National Census of 2011 In the North West Province, 5% of the population speak Sesotho as a first language, with a concentration of speakers in the Maboloka region. Three percent of Mpumalanga's people speak Sesotho as a first language, with many speakers living in the Standerton area. Two percent of the residents of the Eastern Cape speak Sesotho as a first language, though they are located mostly in the northern part of the province. Aside from Lesotho and South Africa, 60,000 people speak Silozi (a close relative of Sesotho) in Zambia.Lewis, P. (2009) Ethnologue: Languages of the World. Dallas: SIL International. Additionally, a few Sesotho speakers reside in Botswana, Swaziland and the Caprivi Strip of Namibia. No official statistics on second language usage are available, but one conservative estimate of the number of people who speak Sesotho as a second (or later) language is 5 million. Sesotho is used in a range of educational settings both as a subject of study and as a medium of instruction. It is used in its spoken and written forms in all spheres of education, from preschool to doctoral studies. However, the number of technical materials (e.g. in the fields of commerce, information technology, law, science, and math) in the language is still relatively small. Sesotho has developed a sizable media presence since the end of apartheid. Lesedi FM is a 24-hour Sesotho radio station run by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), broadcasting solely in Sesotho. There are other regional radio stations throughout Lesotho and the Free State. Half-hour Sesotho news bulletins are broadcast daily on the SABC free-to-air channel SABC 2. Independent TV broadcaster eTV also features a daily half-hour Sesotho bulletin. Both SABC and the eTV group produce a range of programs that feature some Sesotho dialogue. In Lesotho, the Lesotho National Broadcasting Service broadcasts to South Africa via satellite pay-TV provider, DStv. Most newspapers in Lesotho are written in Sesotho or both Sesotho and English. There are no fully fledged newspapers in Sesotho except for regional newsletters in Qwaqwa, Fouriesburg, Ficksburg and possibly other Free State towns. Currently, the mainstream South African magazine Bona includes Sesotho content. Since the codification of Sesotho orthography, literary works have been produced in Sesotho. Notable Sesotho-language literature includes Thomas Mofolo's epic Chaka, which has been translated into several languages including English and German.Kunene, D. (1989) Thomas Mofolo and the emergence of written Sesotho prose. Johannesburg: Ravan Press, 1989. Clothing The Basotho have a unique traditional attire. This includes the mokorotlo, a conical hat with a decorated knob at the top that is worn differently for men and women. The Basotho blanket is often worn over the shoulders or the waist and protects the wearer against the cold. Although many Sotho people wear westernized clothing, often traditional garments are worn over them. Basotho herders Many Basotho who live in rural areas wear clothing that suits their lifestyles. For instance, boys who herd cattle in the rural Free State and Lesotho wear the Basotho blanket and large rain boots (gumboots) as protection from the wet mountain terrain. Herd boys also often wear woolen balaclavas or caps year-round to protect their faces from cold temperatures and dusty winds. Basotho women Basotho women usually wear skirts and long dresses in bright colors and patterns, as well as the traditional blankets around the waist. On special occasions like wedding celebrations, they wear the Seshoeshoe, a traditional Basotho dress. The local traditional dresses are made using colored cloth and ribbon accents bordering each layer. Sotho women often purchase this material and have it designed in a style similar to West and East African dresses. Women often wrap a long print cloth or a small blanket around their waist, either as a skirt or a second garment over it. This is commonly known as a wrap, and it can be used to carry infants on their backs.https://www.helplesotho.org/traditional-basotho-dress/ Special clothing items Special clothing is worn for special events like initiation rites and traditional healing ceremonies. For a Lebollo la basadi, or a girl's initiation ceremony, girls wear a beaded waist wrap called a thethana that covers the waist, particularly the crotch area and part of the buttocks. They also wear grey blankets and goatskin skirts. These garments are worn by young girls and women, particularly virgins. For a Lebollo la banna, or a boy's initiation ceremony, boys wear a loincloth called a tshea as well as colorful blankets. These traditional outfits are often combined with more modern items like sunglasses. Traditional Sotho healers wear the bandolier which consists of strips and strings made of leather, sinew or beads that form a cross on the chest. The bandolier often has pouches of potions attached to it for specific rituals or physical/spiritual protection. It is believed that the San people adopted this bandolier attire for healers during times when the Basotho and the San traded and developed ties through trade, marriage and friendship. The San people's use of the bandolier can be seen in their rock paintings that date to the 1700s. Dean Foster.

Their main function is to prevent sweat, water, and other debris from falling down into the eye socket, but they are also important to human communication and facial expression. It is common for people to modify their eyebrows by means of hair removal and makeup. Functions A number of theories have been proposed to explain the function of the eyebrow in humans including that its main function is to prevent moisture, mostly salty sweat and rain, from flowing into the eye, or that clearly visible eyebrows provided safety from predators when early hominid groups started sleeping on the ground.Joseph Jordania, Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution, chapter \\"I Can See you! Eyespots in Humans.\\" Logos, 2011, pg. 96 Recent research, however, suggests that eyebrows in humans developed as a means of communication and that this is their primary function. Humans developed a smooth forehead with visible, hairy eyebrows capable of a wide range of movement which are able to express a wide range of subtle emotions – including recognition and sympathy.\\"Supraorbital morphology and social dynamics in human evolution\\" Nature, Ecology & Evolution  Aesthetic appeal  Fashion in eyebrow shape has regularly changed throughout the ages and eyebrows have always featured heavily in female fashion, often as part of cultural demands made on women about body hair. Japanese women and men from the 8th century practiced hikimayu, that is, shaving or plucking the eyebrow hair and painting smudge-like ones higher on the forehead or pencilled in thin ones in a different place. This practice is comparable to that in the Elizabethan era when high status women would remove eyebrows altogether. Thin eyebrows, achieved by rigorous plucking, were again fashionable in the 1920s and 1930s. Cosmetic modification An eyebrow that has been modified via waxing Cosmetic methods over the centuries have been developed to alter the appearance of eyebrows, by adding or removing hair, changing the color, or changing the position to meet the aesthetic ideal of the time, for example, by tinting the eyebrow with permanent dye, similar to hair colour, often in order to darken them. Eyebrow brushes, shaders, and pencils are often used to define the eyebrow or make it appear fuller. These can create an outline for the brows or mimic hairs where there are sparse areas. Brow gels are also used in creating a thicker brow; they allow for the hairs to be more textured, which gives the appearance of thicker, fuller brows. Lastly, brow powders or even eyeshadows are used for those who want a fuller and more natural look, by placing the brow powder or eyeshadow (closest to the natural hair colour) in areas where there is less hair. Several options exist for removing hair to achieve a thinner or smaller eyebrow, or to \\"correct\\" a unibrow, including manual and electronic tweezing, waxing, and threading. The most common method is to use tweezers to thin out and shape the eyebrow. Waxing is becoming more popular. Lastly, there is threading eyebrows, where a cotton thread is rolled over hair to pull it out. Small scissors are sometimes used to trim the eyebrows, either with another method of hair removal or alone. All of these methods can be painful for some seconds or minutes due to the sensitivity of the area around the eye but, often, this pain decreases over time as the individual becomes used to it. In time, hair that has been plucked will stop growing back. Some people wax or shave off their eyebrows and leave them bare, stencil or draw them in with eye liner, or tattoo them on. In Western societies, it has become more common for men to pluck part of their eyebrows. To create a fuller look, eyebrows can be cloned in an eyebrow transplant. Individual strands of the eyebrow are created to mimic a natural-looking eyebrow of the desired shape. The process of eyebrow transplant is quite similar to the process of hair transplant. In this process as well, follicles from an active area are transferred to the area where there are no hairs. Follicles are mostly taken from the back of the head because it is the best harvesting site when it comes to hairs. The follicles are then injected into the skin. The healing process after an eyebrow transplant is similar to the process of tattoo. In this process, patients may experience light bruising and crusting of the skin. People who have genetically thin eyebrows or who have over-tweezed are considered ideal for the transplant. An eyebrow lift is a cosmetic surgery to raise the eyebrow, usually to create a more feminine or youthful appearance. It is not a new phenomenon, with the earliest description of brow lifting published in medical literature in 1919 by French surgeon Dr Raymond Passot. Brows can be affected during a face lift or an eye lift. In the 1970s, doctors started injecting patients' eyebrows with botox or similar toxins to paralyse the muscles temporarily to raise the eyebrow. In the 21st century, tattooing became popular as a way to achieve and maintain an eyebrow shape, using a coil machine, rotary machine and linear machine. This process, also called cosmetic tattooing, microblading, or blade and shade brows, involves an eyebrow artist making small, precise cuts that mimic the look of hair. Shaving lines in eyebrows is another cosmetic alteration, popular among some younger people in the 1990s and 2000s. Gallery File:Black eyebrow.jpgEyebrows often thicken with puberty.

He was the first son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bamokoteli lineage- a branch of the Koena (crocodile) clan. In his youth, he helped his father gain power over some other smaller clans. At the age of 34 Moshoeshoe formed his own clan and became a chief. He and his followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain. He subsequently became the first King of Lesotho from to 1822–1870.  Great King  Moshoeshoe I with his ministers Moshoeshoe was the first son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bamokoteli sub-clan of the Basotho people. He was born at Menkhoaneng in Botha-bothe, Lesotho as Lepoqo. Moshoeshoe and his agemates went to initiation school and he got the name Letlama meaning strong bond. During his youth just after initiation, he was very brave and once organised a cattle raid against Ramonaheng and captured several herds. As was the tradition, he composed a poem praising himself where, amongst the words he used to refer to himself, said he was \\"like a razor which has shaved all Ramonaheng's beards\\", referring to his successful raid. In Sesotho language, a razor is said to make a \\"shoe...shoe...\\" sound, and after that he was affectionately called Moshoeshoe: \\"the shaver\\". He also referred himself as the person of Kali, thus showed that he was a descendant of the Great Kali or Monaheng who is said to be the ancestor of most Bakoena people in Lesotho with the exception of the senior Bamolibeli. Moshoeshoe and his followers, mostly the Bakoena Bamokoteli, some Bafokeng from his maternal side and other relations as well as some clans including the Amazizi, established his village at Butha-Buthe, where his settlement and reign coincided with the growth in power of the well- known Zulu King, Shaka and what is now known as the 'time of troubles' (previously known as 'Difaqane'). During the early 19th century Shaka raided many smaller chiefdoms along the eastern coast of Southern Africa (modern day Kwa-Zulu Natal), incorporating parts of them into his steadily growing Zulu chiefdom. Various small clans were forced to flee the Zulu chief. An era of great wars of calamity followed, known as the time of troubles/Difaqane. It was marked by aggression against the Sotho people by the invading Nguni clans. The attacks also forced Moshoeshoe to move his settlement to the Qiloane plateau. The name was later changed to Thaba Bosiu or \\"mountain at night\\" because it was believed to grow during the night and shrink during day. It proved to be an impassable stronghold against enemies.  Diplomat  The most significant role Moshoeshoe played as a diplomat was his acts of friendship towards his beaten enemies. He provided land and protection to various people and this strengthened the growing Basotho nation. His influence and followers grew with the integration of a number of refugees and victims of the wars of calamity. By the latter part of the 19th century, Moshoeshoe established the nation of the Basotho, in Basutoland. He was popularly known as Morena e Moholo/morena oa Basotho (Great King/King of the Basotho). Guns were introduced with the arrival of the Dutch from the Cape Colony and Moshoeshoe determined that he needed these and a white advisor. From other tribes, he heard of the benefits missionaries brought. By chance, three representatives of the Society arrived in the heart of southern Africa: , and . Moshoeshoe brought them to his kingdom. Later Roman Catholic Missionaries were to have a great influence on the shape of Basotho History (the first being, Bishop M.F. Allard O.M.I. and Fr. Joseph Gerard O.M.I.). From 1837 to 1855 Casalis played the role of Moshoeshoe's Foreign Advisor. With his knowledge of the non- African world, he was able to inform and advise the king in his dealings with hostile foreigners. He also served as an interpreter for Moshoeshoe in his dealings with white people, and documented the Sesotho language. In the late 1830s, Boer trekkers from the Cape Colony showed up on the western borders of Basutoland and subsequently claimed land rights. The trekkers' pioneer in this area was Jan de Winnaar, who settled in the Matlakeng area in May–June 1838. As more farmers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers, even north of the Caledon, claiming that it had been \\"abandoned\\" by the Sotho people. Moshoeshoe, when hearing of the trekker settlement above the junction, stated that \\"... the ground on which they were belonged to me, but I had no objections to their flocks grazing there until such time as they were able to proceed further; on condition, however, that they remained in peace with my people and recognised my authority.\\" Eugène Casalis later remarked that the trekkers had humbly asked for temporary rights while they were still few in number, but that when they felt \\"strong enough to throw off the mask\\" they went back on their initial intention. The next 30 years were marked by conflicts.  Wars  Moshoeshoe signed a treaty with the British Governor, Sir George Thomas Napier. Among the provisions of this treaty was the annexation of a tract of land (now called the Orange River Sovereignty) that many Boers had settled. The outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848, but remained bitter at both the British and the Sotho. The situation erupted in 1851. A British force was defeated by the Sotho army at Kolonyama, touching off an embarrassing war for the British. After repulsing another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that allowed him to save face. Once again, diplomacy saved the Sotho kingdom. After a final defeat of the Tloka in 1853, Moshoeshoe reigned supreme. However, the British pulled out of the region in 1854, causing the de facto formation of two independent states: the Boer Orange Free State and the Sotho Kingdom. In 1858 Moshoeshoe defeated the Boers in the Free State–Basotho War and in 1865 Moshoeshoe lost a great portion of the western lowlands. The last war in 1867 ended only when the British and Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British protectorate in 1868. The British were eager to check Boer advances, and Moshoeshoe, with advice from Eugene Casalis, realised that continued pressure from the Boers would lead to the destruction of his kingdom. In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal with the Boers. It defined the boundaries of Basutoland and later Lesotho; those boundaries have not changed. The arable land west of the Caledon River remained in Boer hands, and is referred to as the Lost or Conquered Territory. This effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.  Legacy  Grave of Moshoeshoe I atop Thaba Bosiu. Although he had ceded much territory, Moshoeshoe never suffered a major military defeat and retained most of his kingdom and all of his culture. His death in 1870 marked the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the modern colonial period. Moshoeshoe Day is a national holiday in Lesotho celebrated every year on 11 March to commemorate the day of Moshoeshoe's death. Moshoeshoe I International Airport is named in his honour.  Cultural references  South African-made shweshwe fabric is named for King Moshoeshoe I who once received a gift of it and then popularized it throughout his realm. In episode two of the American animated series Animaniacs, the debuting Pinky and the Brain segment \\"Win Big\\" referenced Moshoeshoe I briefly when the Brain attempted to win $99,000 on a quiz show entitled \\"Gyp-parody\\" so that he might construct a machine that would magnetically hold to the earth any one with loose change in his pockets. One of the categories in the Jeopardy!-like game show is \\"Kings Named Moshoeshoe\\", to whose first answer, \\"He ruled Lestho [sic] in 1820\\", Brain gives the proper question, \\"Who was King Moshoeshoe I?\\" The program makes an error in date, as Moshoeshoe did not become monarch until 1822.

The establishment of this college was a realisation of a decision taken in 1938 by the Synod of Catholic Bishops in South Africa to provide African Catholic students with post- matriculation and religious guidance. The Catholic University College was founded in an isolated valley 34 kilometers from Maseru in a temporary primary school building at Roma Mission.

By virtue of the same charter, the Oblate Fathers kept a close relationship with the U.B.B.S. through serving on the Council and teaching, as well as in the physical presence of Pius XII College House, a residence for the Oblate community. University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland To be in line with the names chosen after independence in 1966, U.B.B.S. became the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. National University of Lesotho The decision to establish the National University of Lesotho on the Lesotho (Roma) campus site of the former U.B.L.S. was taken on October 20, 1975, by the National Assembly through Act No. 13 of 1975.

It lies north of London, southeast of Bedford, and north northwest of the county town of Hertford. Nearby towns include Royston to the northeast, Letchworth and Hitchin to the southwest and Stevenage to the south. History and etymology Baldock has an exceptionally rich archaeological heritage.Moorhead, Sam. \\"A survey of Roman coin finds from Hertfordshire\\", in Lockyear, Kris (2015).

Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements show the site of Baldock has been continuously occupied since prehistoric times.Mawer, J. E. B., Stenton, Allen and Gover, F. M.

At the beginning of the Iron Age there was a hillfort at Arbury Banks, 5 km to the northeast of Baldock, that dominated the area. In the Late Iron Age (c. 100 BC), the local power base shifted from the hillfort to the vicinity of Baldock. The soil was easily farmed and transportation was more convenient. In the later part of the middle Iron Age (from prior to c.100 BC) Baldock became the site of a large Oppidum, arguably the largest such site in Britain. The Oppidum in turn became a sizeable Roman settlement, which although not administratively important, seems to have been a significant cult centre. The Baldock area is also host to the highest quantity of finds of ancient coins in Hertfordshire after the Verulamium region. The site was used until the fifth or sixth century. The Roman settlement gradually disappeared and there is no entry for Baldock in the Domesday Book. Baldock was founded by the Knights Templar (also the name of the town's secondary school) as a medieval market town in the 1140s.Baldock Museum & Local History Society. Retrieved 6 December 2012.

It is a triangular parcel of land beside the old Roman Road cut out from an older estate; it is likely that the Templars used their knowledge of mathematics when siting buildings. The main theory of the origin of the name Baldock is as a derivation from the Old French name for Baghdad: Baldac or later Baudac, which the Templars had been thwarted from conquering during the Crusades. Although the Templars' connections to Baghdad were \\"tenuous\\", it was widely regarded as the most prosperous market in the world and the Templars perhaps hoped that the name would confer a similar prosperity on their own market town in England. Baldock – History and Further Information (downloaded 1 February 2015) Founding contemporaneous documents use the spelling Baudac. This place is first recorded as \\"Baldac\\" in the Pipe Rolls of Hertfordshire in 1168.https://books.google.com/books?id=UERBAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA59&lpg;=PA59&dq;=baudac&source;=bl&ots;=BNxJsnyZIs&sig;=j_9fsAx8_xl9bCXgCxIne2jCYC4&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=v7fPVJOoOoadyAS43oLYBQ&ved;=0CDcQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q;=baudac&f;=false The Place-names of Hertfordshire (Google eBook), by Walter William Skeat, East Herts Archaeological Society, 1904. Page 59 It is possible the Knights Templar used a name already in use, especially since the location was already a crossroads. Other etymologies have been suggested, including Middle English \\"balled\\" meaning bald together with Old English \\"ac\\" meaning oak; and a conjectured Old English personal name \\"Bealdoc\\" meaning bold (with diminutive -oc suffix). In addition the settlement was already thriving as a late-Saxon part of Weston, and may have been identified by a large old tree near the Saxon graveyard or where the Templar church was built. Marco Polo relates that in 1225 Alau the Great Lord of the Tartars captured the Calif and the great city of Baudac,https://books.google.com/books?id=0NBQAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA25&lpg;=PA25&dq;=baudac&source;=bl&ots;=lzy7j-sIm9&sig;=t24W8KtL6TcgB7kOi8CPRtGPeEk&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=TLTPVJCTPJenyAT58oBw&ved;=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q;=baudac&f;=false Travels of Marco Polo, by L. F. Benedetto, 1931. Page 26. achieving what the Crusaders had not. The connection between the great city of Baudac and the ruins of Babylon, in the facile minds of the Templars, were obscurely compared with the great city of London and the ruins of Baldock. The modern layout of the town and many buildings in the centre date from the sixteenth century, with the earliest dating from the fourteenth century. It was where the old Great North Road and the Icknield Way crossed. The A1(M) motorway (1963), was called the Baldock Bypass for some years. In March 2006, a new bypass removed the A505 road (part of the old Icknield Way to the east of Baldock) from the town. Thanks to its location, the town was a major staging post between London and the north: many old coaching inns still operate as pubs and hotels, and Baldock has a surprising number of pubs for its size. From the 1770s until 2008 the high street was very wide, Baldock Town Centre Strategy (downloaded 1 February 2015) a typical feature of medieval market places where more than one row of buildings used to stand. In the case of Baldock, the bottom of the High Street had three such rows, until Butcher's Row was demolished by the Turnpike authorities in the 1770s. In late 2008, a town centre enhancement plan included a narrowing of the road and subsequent widening of paved areas. Since the 16th century, Baldock has been a centre for malting, subsequently becoming a regional brewing centre with at least three large brewers still operating at the end of the 19th Century, despite a decline in demand for the types of beer produced locally. The 1881 Census records approximately 30 drinking establishments (the town's population was at that time around 1900). Throughout the early 20th century a large number of pubs continued to operate, many of which were sustained by the adjacent and much larger town of Letchworth, which had no alcohol retailers prior to 1958, and had only two pubs and a single hotel bar until the mid-1990s. Its larger population had for many years visited both Baldock and Hitchin for refreshment. The Wynn almshouses, in the High Street, were founded in 1621 and were endowed \\"To the World's End\\" by John Wynne, a cloth merchant from London who left £1000 in his will of 1614 for their upkeep.AA Touring Guide of England, 1974, PAGE 138, Since 1850, the town has a railway station which today operates on the line between London Kings Cross and Cambridge. With frequent services to London, including fast services of around 30 minutes, the town is home to many commuters. The station is part of the Thameslink Programme which will connect Cambridge to Farringdon, City Thameslink and Blackfriars via the Great Northern Route. There has been human activity on the site well before the modern town was founded. Prehistoric remains on Clothall Common date back as far as c 3000 BCE. Many Roman remains have been discovered during building work in and around the town, and the core of the Roman settlement lies between Walls Field and Bakers Close. Earlier Iron Age remains have also been uncovered in the same general location, which may be the earliest town ever to develop in Britain. A medieval leper colony, on Royston Road, was located during excavations in 2003, having been thought for many years to lie to the south-east of the town on the former Pesthouse Lane (now Clothall Road), the A507. From 1808 to 1814, Baldock hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain that connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth. A history of Baldock's Middle Ages () was compiled by Vivian Crellin, a former headmaster of the Knights Templar School, while local archaeologists Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews and Gilbert Burleigh published Ancient Baldock: the story of an Iron Age and Roman town in 2007. Baldock's position at the crossing of two important thoroughfares, the Great North Road and the Icknield Way has made it a stopping point for a number of illustrious visitors, including Charles I, who passed through Baldock en route for London after his arrest in 1648 .

A Vision of Britain Through Time: John Wesley In the 1960s and 70s Baldock was a centre of laser research at a MOD laboratory called SERL (Services Electronics Research Laboratory). This facility closed in the late 1970s and some projects and staff were transferred to RSRE (Royal Signals & Radar Establishment) near Pershore. Tesco supermarket Baldock was formerly the location of a film processing factory which closed before the company (originally based in Letchworth Garden City) could move in; local folklore has it that it was a silent film studio, but this is not the case. The building was then bought by the Full-Fashioned Hosiery Company from Halifax, later becoming the Kayser Bondor ladies stocking factory (which temporarily produced parachutes during World War II). Its Art Deco facade still stands as the largest Listed Building in the town; it was converted to a Tesco supermarket in the late 1980s. Church of St Mary the Virgin Another notable building in the town is the thirteenth century Baldock Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin at the centre of the town. The original church was built in about 1150 by the Knights Templar before being largely rebuilt in about 1330 by the Knights Hospitaller. It is a Grade I listed building.\\"Church of Saint Mary, Baldock\\". British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 14 April 2014. Malting and brewing were formerly major industries in the town, but apart from some light industry, today it is mostly a commuter town. Baldock also has a prominent roofing merchant. The original incarnation of the local football team Baldock Town F.C. was formed in 1905. The club folded in 2001 but a new club was formed two years later. To the east of the town there is a large residential estate that was built in several phases. This is known as Clothall Common. An archaeological dig took place in this part of Baldock in the late 1980s. According to the humorous book The Meaning of Liff, a Baldock is defined as: \\"The sharp prong on the top of a tree stump where the tree has snapped off before being completely sawn through\\". Events Several events take place in Baldock throughout the year. The largest three are the Annual Beer Festival, the Charter fair and the Balstock music festival.  Baldock Festival  The Baldock Festival is a cultural festival which started in 1983 and takes place on the first weekend in May. The festival consists of events throughout the town and the local area, such as museum trips, a barn dance, cheese tasting, brewery tours, clairvoyance evening, cricket match, comedy sketches, family quiz night, mystery tour, open gardens, history talks, and several music events, some of which feature local bands. The festival culminates in the Historic Street Fair held in the High Street, on the second and final weekend where stallholders dress in clothing of the era and help to portray what life was like in the historic town. The Baldock Beer Festival takes place during the first weekend where local and national real ales, real ciders and continental lagers may be sampled.  Baldock Charter Fair  Baldock's Charter Fair dates back to 1199, when King John granted to the Templars the right of holding a yearly fair at Baldock on St. Matthew's Day and for four days following. This would mean the original fair was held on 21–25 September, but with the Calendar reform of 1752 the dates are now 2, 3 and 4 October. Today the principal part of the fair is a visiting Amusement Fair which sets up in the High Street.  Balstock  In 2015, the Balstock Festival completed its tenth year, having grown from a small event held in one pub, to a three-day event featuring more than 200 artists held on 13 stages across the town.{http://www.balstock.com/info/history/} It is now Hertfordshire's biggest free music festival with all proceeds going to a nominated charity.{http://www.balstock.com/info/history/} In 2015, that charity was Up on Downs, a local charity which provides which aids families that have children with Downs Syndrome.{http://balstock.com/tag/charity-2/} The 2012 festival resulted in some controversy with a dispute between the organisers of the festival and the Performing Rights Society In literature Daniel Defoe, in his book A tour through the whole island of Great Britain, passed through Baldock and commented: \\"Here is that famous Lane call'd Baldock Lane, famous for being so unpassable, that the Coaches and Travellers were oblig'd to break out of the Way even by Force, which the People of the Country not able to prevent, at length placed Gates, and laid their lands open, setting Men at the Gates to take a voluntary Toll, which Travellers always chose to pay, rather than plunge into Sloughs and Holes, which no Horse could wade through.\\" Baldock is one of the waypoints on Warren's long drive up the Great North Road, which brings about the occasion for the novel's plot, the rescue of the shipbuilding town of 'Sharples' (Blyth), in \\"Ruined City,\\" by Nevil Shute. Baldock is mentioned frequently in the supernatural thriller The Green Man by Kingsley Amis (1969). The town is the nearest centre to the fictional pub owned and run by the main character \\"Maurice Allington\\". The Green Man was later adapted into a television drama starring Albert Finney as Allington. The author Monica Dickens, who lived in nearby Hinxworth for four years after World War II, refers to her regular visits to Baldock and to The George and Dragon public house in particular, in her 1978 autobiography An Open Book.Dickens, Monica An Open Book, Mayflower Books/Heinemann (1978) pgs 111–122 Education=Primary education *St Mary's Church of England (VC) Infant School *St Mary's Church of England (VC) Junior School *Hartsfield Junior Mixed and Infant School *St John Roman Catholic Primary School Secondary education *Knights Templar School *Brandles School Notable people * Arthur Archdale (1882–1948), cricketer and Royal Artillery officer. * Robert Bennet (died 1617), English Anglican bishop and the Dean of Windsor. * Sir Peter Bonfield, formerly Chief Executive of ICL and more recently of BT Group * Samuel Farr (1827–1918), 19th-century builder and architect in Christchurch, New Zealand * Elizabeth Hall, international athlete * Reginald Hine (1883-1949), solicitor and historian whose writings centred on Hitchin and its environs. * Albert Ireton (1879-1947), British tug of war competitor and boxer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics * Keith Milow, artist, Harkness Fellow * Ben Mosley, British expressionist artist * Rev.

He spent most of his career in South Florida. He was known for his life sized realistic sculptures of people. He cast the works based on human models in various materials, including polyester resin, fiberglass, Bondo, and bronze. In 2018, two of Hanson's works were exhibited at the Met Breuer in the show \\"Like Life\\", which NY Times critic Roberta Smith reviewed, stating \\"(the show) juxtaposes figurative sculptures throughout time. On view was Hanson's hyper-realistic “Housepainter II” (1984), and “Hermes,” attributed to Polykleitos (A.D. first or second century). Mr. Hanson's sculpture of a black man whitewashing a brown wall underscores the curators’ point that ancient marbles were originally brightly colored — and that the whiteness of Classical art is a fiction that has “colored” the Western view of perfection. Peter Scheldahl, noted in his March 2018 article for The New Yorker about the show \\"Like Life\\", \\"his (Hanson's) hyperrealistic tableaux, starring a frowsy working-class housewife and a weary housepainter, curiously become ever more affecting as their period looks recede in time.\\" Hanson's works are in the permanent collections of The Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and The Smithsonian. Education Duane Elwood Hanson was born January 17, 1925, in Alexandria, Minnesota. After attendance at Luther College and the University of Washington, he graduated from Macalester College in 1946. Following a period where he taught high school art, he received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills in 1951. Career and style Around 1966 Hanson began making figural casts using fiberglass and vinyl. Works that first brought him notice were of figures grouped in tableaux, some depicting brutal and violent subjects. Hanson's Abortion (1966) was inspired by the horrors of an illicit backroom procedure, and Accident (1967) showed a motorcycle crash. Race Riot (1969–1971) included among its seven figures a white policeman terrorizing an African American man as well as an African American rioter attacking the policeman. Other works which dealt with physical violence or other explosive social issues of the 1960s were Riot (1967), Football Players (1969), and Vietnam Scene (1969). These sculptures, cast from actual people, were painted to make the revealed skin look realistic, replete with veins and blemishes. Hanson then clothed the figures with garments from second-hand clothing stores or from the person who modeled for him. Clearly these works contained strong social comment, and can be seen as modern parallels to the concerns of 19th-century French Realists such as Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, artists Hanson admired. Few of Hanson's early sculptures would survive because he later destroyed many of them, preferring to be known for his more mature style. Around 1970, Hanson abandoned gut-wrenching scenes for more subtle, though no less vivid ones. In that year he made the Supermarket Shopper, Hardhat, and Tourists; Woman Eating was completed in 1971. These were also life-sized, clothed, fiberglass figures. Unlike the earlier works, however, these were single or paired figures, and not overtly engaged in a violent activity. Instead, his figures often had a listless, bored affect, staring into the distance and disengaged from their surroundings. In 1967, art dealer Ivan Karp attempted to persuade Hanson to move from South Florida to New York City, and the artist moved to Manhattan in 1969, residing on The Bowery (Bleecker Street) across the street from CBGB. However, in 1973, Hanson moved to Davie, Florida, where he would spend the remainder of his life. While the earlier works tended to be more contained spatially, the later figures had no clearly defined boundaries separating them from the viewer. They quite literally inhabited the viewer's space—with amusing results at times, as in the cases of Reading Man (1977) or Photographer (1978). Hanson sometimes would cast his own children in his work, as in Cheerleader (1988), and Surfer (1987).

Faith and Practice Doctrines of this church include the unity of one God (Unitarianism); the inspired infallible original texts of God's Word as the final authority of faith and practice; receiving the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues; the pre-millennial return of Christ; observance of weekly seventh-day Sabbath, new moon Sabbaths, and feast days (Pentecost, Unleavened Bread, First fruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles). The church rejects the idea of a Trinity, and the observing of days such as Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day. Salvation is available through Jesus to those who have been baptized into Jesus' Name, received the baptism of the Holy Spirit (With the sign of speaking in tongues), and are obedient to His commandments. Church Name John Quincy Adams had a number of followers, but did not formally organize a new denomination. After his death, the group remembered a dream of one of its members, and based on that dream, took a name to further identify themselves: \\"Many times they were asked, 'To what church do you belong?' They always replied, 'We don't belong to any church--We just follow Jesus'. One night one of them dreamed that when asked this question, she replied, 'I belong to the church of the Little Children of JESUS CHRIST!'\\" Church members usually write the church name as \\"Church of the little children of JESUS CHRIST\\" or \\"church of the little children of Jesus Christ\\". John Quincy Adams followed a Oneness or concurrent modalistic monarchian form of Unitarianism, not to be confused with dynamic monarchianism another Unitarian teaching. Status The Church of the Little Children of Jesus Christ maintains a minimum of organization and does not keep membership rolls. Therefore, statistics are not available. The last count from the _Encyclopedia of American Religions_ reported \\"in the early 1970s...eight congregations and fewer than 100 members...\\" in Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, and Saskatchewan. The church also engages in fellowshipping with other Sabbatarian congregations existing outside of organized religious groups, so the network of this church is much broader than its own congregations. Activities of the church include personal community evangelism by members; a monthly newsletter (known as The Gathering Call); a tape ministry; an internet ministry; and publication of the writings by John Quincy Adams. The Prophetic Word and Great Memorial Days are two of Adams' books that formulate much of the doctrine of the church. Services among the churches of the Little Children of Jesus Christ generally consist of praise and worship through singing, an extended time of prayer, interactive Bible study, sermons, and testimonies. References in popular culture Colleen Mccullough mentions the Children of Jesus in her novel 'The Independence of Mary Bennet'. Mary is abducted by the leader of the sect in order to write out the Church's doctrine. References *Encyclopedia of American Religions, J.

Nursing homes may also be referred to as skilled nursing facility (SNF), long-term care facilities, old people's homes,old people's home in the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary care homes, rest homes, convalescent homes or convalescent care. Often, these terms have slightly different meanings to indicate whether the institutions are public or private, and whether they provide mostly assisted living, or nursing care and emergency medical care. Nursing homes are used by people who do not need to be in a hospital, but cannot be cared for at home. The nursing home facility nurses have the responsibilities of caring for the patients' medical needs and also the responsibility of being in charge of other employees, depending on their ranks. Most nursing homes have nursing aides and skilled nurses on hand 24 hours a day. While nearly 1 in 10 residents age 75 to 84 stays in a nursing home for five or more years, nearly 3 in 10 residents in that age group stay less than 100 days, the maximum duration covered by Medicare, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Some nursing homes also provide short-term rehabilitative stays following surgery, illness, or injury. Services may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech- language therapy. Nursing homes also offer other services, such as planned activities and daily housekeeping. Nursing homes may offer memory care services, often called dementia care. History thumb Poorhouses/workhouses were the first implemented national framework to provide a basic level of care to the old and infirm. Pictured, is \\"The workroom at St James's workhouse\\" from The Microcosm of London (1808). Starting in the 17th century, the concept of poorhouses (also referred to as almshouses) were brought to North America by English settlers. All orphans, mentally ill and the poor elderly were placed into these living commons. In the twenty-first century, nursing homes have become a standard form of care for the most aged and incapacitated persons. Nearly 6 percent of older adults are sheltered in residential facilities that provide a wide range of care. Yet such institutions have not always existed; rather, their history and development reflect relatively recent demographic and political realities that shape the experience of growing old. Before the nineteenth century, no age-restricted institutions existed for long-term care. Rather, elderly individuals who needed shelter because of incapacity, impoverishment, or family isolation often ended their days in an almshouse. Placed alongside the insane, the inebriated, or the homeless, they were simply categorized as part of the community's most needy recipients. These poorhouses gave a place where they could be given shelter and daily meals. Poorhouses continued to exist into the early 20th century despite the criticism they faced. Much of the criticism stemmed from the conditions of the poorhouses. The Great Depression overwhelmed the poorhouses as there were a lot of people that needed help and care but not enough space and funding in the poorhouses. Due to Muck Raking in the 1930s the less than favorable living conditions of the poorhouses were exposed to the public. Poorhouses were then replaced with a different type of residential living for the elderly. These new residential living homes were called board-and-care homes or also known as convalescent homes. These board-and-care homes would provide basic levels of care and meals in a private setting for a specific fee. Board-and-care homes proved to be a success and by World War 2, the new way of nursing homes began to take shape. As the times continued to change, the government identified the issue of people spending extensive amounts of time in hospitals. To combat these long stays in short-term settings, board- and-care homes began to convert into something more public and permanent that was state and federally funded. From this, by 1965 nursing homes were a solid fixture. Nursing homes were a permanent residence where the elderly and disabled (poor elderly and disabled specifically) could receive any necessary medical care and receive daily meals. Though nursing homes in the beginning were not perfect, they were a huge step above almshouses and poorhouses in regards to following laws and maintaining cleanliness. From the 1950s through the 1970s the dynamics of nursing homes began changing significantly. Medicare and Medicaid began to make up much of the money that would filter through the homes and the 1965 amendment laws enforced nursing homes to comply with safety codes and required registered nurses to be on hand at all times. Additionally, nursing homes may sue children for the costs of caring for their parents in jurisdictions which have filial responsibility laws. Later in 1987, the Nursing Reform Act was introduced to begin defining the different types of nursing home services and later added the Residents' Bill of Rights. Today nursing homes are very different across the board. Some nursing homes still resemble a hospital while others look more like a home. Nursing home residents can pay for their care out of pocket, others may receive medicare for a short time and some may use long-term insurance plans. Across the spectrum, most nursing homes will accept medicaid as a source of payment. Elder abuse There are 3 major types of abuses reported in nursing homes: physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Physical abuse is the intention or action to hurt an elderly person resulting in scars and bruising. Emotional abuse occurs when an employee makes verbal threats and continuously degrades the patient, resulting in the patient experiencing mood swings, anxiety, and depression. Sexual abuse is when an elderly patient is being forced into unwanted sexual activity by an employee, resident or visitor, usually attempted and reported when the patient is sleeping, sick, or weak. Nursing home neglect is similar to elder abuse. It is when employees begin to repeatedly ignore and leave a patient alone, neglect the patient's personal hygiene like bathing and brushing of teeth, provide the patient a reasonable amount of food and water, and neglect to provide the patient with the correct amount of medication he or she requires. One factor unique to elder abuse in nursing homes is that many nursing home contracts require residents to sign delegation clauses, giving up their right to trial by jury and instead using an Arbitrator to settle disputes.An 87-Year-Old Nun Said She Was Raped in Her Nursing Home. Here’s Why She Couldn't Sue, Haley Sweetland Edwards Time Magazine. 16 November 2017 Staff All of the nursing homes employees are all required to be licensed or uphold a certificate in the state of which they work. In most facilities, nursing homes are required to provide enough staff to adequately care for residents. In the U.S., for instance, nursing homes must have at least one registered nurse (RN) available for at least 8 straight hours a day throughout the week, and at least one licensed practical nurse (LPN) on duty 24 hours a day. Direct care nursing home employees usually include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants, and physical therapists, amongst others.  Nurses  Nursing homes require that a registered nurse (RN) be present to assess and monitor residents. Registered Nurses are typically required to have between two and six years of education. The RN's job duties include implementing care plans, administering medications, recording and maintaining accurate reports for each resident, monitoring and recording medical changes and providing direction to the nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses (LPN). RNs are not required to choose a specialization. To gain recognition as a specialized nurse professional, RNs typically need to undergo further experience through clinical practices, and becoming educated in their specialized field. LPNs are typically required to have a year of training before working with any patients. The LPNs monitors residents' well-being and administers treatments and medications, such as dressing wounds and dispensing prescribed drugs. LPNs responsible for patients direct bed care and carry out a daily routine  Nursing assistants  A nursing assistant provides basic care to patients while working directly under a LPN or RN. These basic care activities, also referred to as activities of daily living, can include assisting with bathing and dressing residents, helping residents with meals, either serving them or with feeding, transferring to and from the bed or wheelchair, making and cleaning beds, assisting with toileting, and answering call lights. Nursing assistants' official titles can vary between jurisdictions and facilities. They can include Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), nursing aides, caregivers, patient care associates, patient care technicians, personal care attendants (PCAs), and care assistants. Administration Depending on the size of the nursing home, a nursing home may have either a nursing home administrator or an executive director. Some nursing homes may have both, but their job duties are similar and can include overseeing staff, supplying medical supplies, and financial matters. Some nursing homes also have human resources personnel, who are in charge of all aspects of hiring new employees. Human resources job duties vary but can also include coordinating payroll, organizing orientation programs for new employees, interviewing, disciplinary actions, and ensuring compliance with federal and state laws. Nursing homes are usually licensed and heavily regulated under governing legislation. Compliance with the federal and state legislatures are reviewed regularly for adherence to strict standards of building codes, care plans, behavior and altercations between residents, nutrition and dietary services, medical services, nursing and personal care, religious and spiritual practices, pets, and recreational programs.http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ltc/docs/ltcha_guide_phase1.pdf A Guide to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007 and Regulation 79/10 Housekeeping Housekeepers perform the everyday duty of cleaning and keeping up nursing homes. Housekeepers play a huge part in ensuring that nursing homes are kept clean and free of disease causing agents. Housekeepers have a long list of duties which include cleaning floors, changing linens, disinfecting bathrooms, changing towels, washing clothes, emptying garbage cans, sanitizing rooms, replenishing supplies, dusting and polishing furniture, vacuuming, and keeping windows and woodwork clean. These duties can be different from facility to facility but will overall include basic cleaning. Housekeeping does not require any licensure or schooling, but some housekeeping jobs may prefer prior job experience. Recreational staff Recreational staff usually include an activity director and possibly activity assistants depending on the size of the nursing home. Activities aim to meet each residents' emotional, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, and vocational needs. The transition from being independent to having to depend on others and be away from home is oftentimes very difficult, which is why activities are important to combat depression and anxiety. Some of the different activities that may be offered include hosting birthday parties, celebrating holidays, book clubs, musical events, outdoor activities, discussion and social groups, exercise, arts and crafts, pet therapy, religious services and community outings. Volunteer involvement is also an important part of nursing home activities given that volunteers can act as a link between the nursing home and the outside community. Therapy=Occupational therapy One of the many services offered in a nursing home is occupational therapy. Occupational therapy may be necessary following an injury or illness in order to regain skills and to receive support during any physical or cognitive changes. Occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, grooming. Occupational therapy also assists with instrumental activities of daily living which include home and financial management, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. Occupational therapists work to allow the person to safely and comfortably reintegrate into society by practicing public dining, transferring to different surfaces (chairs, beds, couches etc.), and will assess the need for any home modifications or safety equipment to ensure a proper and safe transition. When a cognitive and/or perceptual deficit is presented, therapists will work with the person by teaching strategies to maximize memory, sequencing and attention span length. Physical therapy thumb Another important service found in a nursing home is physical therapy. Physical therapy may be necessary following an injury, illness or surgery. Physical therapy works with the person to help them regain strength, endurance, flexibility, balance and range of motion. Physical therapy is also used as a way of preventing injuries and accidents by focusing on restoring mobility, increasing fitness levels, reducing pain and overall reaching a certain point of independence. There are many conditions that can benefit from receiving physical therapy in a nursing home, these conditions include arthritis, pain associated with cancer, dementia, Alzheimer's, stroke and incontinence.  Speech language therapy  Speech-language pathology is another service found in a nursing home. Speech language pathologists specialize in working with those who have a difficult time with language and/or speech, usually following an injury or an underlying diagnoses. The SLP will evaluate the persons speech. If the person is having trouble with speech, this points to an issue with coordinating the movements and muscles used to produce speech. While trouble with language points to the person having difficulty with understanding what they are hearing and seeing. The SLP will also look at difficulty with swallowing food and will evaluate the person in order to figure out which part of the swallowing process is not working. Some of the many speech disorders worked with by the SLP are; Phonology meaning the speech patterns used, Apraxia meaning difficulty with coordinating the movements needed to make sounds, Receptive Language meaning difficulty understanding language, Fluency meaning stuttering, Expressive Language meaning difficulty using language and many other disorders. By country=Canada Long-term care facilities exist under three major types: privately owned, non-profit/charitable, and municipal. Regardless of their ownership, aspects of funding, admission criteria, and cost to the individuals are all regulated by their respective provincial governments.http://www.oltca.com/OLTCA/Documents/Reports/TILTC2016.pdf This is Long Term Care 2016 As medical care is publicly funded in Canada, all long- term care facilities receive funding from provincial governments for the health care component of the residence – the nurses and personal support workers. Residents pay daily rates for 'room and board' (accommodation and food) that are determined by the type of room chosen, either shared or private. Provincial governments manage waiting lists for long-term care facilities. People who cannot afford to pay the monthly fees receive subsidies, and no one is refused due to inability to pay.https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-long-term-care-home Find a long-term care home United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, care homes and care homes with nursing are regulated by different organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To enter a care home, a candidate patient needs an assessment of needs and of their financial condition from their local council. The candidate may also have an assessment by a nurse, should the patient require nursing care. The cost of a care home is means tested in England. Care homes for adults in the UK are regulated by Care Quality Commission, which replaced the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and each care home is inspected at least every three years. In Wales the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales has responsibility for oversight, In Scotland Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland otherwise known as the Care Inspectorate, and in Northern Ireland the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland. In 2002, nursing homes became known as care homes with nursing, and residential homes became known as care homes. As of April 2009, the lower capital limit is £13,500. At this level, all income from pensions, savings, benefits and other sources, except a \\"personal expenses allowance\\" (currently £21.90), goes towards paying the care home fees. The local council pays the remaining contribution provided the room occupied is not more expensive than the local council's normal rate. The NHS has full responsibility for funding the whole placement if the resident is in a care home with nursing that meets the criteria for NHS continuing Health Care. This is identified by a multidisciplinary assessment process.as detailed on the Department of Health website In May 2010, a coalition government announced the formation of an independent commission on the funding of long-term care, which was due to report within a 12-month time frame on the financing of care for an ageing population. It delivered its recommendations on Monday 4 July 2011. The Care Quality Commission have themselves implemented a re-registration process, completed in October 2010, which will result in a new form of regulation being outlined in April 2011. United States In the United States, there are three main types of nursing facilities (NFs). An intermediate care facility (ICF) is a health care facility for individuals who are disabled, elderly, or non-acutely ill, usually providing less intensive care than that offered at a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Typically an ICF is privately paid by the individual or by the individual's family. An individual's private health insurance and/or a third party service like a hospice company may cover the cost. Board and Care Homes are special facilities designed to provide those who require assisted living services both living quarters and proper care. Often referred to as residential care homes, these facilities can either be located in a small residential home or a large modern facility. In fact, a large majority of board and care homes are designed to room less than 6 people. Board and care homes are typically staffed by licensed professionals, including nurses, doctors and other medical professionals. These facilities are highly regulated in order to ensure that the best possible care is being provided for the residents. Board and care homes offer residents 24 hour assistance, making them a highly popular choice for those in need of regular assistance. Assisted living residences or assisted living facilities (ALFs) are housing facilities for people with disabilities. These facilities provide supervision or assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs); ALFs are an eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity. A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is a nursing home certified to participate in, and be reimbursed by Medicare. Medicare is the federal program primarily for the aged (65+) who contributed to Social Security and Medicare while they were employed. Medicaid is the federal program implemented with each state to provide health care and related services to those who are below the poverty line. Each state defines poverty and, therefore, Medicaid eligibility. Those eligible for Medicaid may be low- income parents, children, including State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIPs) and maternal-child wellness and food programs. seniors, and people with disabilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is the component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. A large portion of Medicare and Medicaid dollars is used each year to cover nursing home care and services for the elderly and disabled. State governments oversee the licensing of nursing homes. In addition, states have a contract with CMS to monitor those nursing homes that want to be eligible to provide care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Congress established minimum requirements for nursing homes that want to provide services under Medicare and Medicaid. These requirements are broadly outlined in the Social Security Act, which also entrusts the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing these requirements. CMS is also charged with the responsibility of working out the details of the law and how it will be implemented, which it does by writing regulations and manuals.

Other students included composers Matteo Capranica and Joseph Haydn. Biography Porpora was born in Naples. He graduated from the music conservatory Poveri di Gesù Cristo of his native city, where the civic opera scene was dominated by Alessandro Scarlatti. Porpora's first opera, Agrippina, was successfully performed at the Neapolitan court in 1708. His second, Berenice, was performed at Rome. In a long career, he followed these up by many further operas, supported as maestro di cappella in the households of aristocratic patrons, such as the commander of military forces at Naples, prince Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt, or of the Portuguese ambassador at Rome, for composing operas alone did not yet make a viable career. However, his enduring fame rests chiefly upon his unequalled power of teaching singing. At the Neapolitan Conservatorio di Sant'Onofrio and with the Poveri di Gesù Cristo he trained Farinelli, Caffarelli, Salimbeni, and other celebrated vocalists, during the period 1715 to 1721. In 1720 and 1721 he wrote two serenades to libretti by a gifted young poet, Metastasio, the beginning of a long, though interrupted, collaboration. In 1722 his operatic successes encouraged him to lay down his conservatory commitments. After a rebuff from the court of Charles VI at Vienna in 1725, Porpora settled mostly in Venice, composing and teaching regularly in the schools of La Pietà and the Incurabili. In 1729 the anti-Handel clique invited him to London to set up an opera company as a rival to Handel's, without success, and in the 1733–1734 season, even the presence of his pupil, the great Farinelli, failed to save the dramatic company in Lincoln's Inn Fields (the \\"Opera of the Nobility\\") from bankruptcy. An interval as Kapellmeister at the Dresden court of the Elector of Saxony and Polish King Augustus from 1748 ended in strained relations with his rival in Venice and Rome, the hugely successful opera composer Johann Adolph Hasse and his wife, the prima donna Faustina, and resulted in Porpora's departure in 1752. From Dresden he went to Vienna, where among other pupils he trained the young Marianne von Martinez, a future composer. As his accompanist and valet he hired the youthful Joseph Haydn, who was making his way in Vienna as a struggling freelancer.Griesinger, p. 12 Haydn later remembered Porpora thus: \\"There was no lack of Asino, Coglione, Birbante [ass, cullion, rascal], and pokes in the ribs, but I put up with it all, for I profited greatly from Porpora in singing, in composition, and in the Italian language.\\" He also said that he had learned from the maestro \\"the true fundamentals of composition\\". In 1753 Porpora spent three summer months, with Haydn in tow, at the spa town Mannersdorf am Leithagebirge. His function there was to continue the singing lessons of the mistress of the ambassador of Venice to the Austrian Empire, Pietro Correr. Porpora returned in 1759 to Naples. From this time Porpora's career was a series of misfortunes: his florid style was becoming old- fashioned, his last opera, Camilla, failed, his pension from Dresden stopped, and he became so poor that the expenses of his funeral were paid by a subscription concert. Yet at the moment of his death, Farinelli and Caffarelli were living in splendid retirement on fortunes largely based on the excellence of the old maestro's teaching. A good linguist, who was admired for the idiomatic fluency of his recitatives, and a man of considerable literary culture, Porpora was also celebrated for his conversational wit. He was well- read in Latin and Italian literature, wrote poetry and spoke French, German and English. Besides some four dozen operas, there are oratorios, solo cantatas with keyboard accompaniment, motets and vocal serenades. Among his larger works, his 1720 opera Orlando, oratorio Gedeone (1737), one mass, his Venetian Vespers, and the operas Germanico in Germania (1732) and Arianna in Nasso (1733 according to HOASM) have been recorded.

Historically part of Cheshire, it lies south of Liverpool, close to the River Mersey on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula. Nearby towns include Birkenhead and Wallasey to the north- northwest, and Heswall to the west-southwest. Bebington railway station opened in 1838 and is situated on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. The electoral ward, which includes the original village centres of Higher Bebington and Lower Bebington, had a total resident population of 13,720 at the 2001 Census. increased to 15,768 at the 2011 Census. Some definitions of Bebington include adjoining areas such as Port Sunlight (an early planned factory town), New Ferry, Spital and Storeton. The former municipal borough of Bebington, a local authority between 1937 and 1974, also included within its boundaries Bromborough, Eastham, Raby, Thornton Hough and Brimstage, which now fall within the electoral wards of Bromborough, Eastham and Clatterbridge.Boundaries of former Bebington municipal borough According to a 2015 study commissioned by Royal Mail from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, Bebington's postcode area, CH63, is the most desirable in England in which to live and work. The study found that the area had \\"the ideal balance\\" of housing close to places of work, good schools and high employment.BBC News, \\"Most 'desirable' postcodes in the UK revealed\\", 23 March 2015. Retrieved 23 March 2015 History The name Bebington is derived from the Anglo-Saxon meaning the \\"Village of Bebba\\", probably a Saxon chief or landowner. The area is thought to be the site of the \\"Birth of England\\" at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, an English victory by the army of Æthelstan, King of England, and his brother Edmund over the combined armies of Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin, Constantine II, King of Alba, and Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of the Cumbrians. Though relatively little known today, it was called \\"the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before Hastings.\\" Michael Livingston claimed that Brunanburh marks \\"the moment when Englishness came of age.\\" The Brackenwood golf course was cited in 2004 as the most likely site for the Battle of Brunanburh. Mention of the battle is made in dozens of sources, in Old English, Latin, Irish, Welsh, Anglo-Norman and Middle English, and there are many later accounts or responses to the battle. A contemporary record of the battle is found in the Old English poem Battle of Brunanburh, preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The Church of St. Andrew, on a site occupied since Saxon times, dates from the 14th and 16th centuries. In 1801, Bebington was a small country hamlet with a population of only 273, situated on the main road connecting Chester and Birkenhead, and then via ferry to Liverpool. Up to 30 horse-drawn coaches would pass by each day. By 1840, the Birkenhead to Chester railway was running and in 1844 the New Chester Road opened and Bebington lost its coaching traffic. In 1838, the footprints of an archosaur later called the Chirotherium storetonese were found in a sandstone bed at Storeton Quarry. Examples can be seen at the Liverpool Museum and at Christ Church within the parish of Higher Bebington. Also a small example can be seen at Higher Bebington Junior School, in their reception area. Stone quarried at Bebington was used for the construction of Birkenhead Town Hall, some of the villas around Birkenhead and Rock Parks and most famously of all the Empire State Building in New York City. The stone is considered to be a high quality sandstone which is creamy in appearance. The quarries were eventually filled in with debris removed during the construction of the two Mersey Tunnels. Mayer Hall, in Lower Bebington village, was formerly an art gallery built by Bebington philanthropist Joseph Mayer,http://www.themayertrust.org.uk/joseph.html a noted antiquarian, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon antiquaries helped in the development of British archaeology. He made Pennant House his home. It is still a community resource and boasts many of its original features. Geography Bebington is on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton, about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Gayton and less than west-north-west of the River Mersey at New Ferry. The area is situated at an elevation of between above sea level. Education Bebington contains ten main schools; Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Wirral Grammar School for Girls, St John Plessington Catholic College, St John's Junior and Infant Schools, Higher Bebington Junior School, Co-op Academy Bebington, Brackenwood Junior School, Stanton Road Primary School, St Andrew's Primary School, Town Lane Infants School, Church Drive Primary School.

The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners, which are angled inward, that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points- accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. History While informal bicycle racing existed to different extents, it was in Southern California that the sport of BMX started to become organized and resemble the modern sport. Original influencers included Ron Mackler, who was a park attendant in Santa Monica and set up races at Palms park in 1969.https://universityofbmx.com/history-of- bmx/history-1968-1974 Scot Breithaupt, a 13 year old aspiring Yamaha motocross support rider, developed the BUMS (Bicycle United Motocross Society) track in Long Beach California, and was influential in setting up multiple tours such as the Yamaha Gold Cup. Bikes sizes There are two BMX racing bikes sizes. One is the 20\\" wheel bike. This bike is common with minors and is currently the most common class. The Cruiser bikes are any bikes with a 24\\" wheel. However, any bikes that have a wheel larger than 24\\" will still be considered Cruisers. Cruisers are more common with older racers and is rapidly growing. The cruiser style bike tends to be easier to jump and rolls better while the 20\\" is seemingly more agile.http://www.livestrong.com/article/116012-bmx- biking/ Advantages While BMX racing is an individual sport, teams are often formed from racers in different classifications for camaraderie and often for business exposure of a sponsoring organization or company. BMX racing rewards strength, quickness, and bike handling. Many successful BMX racers have gone on to leverage their skills in other forms of bicycle and motorcycle competitions. Track features There are all types of BMX jumps, ranging from small rollers to massive step-up doubles. There are pro straights which are for junior and elite men. They are all doubles which range from about 6 m to 12 m, while \\"Class\\" straights have more flow and have many more range of jumps. the Start gate The start gate marks the start of the track. Most BMX tracks have a gate. The starting hill will normally provide all the speed for the remainder of the race. Generally, the larger the hill, the faster, so pro hills are much larger than the amateur ones. Step-up A step-up jump is one where the landing point is at a higher elevation than the take=off point. Berms Turns are at an angle. Therefore, one can easily turn without having to brake. Double A double is two hills close enough to each other that it is possible to jump between them. Step-down A step-down jump is one where the landing point is at a lower elevation than the take-off point. Roller A small hill, generally too low to be jumped off. Rollers are normally built in groups that are known as rhythm sections because they challenge the riders' ability to maintain speed over the bumps. Tabletop A tabletop is a jump where the track is level across between the take-off and landing points. They are especially useful for beginning BMX riders who are still learning how to jump since a too-short jump will land on the level tabletop rather than slamming into the uphill side of the landing hill. Pro set A set of jumps with only a takeoff lip and a landing ramp, that is, where a failure to take-off or to jump far enough will result in a crash. Olympics BMX racing became a medal sport at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under the UCI sanctioning body. The Sanctioning body of the United States is USA BMX. USA BMX is certified under the UCI (International Cycling Union), which is recognized by the Olympic Committee. Sanctioning bodies A sanctioning body is a private (in the United States and most Western Nations) governing body which controls a sport or specific discipline thereof. One or more sanctioning bodies may operate in a sport at any given time, often with subtle rule variations which appeal to regional tastes. They make and enforce the rules, and decide the qualifications and responsibilities of the participants, including the players, owners, and operators of facilities. In legal terms, they are an intermediary between the participants and higher governing bodies such as (in cycling) the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and National Governing Bodies such as USA Cycling. Sanctioning bodies mete out discipline and punishments, as well as bestow awards and rankings of their participants. In the Bicycle Motocross context, sanctioning bodies are chiefly responsible for providing insurance coverage and other \\"back office\\" services to local tracks. They also keep points on riders' performance throughout the year, and undertake the production of a national racing series (which is typically 18-22 weekends per year). Riders are permitted to race at the sanctioning body's affiliated tracks and national events via the purchase of an annual membership which costs (in the US) US$60. As part of their administrative \\"service provider\\" role, BMX sanctioning bodies also determine the rules of competition, such as clothing requirements, age and gender divisions (or \\"classes\\"), as well as the rules and protocol for advancement in proficiency classes (Novice, Intermediate, Expert, A Pro, AA Pro, Women, and Vet Pro in ABA, In NBL Rookie, Novice, Expert, Super-Ex, Elite, Masters are the proficiencys). BMX Racing has had many sanctioning bodies over its 40-year history as an organized sport, the first being Scot Breithaupt's Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS), created in the early 1970s (see below). Since then, there have been dozens of regional, national, and international sanctioning bodies, some of them associated with or owned by another. Most are defunct or have been merged into larger, more successful organizations, but a handful still exist in their original forms and are prospering. In the US, loyalty to one sanctioning body or another is a fundamental example of brand loyalty, where devotees of one vigorously assert the superiority of their chosen body overall others. AustraliaAustralian Bicycle Motocross Association (ABMXA)= Two ABMXA sanctioning bodies that formed in the history of BMX in Australia: The first one was formed in May 1975 by Bob Smith, an Australian businessman and two of his friends. He open the first BMX track in Australia on May 17, 1975 on the Gold Coast in Tallebudgera, Queensland adjacent to the Tally Valley Golf Club. He had admired BMX through the American magazines his son brought home.Bicycle Motocross News July 1975 Vol.2 No.6 pg.23 The second ABMXA was formed in April 1981 from three regional Australian BMX organizations: The Victoria BMX Association; (VBMXA), the Queensland BMX Association (QBMXA) and the New South Wales BMX Association (NSWBMXA). It was Australia's representative to the IBMXF in the 1980s. =National Bicycle Association (NBA)= The National Bicycle Association was a third, separate Australian sanctioning body. It was formed in December 1981 and had branches in different countries around the world. By the summer of 1982 it had 20,000 members worldwide and 950 members in the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales.BMX Torque August 1982 Vol.1 No.1 pg.30 Despite sharing a common name this association had nothing to do with the original United States–based National Bicycle Association that was formed in California in 1974 and ironically merged with the National Bicycle League and ceased operations as an independent body in December 1981, the same month and year the Australian namesake was formed. =Australian Cycling Federation (ACF)=Bicycle Motocross Australia (BMXA)= BMX Australia (BMXA) is the current sanctioning body for BMX in Australia. Canada *Cycling Canada Cyclism (CCC) *BMX Canada Currently - Cycling Canada http://www.cyclingcanada.ca/ is the Federal Sanctioning body for all Canadian cycling disciplines (including BMX) under the UCI. Some tracks and Provinces have chosen BMX Canada over the Provincial UCI representative. Here are the different choices that are available in Canada, Alberta - ABA -Alberta BMX Association. http://www.albertabmx.com/ British Columbia - Cycling BC. http://cyclingbc.net/bmx/ Saskatchewan - http://www.saskcycling.ca/BMX.html Quebec - http://www.fqsc.net/BMX All Ontario tracks and some BC tracks are sanctioned by an American corporation - USA BMX (also known as ABA) under the assumed name BMX Canada - http://www.bmxcanada.org These tracks run rules separate from the UCI but offer similar race structure and age categorization. BMX Canada offers full support to their affiliated tracks, including point tracking, marketing materials, an in-house magazine and a coaching/retention program. Results from these races run under the USA BMX/BMX Canada name are used in the team selection process for Provincial and National teams. FranceFédération Française de Bicrossing (FFB)= La Fédération Française de Bicrossing, which in English translates to The French Federation of Bicrossing (FFB) was created on March 1, 1978 by Marcelle Seurat, a motorcycle importer and distributor. At first its primary purpose was to promote BMX and its products On May 17, 1980 it held is first race in Beaune, France. This organization would cease to exist in early 1981 after only acquiring 100 members. =Association Française de Bicrossing (AFdB)= L'Association Française de Bicrossing, which in English translates to the French Association of Bicrossing (FAB), was founded by Raymond Imbert, Rene Nicolas, Denis Mourier, Bernard Nicolas, Fabrice Pérez, Gerard Hinault and Pascal Giboulot on March 1, 1981. =Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC)= On January 1, 1990, the AFdB joined the FFC. On March 4, 1993, BMX was recognized as an important sport by the French Ministry for sports. Today the official French BMX Sanctioning body is now the Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC), or in English the French Cycling Federation (FCF). It has almost 10,000 members.the VBC site in the original French ItalyAssociazione Italiana BMX (A.I.BMX)= The Associazione Italiana BMX, which in English translates to Italian BMX Association, was founded in December 1981 by Aldo Gandolfo, an Italian journalist and sport promoter. In 1983 the A.I.BMX joined the I.BMX.F. and held the first official Italian BMX race. In 1984, the A.I.BMX held the first Italian international race in Pinerolo and organized the first Italian participation in European Championships. In 1985 Galdolfo left the Association, which was refounded with a new statute and a new board of directors. In 1988 the A.I.BMX concluded an agreement with the UISP in order to unify their respective national championships and in 1989 ceased the activity. =Unione Italiana Sport per Tutti (UISP)= The Unione Italiana Sport per Tutti, which in English translates to Italian Sport For All Association, is an amateur sport association which conducted an official BMX racing activity from 1985 to 1990, mainly developed in Piedmont and Emilia- Romagna. In 1988 concluded an agreement with the A.I.BMX in order to unify their respective national championships and in 1991 ceased the BMX activity. =Federazione Ciclistica Italiana= The Federazione Ciclistica Italiana (FCI), which in English translates to Italian Cycling Federation, is the national governing body of cycle racing in Italy and started conducting official BMX activity in 1984. It was a big promoter of BMX racing within the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) and in 1985 held the first FIAC World Championship in Jesolo (near Venice). Every year the FCI organize the National Championship (held in a single race normally on the first Sunday of July) and a season-long competition called Circuito Italiano BMX (seven rounds in 2008, with the same point system as the UEC European Championship) open to Italian and foreign riders. Japan *Japan Bicycle Motocross Association (JBA) NetherlandsStichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN)= The first sanctioning body in the Netherlands was called the Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Foundation (DBMXF)) and was co-founded on October 19, 1978 by Gerrit Does and Louis Vrijdag. It held its first race on April 21, 1979. In December 1980 it was folded into the KNWU (see below) but a second incarnation was created in 1987 called the Stichting Fietscross Promotie Nederland (the Dutch BMX Promotion Foundation) to promote Dutch racing in the Netherlands. This second \\"SFN\\" was dessoved in 1997. =Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie (KNWU)= On December 16, 1980 the SFN was integrated into the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie (KNWU) (in English the Royal Dutch Cycling Federation (RDCF)), the Dutch cycling sanctioning body that was the governing body for all types of cycling and represents the Netherlands as a member of the UCI. =Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF)= Some of the then- existing local tracks in 1980 did not become a member of the KNWU. Operating for a while independently, they formed another sanctioning body in 1987, the Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF), (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Federation (DBMXF)). Both organizations function as sanctioning bodies for BMX racing. New Zealand BMX 2008 Nationals held in the Christchurch suburb of Bexley *BMX New Zealand Incorporated (BMXNZ) is the recognised National Sporting Organisation (NSO) for BMX racing in New Zealand. It is a founding Member Organisation of Cycling New Zealand (CNZ) the National Federation for cycling in New Zealand. BMXNZ has a membership of 32 clubs (as of January 2017) based in seven regions. United KingdomUnited Kingdom Bicycle Motocross Association (UKBMXA)†= The UKBMXA was created in April 1980 by David Duffield as first as a way of promoting BMX in England. On August 30, 1980 it held its first BMX race in Redditch, England. This sanctioning body would later become affiliated with the IBMXF and represent England in the IBMXF sanctioned events including the European and World Championships. In the summer of 1985 it merged with the National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBMXA) with the UKBMXA being the dominant partner with its name carrying on.BMX Action Bike September 1985 Iss.34 =National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBMXA)*=British Bicycle Motocross Association (BBMXA)=English Bicycle Association (EBA)= In November 1989 UKBMX Association (UKBMXA) and the British BMX Association (BBMXA) merged and formed the English Bicycle Association (EBA). This combination would represent England in the IBMXF. =British Cycling= The EBA merged with the British Cycling Federation (BCF) which had represented all other aspects and disciplines of English bicycle racing other than BMX. This organization is now known as British Cycling. British Cycling now represents all aspects of sport cycling in the United Kingdom including BMX within the UCI. *Not to be confused with the now-defunct United States–based National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBmxA) (1972–1981) that was formerly known as the National Bicycle Association (NBA) and was the first BMX sanctioning body in the world. The British NBMXA ceased operations in the summer of 1985. United States On July 10, 1969, a group of boys riding their Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycles in Palms Park in West Los Angeles wanted to race. A park attendant, Ronald Mackler, a teenager with motorcycle motocross (MX) experience, helped them organize. Palms Park became to BMX as Elysian Fields is to American baseball, for at that moment Bicycle Motocross racing was born. By 1973, entrance fees of US$4.50 (which included a US$1.00 insurance fee for the year) for a 10-week season of Thursday-night racing was charged, and the top three racers in the season were given trophies. Then a new season of 10 weeks would start the following Thursday. The track operated well into the 1980s largely unchanged;, including the lack of a modern starting gate. =Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS)= The first BMX proto sanctioning body was the Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS) founded by Scot Breithaupt in Long Beach, California on November 14, 1970, when he was fourteen years old. On that day he put on his first ad hoc BMX race. At first BUMS simply referred to the transients that congregated in the field around 7th and Bellflower Streets where the track was located, but later Scot turned it into the acronym BUMS. The first race had 35 participants, who paid Scot a quarter (US25 cents) each for the privilege. At the next race 150 kids showed up. Since Scot was a motorcycle racer, he knew even at thirteen the importance of a sanctioning body and how races were run and organized. He used his personal trophies that he won racing motocross motorcycles as awards for the winning competitors. He gave out membership cards, wrote the rulebook, and had a points system for scoring and proficiency level promotion. He ran the first state championship in 1972, when he was all of 16 years old. Also due to his racing experience, he knew how to lay out a particularly exciting course. The track was about long and much more demanding than today's typical BMX course. It was more akin to what the professionals race on in special Pro sections of track at large events today, including water holes and high dropoffs. Indeed, this early track resembled more closely a shortened mountain biking course than today's comparatively well groomed BMX tracks. With the aforementioned exception of pro sections, today's tracks for the most part are pretty tame by comparison due to insurance concerns by the sanctioning bodies. The National Bicycle League even went so far as to ban double jumps in 1988. This first structured sanctioning body would eventually grow to seven tracks in California. This is what made him different from other track operators at the time: he did not just start one track but several others under a single jurisdiction of rules and regulations, all the requirements of a sanctioning body. Among the firsts credited to BUMS was the first professional race in 1975 at Saddleback Park with a US$200 purse. Breithaupt also promoted in a joint venture with the new National Bicycle Association (NBA) (which was established the year before) what would later be called \\"Nationals\\" with the Yamaha Bicycle Gold Cup series in 1974. They were three separate qualifying races held at three separate tracks in California sponsored and heavily promoted by Yamaha Motor Company Ltd. to decide the first \\"National\\" No. 1 racer at a fourth and final race at the Los Angeles Coliseum. It was an achievement of import in the infancy of BMX, but it was not a true national since virtually all the events were held in California and almost all racers were Californians. It would be left for other innovators to create a true national event. =National Bicycle Association (NBA)= Many followed Ronald Mackler, Rich Lee and Scot Breithaupt, opening impromptu often short-lived tracks sometimes within preexisting Motorcycle Motocross tracks; but with the exception of Breithaupt, the operators were independent \\"organizations\\" that operated individual tracks without any cohesion. What was needed was a governing body that would standardize and give direction and purpose to the grab bag of these amateur- run (in that these operators did not have this enterprise as the main concern of their lives) tracks. The first official BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot he was a promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed a group of kids trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX. Mismanagement irreparably damaged its reputation, including such practices as not reporting points totals in time, running races late and behind schedule, deliberately scheduling its own events opposite the events of other sanctioning bodies to weaken their attendance, and a less- than-attentive attitude to members. In its last two years it went through a name change to National BMX Association (NBmxA) in 1979. It tried to reorganize in 1981, starting new tracks and by most accounts had a spark of new energy and enthusiasm, but still suffered lack of ridership (racers were committed to other point races with the other sanctioning bodies). This was to no avail. The NBA, suffering financial difficulties, ceased sanctioning its own races and started joint operations and did merge its membership (but did not merge its management) with the NBL after the 1981 season. Mr. Alexander did try at least one more foray into the sport he helped to pioneer: he started the World Wide Bicycle Motocross Association (WWBMXA) in Chatsworth, California in 1981. Unfortunately it did not last more than two racing seasons. =National Bicycle League (NBL)= The National Bicycle League (NBL), a nonprofit organization, was started in 1974 by George Edward Esser (September 17, 1925 – August 31, 2006). It was originally based in Pompano Beach, Florida, in the US, but ultimately moved its headquarters is located in Hilliard, Ohio. George Esser was exposed to BMX by his son Greg Esser, who was famous within the sport and one of the sport's earliest superstars and first professionals. Like Ernie Alexander and Scot Breithaupt before him, he was a promoter who created the NBL as the BMX auxiliary to the National Motorcycle League (NML), now-defunct, when he became dissatisfied with how the races were run. The NBL started in Florida, and while it expanded rapidly on the East Coast of the United States and for most of its early history, it had only a few tracks west of the Mississippi River. That changed in 1982 when it inherited the membership and tracks of the defunct National Bicycle Association (NBA) which had ceased sanctioning its own races and then went into partnership with the NBL. The NBL acquired all the NBA tracks in the nation including all those west of the Mississippi. As a result, it became a nation-spanning sanctioning body like the ABA. In 1997 the NBL joined USA Cycling, a sanctioning body that has long supported road race, mountain biking and other cycling disciplines in the United States, tracing its roots back to 1920. The resulting organization is the National Federated body that represents cycling in the United States. USA Cycling is part of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) also known as UCI Cycling, the Switzerland-based international governing body that oversees virtually all aspects of cycling around the world (see International Sanctioning bodies below). The NBL had a previous association with the UCI through its affiliations with the defunct NBL sister organization, the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF), which was also co-founded by Mr. Esser. The UCI absorbed IBMXF in 1993 through its amateur cycling division, Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), which in the prior five years held joint World Championships for BMX with the IBMXF (See International Sanctioning bodies below). On May 17, 2011 The NBL announced that a letter of agreement was signed and approved by their Board of Directors, to merge operations with the ABA. The merged organization would be controlled by ABA ownership, and would be called USABMX. After a month of wrangling, and negotiation between the parties, the final documents were signed on June 18, 2011. That day was the first time in more than 35 years that the sport of BMX Racing was run under a single sanctioning body in North America. The following week, the NBL Midwest National in Warsaw, Indiana was the first event to be run under the USABMX banner (though was still an NBL-branded event, as part of their 2011 national series). The 2011 NBL Grand National was the final NBL race of all-time, held September 3–4, 2011 and dubbed \\"The Grand Finale.\\" =American Bicycle Association (ABA)= The American Bicycle Association (ABA), created by Gene Roden and Merl Mennenga in 1977, originated in Chandler, Arizona, USA. Mennenga thought at the time that the kids and their families were being cheated by unscrupulous promoters (not the aforementioned individuals). As the NBA was declining, the ABA inherited many of its tracks and members making the ABA within two years the largest, albeit youngest, and the first truly nation- spanning sanctioning body. It was the ABA which introduced the \\"Direct Transfer System\\" that shortened the duration of race events. The ABA also started the team trophy concept to award trophies and prizes to the bicycle shop and factory teams with the best race results over a season. It was also the first to install electronic gates for its starting line with \\"Christmas tree\\" style lights (reminiscent of drag racing), to ensure fairer starts. It also started the BMX Hall of Fame, now called the National BMX Hall of Fame, recognizing the pioneers and industry visionaries of the sport. Today it is the largest sanctioning body in the world (a position it won as early as 1979 when it surpassed the NBL and the old NBA in numbers) with an estimated 60,000 members and 272 affiliated tracks in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It is technically an international organization, but does not bill itself as one, based on its mandate to grow BMX in the United States, unlike its predecessor, the International Bicycle Motocross Association (IBMX), and its chief early rival, the NBA, both of which had international aspirations. The ABA brand was retired at the close of the 2011 season, becoming USABMX as part of its merger with the rival National Bicycle League (NBL). =Other notable American sanctioning bodies= Along with the majors and pioneers, there were other BMX governing bodies, both national and regional and past and present. Among them were the Bicycle Motocross League (BMXL); the United Bicycle Racers Association (UBR) (1977–1983); the United States Bicycle Motocross Association (USBA) (1984–1986), which merged with the ABA at the end of the 1986 racing season after financial trouble made it unsustainable; the International Cycling Association (ICA), which was started in part by professional racer Greg Hill in 1990; and the Southeast Region-based National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA) (1975–1988). They are all gone now, but they did affect, for good or ill, the American BMX scene. International sanctioning bodies=International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) The International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) was founded on April 3, 1981 by Gerrit Does, a former motocross racer and Dutch citizen. He introduced BMX to the Netherlands in 1974 after seeing it in the United States. He also started the first European BMX sanctioning body the Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Foundation (DBMXF) in English) in the Netherlands in 1978. George Esser, the same man who founded the American-based National Bicycle League (NBL) in 1974 was the co-founder of the IBMXF, after Mr. Does approached the NBL to begin preparations for the new body in December 1980 with the representatives of sanctioning bodies from Canada, Colombia, Japan, Panama, and Venezuela as well as representing his native the Netherlands. The IBMXF was a Waalre, the Netherlands-based body that conducted international events including its own World Championship event until its formal merger with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) amateur cycling division the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) in 1996 to form the largest international sanctioning body. The UCI championships have since superseded the old IBMXF championships and unlike the old FIAC BMX championships it has a pro class. The NBL was affiliated with the UCI through its previous ties with the IBMXF and its merger with the FIAC. In the old days of the IBMXF when you raced an IBMXF sanctioned race you received NBL state points and points that went toward your international standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for national number one plates. The World Championship title was open to 16 & over Experts and older amateurs in the 20\\" class as well as Pros in the 20\\" class. There is a class in European BMX called Superclass. In this class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted definition of amateur. However, no racer in Superclass could win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF affiliate the NBL, Superclass is the equivalent of the old \\"B\\" pro class and \\"A\\" pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World Championships. Among the European standards of racing the IBMXF observed is the rule that racers must stay within their lanes until out of the gate. This is to prevent racers from throwing elbows at each other and to eliminate major crashes before they even get to the first jump. However, on tracks with short straights those who must start from the outside lanes are at a serious disadvantage since they cannot begin moving inside to shorten the distance before the first turn. As a result, many races could be won or lose by lane assignment even before the race begins. In the first year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after having your standard racers to decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best of them. Because of this lost of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion. On January 1, 1993 the IBMXF and the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), the amateur governing branch of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) which handled Olympic Cycling, merged formally after having held joint World Championships since July 22, 1991 in Sandness, Norway (FIAC had been holding its own separate BMX World Championships starting 1986). After a further three year transition time in which the European and World Championships where credited as \\"IBMXF/FIAC\\" the UCI held its first official BMX World Championship in 1996 in England. It has continued to hold BMX European and World Championships ever since. Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) The Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) which in English stands for International Amateur Cycling Federation, which was based in Rome, Italy, was the amateur cycling arm of the UCI. It had direct ties to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It had no professional division. That was the purview of its professional counterpart based in Luxembourg, the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP), also operated by the UCI. However, a class of paid amateurs called the Superclass is allowed even though it may contradict the accepted notions of what an amateur is. However, members of the Supercross class could not win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. In any case, with the allowance of professionals in the Olympics this has largely become a moot point. USA Cycling, formerly the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) as it was known at the time, was the American affiliate of FIAC. However, it did not have a BMX division at this time. The NBL worked through the then independent IBMXF. Today after purchasing the NBL USA Cycling the NBL represents BMX in the UCI through USA Cycling. FIAC started holding its own BMX World Championships in 1984. At the time the IBMXF and FIAC were two separate International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. However, the IBMXF's was far more prestigious, professionally competently run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association (then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States's case it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced at the time in running BMX races. In some nations if you race in the IBMXF circuit (see above) you could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being allowed to race NBL if you race the ABA circuit if they had such rules in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC's only experience. For instance not only did you race three times to determine average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL, you also, if the class was big enough, raced the eighths, quarters and semis also three times and the best racers qualified for the Main. Then if you did qualify for the Main, you had to race the Main five times to find the final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20\\" class raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time- consuming, even at races scheduled over two days. For a sanctioning body then new to BMX, it was pretty efficient in terms of running an event (taking into consideration the multiple qualifying runs). However, because of its inexperience it was plagued with tracks of inferior quality, both in terms of difficulty, they were deemed far too easy for venues of an international event; and the building materials used, for example during the 1988 Championships in Mol, Belgium the track was built out of white sand, which became particularly boggy in the turns. \\"It feels like riding on the beach\\" BMX Plus! December 1988 Vol.11 No.23 pg.43 was a refrain from many American racers. This inexperience of track construction was rectified by 1991 when the FIAC and the IBMXF started holding combined World Championship series in 1991 after four years of holding separate championship events. The two bodies formally unified in 1993 (FICP was disbanded along with the FIAC by the UCI). After a three-year transition period, The UCI held its first World Championship in 1996 after absorbing the IBMXF and abolishing FIAC. With the increasing relaxation of the rules of Professionalism in the IOC, the merged governing body, run directly by the UCI, retained the professional division. Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) or in English the International Cycling Union, is a Switzerland-based international sanctioning body created in 1900 which has had its own international BMX racing program since 1982 (through FIAC) and have been holding World Championships for BMX racing since 1996. The UCI also supports Mountain Bike, Track, Road Race Cycling, and Cyclo-Cross. The UCI through its amateur division FIAC, held championships were separate and distinct from the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) World Championships until they started to hold the World Championships jointly starting in 1991 (see above). The American sanctioning body the National Bicycle League (NBL) was affiliated with the UCI via the old IBMXF which the NBL was a part of. With the merger of the IBMXF with FIAC, they in turn being folded into the UCI, and the NBL joining the USA Cycling directly, the NBL was affiliated with the UCI from 1996 to 2008. Beginning with the 2009 season, the ABA took over as the USA affiliate of UCI. Riders qualify for the annual UCI BMX World Championships through participation and qualifying in their own National Championship Race. In the US, this Championship race occurs in Desoto, TX on the Saturday of the ABA Supernationals (which are run on a Friday/Sunday schedule) in mid-March. General rules of advancement in organized BMX racing The sanctioning bodies have slightly different rules for qualifications of advancement in races between skill levels and age classification. For instance, the ABA and the NBL used different rules of qualifying for mains from the motos. The ABA used almost an all or nothing system called the Transfer System while the NBL (similar to the UCI for international competition) used a cumulative scoring scheme called the Moto System. Below are the general rules, structure of advancement within the American Bicycle Association (and now USABMX) compared to the NBL unless otherwise noted, but the generalities are similar between the sanctioning bodies. Skill levels, race structure, qualifying methods, awards Racers in the 20\\" class are grouped with others of the same relative age and experience levels; Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Veteran, \\"A\\" Pro, \\"AA\\" Pro in the ABA; Rookie, Novice, Expert, Elite Masters, \\"B\\" Pro (Superclass) and \\"A\\" Pro (Elite) in the NBL. They range from 5 & under Novice to 28 & over Expert in the ABA and from 5 & under Rookie to 35 & over Expert in the NBL. Cruiser Class (bicycles with 24\\" or greater diameter wheels) and the girl classes are not divided up into skill classes, only age classes in both the NBL and the ABA. The Cruiser class age brackets for example range from 9 & under to 51 & over for males, 10 & under to 41 & over for females in the ABA; and 9 & under to 55 & over males, 10 & under to 40 & over females in the NBL. In a typical day a racer will race several times with their group to determine the day's finishing order and awards. The qualifying rounds, called Motos (called heats in other types of racing) determines the number of racers in the finals which are called Mains, up to eight racers. The sizes and number of motos at a skill level and age group is determined by the number of racers who register for that race and in that skill level and age group. Usually a racer gets three chances to qualify. As stated in the previous section, the two sanctioning bodies generally use two different methods of moving racers from the qualifying rounds to the Main (although there is some overlap), the Transfer System, the method generally used by the ABA; and the Moto System, the NBL's choice. In the transfer system usually one to three people are transferred to the main depending on the size of the class. For instance, in the ABA transfer system a group of say eight racers sign up for the 17-18 Intermediate class. That is more than enough to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 will have all eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, trophies, a chance to take a step in advancement to a higher amateur level or if they are professionals, prize money. The NBL and the international UCI uses the \\"Olympic\\" or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, the more likely you will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto. In larger races in both the ABA and NBL, then a 2nd moto of the same class but different racers is run right behind the first group. They also race three times but instead of the winners going to the Main they face their first group counterparts (who also went through the three-moto shake out) in the semi finals called the Semi-Main. Then the qualifiers face off in the Main. The same for races large enough for quarterfinals or Quarter-Mains, 1/8s and even 1/16s. The Amateurs, once they get to the mains usually only race once for the top points and the trophy. The Professionals on the other hand run multiple cumulative Mains just like in the qualifying motos for the points, trophy and most important, prize money. This is both NBL and ABA practice. Like during the qualifying motos the points you earn in each running of the Pro Main are tied into the position you finish in each of the three motos. Cumulative scoring rewards consistency. The better the racer you are, the more consistent you will be. The transfer system lets you capitalize on the mistakes of others. The better the racer you are, the fewer the mistakes you make. One major drawback in cumulative scoring is that it is more complicated task in keeping track than in the transfer system. In the 1980s at least two national level scoring scandals (one in 1985) in which the national professional number one was decided after the Grand nationals underlined this. There was also a scoring mix up during the 1983 NBL Grand National in which it was thought Brian Patterson was the winner for two weeks but after a recount initiated after Eric Rupe protested gave Eric Rupe the number one for 1983. An even larger scoring scandal occurred in 1985 in which pro racer Peter Loncarevich apparently beat Greg Hill for the number one pro racer by a mere 3 points. Greg Hill's wife Nancy (who was the bookkeeper for Greg Hill's BMX bicycle company Greg Hill Products) kept an independent accounting of the season points of Mr. Hill's closest competitors and detected an error. At his wife's urging Mr. Hill ask for and received an audit of the points and the NBL confirmed the error had taken place and awarded Mr. Hill the pro title for 1985.BMX Plus! February 1986 Vol.9 No.2 pg.54 The Transfer System on the other hand, was never popular with the racers. While very efficient and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains (on the other hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly in the next two qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto. Among the Pros the Cumulative method is preferred. Not only because they get to race more, it lessens the chance of luck playing as a factor in any given race event. In 1985 Greg Hill staged a personal boycott of ABA nationals in part of his dislike of the transfer system. Cumulative scoring is not only used in the ABA and NBL pro qualifying motos but in the mains, in which the pros are required to race the mains three times to win points and prize money. Cumulative scoring, also known as Olympic scoring, is used by the UCI in their international BMX program and was used in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China for both amateurs and professionals. The ABA continues to use the Transfer System for its amateur classes. Skill level advancement, local points awards and district ranking The first ostensive goal of a BMX racer is to become the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province may be divided up into several Districts depending how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having a sense of accomplishment if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well riders do in the district rankings. How high the rider goes in the rankings depends on what skill level category they are in as well as how well they do in their particular races since it affects how many points they win, which adds to their total for their district ranking. The higher the rider's skill level, the more points they can gather at any given race (providing that they qualify for the Main). In the Amateur class, advancement to a higher skill level depends on rider success in their present skill level. For instance at the ABA local level riders start out as a Novice. From Novice ten local career first places in the Mains will advance them to Intermediate Class. From Intermediate twenty local career first place wins in the Main is required to graduate to the Expert class. From there as in most other sports, it is voluntary to go professional. The Main will determine the winner that day and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and sometimes 4th-8th trophies will be awarded. Riders are also awarded points depending on their respective finish in the race, which are added to their cumulative totals, ultimately determining district rankings at the end of the calendar year. The number of points a racer gets after a race is determined by his place in the Main. On the local level, first place Novice class will get the winner 25 points, 2nd place 20 and so on with 8th getting only 3 points. The more points a racer has the higher his ranking and thus the lower the number he gets to wear on his front number plate the following season. For instance, say in ABA New York District #1 a racer had the 10th most points out of 200 racers in his district at the finish of the 2017 season. He will then be entitled to have the number \\"10\\" on his number plate for that district during the 2018 season. The skill level class you belong to also affects how many points you get. The winners of the Expert Classes on the local level will get 100 points while the winning Intermediates will get 50 points and the winners of the Novice classes only 25 points. Second, third et al. placers would get lower points in proportion. The 7th place Expert finishers will get only 20 points, the equivalent of second place in the Novice class. In all classes and skill levels racers also receive the same number of points depending on how many are in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those who participate will get 8 points, including the last place finisher (who didn't make the main). If the class has 15 racers, all will get 15 points. So the winner of the Intermediate class will get 15 points for the fifteen racers in that class on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points. There are separate point scoring for cruiser and girl classes and separate point tables for state and national rankings. Points for those events are gathered in a similar fashion as on the district, i.e. local, level. National and special event points awards Other important factors affect the point totals. Some local special event races are double or even triple point races, doubling or tripling the points each position in the Mains each racer would normally get. points are awarded, so an Expert winner could look forward to collecting 400 points for winning his class in addition to bonus points and participant points. To compete on a National level for national titles you must compete in Nationals. Nationals have their own separate points tables that are accumulated by the racers similarly to local district points. However the points rewarded are not the same amount. For instance 240 National points are awarded to the first place Expert winner as well as his 300 district triple points, but his national points are not added to his district points or vice versa. Like in local races he or she is also awarded participant points. The amateur with the most National points at the end of the year is the overall National number one (#1) racer and gets to wear a #1 on his number plate at national events the following season. Professionals are not affected since they have their own points system and table separate from the amateurs for the number one pro title. In the NBL there is no overall #1 amateur, only a number one title for their age group, so a racer in say 17 expert that has most points can wear a national #1 plate even if the number one rider in 12 expert actually has more points. Again, the professionals have their own points system for number one pro. There is yet another points table for State/Provincial wide events for the State/Provincial Championship. However, instead of wide gap points between winners and those who follow and between skill levels, they are quite close i.e. for first place in Expert, Intermediate and Novice it is 20, 19, and 18 respectively. Also, it is only a one-point difference between places i.e. 20 points for first and 19 points for second place in Expert. The same for the Novice and Intermediate levels. Also unlike on the National and District level no participant points are awarded. In the NBL, the points received for moto points in the cumulative \\"Olympic\\" system at the national and regional level are similar as on the district level. Nationals can also affect your skill level ranking. On the local level it takes eight career wins to transfer from Novice to Intermediate; from Intermediate to Expert 25 career wins are necessary. On the national level only five career wins are required in both cases. This is because of the much higher quality of competition found on the national level. All of the aforementioned applies with minor variations to the Girls and Cruiser Classes. Open and trophy dash events A fourth class of racing in BMX which are held at local and national events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a points race to sign up for the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these \\"Mixed\\" opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there are Pros in the Open, it is not unusual for an older Expert-17-18 age class for example-to win since many have the talent and speed to be a pro but have not yet taken the opportunity, partly because once you go Pro, you can go back to amateur only under very strict circumstances. There are separate Open divisions for Cruisers where similar rules apply. Sometimes an exhibition race is held after all the meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out every once in a while. Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish line. Professionals There are professional rankings in BMX. In the ABA the two major ones are the \\"A\\" and \\"AA\\" classifications in the 20\\" division. The Professionals are the only class allowed to compete for cash prizes. The first level is pro. To become an \\"A\\" pro you have to hold at least an Expert skill level rating and be at least 16 years old to be issued a Pro Membership card by USA BMX. If you are a professional BMXer with another BMX sanctioning body, you will be recognized as a Pro by USA BMX and barred from competing in ABA sanctioned amateur classes. Once you become a pro BMX racer, you cannot go back to amateur status except under stringent circumstances. What's more by turning BMX Pro you very likely be disqualifying yourself from other amateur sports depending on the state and federal laws that apply. In recent years, A Pros decide when they want to move to up to AA Pro. There used to be a $3,000 winnings cap, however, this was removed in 2015. \\"A\\" pro and \\"AA\\" pros race in separate classes generally, but if there are too few of one or the other type of pro to race separately-four is the minimum-then they race together in a combined class. This occurs generally in at large multi-point local district races but usually not at Nationals. Pro ranking points are similar to the National armateur points awards. \\"A\\" Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. \\"AA\\" Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings. For example, if you participate in 13 national events, your best 10 will be considered and your worst three disregarded. You must meet this qualification on the national level to wear National numbers one though ten on your number plate the following year. The rules are similar for Pro Cruiser and Pro Girls classes. There is a fourth class of pro called Veteran Pro. These are professionals in the 20\\" class that are at least 30 years old and generally past their racing prime but still love to compete. Most of the rules that apply to the \\"A\\" and \\"AA\\" pros apply to the \\"Vet\\" Pros except that they are required to race in only six national events plus the Grand Nationals and are classified as \\"A\\" Pros and get \\"A\\" Pro points, However, they can win unlimited prize money as a Vet pro on this \\"A\\" Pro level without the requirement of moving up to \\"AA\\" pro upon winning US$3000 in a season. Some Vet Pros are retired \\"AA\\" pros that have come back to the sport. In those cases they had to go through a reclassification process with certain criteria having to be met, including written permission from conventional \\"A\\" Pros. \\"Vet\\" Pros cannot compete for the National #1 Championship. Examples of notable BMX racers Many participants in BMX racing have left their mark. Most are pure racers while some promoted and sponsored races; others have created unique maneuvers and invented or helped design equipment as well have raced themselves. They have done it over the near 40-year history of the sport during distinct eras. These are just a few. Pioneering \\"Old School\\"* BMX racers from the US include: *Scot Breithaupt *David Clinton *John George *Bobby Encinas *Tinker Juarez *Perry Kramer *Stu Thomsen *Jeff Bottema *Jeff Kosmala *Jeff Ruminer *Scott Clark *Frank Post *Anthony Sewell *Brent Patterson *Brian Patterson *Harry Leary *Tommy Brackens *Eric Rupe *Pete Loncarevich *Greg Hill *Cheri Elliott *Richie Anderson *Debbie Kalsow *Clint Miller *Donny Atherton *Darrell Young *Andy Patterson *Eddy King *Mike King *Gary Ellis *Deanna Edwards *Tim Judge *Mike Miranda *Lee Medlin *Shawn Texas *Nelson Chanady *Mike Poulson *Toby Henderson *Shelby James *D.D. Leone Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. US \\"Mid school\\" racers and racers whose careers started during the \\"Old School\\" era but were not part of the pioneering 1970's generation include: *Charles Townsend *Terry Tenette *Darwin Griffin *Eric Carter *Billy Griggs *Steve Veltman *John Purse *Kiyomi Waller *Melanie Cline *Kenny May *Danny Nelson *Matt Hadan *Cindy Davis *Alan Foster *Brian Foster *Gary DeBacker *Tara Llanes *Robert MacPherson Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. Notable international Old and \\"Mid School\\"* BMX racers: *Corine Dorland Netherlands *Thomas Allier France *Kelvin Batey Ireland *Bas de Bever Netherlands *Christophe Lévêque France *Dale Holmes UK *Anne-Caroline Chausson France Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. Newer \\"Mid School\\" and \\"New/Current School\\"* racers include: *Jamie Lilly US *Bubba Harris US *Wade Bootes Australia *Kim Hayashi US *Shanaze Reade UK *Randy Stumpfhauser US *Samantha Cools Canada *Willy Kanis Netherlands *Donny Robinson US *Kyle Bennett US *Warwick Stevenson Australia *Robert de Wilde Netherlands *Alice Jung US *Joey Bradford US *Laëtitia Le Corguillé France *Jill Kintner US *Māris Štrombergs Latvia *Mike Day US *Alise Post US Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. *Generally speaking the \\"Old School\\" generation is from 1969, the very beginning of BMX to 1987 or 1988, during the first major slump in the popularity of BMX racing and the height of popularity of Old School Freestyling. \\"Mid School\\" is generally considered to be from 1988 to 1999, which includes the first slump in Freestyle BMX in 1988-89 and the resurgence of BMX racing beginning in 1990 and it really taking off again in 1993. \\"New/Current School\\" or today's BMX is considered to be from 2000 to the present day with the emphasis on Dirt Jumping contest and streetstyle and deemphasis on racing. With the racers, it will not be perfect demarcations. Some Old Schoolers raced well into the Mid School era of the 1990s, like Pete Loncarevich and Greg Hill. There are a few Old Schoolers still racing in the Veteran and Masters classes today, Eric Rupe to name one. Many Mid Schoolers like Warwick Stevenson and Randy Stumpfhauser are racing well into the New/Current School era. A significant number of top New Schoolers started during the \\"Mid school\\" era like Donny Robinson and Bubba Harris, so there is bleed over. As time goes by the year definitions of eras of \\"Mid\\" and \\"New School\\" will change, especially Mid School, but \\"Old School\\" will most likely always refer to the sports first 18–19 years when the pioneers began it, set the rules, promoted it, constructed the precedent setting equipment, set the records and conventions, raced it, and largely retired from it in terms of serious Senior Pro competition. National American sanctioning body number one racers by year=National Bicycle Association (NBA) CDNE=Class did not exist. TDNE=Title did not exist. Note: Dates reflect the year the racers *won* their plates, not the year they actually *raced* their No.1 plates.

In the case of David Clinton in 1974 almost no tracks existed outside of California and none of those were NBA sanctioned. **The NBA did have a separate professional division beginning in 1976, but until 1979 the National No.1 plate was all around for every class pro or amateur. ***The Number One pro title did not exist until 1979. ****NBA Pros were allowed to race in the Amateur class and hold the amateur title at the time, so Greg Hill, while a professional was eligible for and won the no. 1 Amateur title.

The NBL did have a pro class in 1977, 1978 & 1979 but the title of National Number One Professional was not created until the 1980 season when the pros and the 16 Experts were separated and the pros earning separate points (in the form of purse money won) from the amateurs. Prior to 1980 the pros, due to the comparatively small number of them, competed with the 16 Experts and were able to earn amateur titles. ***Title Did Not Exist The title plate for this class did exist under the title of \\"B\\" pro (which was created for the 1981 season), but it was not until 1990 when the name was changed to \\"Superclass\\" and it became a pro/am class were the racers of that class given an opportunity to win a separate year end overall National #1 plate title separate from the pure Pro and the pure amateur classes. Amateurs competed for prizes and Pros could compete for a limited amount purses. Also beginning in the 1990 season \\"Pro Cruiser\\" was renamed \\"Super Cruiser\\" and \\"A\\" Pro \\"All Pro\\". In 1996 Super Cruiser was renamed \\"Pro Cruiser\\" once again and \\"All\\" Pro reverted to \\"Pro Class\\" This was to harmonize NBL nomenclature with UCI/IBMXF labels. Because of this the NBL would change the name of its pro Classes many times during the 1990s, They even began calling there senior pro class \\"AA\\" and the junior pros \\"A\\" just like the ABA beginning in the year 2000. Continuing the name shuffle the senior male pro class was officially known as Elite Men and the junior men \\"A\\" pro until the end of the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 season the junior \\"A\\" pro class was called \\"Super X\\" (SX). The single level pro females are called Elite Women. Beginning with the 2006 season the NBL ceased offering an independent year end title for both the \\"A\\" pro class and the Pro Cruisers. In the case of Pro Cruiser it was an end of a long era with the Pro Cruiser No.1 title going back to 1981 when Brent Patterson first won the class. In 2007 the junior pro class was rechristened \\"Super X\\" and an independent year end number one plate was reestablished. ****Title Discontinued †(AM)=Amateur. From 1981 to 1984 the girl's National No.1 title was amateur. Between 1985 and 1987 a girl's pro class was established but that division was discontinued between 1988 and 1996 due to lack of participants and those National No.1 women titles were again amateurs. From 1997 to the present the title is a professional one once again. ‡(Sup)=Superclass. Superclass was a Pro/Am class.

In the late 1990s, the company's headquarters were in Los Angeles.\\"MIXX'S SAILOR MOON MANGA IS THE NUMBER 1 GRAPHIC NOVEL OR TRADE PAPERBACK IN AMERICA!\\" Mixx Entertainment. June 18, 1999. Retrieved on August 21, 2011. \\"Mixx Entertainment, Inc. 746 W. Adams Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90089-7727\\" While the company was known as Mixx Entertainment, it sold MixxZine, a manga magazine where popular serials like Sailor Moon were published weekly. Mixxzine later became Tokyopop before it was discontinued.[11] Capitalizing on the popularity of Sailor Moon, Mixx also created the magazine, Smile, a magazine that was half girls’ magazine, and half shōjo manga anthology, and also continued the Sailor Moon story after being discontinued in Mixxzine. Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn praised Stu Levy for opening up an untapped market for animation with the publication of Sailor Moon and other. Before Sailor Moon, the belief among entertainment executives was that \\"girls don't watch cartoons.\\" Due to Sailor Moon’s immense popularity, Tokyopop discontinued the serial from its magazines, and released it separately as its first manga graphic novel. They engineered prominent book distribution via retail stores, standardized book trim size, created a basic industry-wide rating system, and developed the first-ever retail manga displays and introduced the world of graphic novels to an audience of teenage girls. Also, together with Diamond, Tokyopop offered retailers free spinner rack displays for Tokyopop manga, thereby increasing the visibility of the medium in bookstores. Tokyopop also licensed and distributed Japanese anime. In 1996, Mixx Entertainment acquired the rights to the anime biopic of Japanese poet Kenji Miyazawa, and Stu Levy produced and directed the English version of the anime film, entitled “Spring and Chaos.” The film was directed and scripted by Shoji Kawamori, who created Super Dimensional Fortress Macross and The Vision of Escaflowne. Taste of Cinema ranked “Spring and Chaos” thirteenth in its list of Top “25 Weird Animated Movies That Are Worth Your Time.” From 2000 to 2004, Tokyopop released multiple film and television projects such as Street Fury, which Stu Levy created, GTO (English version for Showtime TV), Rave Master (English version for Cartoon Network's Toonami), and Reign: The Conqueror (English version for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.) Tokyopop also released English version DVDs for: Initial D, Marmalade Boy, Saint Tail, Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School, Vampire Princess Miyu, Brigadoon, FMW, High School Ghostbusters.  \\"100% Authentic Manga\\"  In 2002, Tokyopop launched its line of \\"100% Authentic Manga\\", which was printed in the original Japanese right-to-left format and included the original Japanese printed sound effects. In Japan, all published manga is written to read from right to left, but when an English translation was published in the U.S., however, the common practice was to use computer-reversed or mirror images that allowed the books to read from left to right. As a result, this distorted the artwork. Tokyopop's decision to use the original left to right format allowed the artwork to keep its original form and also enabled Tokyopop to release most graphic novel series on a frequency three-to-six times faster than the then current industry standard. Tokyopop volumes hit the shelves monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly versus the six months or longer typical of competitors. It also allowed Tokyopop to sell books for an industry-leading price point of $9.99 per book, at a time when most competitors charged $12.99 to $16.99 per book. Tokyopop was the first U.S. publisher to adopt such a sweeping policy. While some Japanese manga artists had required that the English versions of their manga be published from right to left, Tokyopop was the first American publisher to unilaterally announce that it would maintain the original format for all of its future manga titles. An \\"authentic manga\\" how-to guide was included in each graphic novel to keep readers from accidentally reading the final page first, and the authentic manga also featured special packaging.  Rising Stars of Manga  Tokyopop launched their Global Manga publishing program in 2003 via the introduction of its \\"Rising Stars of Manga\\" talent competition. The competition called for American manga artists to submit 15-25 page English-language stories of any genre. The top 10 entries, as judged by Tokyopop editors, received cash prizes (between $500 - $2500) and were published in an anthology of the winning works. The grand prize winners were also given the chance to pitch full-length manga projects to Tokyopop for a chance to become professional manga-ka. Tokyopop launched its first \\"Rising Stars of Manga\\" contest on August 15, 2002 and ended it on December 16, 2002, with more than five hundred American artists submitting their 15–25 page, English-language stories. The 5th Rising Stars of Manga competition added the People's Choice award, where the top-20 finalists had their entire entries judged by the fans on the Tokyopop website. “We are really pleased to open up the Rising Stars judging to the fans,\\" commented Tokyopop editor Rob Valois. \\"Since so many people have been vocal on the message boards and at industry conventions, we’re offering them all a chance to shape the future of manga. I’m personally excited to see how the fans’ favorite will compare to our own.\\" Tokyopop held eight Rising Stars of Manga competitions between 2002 and 2008, as well as one in the UK in 2005. Several Rising Stars of Manga winners went on to publish full-length graphic novels with Tokyopop, including Josh Elder with Mail Order Ninja, M. Alice LeGrow with Bizenghast, Mike Schwark and Ron Kaulfersch with Van Von Hunter, Lindsay Cibos and Jared Hodges with Peach Fuzz, Wes Abbot with Dogby Walks Alone, Felipe Smith with MBQ, Nathan Maurer with Atomic King Daidogan,.  Rise of Tokyopop  Tokyopop became one of the biggest manga publishers outside Japan, and as such, was attributed with popularizing manga in the United States. By 2004, it boasted the largest market share of manga sales in the U.S., reaching as high as 50% of manga exports to the United States, according to Nissei Weekly. Tokyopop was also instrumental in the introduction of manhwa to western audiences. Brad Brooks and Tim Pilcher, authors of The Essential Guide to World Comics. London, said that Tokyopop \\"published many Korean artists' work, possibly without Western fans even realizing the strips don't come from Japan. Series like King of Hell by Kim Jae-hwan and Ra In-soo, and the Gothic vampire tale Model by Lee So-young are both Korean, but could easily be mistaken for manga.\\" In 2005, Tokyopop began a new, free publication called Manga (originally Takuhai) to feature their latest releases. In March 2006, Tokyopop and HarperCollins Publishers announced a co-publishing agreement in which the sale and distribution rights of some Tokyopop manga and books, under this co-publishing license, would be transferred to HarperCollins in mid-June 2006. The agreement enabled Tokyopop to produce original English- language (OEL) manga adaptations of HarperCollins' books. Meg Cabot's books were the first to be adapted into the manga format, along with the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. The first line of Tokyopop-HarperCollins OEL manga was released in 2007 with the goal of publishing up to 24 titles each year. Tokyopop has released several series based on American games, films, and characters, such as Warcraft, the Kingdom Hearts video game series, and Jim Henson films. They released the first volume of a series based on the Hellgate: London video game in April 2008. Tokyopop also helped to pioneer the Cine-Manga format, a blend of cinematic properties and sequential art that uses imagery from movies and television series. Levy secured licenses to publish Cine-Manga with major entertainment brands including Disney, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks, Paramount, Universal, and the NBA. 2008 restructuring In June 2008, Tokyopop announced that it was being restructured, with its name being changed to Tokyopop Group, a holding group for several new subsidiaries. The Tokyopop operations in the United States were split into two subsidiaries: Tokyopop, Inc., and Tokyopop Media. Tokyopop, Inc. consisted of the company's existing publications business, while Tokyopop Media focused on the company's digital and comics-to-film works. Tokyopop Media managed the Tokyopop website, which continued to promote its publications. According to representative Mike Kiley, the divisions would allow the company to \\"set things up in ways that would very clearly and definitively allow those businesses to focus on what they need to do to succeed. The goals in each company are different and the achievement of those goals is more realistic, more possible if everyone working in each of those companies is very clearly focused.\\" During the restructure, Tokyopop laid off 39 positions, equating to 35%–40% of its American workforce. Most of the positions cut were those involved in the direct publication of its books which resulted in a scale back of publication output from Tokyopop, Inc. Tokyopop reported that it would be cutting the volumes released per year by approximately 50%, to an average of 20–22 volumes per month. Tokyopop's Japan division was also to be split, with one unit operating under Tokyopop Media and the other becoming a subsidiary under the overall Tokyopop Group. In response to Tokyopop's restructuring, declining sales, and losing 20% of its manga market share, Tokyopop UK cut its publication release schedule from approximately 25 volumes a month to 20. In December 2008, citing \\"dramatically low sales\\" in the publishing industry as a whole, Tokyopop, Inc., laid off eight more employees, including three editors, and noted that the company would have to rearrange some of its upcoming publication schedules. Loss of Kodansha licenses Licenses from the Japanese manga publisher Kodansha, historically, were a large part of Tokyopop's catalog. In the years leading up to 2009, the number of Kodansha titles licensed by Tokyopop decreased. The final new Kodansha title was Tokko by Tohru Fujisawa, and the final batch of volumes of Kodansha titles appeared around March 2009. Around that time Kodansha began to consistently give licenses to its manga to competitor Del Rey Manga. Deb Aoki of About.com said \\"Well, more or less. You get the idea. If you're the type who reads the tea leaves of the manga publishing biz, you kinda sensed that things weren't quite the same as they used to be.\\" On August 31, 2009, Tokyopop announced Kodansha was allowing all of its licensing agreements with the North American and German divisions of Tokyopop to expire for reasons unknown. Due to this loss in licensing, Tokyopop was forced to leave several Kodansha series unfinished, including the popular Rave Master, Initial D, GetBackers, and Life series. It would be unable to reprint any previously published volumes, rendering all Kodansha-owned Tokyopop releases out-of-print. Several other titles licensed and published by Tokyopop, including best sellers Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Clover, and Magic Knight Rayearth, were reacquired by Dark Horse Comics, though two other titles Kodansha licensed to Dark Horse had since transferred to Random House by then. Samurai Deeper Kyo was relicensed by competitor Del Rey Manga, a division of Random House, which published the remaining volumes of the series. Tokyopop said that it expected the loss of the licenses to have minimal impact on the company economically due to its diversification of their holdings over the last few years, though they acknowledged the loss would hurt fans of the ongoing series who face uncertainty about the completion of those titles from other companies. ICv2 reported that Tokyopop would continue to publish light novels from Kodansha and that Kodansha appeared to be planning to publish its own titles through its partnership with Random House. Resignations and layoffs In February 2011, the president and chief operating officer, John Parker, resigned from the company and took the position of vice president of business development for Diamond. This came shortly after Diamond became Tokyopop's new distributor, taking the business from Harper Collins. Tokyopop did not name a replacement for Parker. Parker's departure left only three remaining executives: the founder and CEO, Stuart Levy; Publisher, Mike Kiley; and Vice President of Inventory, Victor Chin. On March 1, Tokyopop continued to layoff workers, removing many high-profile employees such as long-time manga editors Lilian Diaz-Przyhyl and Troy Lewter. Tokyopop's management also eliminated the position of director of sales operations. In an interview with ICv2, Stuart Levy revealed that the layoffs were due to Borders Group, Tokyopop's largest customer, filing bankruptcy in March 2011, no longer carrying Tokyopop stock, and not paying debts that the company owed to Tokyopop. North American publishing shutdown On April 15, 2011, Tokyopop announced that it would close its Los Angeles, CA-based North American publishing operations on May 31, 2011. According to the release, Tokyopop's film and television projects, as well as European publishing operations and global rights sales, would not be closing. The UK branch would cease to operate after May 31 due to their reliance on the importing of the North American branch's product. Stuart Levy, Tokyopop's founder, released a personal statement reaffirming Tokyopop's role in introducing manga to the mainstream North American audience and thanking fans, creators, and employees for their dedication. On May 24, Tokyopop stated that the manga they licensed would revert to their original owners, who may license the titles to other companies. New incarnation In October 2011, Tokyopop's official Twitter account released a message stating that its \\"ultimate goal is to start publishing manga again.\\" On December 10, 2012, Tokyopop's website relaunched with a letter from management stating that the company was down to a few select employees who were starting a 'new incarnation' of the company. Partnered with 'Right Stuf on Demand', they began offering ebooks of various titles for which they retained the rights. Their company blog article stated: > Luckily new technologies that have only very recently become practical are > enabling us to re-emerge. Conventional publishing has irrevocably changed, > and it is impractical for all but the largest and most established companies > to pursue publishing as it has gone on for centuries. But by embracing ebook > and print-on-demand technologies, we believe we can move forward and > continue to produce some amazing manga as well as bring you Asian Pop > Culture in many forms. A letter from Levy on January 6, 2013 stated: > Digital technology has transformed many industries including publishing. > This hit TOKYOPOP very hard since we didn't have ebook rights to most of our > series (except OEL). Unfortunately our Japanese licensors did not move fast > enough to provide a legitimate alternative to piracy, and piracy shows no > mercy. As a result, TOKYOPOP had to shut down its LA office and the licenses > to Japanese titles expired, reverting to the Japanese licensors. What that > means is TOKYOPOP is evolving as a company. I know many fans would prefer us > to return to being a manga publisher like we were for most of our history. > However, manga will never disappear – we will do what we can to deliver > manga. I plan on experimenting with new ways to bring you Asian pop culture. > Please keep an open mind – and give feedback (not just negative when you > don't like something but also positive when you like something) so we can > tweak our approach. Throughout the publishing closure, Tokyopop Media remained open for business, continuing its efforts to produce film and TV adaptations of Tokyopop's manga, as well as reinvigorating the Tokyopop YouTube channel, launching several original web series and adding trailers for Japanese film and TV. In 2013, Tokyopop partnered with MondoMedia to release an animated short film based on the Tokyopop manga Riding Shotgun,Riding Shotgun which was directed by Michael Davis and starred the voices of Yuri Lowenthal and Jessy Schram. The short film garnered over a million views in its first month, and led to an IndieGoGo campaign to finance a full animated series. In 2015, at Anime Expo and San Diego Comic-Con, Tokyopop announced that it would be relaunching its publishing operations in North America in 2016 and hinted that its first major licensor would be Disney. In January 2018, Tokyopop announced the release dates for three new properties: Konohana Kitan, Futaribeya: A Room for Two, and Hanger. Additionally, TOKYOPOP initiated \\"International Woman of Manga\\" to showcase female manga writers with the publication of five titles: Ocean of Secrets, Goldfisch, Kamo, Undead Messiah, and Sword Princess Amaltea. Tokyopop's \\"Nightmare Before Christmas: Zero's Journey\\" was nominated for two 2018 Diamond GEM awards in the categories \\"2018 Best All Ages Series\\" and \\"2018 Licensed TP or HC of the Year\\". Foreign markets=Tokyopop Germany In the summer of 2004, Tokyopop founded its first foreign branch in Germany, incorporated as Tokyopop GmbH and headquartered in Hamburg. The first manga and manhwa by Tokyopop Germany were published in November 2004, and the first anime in the fall of 2005. In 2006, Tokyopop GmbH entered a \\"strategic partnership\\" with the Japanese publisher Shueisha, allowing them to publish popular titles such as Death Note and Bleach. The company has also released a number of original German-language manga, including Gothic Sports, winner of a 2007 Sondermann award. Tokyopop GmbH continues to operate as a publisher of German-language manga for the international market after the closure of the US publishing office. In addition to publishing popular manga titles, Tokyopop GmbH also expanded the market by producing new and exciting cross-media content, including licensing popular video game franchises such as Assassin’s Creed and Zelda and bestselling novels such as James Patterson and Warrior Cats. In 2013, the company launched a prestige project called Manga Library, which adapted classic literary novels into manga. According to GFK Entertainment, as of 2014 in the core segment of manga, Tokyopop GmbH is currently the second largest provider, with a market share of 27%. Additionally, in the last two years, Tokyopop GmbH had the fastest growth rate out of the big three manga suppliers in the German market, with a growth rate of 29% in 2014. This compares with Egmont Ehapa at 6.5% and Carlsen Verlag at 1.8%. Other overseas markets In 2004, Tokyopop set up a division in the United Kingdom based in London that mainly imported books from its original American counterpart and distributed them to bookstores in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Tokyopop released an anime collection in both countries in late 2006, including titles such as Initial D and Great Teacher Onizuka. Vampire Princess Miyu was released on DVD by MVM Entertainment and the Toonami television channel aired the first half of Rave Master in early 2005. It was announced on the official Tokyopop Facebook page that because the British division mainly imported the North American branch's translated titles, it would become defunct with the only open branch being the German division. Tokyopop distributed some of its titles to Australia and New Zealand via Madman Entertainment/Funtastic and in Greece, Tokyopop properties were licensed by Anubis Comics. Tokyopop partnered with IDW International in February 2018 to license its original intellectual property (IP) and manga in overseas markets. Imprints Logo for Blu Manga. Blu Manga Blu Manga is an imprint under which Tokyopop published shōnen-ai and yaoi manga titles. The imprint was launched in 2005. Initially, the company denied that it owned Blu, stating that it was only distributing for another company. The company released no editor names, nor company contact info out of fear there would be backlash and hate mail from \\"moral crusaders\\". In 2006, Tokyopop confirmed Blu was their own imprint. Blu Manga considered that their \\"non-girly\\" branding had enabled the imprint, in a genre stereotypically created by women for women, to reach out to a male and gay audience. Early titles published by BLU were Earthian, Love Mode, and Shinobu Kokoro. Criticism Fans critical of possible mishandling of the Initial D property voiced concerns regarding \\"editorial changes\\" in the language localization of the manga and anime. The changes included renaming of several characters and the removal of one character's involvement in enjo kōsai, a practice in Japan where younger women are paid to provide older men with companionship. In a letter sent to Anime News Network, Tokyopop responded to the criticisms, noting that they felt the edits were necessary because they were marketing the series to a younger target audience than it was originally designed for in Japan. In an interview by Anime News Network, Tokyopop staff stated they also felt that the series would reach a larger audience if it had a broader American appeal. The company alleviated some of the concerns by noting that the anime series would receive an \\"unedited, subtitled, Japanese language\\" DVD release. The manga series remained edited except for the first volume, which was accidentally printed before the editing decisions were made.

The station is located at the corner of Balham Hill (A24) and Nightingale Lane, at the southern edge of Clapham Common. It is in both Travelcard Zone 2 and Travelcard Zone 3. History The station was designed by Charles Holden and was opened on 13 September 1926 as the first station of the Morden extension of the City and South London Railway, which is now part of the Northern line. Other proposed names for the station prior to opening were \\"Balham North\\" and \\"Nightingale Lane\\".

It has a foot in the South Downs National Park and is located at the midpoint of a long-established route between Winchester and Portsmouth. It is home to the ruins of Bishop's Waltham Palace, a Scheduled Ancient Monument under English Heritage management, and a well- preserved high street with many listed buildings which now house independent shops. Bishop's Waltham's long history includes a roll call of Medieval and Tudor kings and queens who visited the town to stay at the palace. The name of the town is Saxon, being derived from the two words: \\"wald\\" (forest) and \\"ham\\" (settlement). Modern day Bishop's Waltham has a population of over 6,723UK Census Data for Bishop's Waltham, UK Census Data 2011 and is the largest settlement in the Winchester district outside the city itself. It is home to an infant and junior school. History The town's name comprises three parts 'walt' – forest; 'ham' – settlement'; and 'Bishop's'. It started off as a very early Anglo-Saxon settlement between 450-550 AD, and steadily grew to become one of Hampshire's largest villages, despite being burnt to the ground by Danes in 1001 AD. By the time of the Domesday book (1086 AD), it had a population of around 600 living in 115 households - at the time, the 11th largest settlement in Hampshire. In 904, King Edward the Elder (King Alfred's son) exchanged it with Denewulf, Bishop of Winchester, for the Bishop's estate at Portchester. In 1136 Henry de Blois, a later bishop, built a new church and in 1158 started the now-ruined Bishop's Waltham Palace. It was destroyed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War. Much of the old Palace is still in the town. Apart from the ruins, which are open to the public, material from the Palace was used as building materials in town buildings still standing to this day. William of Wykeham died in the town, while after the Battle of Trafalgar, some 200 French officers including Admiral Villeneuve were imprisoned there. There are many Georgian buildings in the town alongside the Norman parish church. The town retains a unique character, with a number of small local businesses (such as a butchers, bakery and fishmonger) including an off-licence which was established in 1617 (Bakers Wine Merchants). The famous High Street in the town is also home to a number of chain stores (such as Co-op) and a small supermarket chain (Budgens), however, the owners of these and other stores have fought to prevent larger chains from threatening their businesses and, they argue, the character of the town.Bishops Waltham Sainsbury's opponents will 'fight on', BBC News, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, 8 April 2011Bishop's Waltham Sainsbury's supermarket plan scrapped, BBC News, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, 10 June 2015 Unusually for the United Kingdom, there is a vineyard nearby. During the 19th century, Bishop's Waltham was a successful market town, being home to several agricultural suppliers, merchants and a cattle market. The town also had a large brickworks to its north, along with a gasworks that provided town gas for lighting and heating the town. The town had a large enough working population by the late 19th century to support a Working Men's Institute, which occupied an ornate brick building on Bank Street, which remained open until 2003, when it was converted into housing. Bishop's Waltham was home to Gunner and Company, which was the last provincial private bank in the United Kingdom. The brickworks was a major employer in Bishop's Waltham. The works began as the Bishop's Waltham Clay Company, founded by Arthur Helps in 1862. The works, sited west of the town centre across the former palace's fishponds, was on a highly geologically suitable site: both the major clay types of the Hampshire Basin – the London Clay and Reading Formation beds – were present at different but easily accessible levels. The company started making clay bricks and tiles, and in 1864 began making terracotta architectural and homeware products to try and compete with the established Staffordshire potteries. Helps invested the works' minimal profits and much of his own fortune in building new housing for workers (creating the district of Newtown south of the brickworks in the process) and the unsuccessful attempt to build the Bishops Waltham Railway (see below). Economic recession finally caused the collapse of the business in 1867. The defunct works was acquired by the Blanchard family of London, already owners of a terracotta works in Lambeth, and restarted operations in 1871. In 1880 the Bishop's Waltham Clay Company was merged with Blanchard & Co., which made Bishop's Waltham the centre of its new operation and invested heavily in the works. Blanchard terracotta made at Bishop's Waltham became world-famous for its even bright red colour and rare combination of hard, smooth external texture and great strength. Buildings using Blanchard terracotta include Buckingham Palace and the Natural History Museum, London, plus buildings as far away as Peru and Egypt. Blanchard continued to produce various types of brick and tile at Bishops Waltham as well, which were used extensively on railway construction and other civil engineering projects in the county. Both the Hockley Railway Viaduct and Privett railway tunnel on the Meon Valley Railway - each the longest of their type in Hampshire - used Blanchard bricks. Much of the Victorian housing stock in Newton, Waltham Chase, Swanmore and as far afield as Southampton and Portsmouth is made from bricks fired at Bishop's Waltham. In 1918 the Blanchard brothers, lacking heirs to pass the business to, sold the works to the prominent Southampton-based builders' merchants Elliott Brothers. They continued to run the business throughout the inter-war period but the relatively small scale of the Bishop's Waltham works, the lack of room for expansion and the dwindling amount of viable clay deposits on the site caused a decline in fortunes. There was also competition from larger brickworks in the Midlands owned by the London Brick Company, making more bricks each day than the Blanchards works made in a year (1.5 million bricks and 650,000 tiles in 1956) meant that the operation became increasingly unviable. The site received major bomb damage during the Second World War and Elliotts closed the Bishop Waltham works (still widely known as 'Blanchards') in 1957. The site is now the Claylands industrial estate and business park - there is still an Elliotts builders' merchant branch on the former brickworks site. Bus Services There is one main bus stop in Bishop's Waltham - The Square. This stop has an average of three services an hour in each direction. Bishop's Waltham has two bus companies that operate from Bishop's Waltham square: Stagecoach South and Xelabus. Weekday Services: On weekdays Stagecoach operates the 69 services hourly in each direction to Fareham & Winchester. Xelabus operates the X9 service hourly to Eastleigh as well as the hourly X10 service to Southampton. Xelabus also operates the X17 bus service twice on a Wednesday only. Saturday Services: Stagecoach has the same bus service pattern as above for Saturday. Xelabus operates all its services every two hours on a Saturday. Sunday and Bank Holiday Services: Stagecoach runs the 69 service on Sundays and Bank Holidays which departs from Winchester via Twyford, Colden Common, Marwell Zoo and then to Bishop's Waltham Square and return. Special School Services: Stagecoach operates the 691 and the 692 bus services from Knowle, Hampshire and Lowford to Peter Symonds College. Xelabus operates the 191 bus service to Itchen College (this also serves Eastleigh College). There is also the X9A which runs from Colden Common to Swanmore College. These bus services only operate once a day in each direction. Closed Railway Line Bishop's Waltham's commercial status warranted the construction of the Bishops Waltham branch line railway to the town from Botley in 1862. The railway became part of the London and South Western Railway in the 1870s, who operated distinctive steam railcars on the line for passenger services, although the majority of traffic was goods – with bricks leaving the town and coal for the gasworks coming in. The LSWR laid on special services to allow farmers to bring their cattle to market at Bishop's Waltham, with trains made up of a mix of cattle trucks and passenger carriages. The line was closed to regular passenger traffic in 1932, but goods services remained, becoming ever less frequent and regular before finally stopping in the 1960s. Bishop's Waltham station was a distinctive brick/half-timbered design with numerous architectural details produced in terracotta by the local brickworks, which stood where the main roundabout in the town – now known as the Old Station Roundabout – at the junction of the B2177 and the B3035 towards Corhampton now is. A short section of the line and a pair of level crossing gates next to the roundabout have been preserved. St Peter's Church Bishop's Waltham Culture and attractions Bishop's Waltham is twinned with Saint-Bonnet-le-Château in France. The Palace grounds are frequently used to hold festivals and other events. The town has a small museum. The Bishop's Waltham Youth Theatre is run by local theatre directors associated with the Theatre Royal, Winchester. The Moors The Moors, Bishop's Waltham is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is a nationally (if not a European) significant tract of alkaline wetland and open waters located south of the Chalk outcrop in southern Hampshire at the head of River Hamble displaying a good diversity of habitat types, plant and animal communities and rare species. As a result, not only is the majority of the site designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) under the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act, but also as a Nature Conservation Review (NCR) site, in recognition of its special national interest. The land comprises some mainly of hydrologically sensitive fen, fen meadow and wet woodland dissected by a series of south and west flowing streams and drains totalling some in length. Some of the drains originate from one-time watercress beds fed by clear chalk water springs and feed into either the Western Stream arising off the 'Sand Boils' or the Eastern Stream arising off Alexanders Moors. Both streams flow into Waltham Mill Pond and from where the water passes to The Moors Stream, a headwater of the River Hamble. The 'Sand Boils' is an area at the head of the West Stream in which upwelling spring water creates swirling sandy patches in the gravelly streambed. The Moors comprises the wetland area fed by springs and surface watercourses within the SSSI and adjacent land and which discharge into the Waltham Mill Pond. Water from the mill pond passes through Chase Mill and then downstream as The Moors Stream tributary to join the Northbrook Stream tributary of the River Hamble. River Hamble The country town and parish of Bishop's Waltham lies in the Hamble Valley at the junction of chalk downs and coastal plains which gives rise to the tributary of the River Hamble at Northbrook on the northern edge of the town. The river then flows south, through the North and South Ponds, and then out towards Botley, where the Moors Stream tributary joins the Northbrook Stream tributary on the southern edge of Bishop's Waltham. The river then flows through Curdridge to the head of the tidal estuary at Fairthorne. Education Bishop's Waltham Junior School was established in 1969. Following the July 2010 Ofsted inspection, the school was rated as Grade 1 'Outstanding', Under the most recent Ofsted Inspection in 2017, the school was rated as Grade 2 'Good'. It is a two form entry school for children aged 7–11 years old. Its feeder school is Bishops Waltham Infant School. Its pupils are in the catchment for Swanmore College senior school. Bishop's Waltham Infant School was rated as Grade 1 'Outstanding' by Ofsted in 2011. It is a two form entry infant school for children who are 4–7 years old. Sport and leisure There is a large youth development club called Bishop's Waltham Dynamos who use the facilities at Priory Park. The Dynamos were founded in 1975 and are now one of the largest junior and youth football clubs in Hampshire, with the largest membership of any society and club within the town of Bishop's Waltham and its confines. Bishop's Waltham Cricket ClubBishop's Waltham CC official site runs three sides in the Hampshire Cricket LeagueHampshire Cricket League official site in addition to junior teams and non-league teams that play friendly matches. The ground is beyond the allotments at the end of Albany Road. Bishop's Waltham has two tennis courts at Hoe Road Recreation Ground. Children's Coaching is available on Sunday mornings.Wickham Tennis Club The Battle of Bunker's Hill The Priory, a large red-brick house at Newtown, Bishop's Waltham, was built in the 1860s for an infirmary, the land being given by Sir Arthur Helps, a benefactor to the neighbourhood. Prince Leopold laid the foundation stone in 1864, and Sir Frederick Perkins presented a statue of the Prince Consort. But owing to the circumstances in which Sir Arthur Helps died, the building was claimed by his creditors and sold as a private house. Sir Frederick Perkins was sent to take back the statue, but the villagers objected strongly, and a fray was fought which came to be called 'The Battle of Bunker's Hill' – The statue is now in Southampton. The Waltham Blacks The Waltham Blacks were a group of deer poachers operating and terrorising local people, and were famous, not only for deer stealing, but also for having an Act of Parliament the Black Act 1723 passed to stop them. The Act, passed in 1723, made it a felony to \\"appear armed, disguised or with a blackened face, being so designed to kill deer, rob a warren or to steal fish\\". Gunner and Company Gunner and Company was an English private bank, based in Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire. Founded in 1809, it served as the primary provincial bank for Bishop's Waltham and the Meon Valley throughout much of the nineteenth century.

There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area. Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI was granted a Royal Charter in 1860. It is a charity in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations, and most of the members of its lifeboat crews are unpaid volunteers. The RNLI, whose main base is in Poole, Dorset, has 238 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats. Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies (65%) and voluntary donations (28%), with the remainder from merchandising and investment. RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches. The lifeguards are paid by local authorities, while the RNLI provides equipment and training. The Institution also operates Flood Rescue Teams (FRT) nationally and internationally (iFRT), the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice. Considerable effort is put into training and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, at a cost of more than 600 lives lost in service. History Memorial in Douglas, Isle of Man, to one of RNLI's earliest rescues: rescuing the sailors from the St George in 1830. Sir William Hillary moved to the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William. 1974 postage stamp marking the RNLI's 150th anniversary (rescue of Daunt Lightship's crew by Ballycotton lifeboat . Artist: B. F. Gribble) In its first year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in financial difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service. It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year. Wartime During the First World War, lifeboat crews launched 1,808 times, rescuing 5,332 people. With many younger men on active service, the average age of a lifeboatman was over 50. Many launches were to ships that had been torpedoed or struck mines, including naval or merchant vessels on war duty; a notable example was the hospital ship which foundered in 1914 and was attended by six lifeboats, saving 144 lives over a 50-hour rescue mission. The Second World War placed considerable extra demands on the RNLI, particularly in south and east England where the threat of invasion and enemy activity was ever-present, rescuing downed aircrew a frequent occurrence, and the constant danger of mines. During the war, 6,376 lives were saved. =Dunkirk evacuation= Nineteen RNLI lifeboats sailed to Dunkirk between 27 May and 4 June 1940 to assist with the Dunkirk evacuation. Lifeboats from , (RNLB Prudential (ON 697), now Trimilia), and , (), went directly to France with their own crews, Ramsgate's crew collecting 2,800 troops. Both Coxswains, Edward Parker from Margate and Howard Primrose Knight from Ramsgate, were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their \\"gallantry and determination when ferrying troops from the beaches\\". Margate's Coxswain named as Edward Drake Palmer. Of the other lifeboats and crews summoned to Dover by the Admiralty, the first arrivals questioned – reasonably in their view – the details of the service, in particular the impracticality of running heavy lifeboats on to the beach, loading them with soldiers, then floating them off. The dispute resulted in the first three crews being sent home. Subsequent lifeboats arriving were commandeered without discussion, much to the disappointment of many lifeboatmen. A later RNLI investigation resulted in the dismissal of two Hythe crew members, who were nevertheless vindicated in one aspect of their criticism, as Hythe's Viscountess Wakefield was run on to the beach and unable to be refloated; she was the only lifeboat to be lost in the operation. Some RNLI crew members stayed in Dover for the emergency to provide repair and refuelling facilities, and after the end of the evacuation most lifeboats returned to their stations with varying levels of damage and continued their lifesaving services. Rescues, losses and honours=Rescues and lives saved The RNLI's lifeboat crews and lifeguards have saved more than 140,000 lives since 1824. The RNLI makes a distinction between people aided and lives saved. There were 8,462 lifeboat launches in 2014, rescuing 8,727 people, including saving 460 lives. Lifeguards helped or rescued 19,353 people. Flood rescuers deployed seven times. In 2015 crews rescued on average 22 people a day. The biggest rescue in the RNLI's history was on 17 March 1907, when the 12,000 tonne liner SS Suevic hit the Maenheere Reef near Lizard Point in Cornwall. In a strong gale and dense fog, RNLI lifeboat volunteers rescued 456 passengers, including 70 babies. Crews from , , and rowed out repeatedly for 16 hours to rescue all of the people on board. Six silver RNLI medals were later awarded, two to Suevic crew members. Losses More than 600 people have lost their lives in the RNLI's service; their names are inscribed on the RNLI Memorial sculpture at RNLI HQ, Poole. Honours Bust of Henry Blogg of More than 2,500 medals have been awarded for bravery: Gold (150), Silver (1,564) and Bronze (793). Bronze medals were awarded from 1917. The obverse of the gold medal carries the motto: \\"Let not the deep swallow me up\\", from Psalm 69. The Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum or a framed Letter of Appreciation may be given for other notable acts, such as those awarded to crews of Aberystwyth Lifeboat Station. The Ralph Glister Award is a monetary award made for the most meritorious service in each year and was inaugurated in 1968. The Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award is given annually for the most outstanding service by an Atlantic 21 (and successors) lifeboat crew. Established in 1986 as the Walter Groombridge Award in memory of Brighton Lifeboat Station's Administration Officer it was renamed in memory of his wife who died in 1989. The most decorated lifeboatman was Henry Blogg, coxswain of for 37 years, with three gold medals and four silver. He also received the George Cross and the British Empire Medal and is known as \\"The Greatest of all Lifeboatmen\\". The youngest recipient was Frederick Carter (11) who with Frank Perry (16) was awarded a Silver Medal for a rescue at Weymouth in 1890. Other notable lifeboatmen include Henry Freeman of Whitby, coxswain for 22 years, Robert William Hook (1828–1911), coxswain at Lowestoft from 1853 to 1883 and credited with saving over 600 lives plus two dogs and a cat,'Heroic lifeboat beards of past and present', RNLI Magazine - 2 August 2015 Henry \\"Shrimp\\" Davies, coxswain of the Cromer Lifeboat with 45 years service and James Haylett, coxswain of Caister- on-Sea. One lifeboat has received an award: for the Daunt lightship rescue in 1936, the RNLB Mary Stanford and her entire crew were decorated (see illustration in history section, above). Heritage The RNLI maintains or encourages a number of entities in respect of the history and activity of the Institution along with preserved lifeboats, including: *Historic Lifeboat Collection in Chatham Historic Dockyard with 17 historic vessels. *The Grace Darling Museum opened in 1938 at Bamburgh, commemorating her rescue of the SS Forfarshire. The museum is run by the RNLI. *The Henry Blogg Museum illustrates the history of Cromer's lifeboats, and tells the story of Henry Blogg's most famous rescues. *The Lifeboat Enthusiasts' Society (a branch of the RNLI) *The (independent) Historic Lifeboat Owners Association, promoting the study and preservation of lifeboats. *The RNLI Heritage Trust's collection of historic items at its HQ in Poole, including fine art, model lifeboats, and an archive of historic documents and photographs. *The National Memorial Arboretum has a memorial dedicated to those who have served in the RNLI. *In 2017 Mikron Theatre Company toured a commissioned play In At The Deep End about the RNLI. Operations Throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, ships in distress, or the public reporting an accident, contact the emergency services by telephone or radio. Calls are redirected to HM Coastguard or the Irish Coast Guard as appropriate, who will coordinate air-sea rescue operations and may call on the RNLI (or independent lifeboats), or their own land-based rescue personnel and rescue helicopters to help. Lifeboat stations Lifeboat station and slipway at Douglas, Isle of Man There are 238 RNLI lifeboat stations around the coasts of the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Tower Lifeboat Station on the River Thames in London is the RNLI's busiest, in 2013 rescuing 372 people and saving 25 lives. In 2015 Tower's launches had increased to 465. Five new lifeboat station buildings were completed in 2013. For public access the RNLI classifies stations as one of three types: Explore, which are normally open all year round and have a shop, Discover, normally open during the summer months and Observe which, because of their location, still welcome visitors but may not be easily accessible. From time to time the RNLI may close a station; some of these are later reopened by independent services. The history of some former lifeboat stations can be found in Wikipedia articles on the places where those stations were. (See also: List of Lifeboat Disasters in the British Isles for further information on closed stations.) Rescue craft lifeboat showing Y-boat ILB The RNLI operates 444 lifeboats (332 on station, 112 in the relief fleet). The ship prefix for all RNLI lifeboats from the D-class (IB1) to the Tamar-class is RNLB (Royal National Lifeboat). *All-weather lifeboats (ALBs) are large boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and can go out in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim is to provide a 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3 million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built. *Inshore lifeboats (ILBs) are smaller boats that operate closer to the shore and in shallower waters than ALBs. There are two classes, inflatables and RIBs capable of 25–40 knots. The RNLI's Inshore Lifeboat Centre at Cowes, Isle of Wight, has been building lifeboats since the 1960s and by 2015 had produced over 1,600. *Hovercraft were introduced in 2002, allowing rescue on mud flats and in river estuaries inaccessible to conventional boats. Personnel and equipment Lifeboat crews are composed almost entirely of volunteers, numbering 4,600, including over 300 women. They are supported by 3,000 volunteer shore crew and station management. Lifejackets have evolved from cork, kapok and synthetic foam to today's light and non-cumbersome designs. ALB and ILB crews wear different styles of lifejacket. RNLI lifeguards are placed on more than 200 beaches around England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, and aided almost 20,000 people in 2014. RNLI lifeguards are paid by the appropriate town or city council, while the RNLI provides their equipment and training. Standard lifeguard set-up at waters edge. The Institution has operated a Flood Rescue Team since the 2000 Mozambique floods, with six strategically placed teams each with two boats, support transport and equipment. The RNLI's international Flood Rescue Team (iFRT) is composed of volunteer lifeboat crew with a range of additional skills prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice. They have trained alongside other teams for the common purpose in the USA. =Women in the RNLI= In the early days of the service, lifeboat launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon. =Voluntary support= Apart from lifeboat crew and lifeguards, the Institution provides a variety of volunteering opportunities. One of these is as \\"Deckhand\\" where signed-up volunteers are notified by email or mobile phone when there is a local need, such as marshalling at fundraising events, helping with collections or in an RNLI shop. Voluntary internships in RNLI offices are available three times a year. Safety advice In addition to safety advice given in its publications, the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users when the opportunity arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly in inner-city areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In an effort to reduce the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, more than half of them children, the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College. Infrastructure The Lifeboat College, Poole Capsize training at the College, Poole The RNLI's chief executive is Mark Dowie, formerly lifeboat operations manager at Salcombe RNLI; he succeeded Paul Boissier on 15 May 2019. The Institution used to be split into six administrative divisions: East (East Anglia and South East England), South (South West England), West (Wales and the Isle of Man), North (East and west coasts of northern England), Scotland and Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). Since 2017 (2020 for non-operational departments) the Divisions became Regions: North & East (Berwick upon Tweed to Burnham on Crouch), South East (Southend to Swanage inc River Thames), South West (Weymouth to Portishead inc Channel Islands), Wales & West England (inc Isle of Man), Scotland and Ireland. The RNLI's main base is in Poole, Dorset, adjacent to Holes Bay in Poole Harbour. It includes RNLI HQ, lifeboat maintenance and repair facilities, the Lifeboat Support Centre and RNLI College (the training centre). The support centre and college were opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. Specialist training facilities include a wave and capsize pool, a fire simulator, a ship's bridge simulator and an engineering workshop. The College's accommodation is available for RNLI members and their guests when training is not taking place and offers facilities for weddings, conferences and other events. About half of the RNLI's staff work at Poole. Other locations are Dublin, London, Perth, Saltash, St Asaph and Stockton-on-Tees, while some roles are at lifeboat stations or home-based and include operations, estate and financial management, public relations and information technology. A new headquarters for RNLI Ireland was opened at Airside in Swords, County Dublin in June 2006 by President Mary McAleese, attended by the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the RNLI, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, R.N. Funding The RNLI is principally funded by legacies (65%) and voluntary donations (28%), with the remainder from merchandising and investment. In 2014, the RNLI's income was £182 million, while its expenditure was £149.6 million. The Institution encourages corporate partnerships, which included in 2014 Waitrose, Yamaha and Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines. There are 1,100 RNLI fundraising branches throughout the regions served by the Institution, many far from the sea, which may support a particular station, or a project such as a new lifeboat. The Institution estimated their volunteer network at 31,500 in 2014. The largest regular contributor is The Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund (known simply as 'The Lifeboat Fund') established in 1886 for civil servants to support the RNLI collectively; the Fund has provided the Institution with 52 lifeboats as well as other support. The lifeboat collection boxes are seen nationwide, and have even become the target for thieves. A fixed, cast iron collection box in Porthgwarra, Cornwall, is Grade II listed. The Institution's annual fundraising day (\\"SOS Day\\") is at the end of January, but many lifeboat stations hold open days during the summer, hosting displays, stalls and other events, as well as in-station shops which are open full or part-time. Nationally and internationally known celebrities in various fields are, or have been supporters and fundraisers for the RNLI; for example, the cartoonist Giles was a Life President of the RNLI and donated many cartoons which are still being used for RNLI charity cards and other illustrations, and Ross Brawn, the former Formula 1 team boss, in 2012 raised funds through a business challenge, for a new lifeboat for Chiswick Lifeboat Station on the River Thames in London. Other names include Bear Grylls, Dee Caffari, Chris Beardshaw, Ben Fogle, Daniel Craig, Rupert Grint, and Rebecca Newman, whose Coast to Coast tour in 2012 earned her an Outstanding Achievement Award. Membership Membership classes involve differing levels of contribution *Governor, which includes voting rights *Offshore, aimed at active sailors and boaters *Shoreline and Joint Shoreline, the most popular level *Storm Force, for younger members Publications The Lifeboat is the quarterly magazine for all members, containing regional and national news from the Institution, featured rescues, book reviews and lifeboat launch listings, with a related news and features section in the RNLI's website. The website contains full details of the organisation and its activities including fundraising, lifeboats and stations, history and projects. Criticism=Salvage There have been a few isolated cases where RNLI crew members (but not the RNLI itself) have claimed salvage. There is no legal reason why crew members of the RNLI could not salvage a vessel, since they frequently tow small vessels to safety, often over long distances. However, the RNLI does not support or encourage salvage for two reasons: firstly, because they exist to save lives at sea, and secondly, to become involved in salvage might discourage those whose lives are at risk from calling for help. The RNLI's Sea Safety Guidelines state that \\"There is no 'salvage' fee when you are towed by a lifeboat, but a voluntary contribution to the RNLI is always very welcome!\\". This stance was reinforced when the RNLI was criticised for not launching a lifeboat in order to aid an unmanned fishing vessel that had run aground. A spokesman for the RNLI declared that \\"We are not a salvage firm and our charity's aim is to provide immediate assistance for people in trouble at sea and lives are at risk.\\" See also * Her Majesty's Coastguard * Irish Coast Guard * Isle of Man Coastguard * International Lifeboat Federation * Independent lifeboats (British Isles) ;Similar organisations of other nations * Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution – Dutch equivalent * Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer – French equivalent * German Maritime Search and Rescue Service – German equivalent * Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue – Norwegian equivalent * Swedish Sea Rescue Society – Swedish equivalent * Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue – West Coast Canadian equivalent * National Sea Rescue Institute – South African equivalent ReferencesFurther reading *Belby, Alec.

It is based on the 1981 novel of the same name by Paul Theroux. The film tells the story of a family that leaves the United States and tries to find a happier and simpler life in the jungles of Central America. However, their jungle paradise quickly turns into a dystopia as their stubborn father's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive. It was shot in the cities of Cartersville and Rome in Georgia, in addition to Baltimore, Maryland, and Belize. Plot Allie Fox is a brilliant but stubborn inventor who has grown fed up with the American Dream and consumerism. Furthermore, he believes that a nuclear war is on the horizon as a result of American greed and crime. After Allie and his eldest son Charlie acquire the components at a local dump, he finishes assembling his latest creation, an ice machine known as Fat Boy. Allie's boss, Mr. Polski, an asparagus farm owner, complains that Allie is not tending to the asparagus, which is rotting. Allie, Charlie, and Allie's youngest son, Jerry, meet Mr. Polski, and Allie shows him \\"Fat Boy.\\" The machine leaves Polski unimpressed. As he drives past the fields, a dejected Allie comments on immigrants picking asparagus, and says that where they come from, they might think of ice as a luxury. The next morning, Allie throws a party for the immigrant workers before telling his family that they're leaving the United States. On board a Panamanian barge, the family meets Reverend Spellgood, a missionary, his wife, and their daughter, Emily. Allie and the Reverend clash due to their opposing religious views. When the barge docks in Belize City, the families disembark and go their separate ways. From a drunken German, Allie purchases a small village called Jeronimo located in the rainforest along the river. Mr. Haddy takes Allie and his family upriver to Jeronimo. Allie meets the inhabitants and proceeds to start building a new, \\"advanced\\" civilization, inventing many new things in the process. The locals take kindly to Allie and his family, but Allie's will to build a utopian civilization keeps them working to their limits. Reverend Spellgood arrives to convert Jeronimo's citizens. In the process, Allie and Spellgood angrily denounce each other, leading to a permanent schism: Allie believes Spellgood to be a religious zealot; Spellgood believes Allie to be a communist. Allie sets to constructing a huge version of \\"Fat Boy\\" that can supply the town with ice. Upon completing the machine, Allie hears rumors of a native tribe in the mountains that has never seen ice. Allie recruits his two sons to carry a load of ice into the jungle to supply the tribe. Upon arriving, Allie finds that the load has melted, and that the tribe has already been visited by missionaries. When Allie returns to Jeronimo, he learns that Spellgood has left with much of the populace, scaring them with stories of God's biblical destruction. The near-empty town is visited by three rebels, who demand to use Jeronimo as a base. Allie and his family agree to accommodate them while Allie concocts a plan to be rid of them. Set on freezing them to death, Allie bunks the rebels up in the giant ice machine, tells Charlie to lock its only other exit, and activates it. The rebels, waking in panic, try to shoot their way out. To Allie's horror, the rebels' gunfire sets off an explosion within the machine. By the next morning, both the machine and the family's home is in ruins, and chemicals from the destroyed machine have severely polluted the river. Forced downstream, Allie and his family arrive at the coast. Mother and the children rejoice, believing they can return to the United States. Allie, refusing to believe his dream has been shattered, announces that they have all they need on the beach and tells them that the United States has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Settling on the beach in a houseboat he has built, and refusing assistance from Mr. Haddy, Allie believes that the family has accomplished building a utopia. One night, the storm surge from a tropical cyclone nearly forces the family out to sea until Charlie reveals that he has been hiding motor components (secretly given to him by Mr. Haddy), allowing them to start the motor on the boat. Forced to travel upstream once again, Charlie and Jerry grow resentful of their father. Coming ashore when the family stumbles across Spellgood's compound, Allie sees barbed wire, and mutters that the settlement is a Christian concentration camp. While the rest of the family sleeps, Charlie and Jerry sneak over to the Spellgood home. They find out that the United States was not destroyed and that Emily will assist them in escaping from Allie. Before Charlie can persuade Mother and his sisters to leave, Allie sets Spellgood's church on fire. Spellgood shoots Allie, paralyzing him from the neck down. The family escapes aboard the boat. The family begins traveling downriver again, with Allie drifting in and out of consciousness. Allie asks his wife if they are going upstream. She lies to him for the first time. Charlie's narration reports the death of Allie, but gives hope that the rest of the family can live their lives freely from now on.

Jack Nicholson was originally offered the lead role, but backed out partly because he could not watch Los Angeles Lakers games in Belize, where part of the film was to be shot.Duke, Brad. Harrison Ford: the films. McFarland, 2005. As the film went into pre-production, and Weir was in Central America scouting for locations, the financial backing for the film fell through and the project was suspended indefinitely.Pfeiffer, Lee. The Films of Harrison Ford. Citadel Press, 2002. In the meantime, Weir was approached to direct Witness starring Harrison Ford. The film, which was Weir's first American production, was a critical and commercial success, garnering eight Academy Award nominations including Weir for Best Director, Ford for Best Actor, and the film itself for Best Film. During the production of Witness, Weir discussed The Mosquito Coast with Ford who became interested in the role of Allie Fox (though Ford's agent was less enthusiastic). With Ford attached to the project, financial backing and distribution for the film was easier to find (ultimately from Saul Zaentz and Warner Bros.). Filming began the week of February 7, 1986 in Belize and finished there on April 26 before moving to Georgia. Weir and Ford famously missed the Academy Awards ceremony for which they had both been nominated for Witness, which won two Oscars, for Best Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The film contains the last feature film role of Butterfly McQueen, who had a prominent role in Gone with the Wind. She plays a lapsed churchgoer, and in real life was a vocal atheist. Reception The film was initially a critical and commercial disappointment, but has since received much stronger modern reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 6.42/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Harrison Ford capably tackles a tough, unlikable role, producing a fascinating and strange character study\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 49% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Siskel & Ebert were split, Siskel giving the film a \\"thumbs up\\" and Ebert giving it a \\"thumbs down,\\" criticizing Allie Fox for being \\"boring.\\" However, he did compliment Ford's performance. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"utterly flat.\\" In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote: In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson wrote, \\"He's orchestrated The Mosquito Coast's action to match Fox's progressive mental state, from rage to explosion to squalls and finally to hurricane velocity; however, the film leaves us not with an apotheosis, but exhaustion.\\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, \\"The Mosquito Coast is a work of consummate craftsmanship and it's spectacularly acted, down to the smallest roles ... but its field of vision is as narrow and eventually as claustrophobic as Allie's.\\" The negative reviews the film received prompted Harrison Ford to defend the film in the media: With a production budget of $25 million, the film made a little over $14 million in North America. Despite being one of his least commercially successful films, Ford has defended it, saying in a 1992 interview: ReferencesExternal links  * Production notes Category:1986 films Category:1980s adventure drama films Category:American adventure drama films Category:American films Category:Dystopian films Category:Films directed by Peter Weir Category:Films scored by Maurice Jarre Category:Films set in Belize Category:Films set in Honduras Category:Films shot in Baltimore Category:Films shot in Belize Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Schrader Category:Survival thriller films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1986 drama films ","title":"The Mosquito Coast"},{"id":"430784","text":"George Douglas Howard Cole (25 September 1889 – 14 January 1959) was an English political theorist, economist, and historian. As a libertarian socialist, he theorised guild socialism. He belonged to the Fabian Society and was an advocate for the co-operative movement. Early life Cole was born in Cambridge \\"George Douglas Howard Cole Papers\\", p. 3. Internationaal Instituut voor Sociale Geschiedenis, Amsterdam. On line. to George Cole, a jeweller who later became a surveyor; and his wife Jessie Knowles. Cole was educated at St Paul's School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he achieved a double first.Marc Stears, ‘Cole, George Douglas Howard (1889–1959)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 7 May 2017  First World War  As a conscientious objector during the First World War, Cole's involvement in the campaign against conscription introduced him to a co-worker, Margaret Postgate, whom he married in 1918. The couple both worked for the Fabian Society for the next six years before moving to Oxford, where Cole started writing for The Manchester Guardian. In 1915, Cole became an unpaid research officer at the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He advised the union on how to respond to wartime legislation including the Munitions Act. This role enabled him to escape conscription on the grounds that he was conducting work of national importance. Having secured exemption from military service, during the war years Cole developed a political theory of guild socialism.Marc Stears, ‘Cole, George Douglas Howard(1889–1959)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Oct 2017  Professional life  Cole authored several economic and historical works including biographies of William Cobbett and Robert Owen. In 1925, he became reader in economics at University College, Oxford. In 1929, he was appointed to the National Economic Advisory Council when it was set up by the second Labour government. In 1944, Cole became the first Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. He was succeeded in the chair by Isaiah Berlin in 1957. Cole was initially a pacifist, but he abandoned this position around 1938, stating: \\"Hitler cured me of pacifism\\".Martin Ceadel, \\"The Peace Movement Between the Wars: Problems of Definition\\", in Campaigns for Peace : British peace movements. Edited by Richard Taylor and Nigel Young. Manchester University Press, 1987. (p. 84). During the 1930s, Cole sought to construct a British popular front against fascism. He identified the extent of the military threat before many of his colleagues had abandoned their pacifism. Cole lent strong support to the republican cause in Spain. He was listed in the Black Book of prominent subjects to be arrested in the case of a successful invasion of Britain.Walter Schellenberg, The Schellenberg Memoirs, London 1956 (Deutsch: Aufzeichungen, München 1979) pp 174. In 1941, Cole was appointed sub-warden of Nuffield College, Oxford. He was central to the establishment of the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey which collected a large amount of demographic, economic and social data. This information was used to advocate for an extensive programme of social reform.  Socialism  Cole became interested in Fabianism while studying at Balliol College, Oxford. He joined the Fabian Society's executive under the sponsorship of Sidney Webb. Cole became a principal proponent of guild socialist ideas, a libertarian socialist alternative to Marxian political economy. These ideas he put forward in The New Age before and during the First World War and also in the pages of The New Statesman, the weekly founded by the Beatrice Webb and George Bernard Shaw. Cole said his interest in socialism was kindled by his reading News from Nowhere, the utopian novel by William Morris, writing: Neither a Marxist nor a social democrat, Cole envisioned a socialism of decentralised association and active, participatory democracy, whose basic units would be sited at the workplace and in the community rather than in any central apparatus of the state.Peter Sedgwick, \\"A Return to First Things\\", Balliol College Annual Record 1980, pp.86–88 (review of A. W. Wright, G.D.H. Cole and Socialist Democracy). Marxists’ Internet Archive. Online. In the 1920s Hugh Gaitskell was a student of Cole's, becoming his driver during the General Strike of 1926.https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university- degree-that-rules-britain In 1936, Cole began calling for a popular front movement in Britain, where the Labour Party would ally with other parties against the threat of fascism.Daniel Ritschel, The Politics of Planning: The Debate on Economic Planning in Britain in the 1930s. Oxford University Press, 1997 (pp. 282–83) Cole was a powerful influence on the life of the young Harold Wilson, whom he taught, worked with and convinced to join the Labour Party. Cole wrote at least seven books for the Left Book Club, all of which were published by Victor Gollancz Ltd. These are marked with LBC in the list of his books given below. He and his wife, Margaret Cole, together wrote 29 popular detective stories,Marc Stears, ‘Cole , Dame Margaret Isabel (1893–1980)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 7 May 2017 featuring the investigators Superintendent Wilson, Everard Blatchington and Dr. Tancred. Cole and his wife created a partnership, but not a marriage. Cole took little interest in sex and he regarded women as a distraction for men. Margaret documented this comprehensively in a biography she wrote of her husband after his death. Although Cole admired the Soviet Union for creating a socialist economy, he rejected its dictatorial government as a model for socialist societies elsewhere. In a 1939 lecture, Cole stated: In his book Europe, Russia and the Future published in 1941, Cole claimed that however immoral the new Nazi- dominated Europe was, in some ways it was better than the \\"impracticable\\" system of sovereign states that had preceded it. In economic terms, it could be said that \\"it would be better to let Hitler conquer all Europe short of the Soviet Union, and thereafter exploit it ruthlessly in the Nazi interest, than to go back to the pre-war order of independent Nation States with frontiers drawn so as to cut right across the natural units of production and exchange\\".G. D. H. Cole, Europe, Russia and the Future (London: Victor Gollancz, 1941), p. 104. Cole also stated: Co-operative studies Cole was also a theorist of the co-operative movement and made a number of contributions to the fields of co-operative studies, co-operative economics and the history of the co-operative movement. In particular, his book The British Co-operative Movement in a Socialist Society examined the economic status of the English CWS (the predecessor of the modern Co-operative Group), evaluated its possibility of achieving a Co-operative Commonwealth without state assistance and hypothesised what the role the co-operative might have in a socialist state.Cole, G. D. H., \\"The British Co-operative Movement in a Socialist Society: A Report for the Fabian Society\\", London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1951. A second book, titled A Century of Co-operation, examined the history of the movement from the very first co-operatives to the contribution of the Chartists and Robert Owen, through to the Rochdale Pioneers as well as the movement's development (in Great Britain) over the following century.Cole, G.D.H., A Century of Co-operation, Oxford: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1944. Cole contributed to An Outline of Modern Knowledge, ed. William Rose (Victor Gollancz, 1931) along with other leading authorities of the time, including Roger Fry, C. G. Seligman, Maurice Dobb and F. J. C. Hearnshaw.  Personal life  In August 1918, Cole married Margaret Isabel Postgate (1893–1980). Margaret was the daughter of the classical scholar John Percival Postgate. The couple had one son and two daughters in a marriage that lasted forty-one years. However, the marriage does not seem to have been especially happy. Cole expressed little interest in actual romantic attachment and even less in sexual relations. Friends observed that emotional attachments tended to be with men rather than women. Cole was very fond of some of his male students. They included the future leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell. There is no evidence of any homosexual encounters either before or during his marriage. Cole and his wife jointly wrote a number of books and articles, including twenty-nine detective stories. Cole could not accept the idea of a \\"determinate human superior\\" his wife recalled that \\"he... never gave orders except in a purely routine and non-significant sense (this somehow did not conflict that he employed houshold servants throughout his life).ibid. p. 145 His dislike of all forms of hierarchy and hatred of ritual led to atheism at an early age, though he never engaged in anti-religious polemics.ibid. While no ludite, he greatly admired everything produced by William Morris including his affection for the Cotswolds. Though he enjoyed classical music and derided the radio as \\"so much noise.\\"Ibid. p. 36 Almost allergic to higher mathematics (he did not understand Algebra) he distrusted science, as it was being used to quantify things that were best left to interpretation.Ibid. p. 35-36 In literature and poetry he enjoyed (after Morris) Defoe, Swift, William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, Henry James, William Cobbett, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Butler, but he found Edmund Burke and Thomas Carlyle pretentious. He disliked the \\"imperialism\\" of Shakespeare and hated D. H. Lawrence.Ibid. p. 47 He was admired by his students, but Gaitskell said he was much too sensitive, self-critical and sardonic to play the part of the master at all willingly.”Ibid. p. 144 In the Spring of 1929 the Cole's returned to London, living in West Hempstead for six years until buying a \\"rambling Victorian\\" house called \\"Freeland\\" in Hendon where he lived for most of the last three decades of his life.Cole p. 171-173 In early 1957 he and his wife moved to a flat in Holland Park, Kensington. He died after going into a diabetic coma in the early hours of 14 January 1959 in hospital in Hampstead. In lieu of religious rites his brother-in-law, Raymond Postgate, read two passages from the works of William Morris at his funeral in Golders Green Crematorium. His estate was offered for probate at £46,617 (equivalent to £1,097,364 in 2020).The Times 4 September 1959 Ibid.

D. H. Cole"},{"id":"430786","text":"The Chanur novels are a series of five science fiction novels, forming three separate stories, written by American author C. J. Cherryh and published by DAW Books between 1981 and 1992. The first novel in the series is The Pride of Chanur (1981), which was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1983. The Pride of Chanur, originally a stand-alone story, was followed by the Chanur's Venture trilogy (also referred to as \\"Chanur's Revenge\\"), Chanur's Venture (1984), which was shortlisted for a Locus Award in 1985; The Kif Strike Back (1985) and Chanur's Homecoming (1986). These were followed by a later sequel, Chanur's Legacy (1992). The five novels were also published in two omnibus editions: the first three in The Chanur Saga in 2000 and the next two in Chanur's Endgame in 2007. An abridged version of The Pride of Chanur was published in the Science Fiction Digest in 1983. Set in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe, but in a different region of space inhabited by numerous alien spacefaring civilizations, the Chanur novels are unusually realistic examples of space opera, with ship-to-ship shooting minimized in favor of coercion, manipulation, politics, pride contests, and clashing economic interests, driven in many cases by species-to-species miscommunication and misunderstanding. The Compact The series is set in the same Alliance-Union universe of Downbelow Station, but in a region of space in the opposite direction from Earth as the Alliance and Union. It is occupied by a number of spacefaring civilizations bound by a set of trade treaties into a so-called Compact. The Compact is not a political organization, and has no government; it deals only with open trade, leaving the component civilizations to resolve conflicts between themselves. Human space borders kif and knnn territory, the most aggressive and enigmatic species of the Compact respectively. First contact ensues when an ambitious kif hakkikt (prince) captures a human exploration ship. The last surviving crew member, Tully, escapes while the kif ship is docked at a station and winds up on The Pride of Chanur, a hani merchant vessel commanded by Pyanfar Chanur. This triggers the events of the first novel in the series and its three-part sequel. Species of the Compact Map of The Compact Oxygen- breathersHani= Homeworld: Anuurn Hani are a feline-like species, maned, bearded, usually of red or tawny fur. Females are smaller than humans, males much larger (for much the same reason as Earth lions). They were discovered by the mahendo'sat and helped into space; most of their technology is therefore derived from mahen. They live in autonomous clans, each consisting of related females, children, and a single male, the clan lord. A male takes over a clan by defeating the previous lord in personal combat. Most males are not that lucky. Male offspring are thrown out of their clan when they become strong enough to pose a threat to the lord. They live in exile among others like themselves, honing their fighting skills and waiting for the opportunity to challenge for a clan. For this reason and because males are stereotyped as being emotionally unstable, only females go into space (until Pyanfar Chanur changes the rules). Females do all the work on clan lands and in space ventures, although Cherryh does describe some able and intelligent males who become involved in the world around them. Clans are united into amphictionies for control of scarce resources; the biggest one is their homeworld itself, governed by a mahen-inspired council of clans called the han. Hani politics are tradition-bound, based on such concepts as allegiance, honor, blood feud and parole. One of the hani languages became the basis for the Compact's pidgin, because it was grammatically and phonetically easy for other species (but not as easy for humans). =Mahendo'sat= Homeworld: Iji Mahendo'sat (singular mahe) are black or brown primate-like creatures, human- size or larger. They are very curious, innovative and politically oriented. The Mahendo'sat political system is based on the concept of Personage, a charismatic figure with a lot of social credit; a Personage's power is determined by the number of its followers, but a supporter can either weaken or strengthen its Personage, depending on whether its actions in its Personage's name prove to be beneficial or not. To an outsider, this can (and frequently does) look like a Personage's mahen agents are promoting mutually contradictory policies at the same time. Mahendo'sat are idiosyncratically bad at learning other species' languages—many of them can not even master the pidgin used by Compact spacers—although they are quite eloquent in their own numerous languages. Mahendo'sat are the \\"glue\\" of the Compact, always trying to maintain the balance of power so peace can be kept and no species dominates. They are in constant search of new powers, recently including humans. =Stsho= Homeworld: Llyene Stsho are slight, slender, fragile, crested bird-like white herbivores (even their eyes are pearly white), xenophobic and non-aggressive. They permit no other oxygen-breathing species in their territory and keep the location of their home world a secret. Stsho rely on wealth, trade, and alliances to maintain their position within the Compact. They hire other species for protection and maintaining order on their space stations, usually the mahendo'sat. They prefer delicate pleasures and pastel colors, their speech is exceedingly ceremonial and politically correct; their identities are prone to change (\\"Phase\\") under great stress, which has many legal implications. They have three genders, gtst, gtste and gtsto, which can change with Phasing. Only the gtst (indeterminate sex) deal with other species. There is a fourth state, gtsta, in which the individual is addressed as a holiness. This is a sexless state usually achieved by an aged, honorable Stsho. A Stsho who is in the process of Phasing from one state to another is gtstisi. =Kif= Homeworld: Akkht. Kif are bare-skinned, wrinkled, ash- grey, long-snouted rat-like bipedal carnivores. They are the tallest species in the Compact, slender, fast and deadly. They are strictly predators, unable to eat anything but live prey; they have two sets of teeth (outer for biting and inner for pulping—their throats are unfit for swallowing solid food) and retractable claws. Their social and political [dis]organization revolves about a personal quality called sfik, which combines face, authority, and ferociousness. Sfik is gained through victory in combat, or possession of something of value, or just the respect of others: followers with their own strong sfik strengthen the sfik of their leader. A kif that loses sfik is likely to have its followers either defect or kill it. As a result, the kif are prone to change sides at the first sign of weakness. They seem to have no other moral values; they are pirates and cannibals, and are generally deemed troublesome and dangerous by the other species. Occasionally, a strong leader gains enough sfik to achieve the status of hakkikt. These individuals are viewed by the mahendo'sat as serious destabilizing factors. During the time of the Chanur cycle, several hakkiktun seek to become the mekt-hakkikt, the leader of all the kif, a status no kif has ever attained, a possibility that greatly disturbs other species, especially the mahendo'sat. Kif are very linguistically adept and adaptable. They are also color blind and the colors of their clothes and habitats are generally shades of black and grey. They use dot codes instead of color codes for their hardware. Unlike other Compact oxygen-breathers, they are capable of remaining awake and physically active during the \\"no-time\\" of \\"Jump\\" --- a fact which (like most other things about themselves) they prefer to keep secret. Methane-breathersTc'a and Chi= Tc'a are large methane-breathing five-eyed yellow snakelike beings, and the chi are yellow arthropod-like creatures. The two species are related in a way none of the oxygen breathers understand, but are (presumably) symbiotic. They are very technologically advanced and powerful, although understanding them is tricky at best, since their brains are multi-part and their speech decodes as complex matrices of intertwined meanings. They run the methane side of most space stations. =Knnn= Knnn, the third methane breathing species, multi-legged tangles of wiry black hair, are the most technologically advanced in the Compact. Unlike other known species, they can maneuver in hyperspace and carry other ships with them. Only tc'a can communicate with them (or claim they can); the knnn are incomprehensible and therefore deemed dangerous by the other species, not to be provoked. They trade by taking whatever they want and leaving whatever they deem sufficient as payment behind; it is an improvement over their prior habit of just taking trader ships apart. Technology of the Compact There are three main kinds of space ships in Compact's employ: surface-to-orbit shuttles, miners, and jump ships. The first and the second use only reaction engines for propulsion; shuttles can land on planets while miners and jump ships need space stations to dock. Only the jump ships can cross interstellar distances by using a jump drive. They are also the fastest in-system transports because they can move at sub-light speeds without entering a jump. Most of these are traders and freighters; some are heavily armed hunter-ships. Compact jump ships do not enter hyperspace proper; they aim at a star and \\"glide\\" along the so-called interface between space and hyperspace until the mass at the other end of the jump goal makes them drop out. They exit at light speed and must dump velocity with help of the same jump engine; a ship failing to do so is doomed, and usually a high hazard. There is a limit on maximum jump distance, depending on the ship's drive power and mass; a ship overstretching a jump may \\"fade\\", never exiting it. A jump takes several weeks of objective time. Subjectively it can take hours or even several days; this tends to exhaust the body, and the crews need to take rest between jumps. Hani and mahendo'sat stay marginally conscious during jump, but unable to act; usually, they dream. Stsho must drug themselves unconscious to survive jump. Humans can survive it undrugged, but it is a terrible experience to them. No one knows what the other species feel during it, though it is hinted that kif maintain more of their faculties than hani during jump. Jumps can be strung together, but at a commensurate increase in crew discomfort. Ships and space stations communicate by radio, which poses time-lag difficulties. To alleviate them somewhat, heavily trafficked systems usually keep buoys near the jump exit points that serve incoming ships with system-wide scan and traffic information, and also mail. The space stations are universally built as huge doughnuts, the spin maintaining artificial gravity provided by centrifugal force; the Compact has no gravitational-control technology. The spin poses a difficulty when docking, as the ship must precisely coincide with the rotating station wheel. When docked, two sets of grapples, its own and the station's, hold it in place and in mutual clinch: a ship can undock forcibly, but that is bound to damage the station and is subject to substantial fines. Tankers and miners dock at the central hub for the transfer of materials. Dockside transport is mostly electric carts and trucks of all sizes, but many move around on the docks on foot. If a ship ignites its jump engine while docked, the energy released will blow the whole compound to pieces. Different species build ships in different fashions; the methane-breather ships seem haphazardly constructed to the oxygen breathers. Hani ships such as The Pride of Chanur are based on mahendo'sat technology. The dock grapples are at the prow of the ship. Behind it is the habitat area with a rotating carousel which provides \\"gravity\\" during inertial flight and in jump; the bridge, galley and living quarters - including crew and passenger quarters - are all located in that ring. Then come the pressurized and \\"cold\\" holds for cargo canisters, loading machinery and a separate cargo access hatch; then the jump drive assembly with three vanes constructed of modular panels and mounted on support columns, with wire struts; these form the \\"hyperspace bubble\\" needed to cross the interface. At the rear of the ship is the main engine, used for ballistic flight. Hunter ships have less cargo space and more weaponry and crew accommodation, and often have detachable holds; even a freighter can \\"blow its holds\\" when necessary to lighten the ship to allow for more speed. This is only done in extremis, as the entire purpose of a freighter is to trade in goods and make a profit. Weapons include lasers, automatic cannons, and missile batteries for the ship; personal armaments include small beam weapons, pistols, and \\"AP guns\\", which fire explosive shells, not unlike a small grenade launcher. Knives are also mentioned. Hani and kif, as predators, also have sharp retractile claws and sharp teeth. The mahendo'sat have tough, non-retractable claws, which are often used for utilitarian purposes, but using these in a fight is seen as a sign of madness in their culture. Plots and characters=Overview The Chanur novels are written as unusually realistic space opera, with much less ship-to-ship shooting than coercion, manipulation, politics, pride contests, and clashing economic interests interspersed with species-to-species miscommunication and misunderstanding. The realistic handling of linguistic and psychological barriers is one of the stronger aspects of the books (especially compared to the genre as a whole). The character development is another, which is also closely connected to the inter-species relations. As the (usually involuntary) exposure of the characters to different cultures goes on, they are pushed to probe other ways of thinking—and together with constant pressure of both economical and immediate hazard that drives them to opening new levels of themselves. Even the \\"enemy\\" side is quickly brought from the level of incomprehensible faceless danger into viewing them as a formidable yet admirable opponent. The books are a metaphor of breaking mental barriers, finding oneself in adversity, and growing above petty interests towards global strategies and greatness. There are several references to the events of the Chanur series in Cherryh's 1988 novel Cyteen, both in statements by its characters and in the pseudo-historical documents making up the chapter interstitials. From them we learn that the Earth authorities, badly rattled by contact with the Compact and thus deprived of expansion opportunities into nearby volumes of space, stepped up their rapprochement with Alliance and Union. In particular, they increased their overtures toward Union to avoid having all of their interstellar commerce dominated by the closer Alliance. This led to Earth's transferring genetic information about Earth species to Union for preservation against their possible extinction, and Union transferring information gained in the terraforming of Cyteen to Earth to be used in terraforming Mars and repairing ecological damage on Earth. The Pride of Chanur The balance of power and economic stability of the Compact are threatened when an Outsider, a human named Tully, escapes from his kif captors at Meetpoint Station and seeks refuge on a hani merchant ship, The Pride of Chanur, captained by Pyanfar Chanur. Pyanfar's refusal to surrender Tully to the kif makes an enemy of their ambitious leader, Akukkakk. The kif had captured Tully's ship and tried to force the four surviving humans to divulge all they knew about their previously unknown species, but the humans resisted. Tully was the only survivor. Aboard The Pride, Tully persuades an initially reluctant Pyanfar into accepting him as a member of her otherwise all-female crew. The kif chase The Pride back to the hani homeworld, but the unpredictable and powerful knnn drive the kif away. The knnn also transport a human ship they found, the Ulysses, into hani space, and Tully is reunited with his species.

Goldtooth (mahendo'sat): captain of Mahijiru * Akukkakk (kif): hakkikt and captain of Hinukku Chanur's Venture / The Kif Strike Back / Chanur's Homecoming Two years after the events of The Pride of Chanur, Pyanfar Chanur returns to Meetpoint Station with The Pride, where Goldtooth presents the surprised hani captain with Tully, returned from Earth. A fleet of human ships is on the way, though Tully does not make it clear whether they are coming to establish trade relations with the Compact or attack the kif. This threatens to break the uneasy balance of power within the Compact. At the same time, two kif, Akkhtimakt and Sikkukkut, are engaged in a power struggle, both trying to become the mekt-hakkikt and finally unite the kif, a prospect that inspires dread among most of the rest of the species in the Compact. Sikkukkut persuades a reluctant Pyanfar into becoming his ally, which raises the suspicions of an already hostile agent of the planet- oriented, conservative hani government. The kif conflict spills over into hani space, threatening the hani homeworld, but Goldtooth and the human fleet arrive and the two hakkikts are defeated. A small delegation of Compact ships return with the human ships to human space to investigate trade. Pyanfar offers Tully the opportunity to return with the human ships, but he elects to remain on The Pride as a crew member.

Eight years later, Hilfy Chanur, Pyanfar's niece, former crew member of The Pride of Chanur and captain of her own ship, Chanur's Legacy, arrives at Meetpoint Station. There No'shto-shti-stlen, the stsho stationmaster, offers her a million-credit contract to deliver a precious oji (cultural artifact) to Atli-lyen-tlas, the stsho ambassador at Urtur Station. Hilfy, unaware of trouble ahead, accepts the contract and takes aboard the oji and its stsho guardian. Legacy's ordeal begins when they can not find Atli-lyen-tlas. A mahen faction that many mahendo'sat believe to have \\"the Momentum\\" (a mystical force) wants the oji and is hunting for the stsho ambassador. Vikktakkht, a kif hakkikt, rescues Atli-lyen-tlas and \\"shelters\\" gtst in kif space, persuading Hilfy to come and fetch gtst. Hilfy rescues Atli-lyen-tlas, but discovers that gtst, due to the stress of gtst's ordeal and old age, has become gtsta, or neuter, and cannot accept the oji, which turns out to constitute a marriage proposal from No'shto-shti-stlen. With the help of Vikktakkht, Hilfy returns to Meetpoint, now under the control of the mahen faction, and frees No'shto-shti-stlen, presenting gtst with Atli-lyen- tlas and the oji, thus completing a complex politically oriented marriage contract. The mahendo'sat are ousted from Meetpoint and control is returned to the stsho.

It was part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a New Deal program. It was one of a group of New Deal arts programs known collectively as Federal Project Number One. The FWP employed thousands of people and produced hundreds of publications including state guides, city guides, local histories, oral histories, ethnographies, and children's books. In addition to writers, the Project provided jobs to unemployed librarians, clerks, researchers, editors, and historians. Background Museum of Science and Industry (c. 1939) Funded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, the Federal Writers' Project was established July 27, 1935, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Henry Alsberg, a journalist, playwright, theatrical producer, and human rights activist, directed the program from 1935 to 1939. In 1939 Alsberg was fired, federal funding was cut, and the Project fell under state sponsorship led by John D. Newsom. The FWP ended completely in 1943. It is estimated that over ten-thousand people found employment in the FWP. The Federal Writers' Project set out not only to provide work relief for unemployed writers, but to create a unique \\"self-portrait of America\\" through publication of guidebooks. From 1935 to 1943, the Writer's Project cost approximately $27,000,000 – one fifth of one percent of all WPA appropriations.  American Guide Series and other publications  The American Guide series, the most well-known of the FWP's publications, consisted of guides to the then 48 states, as well as the Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. The books were written and compiled by writers from individual states and territories, and edited by Alsberg and his staff in Washington, D.C. The format was generally uniform, and each guide included detailed histories of the state or territory, with descriptions of every city and town, automobile travel routes, photographs, maps, and chapters on natural resources, culture, and geography. The inclusion of essays about the various cultures of people living in the states, including immigrants and African Americans, was unprecedented. City books, such as The New York City Guide, were also published as part of the series. Some full- length books are available online at the Internet Archive. The FWP also published another series, Life In America, as well as numerous individual titles. Many FWP books were bestsellers. Others, like Cape Cod Pilot, written by author Josef Berger using the pseudonym Jeremiah Digges, received critical acclaim. In each state a Writers' Project non-relief staff of editors was formed, along with a much larger group of field workers drawn from local unemployment rolls. The people hired came from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from former newspaper workers to white-collar and blue-collar workers without writing or editing experience. George Dillard's oral history was recorded for the Slave Narrative Collection by the Federal Writers' Project (1936)  Ancillary projects  Notable projects of the Federal Writers' Project included the Slave Narrative Collection, a set of interviews that culminated in over 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and- white photographs of former slaves.Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1938 Many of these narratives are available online from the above-named collection at the Library of Congress website. Folklorist Benjamin A. Botkin was instrumental in insuring the survival of these manuscripts. Among the researchers and authors who have used this collection are Colson Whitehead for his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, The Underground Railroad. Other programs that emerged from Alsberg's desire to create an inclusive \\"self-portrait of America\\" were the Life History and Folklore Projects. These consisted of first-person narratives and interviews (collected and conducted by FWP workers) which represented people of various ethnicites, regions and occupations. According to the Library Congress website, American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936 to 1940, the documents \\"chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others.\\" The Illinois Writers' Project, represented one of the few racially integrated Project sites. The Chicago project employed Arna Bontemps, an established voice of the Harlem Renaissance, and helped to launch the literary careers of African American writers such as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Katherine Dunham, and Frank Yerby (Mangione 1972). The Virginia Negro Studies Project employed 16 African American writers and culminated in the publication of The Negro in Virginia (1940). Notably, it included photographs by Robert McNeill, now remembered as a groundbreaking African American photographer. The unpublished works of African American writer Zora Neale Hurston, who was employed by the Florida Writers' Project, was compiled years after her death in Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project.  Controversies  For most of its lifetime, the Federal Writers' Project faced a barrage of criticism from conservatives. When Massachusetts: A Guide to Its Places and People, was published, it was lauded by government officials, including Governor Charles F. Hurley. But the day after its publication, \\"conservatives attacked the book over its essays on the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and other labor issues. Even more sacrilegious to these critics was the coverage of the Sacco and Vanzetti affair.\\" Scholars called the questionable passages \\"fair accounts\\"; ironically, the controversy helped increase book sales. The most poisonous attacks against the FWP came from the House Committee on Un- American Activities (commonly known as HUAC) and its chair, the media-savvy Congressman Martin Dies Jr. of Texas. Alsberg and Hallie Flanagan, his counterpart at the Federal Theatre Project, faced tremendous scrutiny from the committee. The Dies HUAC committee, like the McCarthy committee of the 1950s, \\"used inquisitorial scare tactics, innuendo, and unsupported accusations.\\" Alsberg, Flanagan and others who were accused of supporting the communist agenda could not \\"examine evidence against them, could not produce their own witnesses, could not cross-examine accusers.\\" Accusations that communist activities were carried out openly, and that Soviets funded labor unions which then took control of the arts' projects, were found to be false. Future Guggenheim scholar and author Richard Wright was often under attack, with his writings pronounced as \\"vile.\\" Among the many charges leveled against the FWP and its members, was that Richard Wright was not born in the United States. (He was born in Mississippi.) Alsberg wrote a long court brief and provided supporting documents to refute each charge. thumb Henry Alsberg testifies before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. December 1938. Support for the FWP came from Eleanor Roosevelt, as well as mainstream publishing companies such as Viking Press, Random House, and Alfred A. Knopf, which produced some of the books. By 1939, HUAC's tactics seemed to work, and the newly elected Congress cut $150,000 million from WPA budget while quadrupling HUAC's funding. In January 1939, 6,000 people were laid off from Federal One. By July 1939, Congress voted to eliminate the Theatre Project. Federal sponsorship for the Federal Writers' Project came to an end in 1939, although the program was permitted to continue under state sponsorship, with some federal employees, until 1943. In the last months of the FWP's existence, Henry Alsberg was fired. He continued to work past his firing date in order to meet contractual arrangements with the publishers of three upcoming American Guide books. By the time of his departure in 1939, the FWP had published 321 publications; hundreds more remained in various stages of publications. Some were published in the years leading up to 1943 under the renamed Writer's Program. Others were never completed. Over the lifetime of the FWP and the Writer's Program, it is estimated that 10,000 people were employed. In the 1937 musical The Cradle Will Rock, funded by the Federal Theater Project, composer Marc Blitzstein incorporated into the work the efforts to prevent its production. Film A National Endowment for the Humanities-funded documentary about the Federal Writers' Project, entitled ·Soul of a People: Writing America's Story premiered on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2009. The film includes interviews with American authors Studs Terkel, Stetson Kennedy, and American historian Douglas Brinkley. The companion book was published by Wiley & Sons as Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America. The Slave Narratives featured in the HBO documentary, Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives and includes Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson performing dramatic readings of the transcripts. The 1999 film Cradle Will Rock, by Tim Robbins, while depicting the events of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), dramatizes the attacks against Federal One (via the House Committee on Un-American Activities) which helped shutter both the FTP and the FWP.

Based on Ethan Canin's short story \\"The Palace Thief\\", the film follows a prep school teacher and his students at a fictional boys' prep school, St. Benedict's Academy, near Washington, D.C. Plot William Hundert works at a boarding school for boys called Saint Benedict's in the 1970s, where he is a passionate classics teacher who attempts to impart wisdom and a sense of honor to his students; he begins the school year by having new student Martin Blythe read a plaque that hangs over his door which contains a statement made by an ancient Mesopotamian ruler, Shutruk Nahunte. The plaque sings Shutruk Nahunte's praises, but Hundert explains that he contributed nothing of value to his kingdom, and as a result is virtually forgotten today. Hundert's disciplined life and classroom are shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, is enrolled late in the class. Sedgewick possesses none of Hundert's principles and is the son of a U.S. senator. He frequently disrupts class and does poorly in his homework. Hundert meets with Sedgewick's father to talk about his behavior, only to discover that the senator is disinterested in Sedgewick beyond knowing he is passing his classes. Hundert decides to help Sedgewick, they develop a friendship, and Sedgewick's grades improve. The traditional end-of-the-year \\"Mr. Julius Caesar contest\\", in which the top three students compete in a classics quiz in front of the entire school, is approaching. Sedgewick works very hard to earn a spot, but ends up in fourth place. Hundert doesn't want his efforts to be for naught, so he raises his grade to qualify; Hundert later observes Martin, the rightful third place contestant, despondently withdrawn under a tree. During the competition Hundert spies Sedgewick using crib notes, but the headmaster orders Hundert to ignore it. Hundert then deliberately asks Sedgewick a question on Hamilcar Barca which was not covered in class; it is answered correctly by another contestant, Deepak Mehta (having been seen earlier by Hundert reading a book on military science on his own initiative), who is crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". The cheating is never publicized, but the trust Sedgewick and Hundert had in each other is broken. Sedgewick returns to his old ways and barely graduates, with Hundert expressing deep disappointment that he failed Sedgewick. Twenty-five years later, Hundert is poised to become the new headmaster, but resigns in shock when a less experienced teacher gets the position due to his fundraising ability. Hundert is later told that an adult Sedgewick will make a tremendous donation to Saint Benedict's, contingent upon Hundert hosting a Mr. Julius Caesar rematch at Sedgewick's resort hotel on the Gold Coast. The now adult members of Sedgewick's graduating class are also invited, and all enjoy the reunion. The three original contestants begin the competition, but as it progresses, Hundert realizes that Sedgewick is being fed answers by an assistant through an earpiece. Hundert asks a question about Shutruk Nahunte, which all the students find laughably easy; however, Sedgewick is unable to answer it. Deepak answers correctly and once again wins. Afterward, Sedgewick formally announces that he is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. While the men applaud, Hundert is appalled that he was used for political grandstanding. Shortly after the announcement, Hundert and Sedgewick run into each other in the men's room, where Hundert confronts Sedgewick. Sedgewick tells Hundert that the real world is full of dishonesty, and that Hundert has let life pass him by. The tirade is overheard by one of Sedgewick's young sons, who is shocked to learn the truth about his father. That evening, at the hotel bar, Hundert apologizes to Martin and admits that he gave his spot to Sedgewick in the competition years ago. Martin forgives him, but his body language makes his feelings toward Hundert ambiguous. The following morning, the resort is apparently empty; however, Hundert is then greeted by a surprise party, held in his honor by his former students, who present an award engraved with a quote about education. The men wave goodbye as the helicopter carrying Hundert departs, and he reflects that while he failed with Sedgewick, he succeeded with others. Hundert returns to his old job teaching classics in the present- day Saint Benedict's, which is now coeducational and more diverse. One student comes to class late: the son of Martin Blythe, who is seen outside the window, gladly waving to his old teacher. Hundert has the younger Blythe read the plaque above the door. CastReception The film received mixed reviews from critics. , the film holds a 50% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 127 reviews with an average rating on 5.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Though Kline is excellent in his portrayal of Hundert, the movie is too dull and sentimental to distinguish itself from other titles in its genre.\\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 49 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and praised the complexity of Hundert's flawed character, noting that as \\"a portrait of the escalator that speeds the sons of the rich upward toward power, it is unusually realistic\\", but The New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott was less impressed and suggested that Hundert \\"is less a person than a walking moral problem and is in fact more interesting as an ethical puzzle than as a psychological study\\".

Elementary particles, whose interactions are described by a gauge theory, interact with each other by the exchange of gauge bosons—usually as virtual particles. All known gauge bosons have a spin of 1; for comparison, the Higgs boson has spin zero. Therefore, all known gauge bosons are vector bosons. Gauge bosons are different from the other kinds of bosons: first, fundamental scalar bosons (the Higgs boson); second, mesons, which are composite bosons, made of quarks; third, larger composite, non- force-carrying bosons, such as certain atoms. Gauge bosons in the Standard Model The Standard Model of particle physics recognizes four kinds of gauge bosons: photons, which carry the electromagnetic interaction; W and Z bosons, which carry the weak interaction; and gluons, which carry the strong interaction. Isolated gluons do not occur because they are colour-charged and subject to colour confinement. Multiplicity of gauge bosons In a quantized gauge theory, gauge bosons are quanta of the gauge fields. Consequently, there are as many gauge bosons as there are generators of the gauge field. In quantum electrodynamics, the gauge group is U(1); in this simple case, there is only one gauge boson, the photon. In quantum chromodynamics, the more complicated group SU(3) has eight generators, corresponding to the eight gluons. The three W and Z bosons correspond (roughly) to the three generators of SU(2) in GWS theory. Massive gauge bosons For technical reasons involving gauge invariance, gauge bosons are described mathematically by field equations for massless particles. Therefore, at a naïve theoretical level, all gauge bosons are required to be massless, and the forces that they describe are required to be long-ranged. The conflict between this idea and experimental evidence that the weak and strong interactions have a very short range requires further theoretical insight. According to the Standard Model, the W and Z bosons gain mass via the Higgs mechanism. In the Higgs mechanism, the four gauge bosons (of SU(2)×U(1) symmetry) of the unified electroweak interaction couple to a Higgs field. This field undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the shape of its interaction potential. As a result, the universe is permeated by a nonzero Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV). This VEV couples to three of the electroweak gauge bosons (the Ws and Z), giving them mass; the remaining gauge boson remains massless (the photon). This theory also predicts the existence of a scalar Higgs boson, which has been observed in experiments at the LHC. Beyond the Standard Model=Grand unification theories The Georgi–Glashow model predicts additional gauge bosons named X and Y bosons. The hypothetical X and Y bosons mediate interactions between quarks and leptons, hence violating conservation of baryon number and causing proton decay. Such bosons would be even more massive than W and Z bosons due to symmetry breaking. Analysis of data collected from such sources as the Super- Kamiokande neutrino detector has yielded no evidence of X and Y bosons. Gravitons The fourth fundamental interaction, gravity, may also be carried by a boson, called the graviton. In the absence of experimental evidence and a mathematically coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unknown whether this would be a gauge boson or not. The role of gauge invariance in general relativity is played by a similar symmetry: diffeomorphism invariance. W' and Z' bosons W' and Z' bosons refer to hypothetical new gauge bosons (named in analogy with the Standard Model W and Z bosons).

The necklaces are assumed to be aperiodic (not consisting of repeated subsequences), and the counting is done \\"without flipping over\\" (without reversing the order of the beads). This counting function describes, among other things, the number of free Lie algebras and the number of irreducible polynomials over a finite field.  Definition The necklace polynomials are a family of polynomials M(\\\\alpha,n) in the variable \\\\alpha such that :\\\\alpha^n \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{d\\\\,\\\\,n} d \\\\, M(\\\\alpha, d). By Möbius inversion they are given by : M(\\\\alpha,n) \\\\ =\\\\ {1\\\\over n}\\\\sum_{d\\\\,\\\\,n}\\\\mu!\\\\left({n \\\\over d}\\\\right)\\\\alpha^d, where \\\\mu is the classic Möbius function. A closely related family, called the general necklace polynomial or general necklace-counting function, is: :N(\\\\alpha,n)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{dn} M(\\\\alpha,d)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{d\\\\,\\\\,n}\\\\phi!\\\\left({n \\\\over d}\\\\right)\\\\alpha^d, where \\\\phi is Euler's totient function. Applications The necklace polynomials M(\\\\alpha,n) appear as: * The number of aperiodic necklaces (or equivalently Lyndon words) which can be made by arranging n colored beads having α available colors. Two such necklaces are considered equal if they are related by a rotation (but not a reflection). Aperiodic refers to necklaces without rotational symmetry, having n distinct rotations. The polynomials N(\\\\alpha,n) give the number of necklaces including the periodic ones: this is easily computed using Pólya theory. * The dimension of the degree n piece of the free Lie algebra on α generators (\\"Witt's formula\\"). Here N(\\\\alpha,n) should be the dimension of the degree n piece of the corresponding free Jordan algebra. * The number of distinct words of length n in a Hall set. Note that the Hall set provides an explicit basis for a free Lie algebra; thus, this is the generalized setting for the above. * The number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree n over a finite field with α elements (when \\\\alpha=p^d is a prime power). Here N(\\\\alpha,n) is the number of polynomials which are primary (a power of an irreducible). * The exponent in the cyclotomic identity. Despite the fact that the polynomials appear in these various settings, the precise relationships between these remain mysterious or unknown. For example, there is no known bijection between the irreducible polynomials and the Lyndon words. Amy Glen, (2012) Combinatorics of Lyndon words, Melbourne talk Relations between M and N The polynomials for M and N are easily related in terms of Dirichlet convolution of arithmetic functions f(n)*g(n), regarding \\\\alpha as a constant. *The formula for M gives n\\\\,M(n) \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\mu(n)*\\\\alpha^n, *The formula for N gives n\\\\,N(n) \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\phi(n)*\\\\alpha^n \\\\,=\\\\, n*\\\\mu(n)*\\\\alpha^n. *Their relation gives N(n)\\\\,=\\\\,1*M(n) or equivalently n\\\\,N(n) \\\\,=\\\\, n*(n\\\\,M(n)), since n is completely multiplicative. Any two of these imply the third, for example: : n*\\\\mu(n)*\\\\alpha^n \\\\,=\\\\, n\\\\,N(n) \\\\,=\\\\, n*(n\\\\,M(n)) \\\\quad\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\mu(n)*\\\\alpha^n = n\\\\,M(n) by cancellation in the Dirichlet algebra. Examples : \\\\begin{array}{ccll} M(1,n) & = & 0 & \\\\text{ if }n>1 [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,1) & = & \\\\alpha [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,2) & = & \\\\tfrac12 (\\\\alpha^2-\\\\alpha) [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,3) & = & \\\\tfrac13 (\\\\alpha^3-\\\\alpha) [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,4) & = & \\\\tfrac14 (\\\\alpha^4-\\\\alpha^2) [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,5) & = & \\\\tfrac15(\\\\alpha^5-\\\\alpha) [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,6) & = & \\\\tfrac16(\\\\alpha^6-\\\\alpha^3-\\\\alpha^2+\\\\alpha) [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,p) & = & \\\\tfrac1p (\\\\alpha^{p}-\\\\alpha) & \\\\text{ if }p\\\\text{ is prime} [6pt] M(\\\\alpha,p^N) & = & \\\\tfrac1{p^N}(\\\\alpha^{p^N}-\\\\alpha^{p^{N-1}}) & \\\\text{ if }p\\\\text{ is prime} \\\\end{array} For \\\\alpha=2, starting with length zero, these form the integer sequence :1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 99, 186, 335, ...

Seward Johnson Jr. and Seward Johnson, was an American artist known for trompe l'oeil painted bronze statues. He was a grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, and of Colonel Thomas Melville Dill of Bermuda. He designed life-size bronze statues that were castings of living people, depicting them engaged in day-to-day activities. A large staff of technicians did the fabrication of the works he designed. Computers and digital technology often were used in the manufacturing process. Sometimes the manufacture was contracted in China. He was the founder of Grounds For Sculpture, a sculpture park and museum located in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey. Early life Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on April 16, 1930. His father was John Seward Johnson I, and his mother was Ruth Dill, the sister of actress Diana Dill, making him a first cousin of actor Michael Douglas. Johnson grew up with five siblings: Mary Lea Johnson Richards, Elaine Johnson, Diana Melville Johnson, Jennifer Underwood Johnson, and James Loring \\"Jimmy\\" Johnson. His parents divorced around 1937. His father remarried two years later, producing his only brother, Jimmy Johnson, making him an uncle to film director Jamie Johnson. Johnson attended Forman School for dyslexics. Later, he attended the University of Maine, where he majored in poultry husbandry, but did not graduate. Johnson also served four years in the United States Navy during the Korean War. Career Allow Me, Portland, Oregon Waiting, Sydney, Australia Johnson worked for Johnson & Johnson until 1962, when he was fired by his uncle Robert Wood Johnson II, who had turned the family business into one of the world's largest healthcare corporations. Johnson maintained a studio in Princeton, New Jersey and later, another at a site in Mercerville, New Jersey that formerly had been used for the New Jersey State Fair.Seward Johnson His early artistic efforts focused on painting, after which he turned to sculpture in 1968. Examples of his statues include: *Spring (1979), a bronze dedicated in 1979, set in the Crim Dell Woods section of the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. Other examples of Spring castings include the East Brunswick, New Jersey public library and the Fitton Center for Creative Arts in Hamilton, Ohio. *The Awakening (1980), his largest and most dramatic work, a five-part statue that depicts a giant trying to free himself from underground. The sculpture was located at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. for nearly twenty-eight years while still owned by Johnson. It was moved to Prince George's County, Maryland in February 2008 and an attempt was made by the new curator to correct some of the scale distortions of the original installation by altering some implied underground connections and placing the parts in different relationships to each other. * Double Check (1982), a statue of a businessman checking his attaché case, formerly located in Liberty Plaza Park across an intersection from the World Trade Center, as part of the public space required by a zoning variance granted to the developer of the adjoining skyscraper. Widely published photographs of the debris-battered and dust-covered statue, were taken following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The statue, scars and all, was returned to a prominent corner of the restored and renamed Zuccotti Park in 2006, again open to the public. Periodically, the statue has been adorned by tourists, pranksters, and even Occupy Wall Street protesters. * Hitchhiker (1983), a statue at Hofstra University, at the California Avenue gate, near a road leading away from campus. * Allow Me (Portland, Oregon) (1984), a statue of man holding an umbrella, in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon (part of the Allow Me series). * Competition (1984), a statue of Julie Wier, Fairview Heights, Illinois, chosen to represent the spirit of the people of St. Louis as winner of the \\"picture yourself as a work of art\\" contest. Dedicated on June 16, 1984 unsigned St. Louis County Library in St. Louis, Missouri. * Waiting (1988), at Australia Square, Sydney, Australia * Déjeuner Déjà Vu (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, a facility founded by Johnson, is a three-dimensional restaging of Édouard Manet's painting, Le déjeuner sur l'herbePage on Johnson's site Unconditional Surrender, Saratosa, Florida * Copyright Infringement (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture (a facility founded by Johnson) is a sculpture that he named to flaunt his disdain for criticism of his copies of the iconic works of fine art artists with international recognition. It represents the fine artist Edouard Manet, whose work he has copied. * Unconditional Surrender (a series with several material versions begun in 2005), a spokesperson for Johnson has stated that this series is based on a photograph that is in the public domain, Kissing the War Goodbye, by Victor Jorgensen,Robert L. Pincus, \\"Port surrenders in the battle against kitsch \\", San Diego Union-Tribune, March 11, 2007. however, the Jorgensen photographic image does not extend low enough to include the lower legs and shoes of the subjects, revealed in Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous photograph, V–J day in Times Square, that are represented identically in the statue. A spokesperson for Life has called it a copyright infringement of the latter image. Nonetheless, the first version, a bronze statue in life-size, was placed on temporary exhibition during the 2005 anniversary of V-J Day at the Times Square Information Center near where the original photographs were taken in Manhattan.\\"V-J Day Is Replayed, but the Lip-Lock's Tamer This Time\\", New York Times, August 15, 2005. :Several slightly differing twenty-five-foot-versions have been constructed in styrofoam and aluminum with little detail, painted, and put on display by Johnson in San Diego, California, Key West, Florida, Snug Harbor in New York, and Sarasota, Florida. Their immensity has drawn crowds of viewers at each site although the view of them from nearby is severely limited, essentially allowing a vista of the legs and up the skirt. The statues have been described as kitsch by one critic. Johnson later would dub the statue \\"Embracing Peace\\",Martinez, Alanna, Monumental—and Controversial—’Kissing Sailor’ Sculpture Comes to Times Square, Observer, August 12, 2015 which he treated as a double entendre when spoken. :A proposal to establish a permanent location for a copy on the Sarasota bay front generated a heated controversy about the suitability of the statue to the location, suitability as a military service memorial, the permanent placement of any statue on that public property, as well as the particular issues of lack of originality, mechanical construction, copyright infringement, and the kitsch allegations about the statue. In final agreement documents with the purchaser (a private person), Johnson committed the purchase price to cover copyright liability damages in order to have the statue placed. The city was wary of accepting a gift from the purchaser that might result in a financial loss from a possible legal battle that evidenced merit, according to the city attorney. :In October 2014, French feminist group Osez La Feminisme ! petitioned to have a copy of the statue, erected at a World War II memorial in Normandy in September 2014, removed and sent back to the United States, criticizing it as \\"immortali[zing] a sexual assault\\" Big Sister, Brisbane, Australia * Big Sister, just outside the Pig 'N' Whistle pub and Michael's Restaurant at 123 Eagle Street, part of the Celebrating the Familiar series * First Ride (2006), a statue of a father helping his young daughter learn to ride a bike, in Carmel, Indiana. Newspaper Reader, Lancaster, Pennsylvania * Newspaper Reader, at the entrance to Steinman Park, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. * Forever Marilyn (June 2011), a , 17-ton representation of Marilyn Monroe standing over a gusty subway grate in her appearance in The Seven Year Itch. Until 2012, the statue was located at Pioneer Court in Chicago, where it attracted many visitors and some controversy for its risque features.Bishoff, Dan, Grounds for Sculpture opens Seward Johnson exhibit that's larger than life, NJ.com for Star-Ledger, May 4, 2014, with images It was moved to downtown Palm Springs, California in 2012. In July 2013 plans were announced that it would be moved to New Jersey for a 2014 exhibit honoring Johnson at the Grounds For Sculpture. * Magic Fountain, New Brunswick, New JerseyMagic Fountain stands outside The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The fountain features metallic children playing in the fountain and splashing around. For statues made in a series named, Iconic, by Johnson, many of which are very large, a computer program is employed that translates two-dimensional images into statues that are constructed by a machine driven by the program. Often, these subjects are images that already are well known as the works of others, generating heated ethical controversies regarding copyright infringement and derivative works due to substantial similarity issues. Johnson's works were selected by the United States Information Agency to represent the freedoms of the United States in a public and private partnership enterprise representation sponsored by General Motors and many other US corporations at the World EXPO celebration in Seville, Spain during 1992. Criticism Johnson's work was labeled as \\"kitsch\\" in a 1984 article by an art professor and critic at Princeton University, who explained its rejection as he was commenting on a controversy raging about the work in New Haven, Connecticut. His 2003 show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Beyond the Frame: Impressionism Revisited, which presented his statues imitating famous Impressionist paintings, was a success with audiences, but was panned nationally by acknowledged art critics such as Blake Gopnik writing for the Washington Post and drew strong criticism from curators at other museums about a prominent museum of fine art presenting an exhibit of his work. Philanthropy Johnson was the chairman and CEO of The Atlantic Foundation, the foundation created by his father, John Seward Johnson I, in 1963. Johnson created the Johnson Atelier Technical Institute of Sculpture, an educational, nonprofit casting and fabrication facility in 1974 as a means of fostering young sculptors' talents, while creating a foundry designed to construct his statues that is so well-equipped and staffed that it is chosen by many renowned sculptors. Educational programs at the Atelier ceased in 2004. The Johnson Atelier now operates as a division of The Sculpture Foundation. Johnson continued to make his sculpture at the facility but casting often was performed off premises, with some of his larger works being cast in the Peoples Republic of China. He also founded an organization named \\"The Sculpture Foundation\\", to promote his works. In 1987, he published Celebrating the Familiar: The Sculpture of J. Seward Johnson, Jr. Under Johnson's direction, The Atlantic Foundation purchased the old New Jersey Fairgrounds in Hamilton, New Jersey and in 1992 founded the Grounds For Sculpture to display work completed at the Johnson Atelier and other outdoor exhibitions. In 2000 park operations were transferred to a new public charity with the same intent that continues to operate the park. He was president of the International Sculpture Center of Hamilton, New Jersey, which publishes a magazine out of offices in Washington, D.C. Johnson also was the president of a large oceanographic research institution in Florida that had been founded by his father. The institution published a science magazine. Johnson and his wife funded the construction of The Joyce and Seward Johnson Theater for the Theater for the New City, an Off- Broadway theater in New York City. Personal life Johnson was excluded from his father's will, which left the bulk of his fortune to Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his father's wife and former chambermaid. He and his siblings sued on grounds that their father wasn't mentally competent at the time he signed the will. It was settled out of court, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune. Johnson was formerly married to Barbara Kline. She often engaged in extramarital affairs in their home, driving Johnson to attempt suicide. In 1965, he acknowledged paternity to Jenia Anne \\"Cookie\\" Johnson to speed up the divorce process. Years later, Johnson's family had a legal battle regarding Cookie Johnson's eligibility for a share in the Johnson & Johnson fortune. The court ruled in favor of Cookie. Johnson later married Joyce Horton, a novelist. They had two children, John Seward Johnson III and actress Clelia Constance Johnson, who is credited as \\"India Blake.\\" Johnson died from cancer at his home in Key West, Florida on March 10, 2020.

He took his seat in a by-election, winning with a majority of just 1.72%; in his last election before retiring, he won it by a majority of 36.4%. Early career The final form of his seat in the Commons (which includes Worksop and Retford), the northern quarter of Nottinghamshire near to Sheffield and Doncaster. He held it from 1968 until 2001 Ashton was born and brought up in Sheffield; he attended High Storrs Grammar School and Rotherham Technical College. Before he was elected as an MP, he was a Sheffield City Councillor beginning in 1962. Parliament Ashton was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw in a by- election in 1968, when he struggled to hold the seat (which had been Labour- held since 1929) at a time when the government of Harold Wilson was unpopular. The close result saw it become a marginal seat, won by Ashton with a majority of just 740 (1.72%). The previous MP, Captain Fred Bellenger was said to have built a personal vote through his Labour canvassing, and in the local newspapers. Having been an MP since 1935, Bellenger died mid-term in May 1968 at the age of 73. He had just been awarded the Freedom of Worksop (a town in the constituency) two days before his death. Bellenger was among those deselected for any future election, however, for defying the party whip for his support of the purported continued government of the White Rhodesians and privatisation of steel (which the Labour government nationalised in 1967 as British Steel Corporation). Pit closures were an important issue in a seat with a large mining sector vote. Ashton argued that the Labour government's approach, which included redundancy payments to miners over the age of 55, was better than the terms of the Conservatives when they were in power (1951-1964). The town of Worksop has a train repair depot and the Chesterfield Canal In 1974, when corruption allegations about MPs were circulating, Ashton gave an interview to the Labour Party newspaper Labour Weekly. Seeking to defend MPs in general, Ashton insisted that the number who were guilty of corruption \\"could be counted on the fingers of one hand\\". This statement backfired, as newspapers demanded that he name the guilty five MPs. In the late 1970s, Ashton served as a junior minister in the government of James Callaghan. In 1977, Ashton published Grass Roots,Grass Roots (Quartet Books) a novel about a tough steelworker who becomes a rebellious Labour MP. The Times called it \\"the clearest guide to British party politics since Phineas Finn\\", while The Guardian said it was \\"packed with detail, as rich as a slice of fruit-cake, and as vivid and exciting as an eve-of-poll rally\\". After his party went into opposition in 1979, he was among Labour backbencher columnists in the Daily Star. Ashton saw himself as the shop steward for the Parliamentary Labour Party. When left-wing activists in the party demanded that sitting MPs submit themselves to their local party members for re- selection in each Parliament, he made a strong speech at the Labour Party conference expressly pleading to save the jobs and livelihoods of Labour MPs. He pointed to infighting suiting the Tories, and the large number of Labour MPs who had died of stress-related illness, linking it to pressure from their local parties. Later life In March 1999, Northamptonshire's Chief Constable noted that Ashton had given misleading information to officers when in the same premises of the arrests of the perpetrators of immigration and sexual offences at a Northampton Thai massage parlour. This occurred during a police raid in November 1998. He was interviewed voluntarily and not accused of committing any offence. Ashton threatened to raise a data protection complaint. The police robustly denied that it had leaked Ashton's name; their statement said, \\"there were a great many other people with knowledge of this case - defendants, witnesses, legal representatives, other organisations and other individuals.\\" A director of Sheffield Wednesday football club since 1990, he resigned as a director shortly after his presence at the parlour was established. Following his retirement at the 2001 general election, he was succeeded by John Mann. In 2007, Ashton was appointed an OBE. Ashton was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament's oral history project. His memoir, Red Rose Blues, was published in 2000. Death He died from dementia in March 2020, aged 86. He is survived by his daughter, Lucy.

Doctor of Science (), usually abbreviated Sc.D., D.Sc., S.D., or D.S., is an academic research degree awarded in a number of countries throughout the world. In some countries, \\"Doctor of Science\\" is the degree used for the standard doctorate in the sciences; elsewhere the Sc.D. is a \\"higher doctorate\\" awarded in recognition of a substantial and sustained contribution to scientific knowledge beyond that required for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). It may also be awarded as an honorary degree.  Africa = Algeria and Morocco  In Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia, all universities accredited by the state award a \\"Doctorate\\" in all fields of science and humanities, equivalent to a PhD in the United Kingdom or United States. Some universities in these four Arab countries award a \\"Doctorate of the State\\" in some fields of study and science. A \\"Doctorate of the State\\" is slightly higher in esteem than a regular doctorate, and is awarded after performing additional in-depth post- doctorate research or achievement.  Asia = Japan  Similar to the situation in the US, Japanese universities offer both the Ph.D. and the Sc.D. as initial doctorates in science.  India  In India only few prestigious universities offer Sc.D./D.Sc.in science and obtained in Graduate School after satisfactory evaluation of knowledge, research accomplishment, and the defense. The oldest institute to award D.Sc. degree in India is Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta.https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf  Thailand  Higher education institutes in Thailand generally grant Ph.D. for research doctoral degree, except some universities such as Chulalongkorn University award D.Sc. In exception, Mahidol University can grant both Ph.D. and D.Sc. Doctoral students in Faculty of Science are always awarded Ph.D., but some other programs award D.Sc.  Uzbekistan  The higher education institutes in Uzbekistan also grant D.Sc. degrees. As an example, the National University of Uzbekistan and the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences offer D.Sc. in various fields.  Europe = Austria, Germany, and Switzerland  In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the most common doctoral degrees in Natural Sciences are the following: * Dr rer. nat.: Doctor rerum naturalium, literally \\"Doctor of the things of nature\\" * Dr rer. medic.: Doctor rerum medicarum, Doctor of medical sciences * Dr sc. nat.: Doktor der Naturwissenschaften, Doctor of Natural Sciences * Dr sc. ETH: Doktor der Naturwissenschaften ETH, Doctor of Natural Sciences, awarded by ETH Zurich, Switzerland. * Dr phil. nat.: Doctor philosophiae naturalis, used only by Goethe University Frankfurt instead of Dr rer. nat; Doctor of Natural Sciences, awarded by Swiss universities. * Dr.-Ing.: Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften (Doctor of Engineering), awarded by German universities in areas of technology and engineering. * Dr mont.: Doctor rerum montanarum, awarded by the University of Leoben instead of Dr techn. * Dr techn.: Doctor technicae, awarded by Austrian technical universities. In these countries there are some related doctoral degrees with very similar names, these are the: * Dr sc. agr.: Doctor scientiarum agrariarum, Doctor of Agricultural science * Dr sc. hum.: Doctor scientiarum humanarum, Doctor of Humanistic Sciences * Dr sc. inf.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum, Doctor of Science in Informatics * Dr sc. inf.med.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum medicæ, Doctor of Science in Medical Informatics * Dr sc. inf.biomed.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum biomedicæ, Doctor of Science in Biomedical Informatics * Dr sc. math.: Doctor scientiarum mathematicarum, Doctor of Mathematics * Dr scient. med.: Doctor scientiæ medicæ, Doctor of Medical Sciences * Dr sc. mus.: Doctor scientiae musicae, Doctor of Musicology * Dr sc. oec.: Doctor scientiarum oeconomicarum, Doctor of Economics * Dr sc. pol.: Doctor scientiarum politicarum, Doctor of Political Sciences * Dr rer. pol.: Doctor rerum politicarum, Doctor of economics, business administration, or political science * Dr sc. soc.: Doctor scientiae socialis, Doctor of Social Sciences All these doctoral degrees are equivalent to the Ph.D. or Sc.D. of the American system. Until German Reunification, universities in East Germany also awarded the Dr.Sc. However, the East German Dr.Sc. was not equivalent to the Ph.D. since it was adopted to replace the German Habilitation and therefore was equivalent to this higher-level qualification. After reunification the Habilitation was reintroduced at universities in Eastern Germany. The procedure of habilitation is normally required to receive officially the \\"venia docendi\\", which entitles the candidate to lecture at universities (Privatdozent, for men, or Privatdozentin, for women). The academic degree after the successful habilitation is e.g. Dr. rer.nat. habil., by adding the suffix \\"habil.\\" to the earlier received Doctors degree. In Switzerland, the Dr sc. is a doctoral degree awarded only by the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (EPFL and ETHZ), the University of Fribourg and the Department of Informatics of the University of Zurich. The Swiss Dr sc., like the D.Sc. in the US, is equivalent to the PhD. It is earned with the approval of a committee on the basis of original research, publications, and extensive applied professional contributions and is awarded in doctoral level science and technology programs. Since 2004 the Dr sc. is the only doctoral degree awarded by the ETH Zurich. The École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne awards the degree Docteur ès sciences, abbreviated Dr ès sc.and translated into English as PhD.Ordinance on the doctorate conferred by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (English translation ), Federal Chancellery of Switzerland, 1 September 2008 (page visited on 5 July 2017).  Poland  In Poland \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" or \\"Habilitation\\" ( or in Polish language) is the degree higher than Ph.D. and it is awarded for substantial accomplishments in teaching, research and service after getting the Ph.D. degree (usually up to 8 years after Ph.D.). It is very similar to the equivalent habilitation degree in Germany and Austria. The highest scientific degree in Poland is \\"professorship\\" or \\"full professor\\" (), which is called a scientific title of professor. \\"Habilitation\\" has been a mandatory requirement for many years to apply for full professorship in Poland.  United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan and the Commonwealth  In Ireland, the United Kingdom and the countries of the Commonwealth, such as India (in the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay), the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD) is one of the Higher Doctorates. In some older universities it typically has precedence after Divinity, Laws or Civil Law, Medicine, and Letters, and above Music. The degree is conferred on a member of the university who has a proven record of internationally recognised scholarship. A candidate for the degree will usually be required to submit a selection of their publications to the board of the appropriate faculty, which will decide if the candidate merits this accolade. The award or obtaining of a regular PhD degree is not in any way a pre-requisite for obtaining a DSc, as, for example, it can happen in the sciences that an academic who does a lot of publishing can be awarded a DSc without ever having done a PhD degree. The first University to admit an individual to this degree was the University of London in 1860.Pages xiii and xiv of The University of London and the World of Learning, 1836–1986 by Francis Michael Longstreth Thompson. Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 1990 In 1893 Maria Gordon (née Ogilvie), was the first woman to receive this degree. In former times the doctorate in science was regarded as a greater distinction than a professorial chair and hence a professor who was also a D.Sc. would be known as Doctor. The Doctor of Science may also be awarded as an honorary degree, that is, given to individuals who have made extensive contributions to a particular field and not for specific academic accomplishments. It is usual to signify this by adding D.Sc. h.c. (for honoris causa).  Other European Union countries  In the Czech Republic and Slovakia \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" (DrSc. behind the name), established in 1953, is equivalent to the degree of Doctor of Science in the sense in which the D.Sc. is used in the Commonwealth. It is the highest academic qualification, different from both Ph.D. and PhDr. titles. In the Czech Republic, DrSc. has not been awarded since 2001; instead, since 2006, a \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" degree (DSc. behind the name) has been awarded, not by universities but by the Czech Academy of Sciences mostly for research in the field of natural or formal science. In Slovakia, \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" (Dr.Sc.) is awarded by the Slovak Academy of Sciences. In Hungary, \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" (D.Sc.) is awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In Finland, most doctoral degrees awarded in the fields of natural sciences, technology and economics are termed D.Sc. degrees in English, with a suffix indicating the field of study. However, there is no translation of the term Doctor of Science to Finnish. For example, the proper translation for the doctorate in technology (tekniikan tohtori) would be D.Sc. (Tech.), whereas a doctorate in economics and business administration (kauppatieteiden tohtori) would be translated as D.Sc. (Econ.). When conversing or writing in English, the prefix Dr may be used to address a holder of a doctoral degree awarded in Finland. The degrees are equivalent to filosofian tohtori (FT, English: PhD), but FT is usually awarded only in general sciences, not in specializations like engineering, economics or medicine. In France, the Doctor of Sciences degree (doctorat ès sciences also called doctorat d'État) was a higher doctorate in the fields of experimental and natural sciences, superseded in 1984 by the habilitation. In Denmark, Dr Scient. is a higher doctorate. In Bulgaria, PhD is the highest education level and first science degree. Doctor of Science is the second and the highest science degree.  Other European countries  In the former Yugoslavia, (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Slovenia, North Macedonia),Yugoslavia title doktor nauka or doktor znanosti (literally \\"doctor of science\\") is used in a much broader sense than D.Sc., simply referring to a field of academic study – from art history (doktor znanosti/nauka povijesti umjetnosti), philosophy (doktor znanosti/nauka filozofije), and literary studies (doktor znanosti/nauka književnosti) to hard sciences such as molecular biology (doktor znanosti/nauka molekularne biologije). It is therefore formally recognized as a Ph.D. degree. Starting in 2016, in Ukraine Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, ) is the highest education level and first science degree. \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" (DSc. ) is the second and the highest science degree, awarded in recognition of a substantial contribution to scientific knowledge, origination of new directions and visions in science. A PhD degree is a prerequisite for heading a university department in Ukraine. In Belarus \\"Doctor of Sciences\\" (D.Sc., ) is the highest level of education that follows a PhD. Is awarded by The Higher Attestation Commission under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.  North America = United States  In the United States, the formally recognized traditional Doctor of Science is an academic research doctoral degree awarded by research universities. The academic research Sc.D. (or D.Sc.) is considered by both the United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation to be equivalent to the more commonly awarded Ph.D. The first North American Sc.D. was inaugurated by Harvard University in 1872, when graduate studies first began at Harvard, and where the Ph.D. and Sc.D. degrees were introduced in the same year. The Doctor of Science research degree is earned with the formal dissertation defense and approval of a committee on the basis of original research and publications, and it is awarded predominantly in doctoral-level science programs, such as engineering, medical and health sciences, and health economics. Although rarer than the Doctor of Philosophy, the Doctor of Science research degree has been awarded by institutions such as Columbia University, Bowie State University, The George Washington University (although as of 2011 the University decided to offer only the more widely recognized Ph.D. degree), Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Robert Morris University, Towson University,Information Technology Doctor of Science. Towson University. 2013 Tulane University., University of Baltimore,, Marymount University \\" Catalog 2019-2020\\" http://marymount.smartcatalogiq.com/2019-2020 . Accessed 2020 January 22., and Capitol Technology University. A few university doctoral research programs offer both the Sc.D. and Ph.D. degrees in the same academic field, such as Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with identical requirements for obtaining either. Currently, research programs that offer the formal research Sc.D. but not the Ph.D. degree for a given field include several doctoral programs at Harvard University, Boston University, Capitol Technology University,Capitol Technology University . Accessed 2017 July 2.The Doctor of Science (DSc) degree is offered in Information Assurance. Capitol College 2012—2013 Catalog, p. 56. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and Dakota State University. The University of Baltimore, School of Information Arts and Technologies offers an Sc.D. degree in Information and Interaction Design, a program focused on usable design/user experience (UX) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). There are programs where the Sc.D. and Ph.D. have different degree requirements, though the two degrees are officially considered equivalent. The Engineering school at Washington University in St. Louis, for example, requires four more graduate courses, which can be completed in one year in conjunction with research duties, in the D.Sc. program than the Ph.D. degree, while the Ph.D requires teaching assistance services. The Johns Hopkins University also offers both Ph.D. and Sc.D. in certain programs, with only minor differences in university administration of the degrees. In some institutions, the Sc.D. has been converted to the Ph.D. For instance, the doctoral degree in biostatistics at Harvard recently converted from Sc.D. to Ph.D., even though the doctoral degree structure and requirements have remained identical. In addition, some institutions offer Doctor of Science degrees through distance learning. They include Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions in Health Science, Aspen University in computer science, Jacksonville State University in emergency management and Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership in Jewish studies.  Mexico  In Mexico the PhD level is considered a doctoral degree (level 8) similar to the doctorate degrees in Canada and the United States. The Doctor of Sciences degree is instead recognized as a Higher Degree (Grado Proprio).  Russia and other post-Soviet states  In Russia and various other post-Soviet states, as well as in some of the former Communist Bloc countries, the status of Russian Doktor nauk (literally 'Doctor of Sciences') is a post-doctoral degree. The degree has no American equivalent but rather is similar to German Habilitation.  South America = Argentina  In Argentina the formal title Doctor of Science would be attributed to different fields of the hard or soft sciences. To get into an Argentine Ph.D. program the applicant must have experience in research and at least an Engineering, Licentiate or master's degree:Doctorate in Sciences at the Latin American docta serch:Doctorado Ciencias = Applied sciences = * Doctorate of Agronomic Sciences (University of Buenos Aires, NU of LP, NU of C, NU of R, NU of MP, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Sciences in Lacteal Technology (NU of the L) * Doctorate of Sciences in Material Technology (NU of the S, NU of MP) * Doctorate of Computer Sciences (University of Buenos Aires, NU of C, NU of SL, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Engineering Sciences (NU of C, NU of Cu, NU of RC, NU of the S, ITBA) * Doctorate of Geological Sciences (NU of C, NU of Cu, NU of SJ, NU of SL, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Informatics Sciences (NU of LP) * Doctorate of Basic Sciences Applied (NU of Q) * Doctorate of Science and Technology (NU of GS) * Doctorate of Geological Sciences (University of Buenos Aires) * Doctorate of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NU of SAM) * Doctorate of Systems Control (NU of the S) * Doctorate of Economics Sciences (NU of LM) * Doctorate of Economy (NU of LP, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Geography (NU of the S) * Doctorate of History (NU of the S) * Doctorate of Chemical Engineering (NU of the S) = Basic sciences = * Doctorate of Biological Sciences (U of BA, NU of LP, NU of C, NU of R, NU of the L, NU of Cu, NU of RC, NU of MP, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Biological Chemistry Sciences (U of BA, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Molecular Biology Sciences (U of BA) * Doctorate of Mathematics Sciences (U of BA, NU of LP, NU of SL, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Chemistry Sciences (NU of LP, NU of R, NU of C, NU of RC, NU of MP, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Physics Sciences (U of BA, NU of LP, NU of MP, NU of SAM, NU of the S) * Doctorate of Natural Sciences (U of BA, NU of LP) * Doctorate of Philosophy (NU of the S)  Brazil  In Brazil only the Doctor in Sciences (D.Sc.) category is recognized as a higher doctorate, generally followed by the concentration area (program field). This kind of doctorate is obtained in Graduate School after satisfactory evaluation of knowledge, research accomplishment, and thesis defense. This doctorate is comparable to a Ph.D. program found in other countries. In the state of São Paulo, the doctorate title is the second highest academic title given by the state's universities (University of São Paulo (USP), State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and São Paulo State University (UNESP)) and most Federal Universities, such as the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The highest academic title is the Livre-Docência, which is not equivalent to the German Habilitation, since \\"Livre-Docência\\" is not a requisite to be a professor in Brazilian universities, and German Habilitation is a requisite to be a professor in German universities.

Of the $4.88 billion allocated by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, $27 million was approved for the employment of artists, musicians, actors and writers under the WPA's Federal Project Number One. In its prime, Federal Project Number One employed up to 40,000 writers, musicians, artists and actors because, as Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins put it, “Hell, they’ve got to eat, too”. This project had two main principles: 1) that in time of need the artist, no less than the manual worker, is entitled to employment as an artist at the public expense and 2) that the arts, no less than business, agriculture, and labor, are and should be the immediate concern of the ideal commonwealth. The five divisions of Federal One were these: *Federal Art Project *Federal Music Project *Federal Theatre Project *Federal Writers' Project *Historical Records Survey (originally part of the Federal Writers' Project) All projects were supposed to operate without discrimination regarding race, creed, color, religion, or political affiliation. Federal Project Number One ended in 1939 when, under pressure from Congress, the theater project was cancelled and the other projects were required to rely on state funding and local sponsorship.  Controversy  Many people were opposed to government involvement in the arts. They feared that government funding and influence would lead to censorship and a violation of freedom of speech. Members of the House Un- American Activities Committee believed the program to be infiltrated by communists. However, with support from Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt signed the executive order to create this project because the government wanted to support, as Fortune magazine stated, “the kind of raw cultural material--the raw material of new creative work-- which is so necessary to artists and particularly to artists in a new country”.  Legacy  An example of one of the Federal Writers' Project's books. As previously mentioned, at its peak Federal One employed 40,000 writers, musicians, artists and actors and the Federal Writers' project had around 6,500 people on the WPA payroll. Many people benefitted from these programs and some FWP writers became famous, such as John Steinbeck and Zora Neale Hurston. These writers were considered to be federal writers. Furthermore, these projects also published books such as New York Panorama and the WPA Guide to New York City.

The London deep-level shelters are eight deep-level air-raid shelters that were built under London Underground stations during World War II. Background Each shelter consists of a pair of parallel tunnels in diameter and long. Each tunnel is subdivided into two decks, and each shelter was designed to hold up to 8,000 people. It was planned that after the war the shelters would be used as part of new express tube lines paralleling parts of the existing Northern and Central lines. Existing tube lines typically had diameter running tunnels and about at stations; thus the shelter tunnels would not have been suitable as platform tunnels and were constructed at stations the new lines would have bypassed. However, they would have been suitable as running tunnels for main-line size trains. (One existing tube, the Northern City Line opened in 1904, used a similar size of tunnel for this reason, although in fact main-line trains did not use it until 1976.) Ten shelters were originally planned, holding 100,000 people — 10,000 in each shelter. However the final capacity was around 8,000 people in each shelter, and only eight were completed: at Chancery Lane station on the Central line and Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Stockwell, Clapham North, Clapham Common, and Clapham South on the Northern line. The other two were to be at St. Paul's station on the Central line which was not built due to concern about the stability of the buildings above, and Oval station on the Northern line due to difficult ground conditions encountered as the work started. The working shaft for the shelter at Oval now functions as a ventilation shaft for the station. The shelters were started in 1940 during the Blitz in response to public demand to shelter in the London Underground stations. However, they were not completed until 1942 after the Blitz was over, so they were initially all used by the government, but as bombing intensified five of them were opened to the public in 1944: Stockwell, Clapham North, Camden Town, Belsize Park and Clapham South. The Goodge Street shelter was used by General Eisenhower, and the Chancery Lane shelter was used as a communications centre.  Post-war use  One of the entrances to the Stockwell shelter now decorated as a war memorial After the war, the Goodge Street shelter continued to be used by the army until a fire on the night of 21 May 1956, after which the government decided the shelters were not suitable for use by large numbers of the public or military. The Chancery Lane shelter was converted into Kingsway telephone exchange. One of the entrances to Clapham South in 2009. It has since been incorporated into a new residential development. In 1948 the Clapham South shelter was used to house 200 of the first immigrants from the West Indies who had arrived on the MV Empire Windrush for four weeks until they found their own accommodation. In 1951, it became the Festival Hotel providing cheap stay for visitors to the Festival of Britain, but was closed after the aforementioned fire in the Goodge Street shelter. The shelter was used for archival storage for some years, but is now a Grade II listed building with pre-booked tours arranged by the London Transport Museum. The Clapham North shelter was purchased in 2014 by the Zero Carbon Food company, who use the shelter as a hydroponic farm. All the other shelters were sold by the government to Transport for London in the 1990s and several are still leased out for archival storage. Trivia The Goodge Street shelter appeared in studio mock-up form in the 1968 BBC Doctor Who story The Web of Fear. The surface entrance to the Goodge Street shelter appears as itself in the 1988 feature film Hidden City, written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, although interiors were actually shot at Clapham South. The Camden Town shelter was used to represent parts of Oval tube station in the 1976 two-part story The Lights of London in the BBC television series Survivors. The director of the second episode was Pennant Roberts, who subsequently directed the 1977 Doctor Who story The Sun Makers, in which the same shelter was used for scenes set in tunnels under Pluto. Roberts subsequently worked on the BBC series Blake's 7, in which the shelter was used for the interior of the titular artificial planet in the 1980 story Ultraworld, although the episode itself was directed by Vere Lorrimer. The shelter was also used to represent parts of a secret underground facility in the vicinity of Down Street tube station in the 2005 feature film Creep.

Set in New Orleans and on the Louisiana Gulf coast at the end of the 19th century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle between her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South. It is one of the earliest American novels that focuses on women's issues without condescension. It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism, generating a mixed reaction from contemporary readers and critics. The novel's blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes The Awakening a precursor of American modernist literature; it prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern works of Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams. Summary The novel opens with the Pontellier family—Léonce, a New Orleans businessman of Louisiana Creole heritage; his wife Edna; and their two sons, Etienne and Raoul—vacationing on Grand Isle at a resort on the Gulf of Mexico managed by Madame Lebrun and her two sons, Robert and Victor. Edna spends most of her time with her close friend Adèle Ratignolle, who cheerily and boisterously reminds Edna of her duties as a wife and mother. At Grand Isle, Edna eventually forms a connection with Robert Lebrun, a charming, earnest young man who actively seeks Edna's attention and affections. When they fall in love, Robert senses the doomed nature of such a relationship and flees to Mexico under the guise of pursuing a nameless business venture. The narrative focus moves to Edna's shifting emotions as she reconciles her maternal duties with her desire for social freedom and to be with Robert. When summer vacation ends, the Pontelliers return to New Orleans. Edna gradually reassesses her priorities and takes a more active role in her own happiness. She starts to isolate herself from New Orleans society and to withdraw from some of the duties traditionally associated with motherhood. Léonce eventually talks to a doctor about diagnosing his wife, fearing she is losing her mental faculties. The doctor advises Léonce to let her be and assures him that things will return to normal. When Léonce prepares to travel to New York City on business, he sends the boys to his mother. Being left home alone for an extended period gives Edna physical and emotional room to breathe and reflect on various aspects of her life. While her husband is still away, she moves out of their home and into a small bungalow nearby and begins a dalliance with Alcée Arobin, a persistent suitor with a reputation for being free with his affections. Edna is shown as a sexual being for the first time in the novel, but the affair proves awkward and emotionally fraught. Edna also reaches out to Mademoiselle Reisz, a gifted pianist whose playing is renowned but who maintains a generally hermetic existence. Her playing had moved Edna profoundly earlier in the novel, representing what Edna was starting to long for: independence. Mademoiselle Reisz focuses her life on music and herself instead of on society's expectations, acting as a foil to Adèle Ratignolle, who encourages Edna to conform. Reisz is in contact with Robert while he is in Mexico, receiving letters from him regularly. Edna begs Reisz to reveal their contents, which she does, proving to Edna that Robert is thinking about her. Eventually, Robert returns to New Orleans. At first aloof (and finding excuses not to be near Edna), he eventually confesses his passionate love for her. He admits that the business trip to Mexico was an excuse to escape a relationship that would never work. Edna is called away to help Adèle with a difficult childbirth. Adèle pleads with Edna to think of what she would be turning her back on if she did not behave appropriately. When Edna returns home, she finds a note from Robert stating that he has left forever, as he loves her too much to shame her by engaging in a relationship with a married woman. In devastated shock, Edna rushes back to Grand Isle, where she had first met Robert Lebrun. Edna escapes in an ultimate manner by committing suicide, drowning herself in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Chopin, Kate. The Awakening.

Robert's flirting with Edna catalyzes her \\"awakening\\", and she sees in him what has been missing in her marriage. Style Kate Chopin's narrative style in The Awakening can be categorized as naturalism. Chopin's novel bears the hallmarks of French short story writer Guy de Maupassant's style: a perceptive focus on human behavior and the complexities of social structures. This demonstrates Chopin's admiration for Maupassant, yet another example of the enormous influence Maupassant exercised on nineteenth-century literary realism. However, Chopin's style could more accurately be described as a hybrid that captures contemporary narrative currents and looks forward to various trends in Southern and European literature. Mixed into Chopin's overarching nineteenth-century realism is an incisive and often humorous skewering of upper-class pretension, reminiscent of direct contemporaries such as Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Edith Wharton, and George Bernard Shaw. Also evident in The Awakening is the future of the Southern novel as a distinct genre, not only in setting and subject matter but in narrative style. Chopin's lyrical portrayal of her protagonist's shifting emotions is a narrative technique that Faulkner would expand upon in novels like Absalom, Absalom! and The Sound and the Fury. Chopin portrays her experiences of the Creole lifestyle, in which women were under strict rules and limited to the role of wife and mother, which influenced her \\"local color\\" fiction and focus on the Creole culture. Chopin adopted this style in her early short stories and her first novel At Fault, which also deals with some of the issues of Creole lifestyle. By using characters of French descent, she was able to get away with publishing these stories, because the characters were viewed as \\"foreign\\", without her readers being as shocked as they were when Edna Pontellier, a white Protestant, strays from the expectations of society. The plot anticipated the stories of Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor and the plays of William Inge, while Edna Pontellier's emotional crises and her eventual tragic fall look ahead to the complex female characters of Tennessee Williams's plays. Chopin's own life, particularly in terms of having her own sense of identity—aside from men and her children—inspired The Awakening. Her upbringing also shaped her views, as she lived with her widowed mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, all of whom were intellectual, independent women. After her father was killed on All Saints' Day and her brother died from typhoid on Mardi Gras, Chopin became skeptical of religion, a view that she presents through Edna, who finds church \\"suffocating\\". Being widowed and left with six children to look after influenced Chopin's writing, which she began at this time. Emily Toth argues against the view that Chopin was ostracized from St. Louis after the publication of The Awakening, stating that many St. Louis women praised her; male critics condemned her novel.Kate Chopin, The Awakening: An authoritative text Biographical and historical contexts criticism, ed. By Margo Culley, (University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994), pp. 113–119 Aspects of Chopin's style also prefigure the intensely lyrical and experimental style of novelists such as Virginia Woolf and the unsentimental focus on female intellectual and emotional growth in the novels of Sigrid Undset and Doris Lessing. Chopin's most important stylistic legacy is the detachment of the narrator.  Symbolism  Birds – In the beginning of the book, a caged parrot is shouting to Mr. Pontellier \\"Allez vous-en! Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!\\" This translates to \\"Leave dammit\\". It is clear that the parrot represents Edna's unspoken feelings towards her husband. It also represents how Edna is caged in her society, without much freedom to live as she pleases. As Edna is walking towards the ocean in the end of the novel, we see a bird with a broken wing. There are many possible interpretations of the symbolism of the injured bird. Some would say that the bird is a representation of Edna finally breaking away from the idea of Victorian womanhood, as throughout the entire novel we see caged birds and now we are finally seeing a bird that is free despite its injury. Others say the injured bird represents Edna's failure to live outside of the expectations that society had placed on her. Ocean – The ocean can be interpreted to represent many different things. While the Pontellier family are vacationing at the resort Edna teaches herself how to swim. This signifies her \\"awakening\\", her realizing that she holds some sort of independence. It is as if this first swim was Edna's first taste of freedom and after that she becomes more and more rebellious. The ending of the book depends on the perception of the reader. Many question whether or not Edna dies in the end of the novel. If Edna is thought to be dead, then it is an ironic death because the sea is where she discovered herself. Those that believe Edna purposely kills herself justify her suicide by saying that the ocean is what Edna believed would free her from the chains that were placed on her by society. Piano – Throughout the novel many characters play musical instruments, specifically the piano. At the resort when Adéle is playing the piano it is almost like déjà vu for Edna; just as the event that occurred in the ocean at the novel's beginning, Edna is once again being awakened. It is as if she has a better understanding of herself and her feelings after hearing the woman play the piano. Edna also feels that same emotion when Mademoiselle Reisz plays the piano. It is as if the music that comes from this instrument represents how these women inspire Edna to become a stronger and more independent woman. Topics=Solitude One of the most prominent themes in The Awakening is solitude. As referenced previously, Chopin's work once contained the word in its title when it was originally called A Solitary Soul. Through Edna Pontellier's journey, Kate Chopin sought to highlight the different ways that a woman could be in solitude because of the expectations of motherhood, ethnicity, marriage, social norms, and gender. Chopin presents Edna's autonomous separation from society and friends as individually empowering while still examining the risks of self-exploration and subsequent loneliness. In an attempt to shed her societal role of mother and wife, Edna takes charge of her limited life and makes changes to better discover her true self. For example, Edna leaves her husband and moves into a new house to live by herself, a controversial action since a true woman would never leave her husband. Although Edna's journey ultimately leads to an unsustainable solitude due to lack of societal support, \\"her death indicates self-possession rather than a retreat from a dilemma.\\"Massie, Virginia Zirkel. \\"Solitary Blessings: Solitude in the Fiction of Hawthorne, Melville, and Kate Chopin.\\" Louisiana State U, 2005. She takes control over what she still has agency over: her body and her self. By making Edna's experiences critically central to the novel, Chopin is able to sound a cautionary note about society's capacity to support women's liberation. As shown through Edna's depressing emotional journey, isolation, and eventual suicide, Chopin claims that the social norms and traditional gender roles of the 19th century could not tolerate an independent woman. Chopin's The Awakening questions the value of solitude and autonomy within a society unable to positively sustain women's freedom. Gender roles and social constraints The themes of romance and death in The Awakening aid Chopin's feminist intent of illuminating the restrictive and oppressive roles of women in Victorian society. Edna's longing for Robert Lebrun and affair with Alcée Arobin explicitly show Edna's rejection of her prescribed roles as housewife and mother as she awakens to her sexuality and sense of self. Edna has an emotional affair with Robert, who leaves in order to avoid shaming her in society. Afterwards, Edna has a physical affair with Alcée. Through these affairs, Edna exercises agency outside of her marriage and experiences sexual longing for the first time. However, through these affairs Edna also discovers that no matter which man she is with, there is no escape from the general oppression women face; Edna's society has no place for a woman like her, as she must either be an exemplary housewife and mother like Adèle Ratignolle or an isolated outsider like Mademoiselle Reisz.Clark, Zolia. \\"The Bird that Came Out of the Cage: A Foucauldian Feminist Approach to Kate Chopin's The Awakening.\\" Journal for Cultural Research 12.4 (2008): 335-347, Academic Search Complete. Web. Edna's ultimate decision to commit suicide at the end of the novel exemplifies how few options women had in society at this time. Leaving society all together was Edna's way of rejecting and escaping this oppressive dichotomy. One critic stated that the book leaves one sick of human nature, while another one stated that the book is morbid because it is about an unholy love that tested traditional gender roles of the late 1800s and that the book belongs to the overworked field of sex fiction. However, this was the original criticism of the book. When the book was reevaluated years later it was then recognized as canonical due to the feminist theme. This later then led to many other women writers of the Nineteenth century to become recognized for literary themes on gender roles viewed by their regions, culture, or religion. Musical romanticism When Edna first hears Mademoiselle Reisz play, she develops a strong appreciation towards music and art. At the ball at the Grand Isle, when Edna is seen with Robert listening to Mademoiselle Reisz play a piece by Chopin, the piece sends shivers down her spine. Camastra states that > The emotional fluidity of music is not solely responsible for Edna's > evolving constitution. Such an assertion would deny any individual agency on > her part and misrepresent the synthesis of artistic form and content that > serves as a musical parallel to Edna's experiences. Chopin's music > successfully integrates the opposition of \\"the 'classical' concern for form > and the 'romantic' urge of inspiration.\\" Edna ostensibly adheres to > prescribed feminine standards before witnessing an iconoclastic revelation > of her senses. Therefore, due to Edna's fascination with romantic melodies, it causes Edna to 'Awaken' and desire new things to free herself from confinement. The theme of solitude is also related with musical romanticism. Camastra states that Edna comes to the same despondency to which the writer Maupassant arrived. Maupassant attempts to commit suicide a few months before his actual death in 1893. Maupassant fictionalized spirits and Frederic Chopin internalized them in his music. In \\"The Awakening\\", Edna is fascinated by the musical poet's repertoire, and is forced to confront the spectral presence of an existential yearning for something else that eventually drives her to commit suicide. Publication and critical reception The Awakening was particularly controversial upon publication in 1899. Although the novel was never technically banned, it was censored.Benjamin, Franklin. Colonial literature, 1607–1776. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2010: 88. Chopin's novel was considered immoral not only for its comparatively frank depictions of female sexual desire but also for its depiction of a protagonist who chafed against social norms and established gender roles. The public reaction to the novel was similar to the protests that greeted the publication and performance of Henrik Ibsen's landmark drama A Doll's House (1879), a work with which The Awakening shares an almost identical theme. Both contain a female protagonist who abandons her husband and children for self-fulfilment. However, published reviews ran the gamut from outright condemnation to the recognition of The Awakening as an important work of fiction by a gifted practitioner. Divergent reactions of two newspapers in Kate Chopin's hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, reflect this. The St. Louis Republic labeled the novel \\"poison\\" and \\"too strong a drink for moral babes\\", and the St. Louis Mirror stated, \\"One would fain beg the gods, in pure cowardice, for sleep unending rather than to know what an ugly, cruel, loathsome Monster Passion can be when, like a tiger, it slowly awakens. This is the kind of awakening that impresses the reader in Mrs. Chopin's heroine.\\" Later in the same year, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch praised the novel in \\"A St. Louis Woman Who Has Turned Fame Into Literature.\\" As Chopin was the first woman from St. Louis to become a professional writer, she was of particular interest there. Some reviews clucked in disappointment at Chopin's choice of subject: \\"It was not necessary for a writer of so great refinement and poetic grace to enter the over-worked field of sex-fiction\\" (Chicago Times Herald). Others mourned the loss of good taste; The Nation claimed that the book opened with high expectations, \\"remembering the author's agreeable short stories,\\" and closed with \\"real disappointment,\\" suggesting public dissatisfaction with the chosen topic: \\"we need not have been put to the unpleasantness of reading about her.\\"Review from \\"recent novels\\" reprinted from The Nation 69 (3 August 1899) In Critical essays on Kate Chopin, ed. By Alice Hall Petry, (New York, 1996) The Nation also called Chopin \\"one more clever writer gone wrong.\\" Some reviews indulged in outright vitriol, as when Public Opinion stated, \\"We are well-satisfied when Mrs. Pontellier deliberately swims out to her death in the waters of the gulf.\\"Review from 'Book Reviews' reprinted from Public Opinion 26 (22 June 1899) 794. In Critical essays on Kate Chopin, ed. By Alice Hall Petry, (New York, 1996) Chopin's work also garnered qualified, though still negative, reviews. The Dial called The Awakening a \\"poignant spiritual tragedy\\" with the caveat that the novel was \\"not altogether wholesome in its tendencies.\\" Similarly, The Congregationalist called Chopin's novel \\"a brilliant piece of writing\\" but concludes, \\"We cannot commend it.\\" In the Pittsburgh Leader, Willa Cather set The Awakening alongside Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert's equally notorious and equally reviled novel of suburban ennui and unapologetic adultery—though Cather was no more impressed with the heroine than were most of her contemporaries. Cather \\"hope[d] that Miss Chopin will devote that flexible, iridescent style of hers to a better cause.\\" Legacy and historical context Chopin did not write another novel after The Awakening and had difficulty publishing stories after its release. Emily Toth believes this is in part because Chopin \\"went too far: Edna's sensuality was too much for the male gatekeepers.\\" Chopin's next book was cancelled, and health and family problems consumed her. When she died five years later, she was on her way to being forgotten. Per Seyersted, a Norwegian literary scholar, rediscovered Chopin in the 1960s, leading The Awakening to be remembered as the feminist fiction it is today. In 1991 The Awakening was dramatized in a film, Grand Isle, directed by Mary Lambert and starring Kelly McGillis as Edna, Jon DeVries as Leonce, and Adrian Pasdar as Robert. In \\"Wish Someone Would Care\\", the ninth episode of the first season of the HBO series Treme that aired in 2010, Tulane professor Creighton Bernette (John Goodman) assigns the novel to his class and briefly discusses it with his students. Later in the episode, he lets his students out early and takes a care-free stroll to his favorite spots in New Orleans before ultimately taking his own life in the Mississippi River. The Awakening serves as a structural and thematic background for Robert Stone's 1986 novel Children of Light, in which an assortment of doomed characters, including an alcoholic writer and a mentally unstable actress, gather in Mexico to make a film of Chopin's novel. In the 1890s, when Chopin wrote The Awakening, a range of social changes and tensions that brought \\"the woman question\\" into public discussion influenced Chopin's novel. Louisiana, the setting for The Awakening, was a largely Catholic state where divorce was extremely rare, and women were expected to stay loyal and faithful to their husbands, and men to their wives. This explains some reactions The Awakening received in 1899. Linda Wagner-Martin writes, \\"sometimes being considered 'European' (or at least certainly 'French') rather than American, these types of works were condemned for the very ambivalence that made them brilliant and prescient pieces of writing.\\" Chopin's The Awakening and other novels in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were censored due to their perceived immorality, which included sexual impropriety, an argument supported by the initial reviews of the book found in newspapers at the time.Linda Wagner- Martin, The Forbidden Scandalous and Banned Novels, accessed March 26, 2013. Nevertheless, Margo Culley stresses that Kate Chopin was not the only woman challenging gender ideologies in this period; writing a novel brought her views into public prominence. One of the main issues that nineteenth century readers had with the novel was the idea of a woman abandoning her duties as a wife and mother. As this was so strictly reinforced as the main purpose of women's lives, a character who rebels against these social norms shocked readers. An \\"Etiquette/Advice Book\\" of the time proclaimed: \\"if she has the true mother-heart the companionship of her children will be the society which she will prefer above that of all others.\\" ReferencesExternal links (plain text and HTML) *The Awakening at Internet Archive and Google Books (scanned books original editions) * Category:1899 American novels Category:Feminist fiction Category:Novels by Kate Chopin Category:Novels set in New Orleans Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels about music Category:Fictional characters from Kentucky ","title":"The Awakening (Chopin novel)"},{"id":"430851","text":"Arms of Rich: Gules, a chevron between three crosses botonée or Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland.

The Kraffts were known for being pioneers in filming, photographing and recording volcanoes, often getting within feet of lava flows. Their obituary appeared in the Bulletin of Volcanology. Werner Herzog's documentary Into the Inferno mentions them.  Early life  Katja (née Conrad) was born on April 17, 1942 in the commune of Guebwiller, France. Maurice Krafft was born on March 26, 1946 in the city and commune of Mulhouse, located in the Alsace region of France. Krafft discovered his interest in volcanoes at seven years old while on a family trip to Naples and Stromboli, joining the Société géologique de France (Geological Society of France) at age 15. He studied geology at the University of Besançon then the University of Strasbourg. Katia also graduated from the University of Strasbourg, where she graduated with degrees in physics and chemistry. The two met on a bench at the university and got married in 1970. With little money, they saved up for a trip to Stromboli and photographed its near-continuous eruption. Finding that people were interested in this documentation of eruptions, they soon made a career out of filming volcano eruptions, which afforded them the ability to travel the globe.  Career  The Kraffts were often the first to be at an active volcano, and were respected and envied by many volcanologists. Their footage of the effects of volcanic eruptions was a considerable factor in gaining the cooperation of local authorities faced with volcanic threats. One notable example of this was after the onset of activity at Mount Pinatubo in 1991, where their video of the effects of the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia was shown to large numbers of people, including Philippine President Cory Aquino, and convinced many skeptics that evacuation of the area would be necessary.  Mount Unzen eruption  In June 1991, while filming eruptions at Mount Unzen (Japan), they were caught in a pyroclastic flow, which unexpectedly swept out of the channel that previous smaller flows had been following and onto the ridge they were standing on. They were killed instantly along with 41 other people, including fellow volcanologist Harry Glicken, several firefighters and journalists also covering the eruptions. The work of the Kraffts was highlighted in a video issue of National Geographic, which contained a large amount of their film footage and photographs as well as interviews with both. Maurice said in that video that \\"I am never afraid because I have seen so many eruptions in 23 years that even if I die tomorrow, I don't care\\".  Legacy  A volcanic crater, M. and K. Krafft Crater, of the volcano Piton de la Fournaise on the island of Reunion, is named after the couple. The crater is located at . Lava erupted from this crater in March 1998. The Krafft Medal honors the Krafft memory and is awarded every 4 years by the IAVCEI Scientific Assembly to someone who has made significant contributions to volcanology through service to communities affected by volcanic activity.

The host tree responds to the presence of Dactylanthus by forming a burl-like structure that resembles a fluted wooden rose (hence the common name). When the flowers emerge on the forest floor, they are pollinated by a ground-foraging species of native bat. Description Dactylanthus taylorii in flower Dactylanthus taylorii is a round warty tuber-like stem (up to 50 cm wide) or haustorium with no roots, which draws nutrients from the roots of its host. Its leaves do not photosynthesise, and are reduced to floral bracts. Some plants have been aged in excess of 30 years old. Dactylanthus prefers damp but not waterlogged soil, and is often found at the head of small streams. It parasitises about 30 species of native hardwood trees and shrubs, preferring those growing in secondary forest on the margin of mature podocarp forest. Common hosts include pate or seven-finger (Schefflera digitata), five-finger (Pseudopanax arboreus), lemonwood (Pittosporum eugenioides), and putaputaweta (Carpodetus serratus). Plants are either male or female. They flower between February and May and are primarily pollinated by the native short-tailed bat. Analysis of fossil coprolites suggest the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a flightless nocturnal parrot, was also a pollinator. Pollinated plants produce fruits slightly under long. The nectar exudes a musky smell that resembles mammalian sweat. Introduced mice and rats also pollinate them, although rats tend to destroy them.  Wood rose  Wood roses in the collection of the frameless The plant takes its common name from the attachment point between tuber and host. The host's roots expand to form a fluted disk, resembling a flower. This growth was once dug up in the thousands, incidentally killing the Dactylanthus, and sold as a collectable curio. It is illegal to collect wood roses from public land, and harvesting this threatened species is strongly discouraged. Taxonomy and naming Dactylanthus taylorii was first discovered by Europeans in March 1845, when Rev. Richard Taylor came across it 12 km south of Raetihi. In 1856 Taylor took a specimen to Joseph Hooker in England, who formally described the species in 1859. The genus name is derived from the Greek (dáktulos), “finger”, and (ánthos), “flower”. The specific epithet (taylorii, originally Taylori) honours Rev. Taylor. It is the only species in the genus. Taylor stated that the Māori name for wood rose was pua reinga (more grammatically, pua o Te Rēinga, \\"flower of the underworld\\", poetically rendered by Hooker as \\"flower of Hades\\"). Hill noted that at least in the Taupo region this name referred to a different parasitic plant, Thismia, and claimed the Māori name for Dactylanthus was waewae atua, \\"feet or toes of the spirits/gods\\". The closest relative of Dactylanthus is Hachettea from New Caledonia. Along with Mystropetalon from South Africa, they comprise the Southern Hemisphere group Mystropetalaceae. All three are holoparasites, lacking chlorophyll, and are descended from hemiparasitic root parasites which could photosynthesise.  Distribution  Dactylanthus is currently found only in the North Island, although there is evidence from fossil pollen it lived recently in the northern South Island. It ranges from Puketi Forest in Northland through the Coromandel Peninsula as far south as Mt Bruce, and from Mt Taranaki to Te Araroa on the East Coast. It also lives on Little Barrier Island. The plant is cryptic, hence hard to survey, but more than a few thousand in existence is unlikely. Many sites likely are known only to collectors, as the woody growth has commercial value.  Conservation status  kiore. Dactylanthus is regarded, as of 2012, as Threatened – Nationally Vulnerable. The New Zealand Department of Conservation started a recovery plan in 1995. The wood rose is under threat from harvesting by collectors, browsing by possums, rats, pigs and deer, habitat loss, and the rarity of its pollinators and seed dispersers. Control of the browsing mammals that feed on Dactylanthus, especially possums and kiore, is one conservation strategy. Another is to enclose the plants in protective cages. Because cages also exclude the plant's pollinators, its flowers then need to be hand-pollinated, and the resulting seed set turns out to be no better than in uncaged plants. Dactylanthus has recently been successfully translocated in the wild by sown seeds in closed-canopy forest.

He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, plus a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills. He later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the wild Mexican yam. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs. Julian received more than 130 chemical patents. He was one of the first African Americans to receive a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second African- American scientist inducted (behind David Blackwell) from any field.  Early life and education  Percy Lavon Julian was born on April 11, 1899, in Montgomery, Alabama, as the first child of six born to James Sumner Julian and Elizabeth Lena Julian, née Adams. Both of his parents were graduates of what was to be Alabama State University. His father, James, whose own father had been a slave, was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the United States Post Office, while his mother, Elizabeth, worked as a schoolteacher.Julian family in the 1900 U.S. Census; Montgomery, Alabama; James lived with his wife's siblings: Mather P. Adams (1884–? ); George Adams (1886–? ); Carrie L. Adams (1891–? ); Ethel M. Adams (1893–? ). James is listed as a mail carrier. Percy Julian grew up in the time of racist Jim Crow culture and legal regime in the southern United States. Among his childhood memories was finding a lynched man hanged from a tree while walking in the woods near his home. At a time when access to an education beyond the eighth grade was extremely rare for African-Americans, Julian's parents steered all of their children toward higher education. Julian attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated nature of the town forced social humiliations. Julian was not allowed to live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He later found work firing the furnace, waiting tables, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house; in return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 as a Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian. By 1930 Julian's father would move the entire family to Greencastle so that all his children could attend college at DePauw. He still worked as a railroad postal clerk.1930 US Census; Greencastle, Indiana with Julians; James owned his own home valued at $3,000 (approximately $ today). Percy Julian's siblings were James Sumner Julian II (1903–?) (Honorary Depauw 1970); Mattie Julian Brown (c 1905–1992) (Depauw 1926); Elizabeth Julian White (c 1907–2007) (Depauw 1928); Irma D. Julian Raybon (1912–1990) (Depauw 1933); and Emerson R. Julian (1917–1978) (Depauw 1938). After graduating from DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his doctorate in chemistry, but learned it would be difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that white students would resent being taught by an African- American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard. In 1929, while an instructor at Howard University, Julian received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to continue his graduate work at the University of Vienna, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1931. He studied under Ernst Späth and was considered an impressive student. In Europe, he found freedom from the racial prejudices that had stifled him in the States. He freely participated in intellectual social gatherings, went to the opera and found greater acceptance among his peers. Julian was one of the first African Americans to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, after St. Elmo Brady and Dr. Edward M.A. Chandler. After returning from Vienna, Julian taught for one year at Howard University. At Howard, in part due to his position as a department head, Julian became caught up in university politics, setting off an embarrassing chain of events. At university president Mordecai Wyatt Johnson's request, he goaded white Professor of chemistry, Jacob Shohan (Ph.D from Harvard The National Archive.), into resigning.Kenneth R. Manning, Black Apollo of Science: The Life of Ernest Everett Just, Oxford University Press, 1983, pp. 223-24. In late May 1932, Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local African-American newspaper the letters Julian had written to him from Vienna. The letters described \\"a variety of subjects from wine, pretty Viennese women, music and dances, to chemical experiments and plans for the new chemical building.\\" In the letters, he spoke with familiarity, and with some derision, of specific members of the Howard University faculty, terming one well-known Dean, an \\"ass\\". Around this same time, Julian also became entangled in an interpersonal conflict with his laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson. Julian had recommended Thompson for dismissal in March 1932. Thompson sued Julian for \\"alienating the affections of his wife\\", Anna Roselle Thompson, stating he had seen them together in a sexual tryst. Julian counter-sued him for libel. When Thompson was fired, he too gave the paper intimate and personal letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Dr. Julian's letters revealed \\"how he fooled the [Howard] president into accepting his plans for the chemistry building\\" and \\"how he bluffed his good friend into appointing\\" a professor of Julian's liking. Through the summer of 1932, the Baltimore Afro-American published all of Julian's letters. Eventually, the scandal and accompanying pressure forced Julian to resign. He lost his position and everything he had worked for. Some happiness for Dr. Julian, however, was to come from this scandal. On December 24, 1935 he married Anna Roselle (Ph.D. in Sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 – February 24, 2008), who became a noted civil rights lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin; and Faith Roselle Julian (1944– ), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes inspirational speeches about her father and his contributions to science. At the lowest point in Julian's career, his former mentor, William Martin Blanchard, professor of chemistry at DePauw, threw him a much-needed lifeline. Blanchard offered Julian a position to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, to come to the United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean. Julian also extracted stigmasterol, which took its name from Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.  Private sector work: Glidden  In 1936 Julian was denied a professorship at DePauw for racial reasons. DuPont had offered a job to fellow chemist Josef Pikl but declined to hire Julian, despite his superlative qualifications as an organic chemist, apologizing that they were \\"unaware he was a Negro\\". Julian next applied for a job at the Institute of Paper Chemistry (IPC) in Appleton, Wisconsin. However, Appleton was a sundown town, forbidding African Americans from staying overnight, stating directly: \\"No Negro should be bed or boarded overnight in Appleton.\\" Meanwhile, Julian had written to the Glidden Company, a supplier of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his starting point for the synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses. Julian supervised the assembly of the plant at Glidden when he arrived in 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints. At the start of World War II, Glidden sent a sample of Julian's isolated soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of Kidde Fire Fighting), which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam, the U.S. Navy's beloved fire-fighting \\"bean soup.\\" While it was not exactly Julian's brainchild, his meticulous care in the preparation of the soy protein made the fire fighting foam possible. When a hydrolyzate of isolated soy yuh protein was fed into a water stream, the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It saved the lives of thousands of sailors and airmen. Citing this achievement, in 1947 the NAACP awarded Julian the Spingarn Medal, its highest honor.  Steroids  Percy's research at Glidden changed direction in 1940 when he began work on synthesizing progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone from the plant sterols stigmasterol and sitosterol, isolated from soybean oil by a foam technique he invented and patented.U.S. Patent 2,273,046 At that time clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones. However, only minute quantities could be extracted from hundreds of pounds of the spinal cords of animals. In 1940 Julian was able to produce 100 lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy stigmasterol was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn,Bryan A. Wilson and Monte S. Willis, \\"Percy Lavon Julian, Pioneer of Medicinal Chemistry Synthesis\\" , Lab Medicine. in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed. His work made possible the production of these hormones on a larger industrial scale, with the potential of reducing the cost of treating hormonal deficiencies. Julian and his co-workers obtained patents for Glidden on key processes for the preparation of progesterone and testosterone from soybean plant sterols. Product patents held by a former cartel of European pharmaceutical companies had prevented a significant reduction in wholesale and retail prices for clinical use of these hormones in the 1940s. He saved many lives with this discovery. On April 13, 1949, rheumatologist Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic announced the dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone was produced by Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, which was a rare and expensive chemical. By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S, and most often referred as 11-Deoxycortisol), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not. On April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn published the first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol). After two years, Glidden abandoned production of cortisone to concentrate on Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone. In 1953, Glidden decided to leave the steroid business, which had been relatively unprofitable over the years despite Julian's innovative work. On December 1, 1953, Julian left Glidden after 18 years, giving up a salary of nearly $50,000 a year () to found his own company, Julian Laboratories, Inc., taking over the small, concrete-block building of Suburban Chemical Company in Franklin Park, Illinois. On December 2, 1953, Pfizer acquired exclusive licenses of Glidden patents for the synthesis of Substance S. Pfizer had developed a fermentation process for microbial 11β-oxygenation of steroids in a single step that could convert Substance S directly to 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol), with Syntex undertaking large-scale production of cortexolone at very low cost.  Oak Park and Julian Laboratories  Circa 1950, Julian moved his family to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, becoming the first African-American family to reside there. Although some residents welcomed them into the community, there was also opposition. Before they even moved in, on Thanksgiving Day, 1950, their home was fire-bombed. Later, after they moved in, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951. The attacks galvanized the community, and a community group was formed to support the Julians. Julian's son later recounted that during these times, he and his father often kept watch over the family's property by sitting in a tree with a shotgun. In 1953, Julian founded his own research firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought many of his best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, he would have to use the same Mexican yam, obtained from the Mexican barbasco trade, as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company. In July 1956, Julian and executives of two other American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam. The hearings resulted in Syntex signing a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department. While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised not to do so in the future. Within five years, large American multinational pharmaceutical companies had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico, four of which had been Mexican-owned. Syntex reduced the cost of steroid intermediates more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955. Competition from Upjohn and General Mills, which had together made very substantial improvements in the production of progesterone from stigmasterol, forced the price of Mexican progesterone to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957. The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968. In 1958, Upjohn purchased 6,900 kg of progesterone from Syntex at $0.135 per gram, 6,201 kg of progesterone from Searle (who had acquired Pesa) at $0.143 per gram, 5,150 kg of progesterone from Julian Laboratories at $0.14 per gram, and 1,925 kg of progesterone from General Mills (who had acquired Protex) at $0.142 per gram. Despite continually falling bulk prices of steroid intermediates, an oligopoly of large American multinational pharmaceutical companies kept the wholesale prices of corticosteroid drugs fixed and unchanged into the 1960s. Cortisone was fixed at $5.48 per gram from 1954, hydrocortisone at $7.99 per gram from 1954, and prednisone at $35.80 per gram from 1956. Merck and Roussel Uclaf concentrated on improving the production of corticosteroids from cattle bile acids. In 1960 Roussel produced almost one- third of the world's corticosteroids from bile acids. Julian Laboratories chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a product on which they were barely breaking even. Julian reduced their price for the product from $4,000 per kg to $400 per kg. He sold the company in 1961 for $2.3 million (equivalent to $ million today). The U.S. and Mexico facilities were purchased by Smith Kline, and Julian's chemical plant in Guatemala was purchased by Upjohn. In 1964, Julian founded Julian Associates and Julian Research Institute, which he managed for the rest of his life.  National Academy of Sciences  He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973 in recognition of his scientific achievements. He became the second African- American to be inducted, after David Blackwell.

Noteworthy for instability and failed plans, its organization operated several minor and junior leagues thereafter. History Seeking to capitalize upon the original World Hockey Association of the 1970s, Allan Howell and Dr. Nick Vaccaro announced in 2003 the formation of a new professional hockey league calling itself the \\"World Hockey Association.\\" Original WHA superstar Bobby Hull was named its commissioner. The league was regarded by many as an attempt to fill the void that loomed as the NHL's serious labour problems, which led to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, became apparent. Most hockey commentators felt that the league's best hope was to operate while the NHL players were locked out and try to develop enough of a following to survive once the NHL labour problems were resolved. It was projected that the league would begin operation with teams from Dallas, Detroit, Halifax, Hamilton, Miami, Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City. Five teams went so far as to acquire nicknames: the Detroit Gladiators (which planned to play at the Pontiac Silverdome, a venue that had never hosted hockey before); the Dallas Americans (which introduced Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Ed Belfour as goalie/co-owner); the Quebec Nordiks (a tweaking of the old Quebec Nordiques nickname); the Toronto Toros (adopting the nickname of the original WHA team of the same name); and the Halifax IceBreakers. After being pushed back from June 2, a WHA draft took place on July 18, 2004 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Future superstar Sidney Crosby was the first pick; he turned down the league's three-year, $7.5 million offer. By August, however, things began to unravel: the WHA pulled the Quebec franchise and Toronto, unable to find an arena, dropped out soon afterwards. The Florida-based franchise, apparently headed for Miami, then Jacksonville and finally Orlando, quietly expired. By September, the new WHA was down to four teams and had pushed its debut back to November. By October, Dallas had folded and an announced \\"restructuring\\" never took place. In the spring of 2005, the league announced the \\"Bobby Hull Invitational Tournament,\\" for which 50 NHL players had purportedly showed interest. The tournament, scheduled to begin May 20 and award $2 million to the winning team, was dropped without comment by the organization and never held. When that and other plans failed to materialize, the rights to the WHA's name and logo were sold to Richard Smith, a British Columbia investor. Further plans to operate either a similar Tier II junior league or a professional loop in the Pennsylvania-Midwest area in 2007–2008 were dropped without comment by the organization, in addition to financial problems that led to the company's stockbroker calling for a legal investigation and subsequently filing a lawsuit against the WHA. The organization operated three now-defunct leagues, two playing a single season each before folding and the third playing two seasons; the minor-league World Hockey Association 2 and the WHA Super Junior League in Florida, the latter which was abandoned with little to no warning to players and the communities involved. It operated an unsanctioned Tier II developmental league in British Columbia called the WHA Junior West Hockey League between 2006 and 2008, marked by financial and franchise instabilities that saw the WHA's stock price drop to a fraction of a penny per share. While the organization announced a third season for the Junior West Hockey League, no teams were ever iced or games played, and the league's website was taken down after September 2008.

The method of \\"strip farming\\" was in use under the open field system. The mustard-coloured areas are part of the demesne, the hatched areas part of the glebe. The manor house, residence of the lord, can be seen in the mid-southern part of the manor, near the parish church and parsonage Glebe (also known as church furlong, rectory manor or parson's close(s))McGurk 1970, p. 17 is an area of land within an ecclesiastical parish used to support a parish priest. The land may be owned by the church, or its profits may be reserved to the church. Medieval origins In the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, a glebe is land belonging to a benefice and so by default to its incumbent. In other words, \\"glebe is land (in addition to or including the parsonage house/rectory and grounds) which was assigned to support the priest\\".Coredon 2007, p. 140 The word glebe itself is from Middle English, from the French \\"glèbe\\" (originally from Latin gleba or glaeba \\"clod, land, soil\\"). Glebe can include strips in the open field system or grouped together into a compact plot of land. Tithes were in early times the main means of support for the parish clergy but glebe land was either granted by any lord of the manor of the church's parish (sometimes the manor would have boundaries coterminous with the parish but in most instances it would be smaller), or accumulated from other donations of particular pieces of land. Occasionally all or part of the glebe was appropriated, devoted or assigned to a priory or college. In the case where the whole glebe was given to impropriators they would become the lay rector(s) (plural where the land is now subdivided), in which case the general law of tithes would resume on that land, and in England and Wales chancel repair liability would now apply to the lay rectors just as it had to the rector. The amount of such land varied from parish to parish, occasionally forming a complete glebe farm.Such as the Glebe Farm . From 1571 onwards, information about the glebe would be recorded at ecclesiastical visitations in a \\"glebe terrier\\" (Latin terra, land) by the incumbent of the benefice. It could also entail complete farms, individual fields, houses (messuages), mills or works. A holder of a benefice could retain the glebe for his own use, usually for agricultural exploitation, or he could \\"farm\\" it (i.e., lease it, a term also used) to others and retain a rent as income. Britain=Church of England Glebe associated with the Church of England ceased to belong to individual incumbents as from 1 April 1978, by virtue of the Endowments and Glebe Measure 1976. It became vested on that date, \\"without any conveyance or other assurance\\", in the Diocesan Board of Finance of the diocese to which the benefice owning the glebe belonged, even if the glebe was in another diocese. But see 'Parsonages & Glebe Diocesan Manual 2012' for current legislation. Scotland Glebe land in Scotland was subject to an Act of Parliament in 1925 which meant that it would be transferred little by little to the General Trustees of the Church of Scotland. Anglo-America In Bermuda and the Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain where the Church of England was the established church, glebe land was distributed by the colonial government and was often farmed or rented out by the church rector to cover living expenses. The Dutch Reformed Church also provided glebes for the benefit of the pastor; it continued this practice through at least the 1850s.Heisler 1872, p. 295Ellis 1878, In some cases associations with former glebe properties is retained in the local names, for example: Glebe Road in Arlington County, Virginia, the community of Glebe in Hampshire County, West Virginia, Glebe Hill, near Tucker's Town, Bermuda, another Glebe Hill in Southampton Parish, Bermuda, and The Glebe Road in Pembroke Parish, Bermuda. Ottawa neighbourhood The Glebe was originally land dedicated to support St Andrew's Presbyterian Church. The Baptist, Presbyterian and other churches that were not established in Virginia succeeded in 1802 and passage in the legislature of the Glebe Act, whereby whether glebes were sold by the overseers of the poor for the benefit of the indigent in the parish. The Episcopal Church was weakened by the new law, but in the Carolinas the glebes remained in the hands of the church and either were worked by the minister or rented out by them.

(1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . They are known generally as lobelias.Lobelia. USDA PLANTS. Lobelia boninensis Description The genus Lobelia comprises a substantial number of large and small annual, perennial and shrubby species, hardy and tender, from a variety of habitats, in a range of colours. Many species appear totally dissimilar from each other. However, all have simple, alternate leaves and two-lipped tubular flowers, each with five lobes. The upper two lobes may be erect while the lower three lobes may be fanned out. Flowering is often abundant and the flower colour intense, hence their popularity as ornamental garden subjects. Taxonomy The genus is named after the Flemish botanist Matthias de Lobel (1538–1616)., p. 89 Some botanists place the genus and its relatives in the separate family Lobeliaceae, others as a subfamily Lobelioideae within the Campanulaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group did not make a firm decision on this, listing the genus under both families. Lobelia is probably the base form from which many other lobelioid genera are derived; it is therefore highly paraphyletic and not a good genus in a cladistic sense. For example, the Hawaiian species (see Hawaiian lobelioids), currently classified in several genera, originated from a single introduction to a now-submerged Hawaiian Island 15 million years ago, probably from an Asian Lobelia in Lobelia subg. Tupa. A New Zealand study concluded that local species of Hypsela, Isotoma and Pratia should be treated as Lobelia. Ecology Lobelia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Setaceous Hebrew Character. Cultivation and uses Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens. These include Lobelia cardinalis syn. Lobelia fulgens (cardinal flower or Indian pink), Lobelia siphilitica (blue lobelia), and Lobelia erinus, which is used for edging and window boxes. Hybrids Numerous hybrids have been produced, notably Lobelia × speciosa, a hybrid derived from L. fulgens, L. cardinalis & L. siphilitica. The term \\"fan hybrids\\" is also used.Paghat's Garden: \\"Fan Burgundy\\" Cardinal Flower This plant is borderline hardy and requires fertile, moist soil. It is suitable for summer bedding schemes or growing in containers. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *L. × speciosa 'Fan Orchidrosa' *L. × speciosa 'Fan Scharlach' *L. × speciosa 'Fan Tiefrot' *L. × speciosa 'Fan Zinnoberrosa' *L. × speciosa 'Kompliment Scharlach' *L. × speciosa 'Pink Elephant' Traditional medicine The species used most commonly in modern herbalism is Lobelia inflata (Indian tobacco). Use of lobelia for cardiovascular diseases may cause adverse effects. Lobelia has been used as \\"asthmador\\" in Appalachian traditional medicine.AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini. Handbook of Overdose and Detoxification Emergencies. New Hyde Park, NY Medical Examination Publishing,1982. Pp.53-56. Two species, L. siphilitica and L. cardinalis, were once considered a cure for syphilis.Guédon, Marie-Françoise (2000). Sacred Smudging in North America. Walkabout Press. Herbalist Samuel Thomson popularized medicinal use of lobelia in the United States in the early 19th century. Adverse effects Many members of the genus are considered poisonous, with some containing the toxic principle lobeline. Because of lobeline's similarity to nicotine, the internal use of lobelia may be dangerous to susceptible populations, including children, pregnant women,Lobelia, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and individuals with cardiac disease. Excessive use will cause nausea and vomiting.Lobelia, drugs.com It is not recommended for use by pregnant women and is best administered by a practitioner qualified in its use. It also has a chemical known as lobellicyonycin, which may cause dizziness. Chemical constituents Lobelane Isolobelanine Extracts of Lobelia inflata contain lobeline and those from Lobelia chinensis contain apigenin, lobeline, lobelanine, isolobelanine, lobelanidine, quercetin, coumarins, glucosides and other flavonoids. Diversity Lobelia sessilifolia Species include: Erect Lobelia plant Giant lobelias (Lobelia deckenii), Mount Kenya Mexican spurred lobelias About eleven species native to Mexico and Central America have spurs on the flowers. These spurred lobelias appear to form a monophyletic group. Most have been classified in the genera Heterotoma (or sometimes Calcaratolobelia). However, since their closest relatives such as Lobelia anatina are in Lobelia, Koopman and Ayers classify them in Lobelia. Partial list: *Lobelia aurita (Heterotoma aurita).

It saw action in Western Europe and participated in the Battle of Normandy, the Liberation of Belgium, and fighting in the Netherlands over 1944-1945. Origins Brigade Piron originated in 1940, with hundreds of Belgian soldiers who had escaped to Britain, as had the Belgian Government. A new command of the Belgian Army, under Lieutenant-General Victor van Strydonck de Burkel, was created in Tenby on 25 May 1940, three days before the Belgian capitulation. Van Strydonck de Burkel became commander of the Belgian Forces in Great Britain in June 1940 and in the same month, a Belgian Minister (Jaspar) called upon all Belgians to come to Britain to continue fighting. At the end of July 1940 there were 462 men in the Belgian Forces in exile; the arrival of many Belgians allowed the creation of several military units. The troops were trained in Great Britain and Canada and in 1942, Major Jean- Baptiste Piron arrived in Scotland where he quickly joined the army staff, with the responsibility of improving the training of Belgian troops. In an artillery competition, the Belgian battery came first. The Belgian Forces in Britain were officially made available to the Allies on 4 June 1942. By the end of the year the army had been restructured, including the creation of the 1st Belgian Brigade, under the command of Major Piron, with a mix of infantry, artillery and reconnaissance units. Troop training continued through 1943 and landing exercises were conducted in early 1944. A Luxembourgish unit was assigned to Brigade Piron in March, forming an artillery troop. Because the Belgians had arrived from around the world, thirty-three languages were spoken in the Brigade in 1944. Normandy invasion T17 Staghound armoured car with the markings of the Brigade Piron The D-Day landings took place on 6 June 1944 without Brigade Piron, to the great disappointment of its 2,200 men but the British preferred to reserve them for the liberation of Belgium. (This policy was applied to all of the smaller national military contingents, which were expected to form the basis of post-war armies and for whom it would have been difficult to find replacements for casualties.) Piron lobbied the Belgian government in exile, which requested the British Government to send the Belgian troops to the front, to reverse the declining morale of those troops. On 29 July 1944, the Brigade was ordered to be ready to move. Its first units arrived in Normandy on 30 July and the main body arrived at Arromanches and Courseulles on 8 August, before the end of the Battle of Normandy. The Brigade operated under the command of the British 6th Airborne Division (Major General Gale), which was part of the First Canadian Army. The Belgians entered active service on 9 August. The Belgian Brigade participated in Operation Paddle, Clearing the Channel coast from 17 August with British and Dutch (Prinses Irene Brigade) troops of the 6th Airborne Division. Merville-Franceville-Plage was liberated in the evening, Varaville on 20 August. The Brigade's armoured vehicles were detached to assist British units. Dives-sur-Mer and Cabourg were taken on the morning of 21 August and Houlgate in the afternoon. The Brigade took Villers-sur-Mer and Deauville on 22 August, and Trouville-sur-Mer and Honfleur at the mouth of the Seine on 24 August. The bridge connecting the communes of Deauville and Trouville-sur-Mer was renamed to \\"Pont des Belges\\" and still bears a commemoration to the Brigade which liberated the communes. The Belgian armoured vehicles were reunited with the rest of the Brigade on 26 August at Foulbec. On 28 August 1944, the Brigade was placed under the British 49th Infantry Division in order to mop up the Seine estuary and help in the siege of Le Havre. On 29 August, the Brigade crossed the Seine to support Operation Astonia, the attack on Le Havre on the following day. At the last moment the Brigade was withdrawn from the front and transferred to the Second Army for operations in Belgium. The efforts of Brigade Piron on Normandy's Côte Fleurie are commemorated by memorials, road names and war graves. Belgium and the Netherlands A Universal Carrier of the Brigade Piron mobbed by civilians during the Liberation of Brussels in 1944. On 2 September, the Brigade and the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade had been transferred to the Second Army and ordered to move as quickly as possible to the Belgian border. The British were already in Belgium and expected to enter Brussels on the following day and this transfer would allow the Belgian and Dutch Brigades to operate in their homelands. The Brigade arrived at the French–Belgian border on 3 September, after an overnight journey and continued to Rongy in Brussels the following day, just after the British. In early September the Brigade acted as guides for British soldiers, attempted to aid Resistance fighters, and took part in mine-clearing at the Evere and Melsbroek airports. The Brigade entered northern Belgium on 3 September 1944, On 11 September 1944, the Brigade participated in a battle at the Albert canal bridgehead and helped to capture Leopoldsburg liberating 900 political prisoners. During Operation Market Garden the Brigade was assigned to guard the right flank of the British 30th corps. On 25 September 1944 the Brigade reached the Wessem canal with fighting reaching its peak on 11 November 1944. Six days later the Brigade was withdrawn and reorganized into a proper brigade for the first time at Leuven. During their advance through Belgium, the Belgian troops were sometimes mistaken for French Canadians, since local people did not expect that their liberators would be fellow Belgians. Brigade Piron liberated other Belgian towns and cities before reaching the Netherlands border on 22 September. Its campaign in the Netherlands lasted until 17 November, when it was relieved from the front and moved into reserve in Leuven. In the small Dutch border town of Thorn, a bridge has been named in honour of its liberation on 25 September 1944. Brigade Piron returned to the Netherlands between 11 April 1945 and June 1945. The last casualty of the Brigade occurred on 27 April 1945. The next day, the Brigade was thrown into battle once again around Nijmegen. On that day also, an armistice was implemented in the Netherlands. The Brigade entered Germany in May before being disbanded in December. Its tradition was however preserved in the Bevrijding (Liberation) battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Line. Occupation of Germany Brigade Piron occupied part of the British zone of occupation until 15 December 1945. Post-war Brigade Piron formed the basis of the new Belgian Army. In a reorganisation on 17 November 1945, the Brigade's artillery and armoured units were reorganised to form specialised regiments and the engineers joined a new engineer battalion. The remaining infantry, reinforced by volunteers, became the First Brigade Liberation, based at Leopoldsburg barracks. Order of battle In August 1944, the 1st Belgian Brigade consisted of: *Staff *British Liaison *1st, 2nd and 3rd Motorised companies – each with rifle platoons reinforced by mortar, machine gun, anti-tank and anti-aircraft platoons. *Armoured Car Squadron – 4 squadrons equipped with a mixture of Daimler Armoured Cars, Staghound armoured cars (some armed with anti-aircraft weapons) and Daimler \\"Dingo\\" Scout Cars and a supply and recovery squadron *Artillery Battery – 12 25 pounder gun-howitzers, organised into 3 troops, one of which was Luxembourgish. *Engineers Company *Transport Company *Repair Detachment *Medical Unit NotesReferences ;Bibliography *Roland Breyne, La Brigade Piron, Louvain-la-Neuve, Université Catholique de Louvain, Séminaires d'histoire contemporaine consacrés à la vie quotidienne pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale en Brabant wallon, Hainaut et Namurois, 1985, 78 pages. * Inge Huygebaert, Jean-Baptiste Piron, de man achter de Brigade, Koninklijke Militaire School Brussel.

Together with its major tributary, the Puerco River, it drains an area of about in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. Although it stretches almost , only the headwaters and the lowermost reaches flow year-round. Between St. Johns and Cameron, most of the river is a wide, braided wash, only containing water after heavy snowmelt or flash flooding. The lower is known as the Little Colorado River Gorge and forms one of the largest arms of the Grand Canyon, at over deep where it joins the Colorado near Desert View in Grand Canyon National Park. Course The river rises as two forks in the White Mountains of mid-eastern Arizona, in Apache County. The West Fork starts in a valley on the north flank of Mount Baldy at an elevation of nearly , while the East Fork starts nearby. The forks meet in a canyon near the town of Greer, forming the main Little Colorado River. It flows into River Reservoir, then leaves the canyon near Eagar. The river then turns north, meandering through Richville Valley, before emptying into Lyman Lake, impounded by an irrigation dam built in 1912. From there the river continues north, past the town of St. Johns. Shortly afterwards, the river transforms from a perennial stream to an ephemeral wash as it travels northwestwards through Hunt Valley, where it receives the Zuni River, then receiving Silver Creek and the Puerco River—its main tributaries—near the town of Holbrook as it flows into the Painted Desert. The Grand Falls of the Little Colorado River, seen at peak flow in April The Little Colorado passes Joseph City and crosses the Southern Transcon route of the BNSF Railway (originally the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad), now winding north into Coconino County. The river enters the Navajo Nation, and drops over the Grand Falls of the Little Colorado shortly after. Below Grand Falls, the river flows through a short but rugged canyon for about . Emerging into the desert again, the Little Colorado skirts the eastern edge of Wupatki National Monument and passes the town of Cameron, where it is bridged by U.S. Highway 89. From Cameron, the Little Colorado River carves an extremely steep and narrow gorge into the Colorado Plateau, eventually achieving a maximum depth of about . The depth of the canyon is such that groundwater is forced to the surface, forming numerous springs that restore a perennial river flow. It joins the Colorado deep inside the Grand Canyon, miles from any major settlement. The confluence marks the end of the Marble Canyon segment of the Grand Canyon and the beginning of Upper Granite Gorge. Discharge The Little Colorado River in its canyon The Little Colorado River is one of the two major tributaries of the Colorado River in Arizona, the other being the Gila River.See :File:Coloradorivermap.jpg; the other is the Gila River. Runoff typically peaks twice a year, first in the early spring (February–April) from snow melt and highland rain; and in the summer (July–September) from monsoon storms. The annual runoff is extremely variable with the possibility of no flow occurring due to a weak snow pack or lack of summer rain. Conversely, years such as 1949, 1973, 1979, 1983 and 1993 have seen massive volumes of spring snowmelt while large monsoon runoff has occurred in 1955, 1964, 1984 and 2006. Monthly average flows in the springtime average several hundred cfs and can reach . Only the upper reaches of the river above St. Johns, and the lowermost stretch below Cameron, flow year round; the middle section is basically a huge arroyo that carries water only during the wet seasons. According to a streamflow gauge near Cameron, before the river enters the Grand Canyon, the river's average annual flow was from 1948 to present. The highest annual average was in 1973, and the lowest was in 2000. The river's peak flows can be far higher than its average flow, because of quick desert runoff from cloudbursts. At the same gauge, peak flows were recorded from 1923 to 2008, with spotty data from 1924 to 1947. The highest recorded peak was on September 20, 1923, while the lowest was in 1974. History Navajo Indians crossing the Little Colorado River, ca.1900 Human activity in the Little Colorado River watershed dates back to the early Holocene epoch, in the last glacial period. Nomadic hunter-gatherers inhabited the relatively water-rich and diverse upper basin of the Little Colorado for almost 8,000 years before the Navajo, Apache and Hopi tribes populated the area. Many of these people practiced small-scale irrigation in riverside villages, located in sheltered canyons and cliffs that provided defense. Early Spanish explorers exploring the Grand Canyon area were most likely the first Europeans to see the Little Colorado River. They called it Colorado Chiquito, the Little Colorado. Other than fur trappers and mountain men, one of the first organized expeditions into the area of the Little Colorado River was led by Amiel Weeks Whipple in 1853–54 during one of the expeditions to map out a route for a transcontinental railroad. Called The Great Railroad Expeditions, or Pacific Railroad Surveys, Whipple's expedition consisted of several teams going roughly along the 35th parallel from Albuquerque to the Pacific, following the Santa Fe Trail route. The Little Colorado River (right)'s confluence with the Colorado River (center). Note that the Little Colorado is a light brown color caused by recent cloudbursts, while the Colorado is an emerald green. When Powell and his crew arrived here in 1869, it was this color of the river that they saw, while the Colorado's green color is caused by Glen Canyon Dam trapping sediment.The St. Josieph Brdge a.k.a. the Lost Pratt Pony Truss Bridge built in 1912 over the Little Colorado River in Joseph City, Arizona The Little Colorado River, also known as the Flax River, and the first Rio Chiquito, is depicted and labelled as such on a map compiled by Lt. Joseph C. Ives and published in the official volumes of those expeditions. Ives would again return to the area in 1858 after navigating a steamboat named the Explorer up the Colorado from south of Yuma northwards to Black Canyon, at which point his party went ashore and attempted to go up into the Grand Canyon until the sheer cliffs prevented them from doing so. Leaving the canyon they proceeded overland and someplace in the vicinity of the Grand Falls (also known as the Chocolate Falls) on the Little Colorado, picked up the Whipple trail from four years prior.also see Goetzmann, William H. \\"Army Exploration in the American West, 1803-1863,\\" 1959. The Powell Geographic Expedition, on August 10, 1869, was one of the first American parties to sight the Little Colorado River. Powell and some of his crew explored a segment of the Little Colorado River canyon, although they mainly found it impassable. In diary entries, they recorded its name as \\"Flax River\\", for the flax that makes up much of the river's riparian zone—and \\"Colorado Chiquito\\"—so, presumably they already knew about the river before they had come on the expedition. This was in fact an inaccurate depiction of the Little Colorado, as the muddy flow they observed was the result of a rare flash flood. The river is normally a bright blue color caused by dissolved travertine and limestone in the water, similar to Havasu Creek, another major tributary of the Colorado within the Grand Canyon. In the 1870s, Mormon colonists migrated southwards from Salt Lake City and settled in the lower part of the Little Colorado River valley. Expeditions had been sent into the basin about five years before to determine the qualities of the area. The Mormons founded Joseph City near the confluence with the Puerco River, and four others nearby, although Joseph City is the only one that still exists. Settlers continued traveling into the area through 1876, although many of them had great difficulty in crossing the Little Colorado. Although shallow and slow-flowing, the river flows through soft sand and in some places, even quicksand, creating non-ideal conditions for their wagons.Dam that river! Ecology and Mormon settlement in the Little Colorado River Basin, p. 20 There were two primary crossings of the Little Colorado—one at the Grand Falls, and one at Black Falls, a smaller waterfall some downstream. It was easier to ford the river at the two waterfalls because at that point, it flows over hard bedrock, making the crossing much easier. The Mormons also made many attempts to construct dams on the river to provide irrigation water—as far upstream as the confluence of the river's forks and as far downstream as below Grand Falls—but most of them failed because of the Little Colorado's fickle variations in discharge. Finally, they managed to construct one at Joseph City that lasted for 29 years. Despite the continued hardships, the Mormons persisted, successfully established their colonies, and survived in the region for many decades. Later, Hispanics began to move into the Little Colorado River watershed from the Rio Grande area, establishing St. Johns and Concho. American ranchers from New Mexico also began to colonize the region, creating Eagar and Springerville.Dam that river! Ecology and Mormon settlement in the Little Colorado River Basin, p. 21 For many years, Mormons were the primary group living in the watershed until the 1960s, when their independent towns and farms were absorbed into the growing Arizonan economy. River modifications Aerial view toward Springerville, Arizona, and the region of the source of the Little Colorado River. Some farm land in the river bottom land is visible at the bottom. Because of its isolation, most of the Little Colorado has remained free of human development. However, near its headwaters, the river is dammed twice, first in River Reservoir, then in Lyman Lake, where its water is stored for irrigation. Another reservoir downstream of Springerville, where Mormon colonists dammed the river in 1905 to form Zion Reservoir, is now completely silted in. Many other earthen and masonry dams originally built along the river by the Mormons no longer exist. At very few points is the river confined by levees, with the exception of a floodwall near Holbrook. There are also few bridges for a river of its length. In one of the worst radioactive spills in the U.S. history, on July 16, 1979, of radioactive water containing uranium tailings breached into the North Fork of the Puerco River from a tailing pond of a uranium mine owned by Kerr-McGee Company and United Nuclear Corporation. Approximately 1,100 tons of uranium mine waste contaminated of land and up to of the Puerco River, traveling into the Little Colorado River as far as the Navajo Nation.

He is sometimes called \\"the Chekhov of the suburbs.\\" His fiction is mostly set in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the Westchester suburbs, old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around Quincy, Massachusetts, where he was born, and Italy, especially Rome. His short stories included \\"The Enormous Radio\\", \\"Goodbye, My Brother\\", \\"The Five- Forty-Eight\\", \\"The Country Husband\\", and \\"The Swimmer\\", and he also wrote four novels, comprising The Wapshot Chronicle (National Book Award, 1958), \\"National Book Awards – 1958\\".

The Wapshot Scandal (William Dean Howells Medal, 1965), Bullet Park (1969), Falconer (1977) and a novella Oh What a Paradise It Seems (1982). His main themes include the duality of human nature: sometimes dramatized as the disparity between a character's decorous social persona and inner corruption, and sometimes as a conflict between two characters (often brothers) who embody the salient aspects of both – light and dark, flesh and spirit. Many of his works also express a nostalgia for a vanishing way of life (as evoked by the mythical St. Botolphs in the Wapshot novels), characterized by abiding cultural traditions and a profound sense of community, as opposed to the alienating nomadism of modern suburbia. A compilation of his short stories, The Stories of John Cheever, won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and a National Book Critics Circle Award, and its first paperback edition won a 1981 National Book Award. \\"National Book Awards – 1981\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-14. With essays by Willie Perdomo, Matthew Pitt, and Robert Wilder from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog. Cheever's Stories won the 1981 award for paperback Fiction. From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Awards history there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one. On April 27, 1982, six weeks before his death, Cheever was awarded the National Medal for Literature by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His work has been included in the Library of America. Early life and education John William Cheever was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, the second child of Frederick Lincoln Cheever and Mary Liley Cheever. His father was a prosperous shoe salesman, and Cheever spent much of his childhood in a large Victorian house, at 123 Winthrop Avenue,Susan Cheever, Home Before Dark: A Personal Memoir of John Cheever by His Daughter (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1984), 84. in the then-genteel suburb of Wollaston, Massachusetts. In the mid-1920s, however, as the New England shoe and textile industries began their long decline, Frederick Cheever lost most of his money and began to drink heavily. To pay the bills, Mary Cheever opened a gift shop in downtown Quincy—an \\"abysmal humiliation\\" for the family, as John saw it.From Cheever's unpublished journal, on deposit at Houghton Library, Harvard University. In 1926, Cheever began attending Thayer Academy, a private day school, but he found the atmosphere stifling and performed poorly, and finally transferred to Quincy High in 1928. A year later he won a short story contest sponsored by the Boston Herald and was invited back to Thayer as a \\"special student\\" on academic probation. His grades continued to be poor, however, and, in March 1930, he was either expelled for smoking or (more likely) departed of his own accord when the headmaster delivered an ultimatum to the effect that he must either apply himself or leave. The 18-year-old Cheever wrote a sardonic account of this experience, titled \\"Expelled\\", which was subsequently published in The New Republic. (1930).Jon [sic] Cheever, \\"Expelled\\", The New Republic, October 1, 1930, 171–4. Around this time, Cheever's older brother Fred, forced to withdraw from Dartmouth in 1926 because of the family's financial crisis, re-entered Cheever's life \\"when the situation was most painful and critical\\", as Cheever later wrote. After the 1932 crash of Kreuger & Toll, in which Frederick Cheever had invested what was left of his money, the Cheever house on Winthrop Avenue was lost to foreclosure. The parents separated, while John and Fred took an apartment together on Beacon Hill, in Boston. In 1933, John wrote to Elizabeth Ames, the director of the Yaddo artist's colony in Saratoga Springs, New York: \\"The idea of leaving the city,\\" he said, \\"has never been so distant or desirable.\\"The Letters of John Cheever, ed. Benjamin Cheever (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), p. 33. Ames denied his first application but offered him a place the following year, whereupon Cheever decided to sever his \\"ungainly attachment\\" to his brother. Cheever spent the summer of 1934 at Yaddo, which would serve as a second home for much of his life. Career=Early writings For the next few years, Cheever divided his time between Manhattan, Saratoga, Lake George (where he was caretaker of the Yaddo-owned Triuna Island), and Quincy, where he continued to visit his parents, who had reconciled and moved to an apartment at 60 Spear Street. Cheever drove from one place to another in a dilapidated Model A roadster, but had no permanent address. In 1935, Katharine White of The New Yorker bought Cheever's story \\"Buffalo\\", for $45—the first of many that Cheever would publish in the magazine. Maxim Lieber became his literary agent, 1935–1941. In 1938, he began work for the Federal Writers' Project in Washington, D. C., which he considered an embarrassing boondoggle. As an editor for the WPA Guide to New York City, Cheever was charged with (as he put it) \\"twisting into order the sentences written by some incredibly lazy bastards.\\"The Letters of John Cheever, ed. Benjamin Cheever (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 47. He quit after less than a year and a few months later he met his future wife, Mary Winternitz, seven years his junior. She was a daughter of Milton Winternitz, dean of Yale Medical School, and granddaughter of Thomas A. Watson, an assistant to Alexander Graham Bell during the invention of the telephone. They married in 1941. Cheever enlisted in the Army on May 7, 1942. His first collection of short stories, The Way Some People Live, was published in 1943 to mixed reviews. Cheever himself came to despise the book as \\"embarrassingly immature\\", and for the rest of his life destroyed every copy he could lay his hands on. However, the book may have saved his life after falling into the hands of Major Leonard Spigelgass, an MGM executive and officer in the Army Signal Corps, who was struck by Cheever's \\"childlike sense of wonder.\\"Glad Tidings: A Friendship in Letters, ed. John D. Weaver (New York: Harper Collins, 1993), 58. Early that summer, Cheever was transferred to the former Paramount studio in Astoria, Queens, New York City, where he commuted via subway from his apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City. Meanwhile, most of his old infantry company was killed on a Normandy beach during the D-Day invasion. Cheever's daughter Susan was born on July 31, 1943. After the war, Cheever moved his family to an apartment building at 400 East 59th Street, near Sutton Place, Manhattan; almost every morning for the next five years, he would dress in his only suit and take the elevator to a maid's room in the basement, where he stripped to his boxer shorts and wrote until lunchtime. In 1946, he accepted a $4,800 advance from Random House to resume work on his novel, The Holly Tree, which he had discontinued during the war. \\"The Enormous Radio\\" appeared in the May 17, 1947, issue of The New Yorker — a Kafkaesque tale about a sinister radio that broadcasts the private conversations of tenants in a New York apartment building. A startling advance on Cheever's early, more naturalistic work, the story elicited a fan letter from the magazine's irascible editor, Harold Ross: \\"It will turn out to be a memorable one, or I am a fish.\\"Letters from the Editor: The New Yorker's Harold Ross, ed. Thomas Kunkel (New York: Modern Library, 2000), 308. Cheever's son Benjamin was born on May 4, 1948. Mid- career Cheever's work became longer and more complex, apparently a protest against the \\"slice of life\\" fiction typical of The New Yorker in those years. An early draft of \\"The Day the Pig Fell into the Well\\"—a long story with elaborate Chekhovian nuances, meant to \\"operate something like a rondo\\", as Cheever wrote to his friend and New Yorker editor William Maxwell—was completed in 1949, though the magazine did not make space for it until five years later. In 1951, Cheever wrote \\"Goodbye, My Brother\\", after a gloomy summer in Martha's Vineyard. Largely on the strength of these two stories (still in manuscript at the time), Cheever was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. On May 28, 1951, Cheever moved to Beechwood, the suburban estate of Frank A. Vanderlip, a banker,\\"How Cheever Really Felt About Living in Suburbia\\" by Joseph Berger, The New York Times, April 30, 2009 (p. CT1, 5/3/09, CT ed.). Retrieved 5/2/09. in the Westchester hamlet of Scarborough- on-Hudson, where he rented a small cottage on the edge of the estate. The house, coincidentally, had been occupied before the Cheevers by another suburban chronicler, Richard Yates. In Scarborough, he was a casual volunteer for the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department. Cheever's second collection, The Enormous Radio, was published in 1953. Reviews were mostly positive, though Cheever's reputation continued to suffer because of his close association with The New Yorker (considered middlebrow by such influential critics as Dwight Macdonald), and he was particularly pained by the general preference for J. D. Salinger's Nine Stories, published around the same time. Meanwhile, Random House demanded that Cheever either produce a publishable novel or pay back his advance, whereupon Cheever wrote Mike Bessie at Harper & Brothers (\\"These old bones are up for sale\\"), who bought him out of his Random House contract. In the summer of 1956, Cheever finished The Wapshot Chronicle while vacationing in Friendship, Maine, and received a congratulatory telegram from William Maxwell: \\"WELL ROARED LION.\\"The Letters of John Cheever, 179. With the proceeds from the sale of film rights to \\"The Housebreaker of Shady Hill\\", Cheever and his family spent the following year in Italy, where his son Federico was born on March 9, 1957 (\\"We wanted to call him Frederick\\", Cheever wrote, \\"but there is of course no K in the alphabet here and I gave up after an hour or two\\").The Letters of John Cheever, 196. The Wapshot Scandal was published in 1964, and received perhaps the best reviews of Cheever's career up to that point (amid quibbles about the novel's episodic structure). Cheever appeared on the cover of Time magazine's March 27 issue, this for an appreciative profile, \\"Ovid in Ossining.\\" (In 1961 Cheever had moved to a stately, stone-ended Dutch Colonial farmhouse in Ossining, on the east bank of the Hudson.) \\"The Swimmer\\" appeared in the July 18, 1964 issue of The New Yorker. Cheever noted with chagrin that the story (one of his best) appeared toward the back of the issue—behind a John Updike story—since, as it happened, Maxwell and other editors at the magazine were a little bewildered by its non- New Yorkerish surrealism. In the summer of 1966, a screen adaptation of \\"The Swimmer\\", starring Burt Lancaster, was filmed in Westport, Connecticut. Cheever was a frequent visitor on the set, and made a cameo appearance in the movie. By then Cheever's alcoholism had become severe, exacerbated by torment concerning his bisexuality. Still, he blamed most of his marital woes on his wife, and in 1966 he consulted a psychiatrist, David C. Hays, about her hostility and \\"needless darkness.\\" After a session with Mary Cheever, the psychiatrist asked to see the couple jointly; Cheever, heartened, believed his wife's difficult behavior would finally be addressed. At the joint session, however, Hays said (as Cheever noted in his journal) that Cheever himself was the problem: \\"a neurotic man, narcissistic, egocentric, friendless, and so deeply involved in [his] own defensive illusions that [he has] invented a manic-depressive wife.\\"The Journals of John Cheever, ed. Robert Gottlieb (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), 214. Cheever soon terminated therapy. Later life and career Bullet Park was published in 1969, and received a devastating review from Benjamin DeMott on the front page of The New York Times Book Review: \\"John Cheever's short stories are and will remain lovely birds... But in the gluey atmosphere of Bullet Park no birds sing.\\"Benjamin DeMott, New York Times Book Review, April 27, 1969, 1, 40–1. Cheever's alcoholic depression deepened, and in May he resumed psychiatric treatment (which again proved fruitless). He began an affair with actress Hope Lange in the late 1960s. On May 12, 1973, Cheever awoke coughing uncontrollably and learned at the hospital that he had almost died from pulmonary edema caused by alcoholism. After a month in the hospital, he returned home vowing never to drink again; however, he resumed drinking in August. Despite his precarious health, he spent the fall semester teaching (and drinking, both with fellow writer-teacher, Raymond Carver) at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where his students included T. C. Boyle, Allan Gurganus, and Ron Hansen. As his marriage continued to deteriorate, Cheever accepted a professorship at Boston University the following year and moved into a fourth-floor walkup apartment at 71 Bay State Road. Cheever's drinking soon became suicidal and, in March 1975, his brother Fred, now virtually indigent, but sober after his own lifelong bout with alcoholism, drove John back to Ossining. On April 9, Cheever was admitted to the Smithers Alcoholic Rehabilitation Unit in New York, where he shared a bedroom and bath with four other men. Driven home by his wife on May 7, Cheever never drank alcohol again. In March 1977, Cheever appeared on the cover of Newsweek with the caption, \\"A Great American Novel: John Cheever's Falconer.\\" The novel was No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for three weeks. The Stories of John Cheever appeared in October 1978, and became one of the most successful collections ever, selling 125,000 copies in hardback and winning universal acclaim. Cheever was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contribution to the arts by the MacDowell Colony in 1979. Personal life Cheever's marriage was complicated by his sexuality. Variously described as gay, homosexual, or bisexual, Cheever had relationships with both men and women, including a short relationship with composer Ned Rorem and an affair with actress Hope Lange. Cheever's longest lover was a student of his, Max Zimmer, who lived in the Cheever family home. Cheever's daughter, Susan, described her parents' marriage as \\"European\\", saying: \\"they were people who felt their feelings weren't necessarily a reason to shatter a family. They certainly hurt each other plenty but they didn't necessarily see that as a reason for divorce.\\" Illness and death In the summer of 1981, a tumor was discovered in Cheever's right lung, and, in late November, he returned to the hospital and learned that the cancer had spread to his femur, pelvis, and bladder. Cheever's last novel, Oh What a Paradise It Seems, was published in March 1982; the book received respectful reviews in part because it was widely known the author was dying of cancer. On April 27, he received the National Medal for Literature at Carnegie Hall, where colleagues were shocked by Cheever's ravaged appearance after months of cancer therapy. \\"A page of good prose\\", he declared in his remarks, \\"remains invincible.\\" John Updike wrote that \\"All the literary acolytes assembled there fell quite silent, astonished by such faith.\\" Cheever died on June 18, 1982. The flags in Ossining were lowered to half staff for 10 days after Cheever's death. He is buried at First Parish Cemetery, Norwell, Massachusetts.Wilson, Scott.

Posthumous In 1987, Cheever's widow, Mary, signed a contract with a small publisher, Academy Chicago, for the right to publish Cheever's uncollected short stories. The contract led to a long legal battle and a book of 13 stories by the author entitled Fall River and Other Uncollected Stories, published in 1994 by Academy Chicago Publishers. Two of Cheever's children, Susan and Benjamin, became writers. Susan's memoir, Home Before Dark (1984), revealed Cheever's bisexuality, which was confirmed by his posthumously published letters and journals. This was parodied to comedic effect in a 1992 episode of the TV sitcom Seinfeld, when the character Susan discovers explicit love letters from Cheever to her father. After Blake Bailey published his biography of Richard Yates, A Tragic Honesty (2003), Cheever's son Ben suggested Bailey write an authoritative biography of Cheever. The book was published by Knopf on March 10, 2009 and won that year's National Book Critics Circle Award in Biography and the Francis Parkman Prize, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer and James Tait Black Memorial Prize.Wolff, Geoffrey. \\"Suburban Suffering,\\" New York Times Book Review, March 15, 2009, 1, 8-9.

It is approximately long and wide and connects Newark Bay with Upper New York Bay. The Robbins Reef Light marks the eastern end of the Kill, Bergen Point its western end. It is spanned by the Bayonne Bridge and is one of the most heavily traveled waterways in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Historically, it has been one of the most important channels for the commerce of the region, providing a passage for marine traffic between Upper New York Bay and the industrial towns of northeastern New Jersey. During the colonial era, it played a significant role in travel between New York and the southern colonies, with passengers changing from ferries to coaches at Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth). Since the final third of the 20th century, it has provided the principal access for oceangoing container ships to Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the busiest port facility in the eastern United States, and Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The strait has required continued dredging and deepening to accommodate the passage of ever-larger ships. In many areas, the sandy bottom has been excavated down to rock and now requires blasting.Ports and waterways safety: Kill Van Kull Channel et al., NY and NJ, Federal Register, April 15, 1999 (Nbr.

Etymology Kill Van Kull translates as \\"channel of the pass\\" or \\"ridge\\". Nearby is the Arthur Kill, the name of which is an Anglicization of achter kill meaning \\"back channel\\", referring to its location \\"behind\\" Staten Island. The name \\"Kill Van Kull\\" originated in the early 17th century, during the Dutch colonial era, when the region was part of New Netherland. Places were named by early explorers and settlers in reference to their shape, topography, or other geographic qualities. The area around Newark Bay was called Achter Kol. The bay lies behind Bergen Hill, the emerging ridge of the Hudson Palisades which begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between it and the Upper New York Bay. Behind or achter the ridge was a col or mountain pass to the interior. Kill comes from the Middle Dutch word kille meaning creek. The bay was known as Cull Bay during the British colonial era.

Although her conservative family struggled to accept the fact that she was a lesbian, they remained close throughout her life. Much of her later poetry works were devoted to children (e.g. the collection Iconographs, 1970). She also translated the work of contemporary Swedish poets, including the selected poems of Nobel laureate Tomas Tranströmer.  Personal life  Swenson attended Utah State University in Logan, Utah, graduating in the class of 1934 with a bachelor's degree. She taught poetry as poet-in-residence at Bryn Mawr College, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of California, Riverside, Purdue University, and Utah State University. From 1959 to 1966 she worked as an manuscript reviewer at New Directions Publishing. Swenson left New Directions Press in 1966 in an effort to focus completely on her own writing.Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios & More - May Swenson She also served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1980 until her death in 1989. She is buried in the Logan City Cemetery, and her grave is marked by a granite bench on which is etched some of her poetry. For the last twenty years of her life, she lived in Sea Cliff, New York. In 1936, Swenson worked as an editor and ghostwriter for a man called \\"Plat\\", who became her \\"boyfriend.\\" \\"I think I should like to have a son by Plat\\", she wrote in her diary, \\"but I would not like to be married to any man, but only be myself.\\"May Swenson: A Poet's Life in Photos by R.

Her poem Question was also published in Stephenie Meyer's book The Host. Awards and recognition She received much recognition for her work. Some of which include: *American Introductions Prize in 1955; *William Rose Benet Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1959; *Longview Foundation Award in 1959; *National Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1960; *Brandeis University Creative Arts Award in 1967; *Lucy Martin Donnelly Award of Bryn Mawr College in 1968; *Shelley Poetry Award in 1968 *Guggenheim fellowship in 1959, *Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship in 1960, *Ford Foundation grant in 1964 *Bollingen Prize for poetry in 1981, *MacArthur Fellowship in 1987. Style, imagery and eroticism Swenson created poems in \\"iconograph\\" style, first published in her 1970 book Iconographs, in which Swenson shaped lines of her poetry to create images relating to the poem's content. Her work \\"The Lowering\\", for instance, a memorial poem for Robert F. Kennedy, explored the late Kennedy's military funeral, with lines arranged in the shape of a folded flag. Swenson is known for her heavy use of natural imagery, mixed with religious and philosophical themes. Her poem \\"By Morning\\", which was published in The New Yorker compares a snowfall to the biblical fall of manna. Swenson's sense of imagery also lends itself to erotic poems, as she describes human bodies, breasts and limbs and the \\"pelvic heave of mountains.\\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/blue Author Jean Gould describes Swenson's work as \\"sensual as well as sexual.\\" Legacy Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, houses most of Swenson's documents and original manuscripts.

Established as the first and highest order of chivalry of the Russian Empire in 1698, it was abolished under the USSR before being re-established as the top Russian order in 1998.  Russian Empire  The \\"Jewel\\" (Badge) of the Imperial Order of St. Andrew, obverse (left) and reverse (right) Origins The Order was established in 1698 by Tsar Peter the Great, in honour of Saint Andrew, the first apostle of Jesus and patron saint of Russia. It was bestowed in a single class and was only awarded for the most outstanding civilian or military merit. Peter learned of the practice of bestowing awards from his travels in the West during the Great Embassy. In the past, service to the Russian state was rewarded with money or large estates. He witnessed first hand the awards ceremonies for England's Order of the Garter and Austria's Order of the Golden Fleece and noticed the loyalty and pride of the awardees. It also saved the state land and money. Count Fyodor Golovin was the first recipient of the order. Until its abolition following the Russian Revolution of 1917, just over one thousand awards had been made. During the monarchy, recipients of the Order of St. Andrew also automatically received the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Order of the White Eagle, the Order of St. Anne first class, and the Order St. Stanislaus first class. Moreover, recipients of lower ranks were automatically promoted to the rank of lieutenant general or vice admiral. The Order of Saint Andrew continued to be awarded by the Russian Imperial House in exile. The first post revolutionary presentation was to HH Prince Georgy Konstantinovich of Russia on attaining his dynastic majority in April 1923.:ru:Пожалования титулов и орденов Российской империи после 1917 года Insignia Decoration with collar (left) and with sash and star (right) The insignia of the order consisted of: * Badge: an enameled crowned black double-headed eagle bearing a blue St. Andrew's Cross (saltire) with St. Andrew crucified upon it; on the arms of the saltire were the Latin letters 'SAPR' ('St. Andrew, Patron of Russia'). It was worn on a pale blue sash over the right shoulder, or on special occasions on an elaborate 'collar' (chain). * Star: eight-pointed silver star bearing a miniature of the badge on a golden background at the center, surrounded by the motto \\"For Faith and Loyalty\\" (Russian: Za Veru i Vernost') on a blue ring. It was worn on the left chest. The insignia of the order could be awarded \\"with diamonds\\" as a special distinction. Saint Andrew's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg was the chapter church of this order of chivalry.

The order was officially re-instated as the highest Russian civilian and military award by Presidential Decree No.757 on June 1, 1998. The Order's award criteria were modified by Presidential Decree 1099 of September 7, 2010.  Statute of the Order  The Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called is used to award prominent statesmen and public figures, eminent representatives of science, culture, the arts and various industries for exceptional services, for promoting the prosperity, grandeur and glory of Russia. The Order may also be awarded to foreign heads of states for outstanding service to the Russian Federation. Unlike the original Imperial institution, the modern Order does not have special robes nor strict rules regulating its wearing. The collar, the sash and the star of the Imperial Order were only worn with uniform or full evening dress; the insignia are nowadays may be worn on lounge suits and at least one recipient was seen wearing the order dressed in lounge suit without a tie, something that would be unheard of during the Imperial era. The collar of the original Order was worn across the shoulders; modern recipients tend to wear it as a chain around the neck.  Insignia  The design of the insignia of the modern Order of St. Andrew has changed very little from the imperial design. It consists of: * a badge (double-headed eagle) attached to a chain (called a \\"collar\\") worn around the neck for very special circumstances, or more commonly on a 100mm-wide blue sash worn over the right shoulder * a star worn on the left breast The colour of the sash differs from the colour of the Imperial era, and resembles the shade of the sash of the British Order of the Garter. Members of the military division of the Order have crossed swords added below the crown above the two eagles' heads. On the reverse of the eagle on a white ribbon the motto of the Order appears inscribed in gold letters: «За веру и верность» (\\"For faith and loyalty\\").

Newark Bay is a tidal bay at the confluence of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers in northeastern New Jersey. It is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the largest container shipping facility in Port of New York and New Jersey, the third largest and one of the busiest in the United States. An estuary, it is periodically dredged to accommodate ocean-going ships. Geography Newark Bay is rectangular, approximately long, varying in width from . It is enclosed on the west by the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, and on the east by Jersey City and Bayonne. At the south is Staten Island, New York and at the north Kearny Point and Droyer's Point mark the mouth of the Hackensack. Shooters Island is a bird sanctuary where the borders of Staten Island, Bayonne and Elizabeth meet at one point. The southern tip of Bergen Neck, known as Bergen Point, juts into the bay and lent its name to the former Bergen Point Lighthouse. Built offshore in 1849 it was demolished and replaced with a skeletal tower in the mid 20th century.Bergen Point Lighthouse, 1849-1949, New Jersey Lighthouse Society. The Atlantic Ocean at Sandy Hook and Rockaway Point is approximately away and reached by tidal straits dredged to maintain shipping lanes. Newark Bay is connected to Upper New York Bay by the Kill Van Kull and to Raritan Bay by the Arthur Kill. The names of the channels reflect the period of Dutch colonialization. The area around the bay was called Achter Kol, which translates as behind or beyond the ridge and refers to Bergen Hill. The emergence of the Hudson Palisades begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between the bay and the Hudson River. Kill in Dutch means stream or channel. During the British colonial era the bay was known as Cull bay. Kill van Kull literally translates as channel from the ridge. Arthur Kill is an anglicization of achter kill meaning back channel, which would speak to its location behind Staten Island. Many of the maritime and distribution facilities along the bay are part of Foreign Trade Zone 49PANYNJ FTZ 49 Bridges The bay is spanned by the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge which carries the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. The Upper Bay Bridge is a vertical lift bridge north of the Casciano that is now used by CSX Transportation for freight shipment, including the notable Juice Train. Central Railroad of New Jersey's Newark Bay Bridge crossed the bay from 1864 to connect its Communipaw Terminal. Last used in 1978, it was determined to be a hazard to maritime navigation and demolished in the 1980s. Shoreline=Elizabethport to the Ironbound Elizabeth is the site of the first English speaking European settlement (1675) in New Jersey, its port at the southern end of the bay a major maritime hub during the colonial era. Jersey Gardens, an outlet mall, has been located north of Elizabethport since 1999. There are plans to construct a mixed used community adjacent to it along the bay.$2B MXD Planned for Elizabeth Waterfront The western edge of Newark Bay was originally shallow tidal wetlands covering approximately . In 1910s the City of Newark began excavating an angled shipping channel in the northeastern quadrant of the wetland which formed the basis of Port Newark. Work on the channel and terminal facilities on its north side accelerated during World War I, when the federal government took control of Port Newark. During the war there were close to 25,000 troops stationed at the Newark Bay Shipyard.Newark Bay Shipyard The CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge, demolished in the 1980s, crossed to Elizabethport, seen in the distance. The City decided to expand the port at the end of the war. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was formed in 1921of New York and New Jersey and the Newark Bay Channels were authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Acts in 1922. Shipping operations languished after the war, and in 1927, the City of Newark started construction of Newark Liberty International Airport on the northwest quadrant of the wetlands which lay between Port Newark and the edge of the developed city. Port Authority took over the operations of Port Newark and the Newark Airport in 1948 and began modernizing and expanding both facilities southward. In 1958, the Port Authority dredged another shipping channel which straightened the course of Bound Brook, the tidal inlet forming the boundary between Newark and Elizabeth. Dredged materials was used to create new upland south of the new Elizabeth Channel, where the Port Authority constructed the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The first shipping facility to open upon the Elizabeth Channel was the new Sea-Land Container Terminal, which was the prototype for virtually every other container terminal constructed thereafter. The Ironbound is an industrial area along the bay which becomes residential farther inland near Downtown Newark. Kearny Point The Central Railroad of New Jersey first built the Newark and New York Railroad across the rivers and tip of New Barbadoes Neck in 1869. One bridge was taken out of service in 1946 after a ship collided into it. Passenger service on the other, the PD Draw, was discontinued in 1967. The Kearny Point peninsula is site of the River Terminal, a massive distribution facility.River Terminal It comprises the former Western Electric Kearny Works and Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, the shipyards of which operated from 1917 to 1949 and played a prominent role in both World War I and World War II.Kearny Yard Bergen Point to Droyer's Point The shoreline at Bayonne While there was some maritime development on the eastern banks of the bay closer Bergen Point most of the eastern shore abuts residential and recreational areas. The Hackensack RiverWalk is a partially completed linear park greenway intended to link the string of parks along its banks and that of the Hackensack River from the Bayonne Bridge to the Hackensack Meadowlands in Secaucus and North Bergen. In Bayonne much of the bay has not seen bulkhead development, and hence has a natural shore line. The city's largest parks are its shores.Hackenack Riverwalk Plan proposal 2003 Hudson County Master Plan At Droyer's Point recreational and residential development have included a promenade. Howland Hook The Howland Hook Marine Terminal is a container port facility located at the northwestern corner of Staten Island at the entrance to the Arthur Kill. Nearby is Port Ivory, named for the Ivory Soap plant once located there. To the east is the residential neighborhood of Mariners Harbor which overlooks the bay. In the first half of the 20th century, Bethlehem Steel maintained a plant which built military transports during World War I and World War II.Mariners Harbor ShipyardBethlehem Shipbuilding: List of Ships built at Staten Island Currently, tugboat companies and number of smaller dry docks operate along the shore. Pollution and marine life The watershed which drains into the bay The bay is notoriously polluted, and it is now a Superfund site. \\"One blue crab in Newark Bay has enough dioxin to give somebody cancer,\\" said David Pringle, spokesman for Clean Water Action. Both the tributaries, particularly the Passaic River, have sections which are lined with heavy industry.\\"Watershed Database and Mapping Projects/Newark Bay (New Jersey).\\" National Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration. Silver Spring, MD. March 2007. Some industrial facilities discharged wastes into the tributaries during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, prior to passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act. High levels of PCBs and dioxin have been detected in the bay. It also has high levels of mercury, copper and other toxic chemicals. While illegal discharges of chemical waste have been stopped, crabbing is illegal and fishing is limited due to chemicals that remain in the sediment. Pronounced endocrine disruption and reproductive effects have been reported in Newark Bay Mummichog, often used as a sentinel and bioindicator species. Reproductive effects reported are primarily due to a chemical inhibition of vitellogenesis and oogenesis, which are highly conserved processes for oviparous (egg-laying) animals. Killifish within Newark Bay have also been reported to chemically adapt (desensitize) to aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediated pollutants (i.e. dioxins). Killifish within Newark Bay have emerged as a popular tool for studying population effects of historical and emerging chemicals of concern due to their chronic exposure to complex mixtures of common contaminants, and subsequent effects due to living within a polluted environment. 2008 Liberian Freighter Collision  In January 2008, a 117 ft. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company dredge in Newark Bay was struck by a 669-ft Liberian-flagged orange juice freighter named the Orange Sun. Newark Bay had to be closed for five hours by the U.S. Coast Guard until damages to the GLD&D; dredge were mitigated. The dredge had begun to take on water and a diving crew was sent in order to make repairs. In December 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report that blamed the Orange Sun for the accident. The Orange Sun's master had not informed the captain or crew about the ship's tendency to deviate from its course.

Matthew Flinders was the first European to reach Port Lincoln under his commission by the British Admiralty to chart Australia's unexplored coastline. On 25 February 1802, Flinders sailed his exploration vessel HMS Investigator into the harbour, which he later named Port Lincoln after the city of Lincoln in his native county of Lincolnshire in England. A couple of months later on 19 April, Nicolas Baudin entered the same port and named it Port Champagny. Sealers had visited the area around 1828 and the mainly French whaling ships were fishing the local bays and island regions by the 1820s and up to the 1840s. In 1836 Governor Sir John Hindmarsh, the first Governor of South Australia, gave instructions to Colonel William Light of finding a capital for the 'New British Province of South Australia'. He'd been in the colony for four months and in all that time he'd been trying to find a right place for a harbour, and a right place for a settlement. With boatfuls of immigrants set to arrive and impatient settlers already camping at Holdfast Bay, Rapid Bay and Kangaroo Island, Light was under immense pressure to identify a location with a suitable harbour, sufficient agricultural land and fresh water. After assessing a number of other potential locations, Light was ordered by England to consider Port Lincoln as a possible site for the capital. While Thomas Lipson had arrived in Port Lincoln earlier and approved of its 'beautiful harbour' and 'fertile land', Light was unconvinced from the beginning as he faced fierce westerly gales, ill-placed islands and rocky reefs on arrival. Light decided it might be dangerous for merchant ships trying to enter the unfamiliar territory after a long voyage and that there was not enough of what he thought was good agricultural land, and not enough fresh water to sustain a city so he decided to choose Adelaide as the most suitable place for settlement. Port Lincoln however, proved popular with pioneers and developers, with the first settlers arriving on 19 March 1839 aboard the ships Abeona, Porter and Dorset. On 3 October 1839 Governor George Gawler proclaimed the whole area from Cape Catastrophe to the head of the Spencer Gulf as one district, which he named the District of Port Lincoln. In 1840 one year after settlement, the population of Port Lincoln was 270. There were 30 stone houses, a hotel, blacksmith's shop and a store in the Happy Valley area. Around this time, Edward John Eyre explored the peninsula that was subsequently named in his honour. In early 1842, local Aboriginal resistance to the British invasion and settlement became so successful that it prompted the near abandonment of Port Lincoln. As a result, Governor George Grey ordered a detachment of the 96th Regiment of the British Army under the command of Lieutenant Hugonin to enforce control in the area. After an initial defeat at Pillaworta, the 96th in combination with the Mounted Police and armed settlers were able to restore full British authority by the end of 1843. A section of Native Police were later deployed to the area to maintain this control. Local Government formally began on the Eyre Peninsula on 1 July 1880 with the establishment of the District Council of Lincoln. The township of Port Lincoln naturally was included in that area. On 18 August 1921 the Municipality of Port Lincoln was formally proclaimed. By 1936 the population had grown to 3200 and the town had a first class water supply. The port had become the commercial pivot for the area, providing for its many agricultural and commercial requirements. City status was granted to Port Lincoln on 21 January 1971 and the proclamation was read at the opening of the tenth annual Tunarama Festival on the Australia Day weekend. Water supply The lack of a reliable surface water supply was a factor preventing Port Lincoln from being proclaimed the colony's capital city in the 1830s. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln outgrew its fresh water supplies. It is now largely dependent on water drawn from groundwater basins in the south of the peninsula. The southern and western parts of the Eyre Peninsula region also share this resource via the Tod-Ceduna pipeline. The Iron Knob to Kimba pipeline completed in 2007 provides limited transfer capacity of River Murray water into the Tod-Ceduna system. Following the development of a long term water supply plan for Eyre Peninsula, the South Australian government is progressing detailed investigation of augmentation options.

The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System brings cold, nutrient-rich water into nearby waters of the Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf. These upwellings support lucrative fisheries, including that of the southern bluefin tuna and sardine.Ward, T. M., McLeay, L. J., Dimmlich, W. F., Rogers, P.

Fisheries Oceanography, 15: 191–207. Climate Port Lincoln has a warm- summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk), with warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters. January temperatures average , while in July temperatures range from . Winter days are cool and cloudy, with frequent light drizzle and showers. Cold fronts cause periods of heavy rain and colder temperatures in winter, and violent storms can occasionally roll in from the southern ocean. Summers are mild to warm with cool sea breezes keeping the temperatures generally below . However, on rare occasions a severe blast of heat from the deserts to the north can cause several days of temperatures well over . Rainfall in summer is limited to very infrequent showers or thunderstorms and sometimes during summer, no rain occurs at all. Snow has never been recorded and frost is a very rare occurrence, usually happening only on clear winter nights away from the coast. Extremes have ranged from to , while the wettest month on record was June 1981, recording . Government Port Lincoln is located in the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Flinders and the local government area of City of Port Lincoln. Economy The economy is based on the huge grain-handling facilities (with a total capacity of over 337,500 tonnes), the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market.Tim Treadgold, The future is Fish: Japan's taste for tuna is creating millionaires in a tiny Australian town\\" Forbes Magazine, 22 May 2006 Home of Australia's largest commercial fishing fleet, Port Lincoln now has a thriving aquaculture industry that farms the following species: southern bluefin tuna, yellowtail kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimentally, seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the advent of aquaculture, the main fishing was for southern bluefin tuna. Frank Moorhouse recommended the South Australian government lend the Haldane family 20,000 pounds which they used to build a super vessel. The MFV Tacoma was Australia's first purpose-built tuna fishing vessel. It revolutionised the industry and began catching the fish off the coast of Port Lincoln in the early 1950s. The city also functions as a regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula; however, many state government functions are gradually being withdrawn as they become more centralised in Adelaide. During the early years of this century, housing demand has led to a boom in property development, both residential and commercial.

Culture The book Blue Fin by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln, with the movie of the same name filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of ANZAC Cove scenes in Gallipoli were also filmed near Port Lincoln. The first edition of Australian Survivor, the Australian version of the popular US television series, Survivor, was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001. The Discovery Channel documentary series Tuna Wranglers (2007) and Abalone Wars were both filmed in and around Port Lincoln. Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the 4-masted barque Moshulu, which anchored outside of Boston Island. Moshulu had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer), but there was no grain to be had there, even though Moshulu waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. Moshulu eventually carried on to Port Victoria for cargo. During the 1939 season, Passat and Lawhill were also present at Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his experiences on the round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book The Last Grain Race (1956), and several pictures of Port Lincoln as it appeared in 1939 are included in his photo-essay of his voyage, Learning the Ropes. On the TV show Neighbours, the Brennan brothers, Tyler, Mark and Aaron, are originally from Port Lincoln.Tyler Brennan biography at The Perfect Blend Media Historically, South Australia's first rural newspaper, the Port Lincoln Herald, owned by Robert Thomas, was published on 10 April 1839, before ceasing publication in September 1840. According to the first edition, \\"...The object of the proprietors...is to promulgate just accounts of the capabilities of the only safe and commodious harbour yet known within the territories of South Australia.\\" Only six issues were released, with the first edition being printed in Hindley Street, Adelaide, and the second issue arriving seven months later, after being printed in a hut at Port Lincoln. The Western Weekly News (22 March 1902 – 1904) was also briefly published in the town, as was another short lived, but outspoken publication, called Challenger (28 May 1932 - 4 June 1934), a sister publication of the West Coast Recorder. The town was also the base of the Port Lincoln, Tumby and West Coast Recorder (22 July 1904 – 6 October 1909), later known as the West Coast Recorder (1909-1942), which was then absorbed by the Port Lincoln Times. These days, Port Lincoln has one local newspaper (the Port Lincoln Times), a Rural Press publication first issued on 5 August 1927. It is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays and is printed in Murray Bridge at the high-tech Rural Press printing centre.

In 1779, Laurens gained approval from the Continental Congress for his plan to recruit a brigade of 3,000 slaves by promising them freedom in return for fighting. The plan was defeated by political opposition in South Carolina. Laurens was killed in the Battle of the Combahee River in August 1782. Early life and education John Laurens was born in Charleston, South Carolina on October 28, 1754, to Henry Laurens and Eleanor Ball Laurens, both of whose families were prosperous as planters cultivating rice. By the 1750s, Henry Laurens and his business partner George Austin had become wealthy as owners of one of the largest slave trading houses in North America. John was the eldest of the five children who survived infancy. John and his two younger brothers, Henry Jr. and James, were tutored at home, but after the death of their mother, their father took them to England for their education. His two sisters, Martha and Mary, remained with an uncle in Charleston. In October 1771, Laurens's father moved with his sons to London, and Laurens was educated in Europe from the ages of 16 to 22. For two years beginning in June 1772, he and one brother attended school in Geneva, Switzerland, where they lived with a family friend. As a youth, Laurens had expressed considerable interest in science and medicine, but upon returning to London in August 1774, he yielded to his father's wish that he study law. In November 1774, Laurens began his legal studies at the Middle Temple. Laurens's father returned to Charleston, leaving Laurens as guardian to his brothers, both enrolled in British schools. On October 26, 1776, Laurens married Martha Manning, the daughter of a mentor and family friend. Laurens's brother-in-law was William Manning, Governor of the Bank of England and Member of Parliament. Laurens remained determined to join the Continental Army and fight for his country, rather than to complete law school in England and raise a family there. He embarked for Charleston in December 1776, leaving his pregnant wife behind in London with her family. Military and diplomatic career=Service as Washington's aide-de-camp Laurens arrived at Charleston in April 1777. That summer he accompanied his father from Charleston to Philadelphia, where his father was to serve in the Continental Congress. Henry Laurens, finding himself unable to prevent his son from joining the Continental Army, used his influence to obtain a position of honor for his 23-year-old son. General George Washington invited Laurens to join his staff in early August, as a volunteer aide-de-camp. Washington wrote: Laurens became close friends with two of his fellow aides-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette. He quickly became known for his reckless courage upon first seeing combat on September 11, 1777, at the Battle of Brandywine during the Philadelphia campaign. Lafayette observed, \\"It was not his fault that he was not killed or wounded [at Brandywine,] he did everything that was necessary to procure one or t'other.\\" Laurens behaved consistently at the Battle of Germantown, in which he was wounded on October 4, 1777: Headquarters at Emlen House in late 1777 Two days after the Battle of Germantown, on October 6, 1777, he was given his official appointment as one of General Washington's aides-de-camp, and was commissioned with the rank of lieutenant colonel. From November 2 to December 11, 1777, Washington and several aides, including Laurens, were quartered at the Emlen House, north of Philadelphia in Camp Hill, which served as Washington's headquarters through the Battle of White Marsh. After spending the remainder of the winter of 1777–1778 encamped at Valley Forge, Laurens marched to New Jersey with the rest of the Continental Army at the end of June 1778, to face the British at the Battle of Monmouth. Near the start of battle, Laurens had his horse shot out from under him while he did reconnaissance for Baron von Steuben. On December 23, 1778, Laurens engaged in a duel with General Charles Lee just outside Philadelphia, after Laurens took offense to Lee's slander of Washington's character. Lee was wounded in the side by Laurens's first shot and the affair was ended by the men's seconds, Alexander Hamilton and Evan Edwards, before Laurens or Lee could fire a second shot. Anti-slavery statements and recruitment of black soldiers Lt. Col. John Laurens, 1871 engraving by H.B. Hall As the British stepped up operations in the South, Laurens promoted the idea of arming slaves and granting them freedom in return for their service. He had written, \\"We Americans at least in the Southern Colonies, cannot contend with a good Grace, for Liberty, until we shall have enfranchised our Slaves.\\" Laurens was set apart from other leaders in Revolutionary-era South Carolina by his belief that black and white people shared a similar nature and could aspire to freedom in a republican society. In early 1778, Laurens advised his father, who was then the President of the Continental Congress, to use forty slaves he stood to inherit as part of a brigade. Henry Laurens granted the request, but with reservations that caused postponement of the project. Congress approved the concept of a regiment of slaves in March 1779, and sent Laurens south to recruit a regiment of 3,000 black soldiers; however, the plan was opposed, and Laurens was ultimately unsuccessful. Having won election to the South Carolina House of Representatives, Laurens introduced his black regiment plan in 1779, again in 1780, and a third time in 1782, meeting overwhelming rejection each time. Governor John Rutledge and General Christopher Gadsden were among the opponents. Battles in South Carolina In 1779, when the British threatened Charleston, Governor Rutledge proposed to surrender the city with the condition that Carolina become neutral in the war. Laurens strongly opposed the idea, and fought with Continental forces to repel the British. =Battle of Coosawhatchie= On May 3, 1779, Colonel William Moultrie's troops, outnumbered two to one, faced 2,400 British regulars under General Augustine Prévost, who had crossed the Savannah River. At a point about two miles east of the Coosawhatchie River, Moultrie had left 100 men to guard a river crossing and provide warning when the British arrived. Due to Laurens's connections, his activities could not escape notice; for example, in a May 5 letter to the governor of Virginia, South Carolina's lieutenant governor Thomas Bee added a postscript: \\"Col. John Laurens received a slight wound in the arm in a skirmish with the enemy's advanced party yesterday, & his horse was shot also – he is in a good way – pray let his father know this.\\" =Battles of Savannah and Charleston= That fall, Laurens commanded an infantry regiment in General Benjamin Lincoln's failed assault on Savannah, Georgia. Prisoner of war Laurens was taken prisoner by the British in May 1780, after the fall of Charleston. As a prisoner of war, he was shipped to Philadelphia, where he was paroled with the condition that he would not leave Pennsylvania. In Philadelphia, Laurens was able to visit his father, who would soon take ship for the Netherlands as American ambassador, in search of loans. During the voyage to his post, Henry Laurens's ship was seized by the British, resulting in the elder Laurens' imprisonment in the Tower of London. Determined to return to South Carolina, and in the expectation of being freed by a prisoner exchange in November 1780, Laurens wrote to George Washington and requested a leave of absence from his service as aide-de-camp: Washington responded, \\"The motives which led you to the Southward are too laudable and too important not to meet my approbation.\\" Diplomatic mission to France Upon his release, Laurens was unwillingly appointed by Congress in December 1780 as a special minister to France. Preferring to return to the South, he had originally refused the post and proposed Alexander Hamilton as the better candidate. Laurens was ultimately persuaded by both Hamilton and Congress to accept the post. He wrote again to advise Washington that \\"unfortunately for America, Col. Hamilton was not sufficiently known to Congress to unite their suffrages in his favor and I was assured there remained no other alternative to my acceptance than the total failure of the business. Thus circumstanced I was reduced to submit—and renounce my plan of participating in the southern campaign.\\" In March 1781, Laurens and Thomas Paine arrived in France to assist Benjamin Franklin, who had been serving as the American minister in Paris since 1777. Together, they met with King Louis XVI, among others. Laurens gained French assurances that French ships would support American operations that year; the promised naval support was later to prove invaluable at the Siege of Yorktown. Laurens was also reported to have told the French that without aid for the Revolution, the Americans might be forced by the British to fight against France. When Laurens and Paine returned to America in August 1781, they brought 2.5 million livres in silver, the first part of a French gift of 6 million and a loan of 10 million. Laurens also was able to arrange a loan and supplies from the Dutch, before returning home. His father Henry Laurens, the American ambassador to the Netherlands who had been captured by the British, was exchanged for General Cornwallis in late 1781, and the senior Laurens had proceeded to the Netherlands to continue loan negotiations. British surrender at Yorktown Detail of Surrender of Lord Cornwallis by John Trumbull, showing Colonels Alexander Hamilton, John Laurens, and Walter Stewart Laurens returned from France in time to see the French fleet arrive and to join Washington in Virginia at the Siege of Yorktown. He was given command of a battalion of light infantry on October 1, 1781, when its commander was killed. Laurens, under the command of Colonel Alexander Hamilton, led the battalion in the storming of Redoubt No. 10. British troops surrendered on October 17, 1781, and Washington appointed Laurens as the American commissioner for drafting formal terms of the British surrender. Louis-Marie, Vicomte de Noailles, a relative of Lafayette's wife, was chosen by Rochambeau to represent the interests of France. At Moore House on October 18, 1781, Laurens and the French commissioner negotiated terms with two British representatives, and the articles of capitulation were signed by General Cornwallis the following day. Return to Charleston Laurens returned to South Carolina, where he continued to serve in the Continental Army under General Nathanael Greene until his death. As head of Greene's \\"intelligence department\\", stationed on the outskirts of the city near Wappoo Creek, Laurens created and operated a network of spies who tracked British operations in and around Charleston, and was given responsibility for guarding Greene's lines of secret communication with the British-occupied city. Death at Combahee River On August 27, 1782, at the age of 27, Laurens was shot from his saddle during the Battle of the Combahee River, as one of the last casualties of the Revolutionary War. Laurens died in what General Greene described sadly as \\"a paltry little skirmish\\" with a foraging party, only a few weeks before the British finally withdrew from Charleston. Laurens had been confined to bed at Wappoo Creek with a raging fever for several days, possibly due to malaria. When he learned that the British were sending a large force out of Charleston to gather supplies, he left his sickbed, \\"wrote a hurried note to Gen. Greene, and, in disregard of his orders and the important duties with which he had been charged – a practice which the loose discipline of the American forces rendered not unusual – put off for the scene of action.\\" On August 26, Laurens reported to General Mordecai Gist near the Combahee River. Gist had learned that 300 British troops under Major William Brereton had already captured a ferry and crossed the river, in search of rice to feed their garrison. Gist sent a detachment with orders to attack the British before sunrise the next morning. Laurens was given orders, at his own request, to take a small force further downriver to man a redoubt at Chehaw Point, where they could fire on the British as they retreated. Laurens and his troops stopped for the night at a plantation house near the Combahee River. Laurens got little or no sleep, instead \\"spending the evening in a delightful company of ladies... [and] turned from this happy scene only two hours before he was to march down the river\\". With his command, Laurens left the plantation at about 3:00 am on the morning of August 27. Leading a force of fifty Delaware infantrymen, and an artillery captain with a howitzer, Laurens rode toward Chehaw Point. However, the British had anticipated their maneuvers; before Laurens could reach the redoubt, 140 British soldiers had prepared an ambush along the road, concealed in tall grass about one mile from his destination. When the enemy rose to fire, Laurens ordered an immediate charge, despite the British having superior numbers and the stronger position. Gist was only two miles away, and quickly approaching with reinforcements. According to William McKennan, a captain under Laurens's command, Laurens appeared \\"anxious to attack the enemy previous to the main body coming up,\\" gambling that his troops, \\"although few in numbers, [would be] sufficient to enable him to gain a laurel for his brow\\" before the end of the fighting. McKennan's opinion was that Laurens \\"wanted to do all himself, and have all the honor.\\" As Laurens led the charge, the British immediately opened fire, and Laurens fell from his horse fatally wounded. Gist's larger force arrived in time to cover a retreat, but was unable to prevent costly losses, including three American dead. After Laurens's death, Colonel Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had been a friend of Laurens, came from North Carolina to take his place in the final weeks of battle near Charleston, also taking over Laurens's intelligence network in the area. Laurens was buried near the site of the battle, at William Stock's plantation where he had spent the evening before his death. After Henry Laurens returned from imprisonment in London, he had his son's remains moved and reinterred on his own property, the Mepkin Plantation. The Laurens family sold their plantation in the 19th century, and in 1936 it was purchased by publisher Henry Luce and his wife Clare Boothe Luce. In 1949, the Luces donated a large part of the former plantation, including an extensive landscape garden, to the Trappists for use as a monastery. As Mepkin Abbey and the Mepkin Abbey Botanical Garden, located near Moncks Corner, South Carolina, the site is open to the public, including the Laurens family graveyard on the monastery grounds. Personal life=Marriage and children Marriage record for John Laurens and Martha Manning On October 26, 1776, Laurens married Martha Manning in London. Her father, one of Henry Laurens's business agents, was a mentor and family friend whose home Laurens had frequently visited during his years in London. Laurens wrote to an uncle, \\"Pity has obliged me to marry\\", an unplanned marriage being necessary to preserve his honor, the reputation of the six-month pregnant Martha, and the legitimacy of their child. Laurens and his new wife moved from London to a home in Chelsea, but Laurens was zealous in his patriotism and unwilling to remain in England, believing that honor and duty required him to fight in the American Revolution. In December 1776, he sailed for Charleston. His pregnant wife, unable to risk a months-long journey by sea during wartime, stayed behind with her family in London. Laurens's only child, their daughter Frances Eleanor Laurens (1777–1860), was born and baptized on February 18, 1777. Laurens' father-in-law wrote to him that the infant had \\"undergone much pain, & misery by a swelling in her hip, & thigh, I believe from a hurt by the carelessness of the nurse\\". Fanny was not expected to live, but by July 1777, she had recovered from a successful surgery to her hip. At the age of eight, after the loss of both parents, Fanny was brought to Charleston in May 1785, and was raised there by John Laurens's sister Martha Laurens Ramsay and her husband. Against the wishes of the Ramsays, Fanny eloped in 1795 with Francis Henderson, a Scottish merchant. Later in life, she was married to James Cunnington, and died in South Carolina at the age of 83. Laurens had one grandson, Francis Henderson Jr. (1800–1847), a South Carolina lawyer who died young after struggling with alcoholism, and who did not marry or have children. Sexuality and relationship with Alexander Hamilton As a young man in Geneva, from ages 16 to 19, Laurens \\"never had difficulty attracting women and men\\", while reserving \\"his primary emotional commitments for other men.\\" According to Laurens's biographer Gregory D. Massey, this period \\"marked the beginning of a pattern; he continually centered his life around homosocial attachments to other men.\\" Homosociality, in sociology, refers to same-sex relationships that are not of a romantic or sexual nature, such as friendship, mentorship, and male bonding. Shortly after his marriage, while in Washington's camp, Laurens met and became extremely close friends with Alexander Hamilton. They exchanged many letters during the several years when different assignments and Laurens's capture by the British kept them apart; for example, when the terms of Laurens's parole prevented him from being present at Hamilton's wedding to Elizabeth Schuyler in December 1780, even though Hamilton had invited him. While emotional language was not uncommon in romantic friendships among those of the same gender in this historical period, Hamilton biographer James Thomas Flexner stated that the intensely expressive language contained in the Hamilton-Laurens letters \\"raises questions concerning homosexuality\\" that \\"cannot be categorically answered\\". Stating that \\"one must tread gingerly in approaching this matter,\\" Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow wrote that it is impossible to say \\"with any certainty\\" that Laurens and Hamilton were lovers, noting that such an affair would have required the exercise of \\"extraordinary precautions\\" because sodomy was a capital offense throughout the colonies at the time. Chernow concluded that based on available evidence, \\"At the very least, we can say that Hamilton developed something like an adolescent crush on his friend.\\" According to Chernow, \\"Hamilton did not form friendships easily and never again revealed his interior life to another man as he had to Laurens\\", and after Laurens's death, \\"Hamilton shut off some compartment of his emotions and never reopened it.\\" In contrast to Hamilton's effusive letters, surviving letters from Laurens to Hamilton were notably less frequent and less passionately worded, although some letters written by Laurens have been lost or may have been destroyed. Massey has dismissed speculations on John Laurens's supposed homosexuality and on a Laurens-Hamilton relationship as unsubstantiated, concluding, \\"Their relationship was platonic, a bond formed by their devotion to the Revolution and mutual ambition for fame.\\" Years later, Massey regretted that the tone of his assertion had been decisive rather than equivocal, conceding that the matter \\"can not be definitively resolved.\\" Legacy=In popular culture Anthony Ramos in Hamilton costume, July 2015 John Laurens was the subject of two short educational films, both released in 1972 by Learning Corporation of America.Learning Corporation of America, The Shaping of the American Nation (18 videocassettes). Worldcat information sourced from Library of Congress Authorities data, . Retrieved October 5, 2020. Based on Laurens' correspondence with his father, the first film dramatized the young man's decision to leave England, and the second outlined his battles in the Continental Army and his death.American Heritage: The Cause of Liberty (video); Michael Douglas played the leading role of Laurens. Laurens was featured in an episode of the 1984 George Washington miniseries, portrayed by Kevin Conroy. Laurens was depicted heroically as a supporting character in the 2015 musical Hamilton. Anthony Ramos originated the role of Laurens in the off-Broadway and Broadway casts, including the 2020 film of the stage production. Historical tributes In October 1782, Alexander Hamilton wrote to General Nathanael Greene of Laurens's death: In 1834, Hamilton's son and biographer John Church Hamilton named his youngest son Laurens Hamilton, a name that continued to recur over several generations in that branch of the Hamilton family. Nathanael Greene, in general orders announcing the death of Laurens, wrote \\"The army has lost a brave officer and the public a worthy citizen.\\" Three years after Laurens's death, George Washington responded to a question about Laurens's character by stating that \\"no man possessed more of the amor patria [love of country]. In a word, he had not a fault, that I ever could discover, unless intrepidity bordering upon rashness could come under that denomination; and to this he was excited by the purest motives.\\" According to Gregory D. Massey, a history professor at Freed–Hardeman University and author of a Laurens biography: Geographical names * Laurens County, Georgia was named in honor of John Laurens. * The city of Laurens, South Carolina and Laurens County, South Carolina were named for both Laurens and his father Henry Laurens.

The ASIMO robot was designed by one of Masahiro's students. In 1970, Mori published \\"Bukimi No Tani\\" (不気味の谷 The Uncanny Valley) in Energy. The article forwarded the hypothesis that as robots become more humanlike, they appear more familiar until a point is reached at which subtle imperfections of appearance make them look eerie. The observation led Mori to the belief that robot builders should not attempt to make their creations overly lifelike in appearance and motion. In 1974, Mori published The Buddha in the Robot: a Robot Engineer's Thoughts on Science and Religion in which he discussed the metaphysical implications of robotics. In the book, he wrote \\"I believe robots have the buddha-nature within them--that is, the potential for attaining buddhahood.\\" In 1988, Mori founded the first nationwide robot-building competition in Japan and has widely promoted robot competitions in the years since then. Of Robocon, Mori has said, \\"When we lose ourselves in an activity, we become creative, friendly and funny. Think of how children are when they are playing. They are completely absorbed in the game; their eyes shine and they are all smiles. They're into the game, not themselves. That's the message of Robocon, too: To not be self-centered, but to love others and share the joy of creating wonderful things.\\" Mori is currently president of the Mukta Research Institute, which he founded in Tokyo in order to promote his views on religion and robots. The institute also provides consultation on the use of automation and robotics in industry. ReferencesExternal links * Mori, M. (1970/2012). The uncanny valley (K. F. MacDorman & N. Kageki, Trans.).

Russian Orders, Decorations, and Medals Under the Monarchy. Harrison & Sons., Ltd., London. 1935. After the 1917 Russian Revolution it was awarded by the White movement anti-communist forces under Alexander Kolchak until their collapse in 1921. The order was revived in the Russian Federation on 8 August 2000 by Decree №1463Decree 1463 of 2000 (pravo.gov.ru) of the President of Russia. The current award criteria were amended on 7 September 2010 by Presidential Decree 1099.Decree 1099 of 2010 (pravo.gov.ru)  Statute of the Order of St. George  Georgi Pulevski wearing a cross of the Order of Saint George, conferred for his part in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) Order of Saint George, first class Breast Star and Sash The current Order of Saint George is awarded to highest and senior military officers for the conduct of military operations to protect the Fatherland from attack by an external enemy which resulted in the complete defeat of the enemy, for the execution of combat and other operations in other states aimed at restoring international peace and security, or for being a model of military science with feats that exemplify military prowess; the Order is also conferred upon officers who were previously awarded state awards of the Russian Federation for distinction in combat.  Description  The Order of Saint George is divided into four classes, from the First Class to the Fourth class; the highest degree being the Order First class. The four classes are awarded sequentially from the fourth to the first. These four classes are individually identified by the size and manner of wearing the two principal insignia of the Order, the cross and the star. Proper wear of the Order of Saint George insignia, fourth class at left to first class at right Order of Saint George, second class, neck badge and breast star Cross: A white enamelled cross pattée with a central medallion bearing the image of Saint George on horseback slaying the dragon. The cross measures 60mm across in the case of the Order first class and is worn on a sash in the colours of Saint George (orange and black). The same 60mm cross is worn around the neck on a 45mm wide ribbon also in the colours of Saint George for the Order second class. The cross is 50mm across for the Order third class and is also worn around the neck but from a 24mm wide ribbon in the same colours. The Order fourth class is a 40mm cross worn on the left breast hanging from a pentagonal mount covered with a 24mm wide ribbon of Saint George. Star: A four-pointed silver gilt star with a gold central medallion bearing the cipher of Saint George \\"SG\\" topped by a crown and surrounded by a black enamelled band bearing the motto of the order \\"For Service and Bravery\\" (\\"Za Sluzhbu i Khrabrost\\"). The star is worn on the left breast for both the Order first and second classes. Ribbon: The ribbon of the Order of Saint George is orange with three black stripes, commonly called \\"George's Ribbon\\". It symbolises fire and gunpowder: the Russian \\"colors of military glory\\", and is also thought to be derived from the colours of the original Russian imperial coat of arms (black eagle on a golden background). It was subsequently associated to the colors of the Russian Guard units. Unlike the other classes, the Order of Saint George fourth class can be awarded to junior officers while the rest is for senior and flag officers. :File:RUS Order of Saint George 1st class ribbon 2000.svg The ribbon bar for the Order first class is adorned with a miniature golden star. :File:RUS Order of Saint George 2nd class ribbon 2000.svg The ribbon bar for the Order second class is adorned with a miniature silver star. :File:RUS Order of Saint George 3rd class ribbon 2000.svg The ribbon bar for the Order third class is adorned with a miniature white cross. :File:RUS Order of Saint George 4th class ribbon 2000.svg The ribbon bar for the Order fourth class has no device.

He was the first party politician to hold the office. Biography Hertling became professor of philosophy at the University of Munich and published books on Aristotle (1871) and on Albertus Magnus (1880). From 1875 to 1890, and again from 1893 to 1912, he was a member of the Reichstag, and from 1909 to 1912 he led the Centre (Catholic) Party faction in the Reichstag. In 1891, the Regent of Bavaria made him a life member of the upper house of the Bavarian Landtag. As leader of the largest party in the Bavarian Landtag, in 1912 Hertling was appointed Bavarian Minister-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. He was the first minister-president ever appointed who governed on the basis of a majority in the Landtag. King Ludwig III later elevated him to the rank of Count. Following the outbreak of World War I, Hertling supported the policy of Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg but declined to become his successor in 1917. After the fall of Georg Michaelis in November of that year, however, he accepted appointment as German Chancellor and Minister- President of Prussia. He was the first politician to hold either post; all of his predecessors had been career civil servants or military men. Hertling was a staunch conservative who believed in total victory for Germany. His age and his conservatism made him unequipped to overcome the influence of the military high command, led by Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. Like Michaelis before him, he was increasingly seen as a puppet of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who constituted a virtual military dictatorship in the last year of the war. Hertling presided over the last stage of the collapse of the German home front. When it became apparent that he was unable to manage the crisis, he was forced to resign in favour of Prince Maximilian of Baden. He founded the important German Catholic fraternity Askania-Burgundia and was a member of K.St.V. Arminia at Bonn. His great-granddaughter is actress Gila von Weitershausen.

Plot The story concerns Harvard student Alan Jensen, the point guard of the Harvard basketball team. When his parents' house is destroyed by a tornado, Alan is desperate for $100,000 to replace their home. He is approached by his girlfriend Cindy Bandolino, whose father is an organized crime boss. Cindy convinces Alan to throw a game for the money. She tells Alan that her father is behind the deal, but actually she goes to her father's associate, Teddy Carter, and Carter's assistant, Kelly Morgan for funding. What she does not know is that Carter and Morgan are undercover FBI agents. Alan throws the game, gives his parents the money, and then undergoes a psychedelic experience after he ingests a big dose of LSD, 15,000 micrograms. There follows a long stretch of the film during which morphing special effects demonstrate Alan's altered state as he is pursued by Carter, while Cindy is collared by Morgan. Just when it looks like a toss-up as to what will prove his downfall first, the bad trip, the FBI, or the mob, Alan's other girlfriend (who is also his philosophy lecturer), Chesney Cort (played by Adams), saves the day. Not only does she get Alan to a doctor who can bring him back to sobriety, she reveals that she is in a sexual threesome with Carter and Morgan. Once he gets some photographic evidence for blackmail, Alan is extricated from his problems. The ending implies that he may have HPPD, Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (a chronic disorder in which a person has flashbacks of visual hallucinations or distortions experienced during a previous hallucinogenic drug experience) this is also known as being permafried.

The concept suggests that humanoid objects which imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke uncanny or strangely familiar feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers. \\"Valley\\" denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness. Examples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls. With the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the \\"valley\\" has been cited in reaction to the verisimilitude of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers. Etymology The concept was identified by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori as bukimi no tani genshō () in 1970. The term was first translated as uncanny valley in the 1978 book Robots: Fact, Fiction, and Prediction, written by Jasia Reichardt, thus forging an unintended link to Ernst Jentsch's concept of the uncanny, introduced in a 1906 essay entitled \\"On the Psychology of the Uncanny\\".Jentsch, E. (25 Aug. 1906). Zur Psychologie des Unheimlichen. Psychiatrisch-Neurologische Wochenschrift, 8(22), 195-198. Jentsch's conception was elaborated by Sigmund Freud in a 1919 essay entitled \\"The Uncanny\\" (\\"Das Unheimliche\\").Freud, S. (1919/2003). The uncanny [das unheimliche] (D. McLintock, Trans.). New York: Penguin. Repliee Q2 (pictured above), the uncovered robotic structure underneath Repliee, and the actual human who was the model for Repliee, the human lookalike triggered the highest level of mirror neuron activity. Hypothesis Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels. This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a \\"barely human\\" and \\"fully human\\" entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly \\"strange\\" to some human beings, produces a feeling of uncanniness, and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human–robot interaction. Theoretical basis A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon: * Mate selection. Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved cognitive mechanism for the avoidance of selecting mates with low fertility, poor hormonal health, or ineffective immune systems based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.Rhodes, G. & Zebrowitz, L. A. (eds) (2002). Facial Attractiveness: Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Social Perspectives, Ablex Publishing. * Mortality salience. Viewing an \\"uncanny\\" robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally-supported defenses for coping with death's inevitability.... [P]artially disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines. (2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality. (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are doppelgängers and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on. (4) The jerkiness of an android's movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control.\\"MacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006, p. 313. * Pathogen avoidance. Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. \\"The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other parasites increases with genetic similarity.\\"MacDorman, Green, Ho, & Koch, 2009, p. 696. The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals. * Sorites paradoxes. Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric, degree of human likeness.Ramey, 2005. * Violation of human norms. The uncanny valley may \\"be symptomatic of entities that elicit a model of a human other but do not measure up to it\\".MacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006, p. 303. If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person. This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding. * Religious definition of human identity. The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity.MacDorman, K. F., Vasudevan, S. K., & Ho, C.-C., 2009. An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist Irvin Yalom. Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses in order to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death. One of these defenses is specialness, the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself.Yalom, Irvin D. (1980) \\"Existential Psychotherapy\\", Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York The experience of the very humanlike \\"living\\" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans' notions of \\"specialness\\" and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety. In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the golem in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator. * Conflicting perceptual cues. The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to category membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., \\"eeriness\\"), much like the discomfort that is experienced with cognitive dissonance. Several studies support this possibility. Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face's human- or mechanical-resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley, suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as \\"human\\" or \\"robot\\" posed a greater cognitive challenge. However, they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley, it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects' social and emotional reactions—suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect. Burleigh and colleagues demonstrated that faces at the midpoint between human and non-human stimuli produced a level of reported eeriness that diverged from an otherwise linear model relating human-likeness to affect. Yamada et al. found that cognitive difficulty was associated with negative affect at the midpoint of a morphed continuum (e.g., a series of stimuli morphing between a cartoon dog and a real dog). Ferrey et al. demonstrated that the midpoint between images on a continuum anchored by two stimulus categories produced a maximum of negative affect, and found this with both human and non-human entities. Schoenherr and Burleigh provide examples from history and culture that evidence an aversion to hybrid entities, such as the aversion to genetically modified organisms (\\"Frankenfoods\\"). Finally, Moore developed a Bayesian mathematical model that provides a quantitative account of perceptual conflict. There has been some debate as to the precise mechanisms that are responsible. It has been argued that the effect is driven by categorization difficulty, perceptual mismatch, frequency-based sensitization, and inhibitory devaluation. * Threat to humans’ distinctiveness and identity. Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human – non-human distinction. Kaplan stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness, pushing for a redefinition of humanness. MacDorman and Entenzari investigated the distinction of human and robots as an individual trait that can predict sensitivity to the uncanny valley phenomenon. Ferrari, Paladino and Jetten found that the increase of anthropomorphic appearance of a robot leads to an enhancement of threat to the human distinctiveness and identity. The more a robot resembles a real person, the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings. Research A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB & Reichling DB used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to \\"wager\\" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses. One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin. As of 2011, researchers at University of California, San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology are measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley. In one study using fMRI, a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in parietal cortex, on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain's visual cortex that processes bodily movements with the section of the motor cortex thought to contain mirror neurons. The researchers say they saw, in essence, evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict. The brain \\"lit up\\" when the human-like appearance of the android and its robotic motion \\"didn’t compute\\". Ayşe Pınar Saygın, an assistant professor from UCSD, says \\"The brain doesn’t seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se. What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met – for appearance and motion to be congruent.\\" Viewer perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic, human-like characters intended for video games and film is being investigated by Tinwell et al., 2011. Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al. (2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games. Building on the body of work already undertaken in android science, this research intends to build a conceptual framework of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a real-time gaming engine. The goal is to analyze how cross-modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny. Tinwell et al., 2011 have also introduced the notion of an unscalable uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer's discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism. A summary of Angela Tinwell's research on the uncanny valley, psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human-like virtual characters is provided in her book, The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation by CRC Press. Design principles A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley: * Design elements should match in human realism. A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed.Ho, MacDorman, Pramono, 2008. For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice.Mitchell et al., 2011. For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior.Goetz, Kiesler, & Powers, 2003. If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression.Vinayagamoorthy, Steed, & Slater, 2005. Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.Saygin, A.P., Chaminade, T., Ishiguro, H. (2010) The Perception of Humans and Robots: Uncanny Hills in Parietal Cortex. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2716-2720).Saygin et al., 2011. * Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability. In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it. A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub- conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted \\"when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide 'it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all'.\\" * Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together. A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley. Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g., larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture. Avoiding a photorealistic texture can permit more leeway.MacDorman, Green, Ho, & Koch, 2009. Criticism A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny: * The uncanny valley is a heterogeneous group of phenomena. Phenomena labeled as being in the uncanny valley can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes, which can range from evolved or learned circuits for early face perceptionMacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006 to culturally-shared psychological constructs.MacDorman, Vasudevan & Ho, 2008. People's cultural backgrounds may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.Bartneck Kanda, Ishiguro, & Hagita, 2007. * The uncanny valley may be generational. Younger generations, more used to CGI, robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue. * The uncanny valley is simply a specific case of information processing such as categorization and frequency-based effects. In contrast to the assumption that the uncanny valley is based on a heterogeneous group of phenomena, recent arguments have suggested that uncanny valley-like phenomena, simply reflect the products of information processing such as categorization. Cheetham et al. have argued that the uncanny valley can be understood in terms of a categorization processes, with a category boundary defining 'the valley'. Extending this argument, Burleigh and Schoenherr suggested that the effects asosciated with the uncanny valley can be divided into those attributable to the category boundary and individual exemplar frequency. Namely, the negative affective responses attributed to the uncanny valley were simply a result of the frequency of exposure, similar to the mere-exposure effect. By varying the frequency of training items, they were able to demonstrate a dissociation between cognitive uncertainty based on the category boundary and affective uncertainty based on the frequency of training exemplars. In a follow-up study, Schoenherr and Burleigh demonstrated that an instructional manipulation affected categorization accuracy but not ratings of negative affect. Thus, generational effects and cultural artifacts can be accounted for with basic information processing mechanisms. These and related findings have been used to argue that the uncanny valley is merely an artifact of having greater familiarity with members of human categories and does not reflect a unique phenomenon. * The uncanny appears at any degree of human likeness. Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g., MIT's robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g., cosmetically atypical people). Capgras delusion is a relatively rare condition in which the sufferer believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates. These duplicates are rationally accepted as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the \\"true\\" entity has been replaced with something else. Some sufferers of Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot. Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which leads to conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense. This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information.Pollick, F. In Search of the Uncanny Valley. Analog communication: Evolution, brain mechanisms, dynamics, simulation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press: The Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology (2009) * Good design can lift human-looking entities out of the valley. David Hanson has criticized Mori's hypothesis that entities approaching human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively. He has shown that the uncanny valley that Karl MacDorman and Hiroshi IshiguroMacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006, p. 305. generated – by having participants rate photographs that morphed from humanoid robots to android robots to human beings – could be flattened out by adding neotenous, cartoonish features to the entities that had formerly fallen into the valley. This approach uses the fact that humans find characteristics appealing that are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons. Similar effects If the uncanny valley is the result of general cognitive processes, there should be evidence in evolutionary history and cultural artifacts. Most notably, an effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839: A similar \\"uncanny valley\\" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements (cf. body modification), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it eyesight, muscle strength, or cognition.Jamais Cascio, The Second Uncanny Valley So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected. However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, \\"transhuman\\" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed \\"posthuman\\"), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley. Another example comes from \\"pageant retouching\\" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like. Due to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing, cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an \\"Uncanny Valley of Mind\\". Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research. In visual effects A number of films that use computer-generated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or \\"creepiness\\" as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following: * According to roboticist Dario Floreano, the baby character Billy in Pixar's groundbreaking 1988 animated short film Tin Toy provoked negative audience reactions, which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.EPFL. http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&id;=41121 * The 2001 film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the first photorealistic computer- animated feature film, provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its near-realistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw stated that while the film's animation is brilliant, the \\"solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely because they're almost there but not quite\\". Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers wrote of the film, \\"At first it's fun to watch the characters, […] But then you notice a coldness in the eyes, a mechanical quality in the movements\\". * Several reviewers of the 2004 animated film The Polar Express called its animation eerie. CNN.com reviewer Paul Clinton wrote, \\"Those human characters in the film come across as downright... well, creepy. So The Polar Express is at best disconcerting, and at worst, a wee bit horrifying\\". The term \\"eerie\\" was used by reviewers Kurt Loder and Manohla Dargis, among others. Newsday reviewer John Anderson called the film's characters \\"creepy\\" and \\"dead-eyed\\", and wrote that \\"The Polar Express is a zombie train\\". Animation director Ward Jenkins wrote an online analysis describing how changes to the Polar Express characters' appearance, especially to their eyes and eyebrows, could have avoided what he considered a feeling of deadness in their faces.The Polar Express: A Virtual Train Wreck (conclusion), Ward Jenkins, Ward-O-Matic blog, December 18, 2004 * In a review of the 2007 animated film Beowulf, New York Times technology writer David Gallagher wrote that the film failed the uncanny valley test, stating that the film's villain, the monster Grendel, was \\"only slightly scarier\\" than the \\"closeups of our hero Beowulf's face... allowing viewers to admire every hair in his 3-D digital stubble\\".Digital Actors in ‘Beowulf’ Are Just Uncanny - New York Times, November 14, 2007 * Some reviewers of the 2009 animated film A Christmas Carol criticized its animation as creepy. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News said of the film, \\"The motion-capture does no favors to co- stars [Gary] Oldman, Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn, since, as in 'Polar Express,' the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it's off-putting\\". Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com wrote of the film, \\"In the center of the action is Jim Carrey -- or at least a dead-eyed, doll-like version of Carrey\\". * The 2011 animated film Mars Needs Moms was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation. The film was among the biggest box office bombs in history, which may have been due in part to audience revulsion. (Mars Needs Moms was produced by Robert Zemeckis's production company, ImageMovers, which had previously produced The Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol.) * Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn was affected by the uncanny valley. Daniel D. Snyder of The Atlantic wrote, \\"Instead of trying to bring to life Herge’s beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin’s original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It’s now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles.\\" He added, \\"In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.\\". N.B. of The Economist called elements of the animation \\"grotesque\\", writing, \\"Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people. And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comic-strip characters. It's not so much 'The Secret of the Unicorn' as 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers'\\". However, other reviewers felt that the film avoided the uncanny valley despite its animated characters' realism. Critic Dana Stevens of Slate wrote, \\"With the possible exception of the title character, the animated cast of Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment in the so-called 'uncanny valley'\\". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly wrote of the film, \\"we have passed beyond the uncanny valley into the plains of hyperreality\\". * The 2019 film The Lion King, a remake of the 1994 film that featured photo-realistic digital animals in place of the earlier film's more traditional animation, divided critics about the effectiveness of its imagery. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the images were so realistic that \\"2019 might best be remembered as the summer we left the Uncanny Valley for good\\". However, other critics felt that the realism of the animals and setting rendered the scenes where the characters sing and dance disturbing and \\"weird\\". * The 2020 film Sonic the Hedgehog was delayed from its November 8, 2019 release date after an extremely negative audience reaction to the title character's design in the first trailer forced the creators to redesign him. * Multiple commentators cited the CGI half-human half-cat characters in the 2019 movie Cats as an example of the uncanny valley effect, first after the release of the trailer for the film and then after the film's actual release. Virtual actors An increasingly common practice is to feature virtual actors in films: CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased. Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor (who may contribute motion capture, audio, etc.), while at other times the actor has no involvement. Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect, saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation (2009), Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy (2010), Schwarzenegger again in Terminator Genisys (2015), Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in Rogue One (2016), and Will Smith in Gemini Man (2019). The use of virtual actors is in contrast with digital de-aging, which can involve simply removing wrinkles from actors' faces. This practice has generally not faced uncanny valley criticism. One exception is the 2019 film The Irishman, in which Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci were all de-aged to try to make them look up to 50 years younger: one reviewer wrote that the actors' \\"hunched and stiff\\" body language stood in marked contrast to their facial appearance, while another wrote that when De Niro's character was in his 30s, he looked like he was 50. Deepfake software, which first began to be widely used in 2017, uses machine learning to graft one person's appearance onto another's facial expressions, thus providing an alternate approach to both creating virtual actors and digital de-aging. Various individuals have created web videos that use deepfake software to re-create some of the notable previous uses of virtual actors and de-aging in film. Journalists have tended to praise these deepfake imitations, calling them \\"more naturalistic\\" and \\"objectively better\\" than the originals. In fiction In the 2008 30 Rock episode \\"Succession\\", Frank Rossitano explains the uncanny valley concept, using a graph and Star Wars examples, to try to convince Tracy Jordan that his dream of creating a pornographic video game is impossible. He also references the computer- animated film The Polar Express.

A protest vote (also called a blank, null, spoiled, or \\"none of the above\\" vote) is a vote cast in an election to demonstrate dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates or the current political system. Protest voting takes a variety of forms and reflects numerous voter motivations, including political alienation. Along with abstention, or not voting, protest voting is a sign of unhappiness with available options. If protest vote takes the form of a blank vote, it may or may not be tallied into final results. Protest votes may be considered spoiled or, depending on the electoral system, counted as \\"none of the above\\" votes.  Types of protest vote  Protest votes can take many different forms: * Blank ballots * Null ballots * Spoiled ballots * None of the above votes * Votes for a fringe candidate or party, or a less preferred candidate or party * Organized protest votes * Declined ballots Protest voting tends to occur among voters who feel alienated but who have an alternative voting option, such as a third-party candidate in the United States, or who can register their displeasure with the political process by reducing the majority status of a likely winner. Alienation often leads to abstention from voting, but can also generate participation in the form of a protest vote. In the 1992 United States presidential election, for example, 14% of those who voted for Ross Perot said they would not have voted at all if he had not run. Protest votes can take the form of blank, null, or spoiled ballots. Blank ballots are ballots with no markings on them. Null ballots are ballots that do not result in a valid vote because the ballot was filled out incompletely or incorrectly. Spoiled ballots are ballots that have been defaced, deformed, or otherwise marked in a way that makes the ballot ineligible; spoiled ballots most clearly indicate the presence of a protest vote. Write-in votes may also indicate protest voting; in the United States, Mickey Mouse has historically been a popular choice. None of the above (NOTA) voting is rarely an option in U.S. politics, although it has been an option on Nevada ballots since 1976. NOTA voting is proposed as a state-legitimized method of allowing voters to signal discontent, although selecting a \\"none\\" option does not always indicate protest. Other types of protest voting relate more to the choice of candidate or party selected for a valid vote than the ballot itself. Voting for a fringe candidate or less preferred party can be a way of signaling dissatisfaction with a leading candidate, party, or policy, or of reducing the margin of victory in an election. Protest voting organized by political parties or leaders also occurs, but tends to be rare and associated with extreme circumstances.  Determining the presence of a protest vote  Distinguishing between ballots that have been deliberately cast as protest votes and those that are blank, null, or spoiled by an individual trying but failing to cast a valid vote is challenging. Blank votes are often associated with protest voting, but can also be indicators of a lack of information. Blank, null, and spoiled votes occur more frequently in areas with high levels of illiteracy or limited language competency. Spoiled ballots, especially those that have been deliberately defaced or otherwise ruined, are a more reliable indicator of protest votes and of political sophistication.  Significant protest vote events  One United States court case determined that voting is not an issue of free speech or expression, but rather about electing officials; in Burdick v Takushi, 1992, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on write-in votes after Alan B. Burdick argued that Hawaii should be required to count his protest vote for Donald Duck. In the parliamentary elections in Finland and Sweden, voters have also used Donald Duck as a protest vote.Kallionpää, Katri. \\"Donald Duck holds his own in the north .\\" Helsingin Sanomat. March 7, 2007. Retrieved on March 4, 2009. In Ukraine, the Internet Party nominated Darth Vader for mayoral elections in Kyiv and Odesa, and tried to nominate Darth Vader for presidency, although this application was rejected.Vote Dark Side: 'Darth Vader' Runs for Mayor in Ukraine — NBC News Protest voting is common in Latin America, where over 5.5% of ballots in presidential elections since 1980 have been blank or spoiled. During the 2000 presidential elections in Peru, candidate Alejandro Toledo withdrew over concerns about election integrity and encouraged his supporters to spoil their ballots as protest—an example of organized protest voting. In that election, around 31% of ballots cast were spoiled or blank. After the 2002 French presidential election, in which far-right leader Jean- Marie Le Pen arrived second behind conservative candidate Jacques Chirac, protest vote was named a contributing factor. The 2017 French presidential election, won by Emmanuel Macron, saw the highest level of protest voting and abstention in France since the late 1960s, with 4 million blank or spoiled ballots and an additional 12 million abstentions. In Colombia, the blank vote has a legal path to force a repetition of an election and a change of the candidates in that election. According to the paragraph 1 of the article 258 of the Political Constitution of Colombia, if the blank vote in Colombia becomes the most voted option, the elections should be repeated once and, depending on the nature of the election, the parties should present new candidates or new lists of candidates. This gives the protest vote a way to express dissent with real electoral consequences. So far, the blank vote has not been majoritarian in presidential or congress elections in Colombia, but it already has forced to repeat some elections for mayor's office.Freeman, Daniel E. \\"The blank vote explained: Colombia’s biggest electoral gamble\\". March 7, 2014. In certain parts of the United States, especially in the South, protest candidates often receive a large number of votes in Democratic Party presidential primaries due to a large presence of conservative Democrats who, while registered Democrats, often vote Republican at the federal level. This phenomenon received significant attention in the 2012 Democratic primaries, where attorney John Wolfe Jr. polled at 42% against incumbent President Barack Obama in the Arkansas primary, and prisoner Keith Judd received 41% in West Virginia. In Oklahoma, non-Obama candidates gathered a combined total of 43%, with the highest number of votes going to anti-abortion activist Randall Terry. The phenomenon showed up in later elections but on a smaller scale (as many former Democrats left the party). In the 2016 West Virginia Democratic primary, favorite son Paul T. Farrell Jr. received 9% of the vote and placed ahead of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in one county. In the 2020 primary in that state, fellow favorite son David Rice received a similar 8%.  Protest vote and abstention  Abstention may be a type of protest vote when it is not solely the result of apathy or indifference towards politics. In systems where voting is compulsory, abstention may be an act of political disappointment. The anarchist movement rejects representative democracy in favor of a more direct form of government and has historically called for abstention as a form of protest. Active protest voting, whether through spoiled or blank ballots, tends to communicate dissatisfaction more effectively than abstention. Abstaining increases the proportion of votes for the most popular candidate or party, while using a protest vote against the popular candidate or party can shrink a margin of victory. Reducing the margin may result in a hung parliament or a smaller difference between the parties in government, thus limiting the chance a single party will have control over the system.

The breed is renowned for its broodiness and mothering abilities. The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, but like any pet, should be handled with care. History It is unknown exactly where or when these fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared, but the most well documented point of origin is ancient China (hence another occasionally encountered name for the bird, Chinese silk chicken). Other places in Southeast Asia have been named as possibilities, such as India and Java. The earliest surviving written account of Silkies comes from Marco Polo, who wrote of a \\"furry chicken\\" in the 13th century during his travels in Asia. In 1598, Ulisse Aldrovandi, a writer and naturalist at the University of Bologna, Italy, published a comprehensive treatise on chickens which is still read and admired today. In it, he spoke on \\"wool-bearing chickens\\" and ones \\"clothed with hair like that of a black cat\\". White Silkie cock Silkies most likely made their way to the West via the Silk Route and maritime trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur. In the 21st century, Silkies are one of the most popular and ubiquitous ornamental breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks and geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants. Characteristics Silkies are considered a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam- sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only four pounds (1.8 kg), and females weighing three pounds (1.36 kg). The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces (1 kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910 grams). A partridge Silkie hen Silkie plumage was once unique among chicken breeds, however in recent years silkie feathering has been developed in several breeds, mostly notably the Chabo, where it is now standardised in Britain and the Netherlands. It has been compared to silk, and to fur. The overall result is a soft, fluffy appearance. Their feathers lack functioning barbicels, and are thus similar to down on other birds. This characteristic leaves Silkies unable to fly. Silkies appear in two distinct varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies have an extra muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-shaped comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan. All Silkies have black or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their Chinese language name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism which extends beyond the skin into an animal's connective tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce as much as the more common meat breeds of chicken. Silkies lay a fair number of eggs, of a cream color, but production is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks. Bantams In the American Standard of Perfection, the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1 kg (36 oz) (12in)and for the female, 907 g (32 oz)(10in). The Australian Poultry Standard and British Poultry Standard call for Silkie bantams much smaller; in the Australian, the standard weights are 680 g (25 oz) for males and 570 g (20 oz) for females. The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22 oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18 oz). Polydactyly A foot of the Silkie Bantam that shows the phenomenon of polydactyly in the breed Silkies are also known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an additional 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation has been shown to be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. While the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect. In cuisine Silkie soup sold in Bukit Batok, Singapore The black meat of a Silkie is generally considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, but it is also a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has a strong influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth, braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, Dioscorea polystachya (mountain yam), orange peel, and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.

It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League (NFL), between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 23, 1972. With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game, Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua. The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua, and, as it fell, Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game-winning touchdown. The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since, as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it, either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time. Kevin Cook's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL's most controversially physical era. NFL Films has chosen it as the greatest play of all time, as well as the most controversial.NFL Top 10 – Controversial Callshttps://bleacherreport.com/articles/2854640-franco-harris-immaculate- reception-named-nfl-networks-top-play-in-nfl-history The play was also selected as the Greatest Play in NFL History in the NFL Network’s 100 series. The play was a turning point for the Steelers, who reversed four decades of futility with their first playoff win ever, and went on to win four Super Bowls by the end of the 1970s. The play's name is a pun derived from the Immaculate Conception, a dogma in the Roman Catholic Church. The phrase was first used on air by Myron Cope, a Pittsburgh sportscaster who was reporting on the Steelers' victory. A Pittsburgh woman, Sharon Levosky, called Cope before his 11 PM sports broadcast on the 23rd and suggested the name, which was coined by her friend Michael Ord. Cope used the term on television and the phrase stuck. The phrase was apparently meant to imply that the play was miraculous in nature (see Hail Mary pass for a similar term).  Events of the play  Diagram of the Immaculate Reception After Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler scored a touchdown on a 30-yard run with 1:17 left, the Pittsburgh Steelers trailed the Oakland Raiders 7–6, facing fourth-and-10 on their own 40-yard line with 22 seconds remaining in the game and no time-outs. Head coach Chuck Noll called a pass play, 66 Circle Option, intended for receiver Barry Pearson, a rookie who was playing in his first NFL game. Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw (1 in diagram), under great pressure from Raiders linemen Tony Cline and Horace Jones, threw the ball to the Raiders' 35-yard line, toward halfback John \\"Frenchy\\" Fuqua. Raiders safety Jack Tatum collided with Fuqua just as the ball arrived (2). Tatum's hit knocked Fuqua to the ground and sent the ball sailing backward several yards, end over end. Steelers fullback Franco Harris, after initially blocking on the play, had run downfield in case Bradshaw needed another eligible receiver. He scooped up the sailing ball just before it would have hit the ground (3). Harris ran past Raiders linebacker Gerald Irons, while linebacker Phil Villapiano, who had been covering Harris, was blocked by Steelers tight end John McMakin (4). Harris used a stiff arm to ward off Raiders defensive back Jimmy Warren (5), and went in for a touchdown. The touchdown gave the Steelers a 13–7 lead when Roy Gerela added the ensuing extra point.  Controversy  Statue of Harris making the \\"Immaculate Reception\\" at Pittsburgh International Airport. The critical question was: who did the football touch in the Fuqua/Tatum collision? If it bounced off Fuqua without ever touching Tatum, then Harris's reception was illegal. If the ball bounced off only Tatum, or if it bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order), then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that once an offensive player touches a pass, he is the only offensive player eligible to catch the pass. \\"However, if a [defensive] player touches [the] pass first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one [offensive] player, then all [offensive] players become and remain eligible\\" to catch the pass. (This rule was rescinded in 1978.) If the reception was illegal, the Raiders would have gained possession (by a turnover on downs), clinching a victory. One official, Back Judge Adrian Burk, signaled that the play was a touchdown, but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, Umpire Pat Harder, thought that the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others said that they were not in a position to rule. Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout, but it was not used by Swearingen. (Terry Bradshaw's assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call McNally had \\"an opinion from the get-go\\" that the ball had hit Tatum's chest, which he confirmed by looking \\"at one shot on instant replay.\\" In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary), and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen \\"never asked me about the rule, and never asked what I saw. All he said was, 'Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.' And I said, 'everything's fine then, go ahead.'\\" After Swearingen hung up the phone Boston asked, \\"What do we got?\\" \\"We got a touchdown,\\" answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. Franco Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field, and it took 15 minutes to clear them so that the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7. Although this has been described as the first known use of television replay to confirm a call (there was no instant replay review then), at the time the NFL denied that the decision was made in the press box or using a television replay. An Oakland Tribune article two days after the game reported that Steelers publicist Joe Gordon told reporters in the press box that the decision had been made using the replay. (Reprinted in One for the Thumb: The New Steelers Reader, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2006, , pp. 171–172) Gordon has dismissed this as \\"a total fabrication.\\" NFL officials Jim Kensil and Val Pinchbeck, who were in the press box with McNally, also deny that replay was used in making the decision on the play. (Reprinted in One for the Thumb: The New Steelers Reader, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2006, , pp. 169–171) In various NFL Films productions about the play years later, various Raiders have theorized that the real purpose of Swearingen's phone conversation was to see if there were enough police on hand to ensure the players' safety if the play was ruled incomplete. The theory claims that there were too few police, so the play was called for the Steelers out of fear. In one of the films, McNally laughs at the suggestion. The play is still disputed by those involved, particularly by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum said that the ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating that he could not honestly say whether or not the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will never tell. According to Raiders defensive back George Atkinson, the play is known by the Raiders and their fans as the \\"Immaculate Deception\\" because \\"the public was deceived, the officials were deceived, and we got deceived\\". John Madden, coach of the 1972 Raiders, has said that he will never get over the play, and has indicated that he was bothered more by the delay between the end of the play and the final signal of touchdown than by which player the ball truly hit. After the game, he indicated that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. Although a few days later Madden indicated that the Raiders game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua's shoulder pads, Jack Tatum conceded that \\"even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on that moment of impact.\\" Years later Madden wrote, \\"No matter how many times I watch the films of the 'immaculate reception' play, I never know for sure what happened.\\" In 1998, during halftime of the AFC Championship game, NBC showed a replay from its original broadcast. The replay presented a different angle than the NFL Films clip that is most often shown. According to a writer for the New York Daily News, \\"NBC's replay showed the ball clearly hit one and only one man[:] Oakland DB Jack Tatum.\\" Curt Gowdy, doing the live TV play-by- play, called it as having been deflected by Tatum, and reiterated that during the video replay.NBC broadcast of 1972 AFC Divisional Playoff Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope, in a 1997 article and in his 2002 book Quintuple Yoi!, related that two days after the game he reviewed film taken by local Pittsburgh TV station WTAE-TV, and that the film showed \\"[n]o question about it – Bradshaw's pass struck Tatum squarely on his right shoulder.\\" Cope stated that the local film would be next to impossible to find again, because of inadequate filing procedures. In 2004 John Fetkovich, an emeritus professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University, analyzed the NFL Films clip of the play. He came to the conclusion, based on the trajectory of the bounced ball and conservation of momentum, that the ball must have bounced off Tatum, who was running upfield at the time, rather than Fuqua, who was running across and down the field. Fetkovich also performed experiments by throwing a football against a brick wall at a velocity greater than 60 feet per second, twice the speed Fetkovich calculated that Bradshaw's pass was traveling when it reached Tatum and Fuqua. Fetkovitch achieved a maximum rebound of 10 feet when the ball hit point first, and 15 feet when the ball hit belly first, both less than the 24 feet that the ball actually rebounded during the play. Timothy Gay, a physics professor and a longtime Raiders fan, cited Fetkovich's work with approval in his book The Physics of Football, and concluded that \\"the referees made the right call in the Immaculate Reception.\\" Terry Bradshaw himself had made points similar to those of Fetkovich 15 years earlier, stating that he did not think that he had thrown the ball hard enough for it to bounce that far back off Fuqua, and that since Fuqua was running across the field, the ball would have veered to the right if it had hit him. Bradshaw opined that the ball must have bounced off the upfield-moving Tatum – if that had happened then \\"Tatum's momentum carries the ball backward.\\" The ball came very close to hitting the ground before Harris scooped it up. In the sideline views of both film and video, Harris had caught the ball out of frame, and came running into frame from the right side on his path to the end zone. The only other known NBC video was an end zone shot from above and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before it touched the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below. Villapiano has also stated that he was illegally blocked by Steelers tight end John McMakin as he was pursuing Harris following the reception, and he would have tackled Harris without it. Raiders coach Madden echoed this complaint; McMakin, who calls his contribution the \\"Magnificent Obstruction\\", insists the block was perfectly legal, and is \\"puzzled\\" that the Raiders would think otherwise.  Aftermath  The week after this playoff victory, the Steelers lost the AFC championship game 21-17 to the Miami Dolphins, who went on to win Super Bowl VII in their landmark undefeated season. Had the Raiders advanced to the AFC championship game instead, they would have entered that contest with an all-time record (including playoffs) of 6-1-1 against the Dolphins. Despite the loss to the Dolphins, the Steelers started to reverse four decades of futility and went on to become a dominant force in the NFL for the rest of the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls in six years with such stars as Bradshaw, Harris, John Stallworth, and Lynn Swann along with the Steel Curtain defense led by Jack Ham, Jack Lambert, \\"Mean Joe\\" Greene, Mel Blount, and Dwight White. 1972 was the year before the team's 40th year in the league, during which they had finished above .500 only nine times, and until then had never won a playoff game. In fact, before this game, the only playoff game the team had ever played was a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in 1947 after the two teams finished tied for the Eastern Division championship. The Immaculate Reception was actually the first touchdown the Steelers ever scored in the postseason (they were shut out against the Eagles in the 1947 playoff game). (The Steelers also lost to the Detroit Lions in the 1962 Playoff Bowl, though this was considered an exhibition game between the two second place teams in league record books and not an actual playoff game.) They had long been regarded as one of the league's doormats (as the 1944 Card- Pitt merger was 0–10 and was ridiculed as the \\"Carpitts,\\" a play on the word \\"carpet\\"). As recently as 1969 the team had posted a 1–13 record, thus securing the first draft choice in the subsequent NFL draft (in which the Steelers chose Terry Bradshaw) and seeding their remarkable turnaround. Since the AFL-NFL Merger, the Steelers have the NFL's best record (surpassing Miami in 2007 because of the Dolphins' recent struggles), have had a league-low three head coaches, and have had only nine losing seasons, none worse than 5–11. Only twice since the Immaculate Reception has the team had losing seasons two years in a row and none three years in a row. The Immaculate Reception spawned a heated rivalry between the Steelers and Raiders, a rivalry that was at its peak during the 1970s, when both teams were among the best in the league and both were known for their hard-hitting, physical play. The teams met in the playoffs in each of the next four seasons, starting with the Raiders' 33–14 victory in the 1973 divisional playoffs. Pittsburgh used the AFC championship game victories over Oakland (24–13 at Oakland in 1974 and 16–10 at Pittsburgh in 1975) as a springboard to victories in Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X, before the Raiders notched a 24–7 victory at home in 1976 on their way to winning Super Bowl XI. To date, the two last met in the playoffs in 1983 when the eventual Super Bowl champion Raiders, playing in Los Angeles at the time, crushed the Steelers 38–10. The rivalry has somewhat died off in the years since, mainly due to the Raiders on-field struggles since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII. The play itself started another rivalry between the Raiders and the rest of the league, as Raider fans have long thought that the league has wanted to shortchange the team and specifically owner Al Davis. In 2007, NFL Network ranked the \\"Raiders versus the World\\" as the biggest feud in NFL history. For the 1978 NFL season, the rule in question regarding the forward pass was repealed. There are no longer any restrictions on any deflections of passes, and a future play that mirrored the Immaculate Reception would simply be an extraordinary but legal reception. Whether a future Franco Harris would have been ruled as catching such a deflected football before it struck the turf is a different matter, thanks to myriad cameras and use of instant replay that is part of the present-day NFL. As 1972 was the last year that the NFL forbade any local telecasts of home games, the game itself wasn't shown live on Pittsburgh NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now WPXI), nor was it shown on nearby NBC affiliates WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, Ohio; WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, West Virginia; and then- NBC affiliate WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia, all of which are secondary markets to the Steelers—WICU-TV in Erie, Pennsylvania and then-NBC O&O; WKYC- TV in Cleveland, Ohio, were the closest stations to air the game (although WIIC-TV showed the game on tape delay the following day). Starting the next year, any home games that sold out 72 hours before kick-off could be televised locally. As the Steelers began their home sell-out streak in 1972, blackouts have never been needed in the Pittsburgh area. Game ball The actual ball ended up in the hands of fan Jim Baker, who attended the game with his young nephew, Bobby. Baker managed to scoop up the ball during the ensuing melee after the extra point kick, grabbed his nephew, and ran off the field. He had offered to give the ball back to the Steelers in return for lifetime season tickets but was rebuffed. He has since declined any offer to sell it, including the highest offer of $150,000 from heavy equipment provider Ray Anthony International. Baker has instead kept this coveted piece of NFL memorabilia in a guarded bank vault in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, occasionally bringing it out for public appearances involving the Steelers including one with Franco Harris in 1997 to commemorate the play's 25th anniversary. Legacy The Steelers organization still consider the Immaculate Reception the greatest moment in team history. The Immaculate Reception was documented by NFL Network's A Football Life in 2012. On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the play just hours before the Steelers hosted the Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Harris made the reception at a parking lot just outside Heinz Field, where Three Rivers Stadium formerly stood. This is the third such monument that commemorates the play in the city (the others are located at the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Heinz History Center). The play was referenced on the third season premiere of This Is Us. In the 2013-14 NFL playoffs, Seattle Seahawks' Richard Sherman deflected a pass by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, that was intended for Michael Crabtree, which was caught by teammate Malcolm Smith to seal the Seahawks' 23–17 victory in the NFC Championship Game. The play was later dubbed \\"the Immaculate Deflection\\" (as an homage to the Immaculate Reception), and would later be voted by Seahawks fans to be the most significant play in franchise history. For Super Bowl XLIX, Wix.com ran an ad featuring retired football players using its tools to build websites for their new businesses, including Franco Harris who creates a fictional wedding planning website called \\"Immaculate Receptions\\" named after the famous play.https://www.wix.com/blog/2015/01/5-beautiful-wix-websites-that-almost- broke-the-internet/ For Super Bowl LIII, the NFL used the Immaculate Reception reference, with Bradshaw throwing while chased by Aaron Donald, with contemporary 21st-century players deflecting the ball, and being caught by Harris as part of the NFL's centennial advertising campaign. A 2019 poll of media members by the NFL named the Immaculate Reception as the greatest NFL play in its history.

Examples of such devices range from self-resetting fuses (where the MTTR would be very short, probably seconds), up to whole systems which have to be repaired or replaced. The MTTR would usually be part of a maintenance contract, where the user would pay more for a system MTTR of which was 24 hours, than for one of, say, 7 days. This does not mean the supplier is guaranteeing to have the system up and running again within 24 hours (or 7 days) of being notified of the failure. It does mean the average repair time will tend towards 24 hours (or 7 days). A more useful maintenance contract measure is the maximum time to recovery which can be easily measured and the supplier held accountable. Note that some suppliers will interpret MTTR to mean 'mean time to respond' and others will take it to mean 'mean time to replace/repair/recover/resolve'. The former indicates that the supplier will acknowledge a problem and initiate mitigation within a certain timeframe. Some systems may have an MTTR of zero, which means that they have redundant components which can take over the instant the primary one fails, see RAID for example. However, the failed device involved in this redundant configuration still needs to be returned to service and hence the device itself has a non-zero MTTR even if the system as a whole (through redundancy) has an MTTR of zero.

Entire forests were stripped during this period for building materials, fuel wood, and to clear land for crops and livestock. Along with grassroots concerns about preservation of forests and trees came a natural pride in a part of the local flora, and the concept of a state tree was born. Although the mid Atlantic region of the United States has mild weather which allows the USDA to grow most of the species designated by the various states as their arboreal emblems, it cannot successfully grow a few of the state trees such as the cabbage palmetto, which is the state tree of both Florida and South Carolina, or the kukui, which is Hawaii's state tree. Substitutes have been made for these species so the arboretum could have a tree that is important in each of the states. Planting was undertaken in 1989 with the National Association of State Foresters, the American Forest Foundation, the USDA Forest Service, and the U.S. National Arboretum joining forces to create the Grove of State Trees. The centerpiece of the collection is the portal adjacent to the M Street Parking Lot in Washington, D.C. A wooden entrance arbor is dedicated to the memory of Jeanne Yeutter, wife of former Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, whose sponsorship of the project helped the concept of a Grove of State Trees to be realized. The inscription on the arbor reads \\"In Celebration of Jeanne Yeutter's Love of Trees\\". The arbor leads to a large plaza with a flagstone star and a wall adorned with pottery tiles designed and fabricated by Liza Bach, a Tennessee crafter. Each tile is individually cast with the name of each state and a raised image of the foliage of the state tree. Although a complete trail system is planned to link all the individual plantings of state trees, as of 2004, only a small portion of the trail is complete, and most of the collection is not accessible to the handicapped.

Adopting the designation of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, it was initially composed of volunteers within brigades established along regional lines, though a halt in recruitment in the early months of the war caused a delay in the formation of brigade and divisional headquarters. With questions concerning overseas deployment resolved, the division's respective commands were formed in May and June 1940, and at British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's request, the division was deployed to the United Kingdom between 1August and 25December 1940, forming part of the Canadian Corps. Having performed well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, elements of the 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division's 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe's beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses and had to be evacuated, with fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom. Following a period of reconstruction and retraining from 1942 to 1944, the division joined II Canadian Corps as part of the British Second Army for the Allied invasion of Normandy. The 2nd Division saw significant action from 20July to 21August in the battles for Caen and Falaise. Joining the newly activated headquarters of the First Canadian Army in the assault on northwestern Europe, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division played a significant role in the retaking of the Channel Ports, the Battle of the Scheldt, and the liberation of the Netherlands. The division was deactivated shortly after the end of the war. Formation, garrison duties and organization (1939–1940) At the start of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was initially composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on 1September 1939.Bercuson, p. 27 The fighting power of this force lay in its constituent infantry brigades, of which each division had three. These were in turn composed of three rifle and one machine gun battalion, with additional divisional artillery and engineer units in support.Bercuson, p. 279 Formed under the command of Major-General Victor Odlum with an authorized strength of between 13,000 and 17,000 personnel,Stacey 1955, p. 75 the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, like its sister formation, was originally organized along regional lines. Its 4th Brigade was composed of regiments from Ontario, the 5th Brigade of regiments from Quebec, and 6th Brigade of regiments from Western Canada.Stacey 1955, p. 43 These were the same infantry brigades—although their constituent battalions were different—that had formed part of the 2nd Canadian Division during its service on the Western Front as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.Chartrand, p. 12 It was over a year before the 2nd Division came together as a cohesive unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba.Bercuson, p. 29 The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.Stacey 1955, p. 39Byers pp. xvii & 81 The 2nd Division's structure was altered in early 1940, reducing its number of machine-gun battalions from three to one.Copp, p. 20 The Camerons and the Chaudières (now a rifle battalion) were reassigned to the newly mobilized 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, and the Winnipeg Grenadiers were sent to Jamaica for garrison duty, after which they returned to Canada then redeployed to Hong Kong, where they were captured when it fell to the Japanese on 25December 1941.Willmott & Keegan, p. 57 In May 1940, The Black Watch were moved from Valcartier to Newfoundland, and in June, the 2nd Division was earmarked for garrison duty by the forces of the British Commonwealth,Copp, p. 15 with the Royal Regiment of Canada and Les Fusiliers Mont Royal arriving in Iceland later that month.Copp, p. 16 However, at the request of Winston Churchill these deployments were cut short, as the division was badly needed in England to supplement the British Army—then facing the imminent possibility of German invasion. As a result, most of the 2nd Division's units were sent to the United Kingdom in August 1940, although the Iceland garrison remained in place until 31October. The absence of the Mont Royals allowed Odlum to reassign the Calgary Highlanders to the 5th Brigade in September, in an attempt to ethnically mix the brigades of the division.Copp, p. 19 By late December 1940, the 2nd Canadian Division was joined with the 1st to form the Canadian Corps (later renamed to I Canadian Corps).Canadian Army Historical Section, p. 34 Training in the United Kingdom (1941) Harold Marshall of the Calgary Highlanders' Sniper Platoon In 1941, the Toronto Scottish Regiment was transferred from the 1st Division to become the machine-gun battalion of the 2nd Division.Copp, p. 12 Around the same time, the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars) was raised from 2nd Division personnel supplemented by reinforcements from Canada. Due to equipment shortages, it was often difficult to adequately supply newly arrived divisions in England.Berton, p. 362 Artillery units had to make use of outmoded 75 mm guns with steel tires, and a lack of anti-aircraft guns—diverted to civil defence during the height of the Battle of Britain—left Canadian units to fend for themselves with small arms.Copp, p. 22 However, by February 1941, enough Bren guns had been issued to the infantry units and, by September, the artillery had been equipped with 25-pounder () howitzers, although signals equipment and transport were still lacking and anti-tank guns were dangerously scarce.Bercuson, p. 63 When the division was not engaged in coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training took the form of increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14 to 16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.Copp, p. 23 On 23December 1941, Major General Harry Crerar was appointed as divisional commander, replacing Odlum who had ceased command in November, temporarily handing over to Major General John Roberts. However, Crerar was appointed temporary corps commander the same day and as a result never actually fulfilled the role of divisional commander, with Roberts eventually being confirmed in the role in April 1942.Stacey 1955, p. 542 Meanwhile, on 30December 1941, the Calgary Highlanders introduced \\"battle drill\\" to the division.Copp, p. 24 This new type of training emphasized small unit tactics as well as \\"hardening\\" training through use of live ammunition, slaughterhouse visits, and obstacle courses, and was adopted throughout Commonwealth forces stationed in Britain. Operation Jubilee (1942) Soldiers' corpses from the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division following the Dieppe Raid In early 1942, under Roberts, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division participated in several additional full-scale combat exercises, again gauging the ability of Commonwealth divisions to repel a possible German invasion. As April and May progressed, the exercises intensified, becoming significantly more demanding on the participants.Copp, p. 29 As a result, the 2nd Division was judged to be one of the four best divisions in the United Kingdom,Copp, p. 30 and was selected as the primary force for the upcoming Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe—codenamed Operation Jubilee. Mounted as a test of whether or not such a landing was feasible,Bercuson, p. 62 the Dieppe raid was to be undertaken by the 4th and 6th Brigades, with additional naval, air, and infantry support. Significant elements of the 5th Brigade were also involved. On 19August 1942, while British commando units attacked bunker positions on the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated at the foot of a sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of the men that landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.Bercuson, p. 69 The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay in front of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the majority of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy.Zuehlke, p. 151 Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded or captured.Bercuson, p. 73 At Green Beach to the west, part of the South Saskatchewan Regiment was landed on the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of PourvilleBercuson, p. 71 was captured but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities. Rebuilding (1942–1944) Throughout 1943, the 2nd Division focused on rebuilding its ranks, having lost close to half its strength at Dieppe. In April 1943, Major General Guy Simonds assumed command of the division, taking over from Roberts,Stacey 1955, p. 249 before handing over the following month to Major General Eedson Burns. In January 1944, Major General Charles Foulkes—the first officer to command the division who had not served in the Great War—replaced Burns.Copp, p. 35 The following month, all three brigade commanders were replaced as part of a general move to modernize the Canadian forces' higher echelons;Copp, p. 37 further sweeping changes throughout all levels of command, coupled with the lingering effects of the large influx of new personnel during 1943, lowered morale in the division. However, in March 1944, training again intensified, heralding the coming invasion of Europe. On 9March, the 2nd Division was inspected by King George VI,Copp, p. 38 and by May the division numbered close to 18,000 fully equipped and trained soldiers.Copp, p. 39 When D-Day arrived on 6June 1944, the main Canadian assault was led by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, while the 2nd Division was held in reserve.Copp, p. 41 At this time, the division consisted of three brigades—4th, 5th and 6th—each of three infantry battalions,Hart 2016, p. 24 and a brigade ground defence platoon provided by Lorne Scots.Rottman, p. 60 In addition, at divisional level there was a machine gun battalion and a reconnaissance regiment provided by the Toronto Scottish Regiment (machine gun) and 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars), as well as various combat support and service support elements including field, anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery, field engineers, electrical and mechanical engineers, and signals, medical, ordnance, service corps troops and provosts.English, p. 177Hart, p. 24 Battle of Normandy The attack on Juno Beach by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was the most successful of the five beaches attacked on D-Day, 6June 1944. Having successfully landed in Normandy, Allied forces soon became embroiled in battles against German armour and were unable to significantly expand their beachhead; by the time the 2nd Division came ashore at the end of the first week of July, the entire front had congealed.Zuehlke, p. 166 Assigned to the II Canadian Corps, and subordinated to the British Second Army, the division assembled its brigades for combat while British and Canadian forces launched Operation Charnwood. It was a tactical success, but could not clear all Caen of its German defenders.D'Este, p. 325 Although originally a D-Day objective, Caen proved a difficult prize, holding out until 19July when it finally fell to British troops during Operation Goodwood.Trew, p. 77 In the aftermath, General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo- Canadian 21st Army Group, ordered elements of II Canadian Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, to push forward towards Verrières Ridge, the dominant geographical feature between Caen and Falaise. By keeping up the pressure, Montgomery hoped to divert German attention away from the American sector to the west.D'Este, p. 398 Operation Atlantic Operation Atlantic, launched on 18July alongside Goodwood, had the objectives of securing the western bank of the Orne River and Verrières Ridge.Zuehlke, p. 168 The 2nd Division's 5th and 6th Brigades were selected as the assaulting forces, with the 5th Brigade focusing on the Orne and the 6th on Verrières. The 4th Brigade were tasked with securing the flank of the operation, and the Royal Regiment of Canada attacked Louvigny on 18July.Stacey 1964, p. 172 Early on 19July, the Calgary Highlanders seized Point 67, directly north of Verrières Ridge, and the following morning the Royal Highland Regiment of Canada crossed the Orne River and secured the flanks of the advance. In the afternoon, the 6th Brigade's South Saskatchewan Regiment attacked the well-entrenched German positions on the ridge, with support from Typhoon fighter-bombers and tanks.Bercuson, p. 223 However, the attack ran into torrential rain, and the Germans counterattacked in force. This and further German attacks inflicted heavy casualties on the South Saskatchewan Regiment and its supporting battalions, the Essex Scottish Regiment and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. On 21July, the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade reinforced Canadian positions on Point 67. In two days of fighting, the division suffered 1,349 casualties. Operation Spring Formation sign used to identify vehicles of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division On 22July 1944, Montgomery elected to use the Anglo-Canadian forces south of Caen in an all-out offensive aimed at breaking the German defensive cordon keeping his forces bottled up in Normandy.Bercuson, p. 224 To meet Montgomery's objectives, General Simonds was ordered to design a large breakout assault, codenamed Operation Spring.Copp, p. 63 The attack was planned in three tightly timed phases of advance, pitting two Canadian and two British divisions against three German SS-Panzer divisions, which would be launched in conjunction with an American offensive, Operation Cobra, scheduled to take place on 25July 1944.Stacey 1964, pp. 180 & 183 The 4th Brigade attacked in the east with some success, taking Verrières village itself, but were repulsed at Tilly-la-Campagne by German counterattacks. The 5th Brigade, in the centre, made a bid for Fontenay-le- Marmion; of the 325 members of the Black Watch who left the start-lines, only 15 answered evening roll-call. German counterattacks on 26 and 27July pushed Canadian forces back to Point 67.Copp, p. 87 However, the situation eventually eased for the 2nd Canadian Division when US forces went on the offensive. Throughout the first week of August, significant German resources were transferred from the Anglo-Canadian front to that of the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant General George Patton, while reinforcements moved from Pas de Calais to the Falaise–Calvados area.Bercuson, p. 228 By 7August 1944, only one major formation—the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend—faced Canadian forces on Verrières Ridge.Stacey 1948, p. 205 Operation Totalize By 1August 1944, the British had made significant gains on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had achieved a complete breakthrough in the west. On 4August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to prepare an advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen–Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise.Bercuson, p. 229 However, strong resistance by the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division halted the advance. Although 12 km (7.5 mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.Bercuson, p. 230 Simultaneously, the Germans had launched Operation Luttich, a desperate and ill-prepared armoured thrust towards Mortain, beginning on 6August 1944. This was halted within a day and, despite the increasingly dangerous threat presented by the Anglo–Canadian advance on Falaise, the German commander Field Marshal Günther von Kluge was prohibited by Hitler from redeploying his forces.D'Este, p. 420 Thus, as American armoured formations advanced towards Argentan from the south, the Allies were presented with an opportunity to encircle large sections of the German Seventh Army.D'Este, p. 427 The First Canadian Army was ordered south, while the Americans prepared to move on Chambois on 14August. Simonds and Crerar quickly planned a further offensive that would push through to Falaise, trapping the German Seventh Army in Normandy.Zuehlke, p. 169 Operation Tractable On 14August, the First Canadian Army launched Operation Tractable with the aim of capturing Falaise and achieving a linkup with American forces in Chambois.D'Este, p. 429 A daylight attack was executed after artillery provided smoke-screen cover and medium bombers softened up the German defences. The offensive was largely successful and, although the 2nd Division was not an active participant, divisional troops entered Falaise on 16August as the remainder of First Canadian Army moved south-east towards Trun and Chambois. By 21August the remnants of the battered German Seventh Army had surrendered in the Falaise Pocket, bringing the Battle of Normandy to a close. The German forces committed to Normandy since D-Day had been virtually annihilated—by the end of Operation Tractable, the 12th SS Panzer Division, the main adversary of the Canadians, had lost 80% of its tanks,D'Este, p. 432 70% of its personnel carriers, and 60% of its artillery. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Division moved to Foret de la Londe, along the valley of the River Seine. From 27to 29August, the 4th and 6th Brigades were engaged in heavy fighting against the rearguard of German forces seeking to withdraw across the Seine. The Channel Ports and the Scheldt Canadian movements during the Battle of the Scheldt, October 1944 Throughout September and October 1944, the First Canadian Army moved along the coast of France with the aim of securing the Channel Ports. On 1September, while the 3rd Division made for Boulogne and Calais, the 2nd Division entered Dieppe, encountering virtually no resistance.Bercuson, p. 234 Five days later they were tasked by Montgomery and Crerar with retaking Dunkirk.Copp, p. 123 Heavy fighting around the outskirts would hold the division for several days but, by 9September, the 5th Brigade had captured the port.Copp, p. 127 The Dunkirk perimeter was handed over to the British on 15September, and the 2nd Division made for Antwerp. Although the Belgian White Brigade, the 11th Armoured Division, and elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division had entered Antwerp as early as 6September, taking the city and docks, a strategic oversight meant that the nearby bridges over the Albert Canal were not seized, leaving the Germans in control of the Scheldt estuary.Copp, p. 132 The failure to make an immediate push on the estuary ensured the strategically vital port would remain useless until the Scheldt was cleared. Strong formations of the German Fifteenth Army, which had withdrawn from the Pas de Calais, were able to consolidate their positions on the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, as well as the Albert Canal directly northwest of Antwerp, and were further reinforced by elements of General Kurt Student's First Parachute Army. During the initial phases of the battle, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division sought to force a crossing of the Albert Canal.Bercuson, p. 235 On 2October, the entire First Canadian Army—under the temporary command of General Simonds—moved against the German defences. Two days later, 2nd Division had cleared the canal, and was moving northwest towards South Beveland and Walcheren Island.Zuehlke, p. 170 On Friday, 13October, later known as \\"Black Friday\\", the 5th Brigade's Black Watch attacked positions near the coast, losing all four company commanders and over 200 men.Bercuson, p. 249 Three days later, the Calgary Highlanders conducted a more successful offensive, capturing the initial objective of Woensdrecht. Simultaneously, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division captured Bergen, cutting off South Beveland and Walcheren from reinforcement.Bercuson, p. 250 Battles for the Rhine (November 1944 – March 1945) By November 1944, the First Canadian Army had entered the Nijmegen Salient which was being held for use in the development of future offensives.Bercuson, p. 255 The 2nd Division came under the command of Major General Bruce Matthews, with Foulkes being transferred to command the I Canadian Corps on the Italian Front.Copp, p. 176 The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 to January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians had enjoyed since landing on the Normandy beaches the previous June. Sherman tanks of the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse) with infantry of the Royal Regiment of Canada massing in preparation for the assault on Goch, 17 February 1945 Operation Veritable was designed to bring the 21st Army Group to the west bank of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive.Bercuson, p. 258 Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald Layback covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8February 1945, with the 2nd Division's advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant defences in depth, both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, and to add to the Canadians' difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel.Bercuson, p. 263 On 11February, the division moved southeast to assist British XXX Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood. The operational plan's second phase called for the 2nd and 3rd Divisions to take the Hochwald Forest. Following its capture, the 4th Canadian Armoured would sweep through the Hochwald Gap towards Wesel,Bercuson, p. 265 followed by the 2nd Division \\"leap-frogging\\" towards Xanten. Operation Blockbuster was scheduled for 27February, but despite initial gains, stubborn German resistance prolonged the battle for six days.Zuehlke, p. 171 It was not until 3March that the forest was cleared—during the intense close-quarter fighting, Major Frederick Tilston of the Essex Scottish Regiment won a Victoria Cross. Operation Blockbuster's final phase was the attack on Xanten itself, which lasted from 8to 10March.Zuehlke, p. 172 This fell primarily to the 2nd Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, although the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division was temporarily assigned to Simonds's II Canadian Corps for the assault.Copp, p. 190 Despite an elaborate preceding artillery barrage, dogged German resistance caused the battle to degenerate into one of attrition. Because effective air-support was prevented by fog and movement was hindered by German mortar barrages, the British and Canadians suffered heavy casualties. However, by 10March, the 2nd Division's 5th Brigade had linked up with elements of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, bringing the offensive to a close.Copp, p. 192 Total Canadian casualties during Veritable and Blockbuster were 5,304 killed or wounded. North of the Rhine (March–May 1945) Canadian troops at Groningen As Canadian forces had incurred heavy casualties in clearing a path to the Rhine, the 2nd Division was excluded from the massive crossing operation that took place on 23March 1945, instead crossing unopposed a week later after a bridgehead had been secured.Bercuson, p. 267 After a brief detour through German territory, the First Canadian Army—now unified with the arrival of I Canadian Corps from Italian Front—prepared to assault German positions in the Netherlands. The 2nd Division moved northwards towards Groningen.Copp, p.196 In the nine days preceding their attack, German resistance had been light and uncoordinated,Copp, p. 197 but opposition stiffened as the assault progressed, leading to heavy losses among the battalions of the 5th Brigade.Copp, p. 200 By 13April, the division had been shifted eastward to guard the flanks of a British assault on Bremen,Copp, p. 202 and the following day ICanadian Corps liberated Arnhem. On 2May, the 2nd Division took Oldenburg, solidifying Canadian positions throughout the Netherlands.Zuehlke, p. 173 German and Canadian forces declared a ceasefire on 5May,Copp, p. 205 and all fighting came to an end with the surrender of German forces in Western Europe on 7May 1945. In October 1945, after four months in the Netherlands, General Order 52/46 officially disbanded the headquarters of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. By December, the entirety of the division had been stood down and returned to Canada.Copp, p. 206 The division suffered heavy casualties through 1944 and 1945; according to Bercuson it had the \\"highest casualty ratio in the Canadian Army – from the time it returned to combat in early July 1944 until the end of the war\\".Bercuson p. 74.

He is noted for the military expansion of his domain.  Background  Dae Mu-ye was the eldest son of Dae Jo-yeong, the founder of the ancient kingdom of Balhae, He ascended to the throne after the death in 719 of his father. He was given the title of \\"King of the Gyeru Province\\" by Tang Emperor Xuanzong. He gave the posthumous title King Go to his father, Dae Jo-yeong. Since then, He declared the era name In-an, an act of independence from China's Tang dynasty. On the other hand, he frequently sent embassies to the Tang, including his sons and brothers.  Reign  Balhae's aggressive expansion triggered frictions with Tang China, Silla of southern Korea, the Khitans, the Xi, the Göktürks, and several Mohe tribes. When the Heishui Mohe in the north of Balhae came under the direct control of the Tang in 727, he attacked the Heisui Mohe fearing a pincer attack. Dae Mun-ye (大門藝), His pro- Tang brother, opposed the military campaign and defected to the Tang. In 732, King Mu ordered a punitive expedition against Tang in present-day Shandong, sending the Balhae navy at the command of Jang Mun-hyu. In the same year, he led troops to Madushan (馬都山) in the vicinity of Shanhaiguan and occupied nearby towns.New History of Tang Dynasty Wuchengci zhuan, p.4597; Comprehensive Mirror to Add in Government, Vol.210, Xuanzhong Kaiyuan 21st Year, January, “Kaoyi”,p.6800 In 733, Chinese Emperor Xuanzong ordered Dae Mun-ye to attack Balhae, along with forces from Silla, but the attack was unsuccessful and they were repelled. In 727, Balhae began to dispatch embassies to Japan to avoid international isolation. The king sent an official document to Japan indicating that Balhae recovered the terrain of Goguryeo and succeeded to the culture of Buyeo. Japan, whose relationship with Silla was strained, welcomed them as a revival of Goguryeo. In 732, He made an assault on Tang empire's Dengzhou. During the assault, the local governor of Dengzhou Wei Jun was killed. The assault was mostly an act of piracy and did not elevate to an international conflict until Wei's death. Later, Tang, allied with Silla, invaded Balhae but the advance of the allied troops was deterred by heavy snow. Dae Muye was succeeded by his son Dae Heummu in 737.

A zucchini is a thin-skinned cultivar of what in Britain and Ireland is referred to as a marrow. In South Africa, zucchini is known as baby marrow. Along with certain other squashes and pumpkins, the zucchini belongs to the species Cucurbita pepo., The Integrated Taxonomic Information System, 6 November 2002. Retrieved on 2010-07-19. It can be dark or light green. A related hybrid, the golden zucchini, is a deep yellow or orange color. In a culinary context, the zucchini is treated as a vegetable; it is usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment. Botanically, zucchinis are fruits, a type of botanical berry called a \\"pepo\\", being the swollen ovary of the zucchini flower. The zucchini, like all squash, originates in the Americas, specifically Mesoamerica. Its original name in Nahuatl is ayo(h)conetl, also with the variants ayo or ayocotzin (plural ayococone). After this, the concept and use of zucchini was developed in northern Italy in the second half of the 19th century, long after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas in the early 16th century. Naming and etymology Harvest-ready, although not yet full-grown, zucchini on plant; the glossy skin is progressively lost after the first week following anthesis. Golden zucchini grown in the Netherlands for sale in a supermarket in Montpellier, France, in April 2013 Zucchini is the plural of zucchino, a diminutive of Italian zucca 'pumpkin, squash'. Zucchino, the masculine form, is attested earlier,Accademia della Crusca, Alcune varianti di nomi di frutti but the feminine form zucchina is also found.lo Zingarelli 2015, Zanichelli EditoreDevoto-Oli, Le Monnier The Accademia della Crusca prefers the masculine form, and the Treccani prefers the feminine, considering the masculine to be Tuscan dialect.Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana, Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti The plurals are zucchini and zucchine. In the United States, New Zealand,https://www.gardengrow.co.nz/plant/Zucchini Australia, English-speaking Canada, Sweden and Germany, the plant is commonly called a zucchini (; plural: zucchini or zucchinis), from Italian zucchina (; plural: zucchine), diminutive of zucca 'gourd, marrow, pumpkin, squash'. The name courgette () is a French loanword, the diminutive of courge 'gourd, marrow', and is commonly used in France, Belgium, and other Francophone areas, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore, a fully-grown, matured courgette is referred to as a marrow. Most marrow cultivars sold in the UK are striped. In South Africa, the fruit is typically harvested as a baby vegetable, approximately finger size, and is referred to as baby marrows. Flower Flower of zucchini The female flower is a golden blossom on the end of each emergent zucchini. The male flower grows directly on the stem of the zucchini plant in the leaf axils (where leaf petiole meets stem), on a long stalk, and is slightly smaller than the female. Both flowers are edible and are often used to dress a meal or to garnish the cooked fruit. Firm and fresh blossoms that are only slightly open are cooked to be eaten, with pistils removed from female flowers, and stamens removed from male flowers. The stems on the flowers can be retained as a way of giving the cook something to hold onto during cooking, rather than injuring the delicate petals, or they can be removed prior to cooking, or prior to serving. There are a variety of recipes in which the flowers may be deep fried as fritters or tempura (after dipping in a light tempura batter), stuffed, sautéed, baked, or used in soups. History Zucchini, like all squash, has its ancestry in the Americas, specifically Mesoamerica. However, the varieties of green, cylindrical squash harvested immature and typically called \\"zucchini\\" were cultivated in northern Italy, as much as three centuries after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas. It appears that this occurred in the second half of the 19th century, although the first description of the variety under the name zucchini occurs in a work published in Milan in 1901.Teresa A. Lust and Harry S. Paris, \\"Italian horticultural and culinary records of summer squash (Cucurbita pepo Cucurbitaceae) and emergence of the zucchini in 19th-century Milan\\" Annals of Botany 2016, vol. 118, pp53-69. Early varieties usually appended the names of nearby cities in their names. The first records of zucchini in the United States date to the early 1920s. It was almost certainly taken to America by Italian immigrants and probably was first cultivated in the United States in California. A 1928 report on vegetables grown in New York State treats 'Zucchini' as one among 60 cultivated varieties of C. pepo. Culinary uses Zucchini soup When used for food, zucchini are usually picked when under in length, when the seeds are still soft and immature. Mature zucchini can be long or more. The larger ones are often fibrous. A zucchini with the flowers attached is a sign of a truly fresh and immature fruit, and it is especially sought after for its sweeter flavor. Unlike cucumber, zucchini is usually served cooked. It can be prepared using a variety of cooking techniques, including steamed, boiled, grilled, stuffed and baked, barbecued, fried, or incorporated in other recipes such as soufflés. Zucchini can also be baked into a zucchini bread, similar to banana bread, or incorporated into a cake mix to make zucchini cake, similar to carrot cake. Its flowers can be eaten stuffed and are a delicacy when deep fat fried (e.g., tempura). Grilled zucchini Zucchini has a delicate flavor and requires little more than quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without fresh herbs. The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially boil and steam, with the juices concentrated in the final moments of frying when the water has gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles that act as a spaghetti substitute for low-carbohydrate recipes. In Bulgaria, zucchini may be fried and then served with a dip, made from yogurt, garlic, and dill. Another popular dish is oven-baked zucchini—sliced or grated—covered with a mixture of eggs, yogurt, flour, and dill. In Egypt, zucchini may be cooked with tomato sauce, garlic, and onions. In France, zucchini is a key ingredient in ratatouille, a stew of summer fruits and vegetables prepared in olive oil and cooked for an extended time over low heat. The dish, originating near present-day Nice, is served as a side dish or on its own at lunch with bread. Zucchini may be stuffed with meat or with other fruits such as tomatoes or bell peppers in a dish called courgette farcie (stuffed zucchini). In Greece, zucchini is usually fried or stewed with other fruits (often green chili peppers and eggplants). It is served as an hors d'œuvre or as a main dish, especially during fasting seasons. Zucchini is also stuffed with minced meat, rice, and herbs and served with avgolemono sauce. In several parts of Greece, the flowers of the plant are stuffed with white cheese, usually feta or mizithra, or with a mixture of rice, herbs, and occasionally minced meat. They are then deep-fried or baked in the oven with tomato sauce. In Italy, zucchini is served in a variety of ways: fried, baked, boiled, or deep fried, alone or in combination with other ingredients. At home and in some restaurants, it is possible to eat the flowers, as well, deep-fried, known as fiori di zucca (cf. pumpkin flower fritter). In the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, zucchini is often stuffed and called dolma. It is also used in various stews, both with and without meat, including ladera. In Mexico, the flower (known as flor de calabaza) is often cooked in soups or used as a filling for quesadillas. The fruit is used in stews, soups (i.e. caldo de res, de pollo, or de pescado, mole de olla, etc.) and other preparations. The flower, as well as the fruit, is eaten often throughout Latin America. Sliced zucchini for preparation of salad In Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries, zucchini usually is coated in flour or semolina and then fried or baked in vegetable oil, served with a sour cream. Another popular recipe is \\"zucchini caviar\\", a squash spread made from thermically processed zucchini, carrots, onions and tomato paste, produced either homemade or industrially as a vegetable preserve. In Turkey, zucchini is the main ingredient in the popular dish mücver, or \\"zucchini pancakes\\", made from shredded zucchini, flour, and eggs, lightly fried in olive oil and eaten with yogurt. They are also often used in kebabs along with various meats. The flowers are also used in a cold dish, where they are stuffed with a rice mix with various spices and nuts and stewed. In 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed it to be Britain's 10th favorite culinary vegetable. Stuffed zucchini is found in many cuisines. Typical stuffings in the Middle Eastern family of dolma include rice, onions, tomato, and sometimes meat. Nutrition Zucchini plant in India (2012) Zucchini are low in food energy (approximately per fresh zucchini) and contain useful amounts of folate (24 μg/100 g), potassium (261 mg/100 g), and provitamin A (200 IU [10 RAE]/100 g).USDA Agricultural Research Service National Nutrient Database Basic Report: 11477, Squash, summer, zucchini, includes skin, raw Zucchini can be shaped into noodle-like spirals and used as a low-carbohydrate substitute for pasta or noodles. Toxicology Members of the plant family Cucurbitaceae, which includes zucchini / marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are steroids which defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can have high levels of cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Dry weather or irregular watering can also favor the production of the toxin, which is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly the elderly) should therefore ask a younger person to taste the zucchini for them. This toxin has caused at least one death of an elderly person in recent years. Investigators warned that gardeners should not save their own seeds, as reversion to forms containing more poisonous cucurbitacin might occur. Zucchini can also be responsible for allergy caused by the presence of a protein: profilin. The sap released when peeling young zucchini also contains a viscous substance which when drying on the hands gives the impression of super-glue and dry hands. Cultivation A young zucchini plant grown by a home gardener in the city. Zucchini is very easy to cultivate in temperate climates. As such, it has a reputation among home gardeners for overwhelming production. The part harvested as \\"zucchini\\" is the immature fruit, although the flowers, mature fruit, and leaves are eaten, as well. One good way to control overabundance is to harvest the flowers, which are an expensive delicacy in markets because of the difficulty in storing and transporting them. The male flower is borne on the end of a stalk and is longer-lived. While easy to grow, zucchini, like all squash, requires plentiful bees for pollination. In areas of pollinator decline or high pesticide use, such as mosquito-spray districts, gardeners often experience fruit abortion, where the fruit begins to grow, then dries or rots. This is due to an insufficient number of pollen grains delivered to the female flower. It can be corrected by hand pollination or by increasing the bee population. Closely related to zucchini are Lebanese summer squash or kusa (not to be confused with cushaw), but they often are lighter green or even white. Some seed catalogs do not distinguish them. Various varieties of round zucchinis are grown in different countries under different names, such as \\"Tondo di Piacenza\\" in Italy and \\"Ronde de Nice\\" in France. In the late 1990s, American producers in California cultivated and began marketing round yellow and green zucchini known as \\"8-ball\\" squash (the yellow ones are sometimes known as \\"1-ball\\" or \\"gold ball\\"). White zucchini (summer squash) is sometimes seen as a mutation and can appear on the same plant as its green counterpart.

Since 1971 regional and national initiatives have been grouped under a parent organization, Emmaus International, now run by Jean Rousseau, representing 350 groups in 37 countries, offering a range of charitable services. Emmaus is a secular organisation, but communities around the world have kept the name because of its symbolism. The biblical story, found in the Gospel of Luke, describes how two men saw the resurrected Jesus on the road to the town of Emmaus, and so regained hope. The organization's guiding principle can be found in the Universal Manifesto of Emmaus International: History Abbé Pierre, founder of the Emmaus movement The first Emmaus Community was founded by Father Henri-Antoine Groues (known as Abbé Pierre) in Paris in 1949. The former Resistance member was also an MP who fought to provide accommodation for the homeless people of Paris. He was assisted by another former Resistance member, Lucie Coutaz. Abbé Pierre also took on the first Emmaus Companion, a former convict called Georges who had attempted suicide in the Seine. George helped to build temporary homes for those in need (initially in the priest's own garden), and then on any land they could obtain. From Parliament in 1951, Abbé Pierre dedicated himself to the homeless cause. He struggled to pay Georges and the first 18 members of the Emmaus Community. The priest was rebuffed by his Church for begging at restaurants and so organised 'rag pickers' to collect unwanted items for resale. This formed the basis of Emmaus Communities raising funds and using profits to help others. The harsh winter of 1954 led to a number of homeless people's deaths and Abbé Pierre appealed through the newspapers and on the radio for donations. The French people responded and Emmaus grew from a national charity into an international one. Emmaus Communities now began to appear across Europe, French West Africa, the Far East and South America. By 2017 there were 400 Emmaus organisations in 44 countries. Emmaus in the UK The first British Emmaus Community appeared in Cambridge in 1992. It was set up by Selwyn Image, who had been a student volunteer at an Emmaus Community in Paris. The charity provides formerly homeless people with a home and work, usually collecting, sorting and reselling donated furniture and household goods. Emmaus UK acts as a central resource to local Emmaus Communities across the UK. As of September 2016, there are 28 Emmaus Communities operating in the UK, with others under development. These communities provide accommodation and meaningful work for formerly homeless people.

The 1st Canadian Army Tank Brigade, later known as 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, was an armoured brigade of the Canadian Army, raised during the Second World War. The brigade was composed of the 11th, 12th and 14th Canadian Armoured regiments and saw service in the Italian campaign and later in north-west Europe. It was one of only two independent Canadian armoured brigades in combat, the other being 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. History The 1st Canadian Tank Brigade was formed on 4 February 1941.Marteinson, J.K. and Michael McNorgan. The Royal Canadian Armoured Corps: An Illustrated History (Kitchener: Robin Brass, 2000), 89. The Ontario Regiment and The Three Rivers Regiment were transferred from the incomplete 1st Canadian Armoured Division to provide the nucleus of the 1st Canadian Tank Brigade in February 1941. In March, The Calgary Regiment joined the new brigade from 2nd Division. The Fort Garry Horse were also originally part of the brigade, but transferred to the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division in May 1941. General Sir Bernard Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, addresses officers and men of the 11th Army Tank Regiment (The Ontario Regiment (Tank)) near Lentini, Sicily, 25 July 1943. The 1st Tank Brigade moved to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1941; personnel arrived in the Clyde on 30 June and were promptly moved to Salisbury Plain where they were issued sufficient Churchill tanks for training. The Calgary Regiment participated in the disastrous Dieppe landing in 1942. Issued brand new M4 \\"Sherman\\" tanks, the entire brigade moved to the Mediterranean, with The Three Rivers Regiment participating in the assault landing at Pachino. The remainder of the brigade landed with the follow-up convoy of 13 July and served alongside the Three Rivers Regiment for the final weeks of the brief campaign in Sicily. The 1st Tank Brigade's role in the latter operations was largely one of fire support, the rugged terrain limiting the role of the armoured corps. The fight for Sicily ended with 1st Tank in reserve. Preparing for Operation Baytown, the landings on mainland Italy, it was redesignated 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade in August 1943. Although reorganized as an armoured brigade, no motor battalion served under command. Having established a reputation for both courage and skill, the Canadian tankers were in constant demand by senior British commanders. The brigade took part in the British Eighth Army's assault landing on the toe of Italy in Operation Baytown in September 1943. Its regiments participated in the Battles of Potenza, Termoli, Ortona. During the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944, the brigade helped break the Gustav Line, crossing the Gari River in support of the 8th Indian Division. Its regiments helped the 1st Canadian Division and the British 78th Division in breaking the Hitler Line. It cooperated with the British XIII Corps in the Battle of Lake Trasimeno. It was active in the crossing of the Arno River and later fought on the Gothic Line. Combined with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and 5th Canadian Armoured Division as part of I Canadian Corps, the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade was moved from the Italian Front and joined the First Canadian Army in Northern Europe at the beginning of 1945. Here it participated in the crossing of the IJssel River. In its two incarnations as 1st Tank and 1st Armoured, the brigade's service at Dieppe, France, in Sicily, Italy, and Northwest Europe earned it the distinction of the longest and widest service of any brigade of the Canadian Army during the Second World War.

During the postwar era, he participated in the Soviet and East German Communist-controlled neutralist Alliance of Germans party from 1952 until his death in 1956. Early life Joseph Wirth was born on 6 September 1879 in Freiburg im Breisgau, in what was then the Grand Duchy of Baden, the son of the Maschinenmeister (working engineer) Karl Wirth and his wife Agathe (née Zeller). According to Wirth himself, the Christian and social involvement of his parents had a strong impact on him. From 1899 to 1906 he studied mathematics, natural sciences and economics at the University of Freiburg finishing with a dissertation in mathematics. From 1906 to 1913 Wirth worked as a teacher at a Realgymnasium in Freiburg. In 1909, he was a co-founder and first president of the Akademische Vinzenzkonferenz, a charity run by laymen for the poor. Early career In 1911, he was elected to the Freiburg city council for the Catholic Zentrum. From 1913 to 1921, he was a member of the Badischer Landtag, the diet of the Grand Duchy (later the Republic of Baden). In 1914, Wirth became a member of the Reichstag. His main focus was on social issues. At the start of World War I, Wirth volunteered for military service but was deemed unfit to serve for health reasons. He then joined the Red Cross. From 1914 to 1917, he worked as a nurse on the Western and Eastern Fronts. After contracting pneumonia, he had to stop. In July 1917, Wirth voted in the Reichstag for the \\"peace resolution\\" sponsored by Matthias Erzberger. Revolution and Weimar Republic During the German Revolution of 1918-19, Wirth became Finance Minister of Baden on 10 November 1918, after the provisionary government replaced the Grand Duke's ministers. In January 1919, Wirth was elected to the Constituent Assembly which met at Weimar. At the time he described himself as a \\"firm republican\\". In April 1919, he became Finance Minister of the newly created Freistaat Baden. After the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch of March 1920, when the government of Gustav Bauer resigned and was replaced by one led by Hermann Müller, Wirth became Minister of Finance of the Reich. He continued to hold this portfolio in the subsequent cabinet of Konstantin Fehrenbach. His task was to carry out the system of increased national taxation which his predecessor Matthias Erzberger had induced the Reichstag to adopt. When in May 1921 the Allied ultimatum on reparations (\\"London ultimatum\\") was presented to Germany and the sanctions enforced on the Rhine, the Fehrenbach cabinet, which had rejected the London terms, resigned, and Wirth was called upon to form a new cabinet as Reichskanzler. He succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of a number of Democrats (DDP) and Socialists (SPD), including the prominent industrialist and economist Walther Rathenau as Minister of Reconstruction. Wirth himself retained the portfolio of finance. The new government then accepted the Allies' reparation terms — 132 billion marks (£6,600,000,000) payable in yearly installments of £100,000,000 plus the proceeds of a 25% duty on German exports. By 31 August 1921, Germany had paid the first half-yearly installment of £50,000,000, and in the following October Rathenau succeeded in concluding a comprehensive agreement with France for paying reparations in kind for the reconstruction of the devastated regions. By trying to comply with the Allied demands, the Wirth government attempted to show that it was impossible for the German Reich to satisfy all the reparation demands. The extreme right reacted to Wirth's policy by calling for his assassination. After the assassination of Erzberger on 26 August 1921, the conflict between the Berlin government and the Bavarian government of Gustav Ritter von Kahr came to a head, the latter showing the same recalcitrancy against carrying out the special ordinances against plots as he had previously exhibited in regard to the dissolution of the illegal volunteer force, the Einwohnerwehr. Wirth stood his ground, and von Kahr was compelled by his own party in Bavaria to resign and make way for a more conciliatory Ministerpräsident. The strife which arose out of this acute internal crisis had hardly abated when the announcement in mid-October of the decision of the League of Nations on the partition of Upper Silesia between Germany and Poland aroused wild excitement throughout Germany and sent the exchange value of the mark down; on 17 October, it was 750 marks to the pound. For his part, Wirth is recorded as declaring that Poland must be destroyed.The Burden of German history, 1919-45: essays for the Goethe Institute, Michael Laffan Methuen, 1988, page 89 Wirth had not concealed his conviction that the severance from Germany of the rich industrial district of Upper Silesia would fatally affect Germany's capacity to pay further reparation installments, and the political tension in Berlin again became acute. On 22 October 1921, he resigned in protest over the partition of Upper Silesia against the expressed will of the majority of the population. However, on 25 October, Reichspräsident Friedrich Ebert once again asked him to form a government, which Wirth did on 26 October. On 16 April 1922, Wirth and Rathenau signed the Treaty of Rapallo which ended Germany's foreign policy isolation. After Rathenau was murdered by right-wing extremists on 24 June 1922, Wirth gave a speech in front of the Reichstag the next day in which he warned that \\"we are experiencing in Germany a political brutalization\\" that was characterized by \\"an atmosphere of murder, of rancor, of poison,\\" and famously proclaimed, \\"the enemy is on the right!\\"Joseph Wirth, Reichstagsrede aus Anlass der Ermordung Rathenaus, June 25, 1922, in Politische Reden II: 1914-45, ed. Peter Wende (Frankfurt a.M.: Deutscher Klassiker, 1994), pp. 330-341.Ulrich Schlie: Altreichskanzler Joseph Wirth im Luzerner Exil (1939–1948). In: Exilforschung 15, 1997, S.180–199. On 21 July 1922, the Gesetz zum Schutz der Republik was passed on the initiative of his government, aimed at protecting the republic against its internal enemies. However, by 14 November 1922, Wirth felt that the Erfüllungspolitik of complying with Allied demands had failed and resigned after his attempt to bring all democratic parties together in a coalition failed. In 1924, Wirth joined the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, an organization that aimed to protect the republic. When the Zentrum joined the government of Hans Luther in January 1925, Wirth criticized his party for working together with the nationalist DNVP. In August 1925, he left the Zentrum Reichstag fraction in protest over the social policies of his party but retained his seat as an independent. In April 1929, Wirth became Reichsminister for the occupied territories in the Second Müller Cabinet. After that government's resignation in late March 1930, Wirth became Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Heinrich Brüning. Wirth was highly popular with the Social Democrats and acted as mediator between them and the new government. In October 1931, he was pushed out of office and replaced by Wilhelm Groener on the personal initiative of Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg, who regarded Wirth as a leftist. Nazi era In March 1933, two months after Hitler was appointed chancellor by Hindenburg, Wirth spoke passionately in the Reichstag against the Nazi-sponsored Enabling Act, which gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Wirth voted in favor of the Act along with the rest of Centre parliamentary fraction on 24 March. After its passage, Wirth emigrated to Switzerland, settling in Lucerne and purchasing a villa there. He communicated with leading statesmen in Britain and France about the dangers of Nazism, and traveled to the US, where he met with the exiled former chancellor Heinrich Brüning and gave lectures at Harvard University and Princeton University on the Nazi regime. Wirth resided in Paris from 1935 to 1939, when he returned to Lucerne. Subsequently, he made efforts to inform the Vatican about the threat of Nazi Germany's anti-Jewish policies, and during World War II, he secretly kept in touch with anti-Nazi Solf Circle and Kreisau Circle in Germany.Ulrich Schlie: Diener vieler Herren. Die verschlungenen Pfade des Reichskanzlers Joseph Wirth im Exil: In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 29. November 1997. Wirth's grave in Freiburg Later life In 1949, Wirth returned home, after being prevented from doing so by the French occupation authorities for four years. He opposed Konrad Adenauer's policy of Western integration, for fear of making the division of Germany permanent. Together with Wilhelm Elfes, he founded the neutralist \\"Alliance of Germans\\" (BdD) in 1953, that was also supported by the SED, and the newspaper Deutsche Volkszeitung. Although Wirth did not approve of Stalin's policies, he believed in a compromise with the USSR in line with the Rapallo Treaty. In 1951, Wirth visited Moscow for political talks. In the CIA file \\"The background of Joseph Wirth\\", it is even claimed that Wirth was a Soviet agent. Unlike West Germany, East Germany paid Wirth a small amount of financial aid. In 1954, Wirth was awarded the East German \\"Peace Medal\\" (Friedensmedaille). He received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1955. According to a CIA document Wirth claimed that he met with Lavrentiy Beria and Erwin Respondek (who arranged the meeting) in Karlshorat, Berlin in December 1952. The document states Wirth said Beria asked him to work for the East German government.https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP80-00810A001700290003-9 He died of heart failure in 1956, aged 76, in his hometown of Freiburg and was buried in the city's main cemetery.

His tenure included the episode known as the Occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops and the period in which inflation in Germany accelerated notably, heading towards hyperinflation. Cuno was also general director of the Hapag shipping company. Early life Wilhelm Carl Josef Cuno was born on 2 July 1876 in Suhl, in what was then Prussian Saxony and is now in Thuringia. He was the son of August George Wilhelm Cuno (1848-1915) and his wife Catherina Elisabeth Theresia, née Daske (1852-1878). In 1906, Cuno, a Roman Catholic, married Martha Berta Wirtz (born 1879), daughter of Hamburg merchant Hugo Wirtz. They had three sons and two daughters. Cuno studied law in Berlin and Heidelberg and was awarded a Juris Doctor. He was a member of K.D.St.V. Arminia Heidelberg, a Catholic student fraternity that is a member of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. Early career He was employed by the Reichsschatzamt (Treasury) in 1907, initially as Regierungsassessor. Cuno was promoted in 1910 to Regierungsrat and in 1912 to Geheimer Regierungsrat. His tasks mainly involved preparing parliamentary bills and presenting them to the Reichstag. During World War I, Cuno was involved in organizing food supplies for the German army, first directing the Reichsgetreidestelle from its inception until July 1916. He then was attached to Secretary of State (i.e. Minister) Batocki to help organize the Kriegsernährungsamt (war food department). In late 1916, Cuno was put in charge of the Generalreferat (section) on economic issues relating to the war at the Treasury. At the request of Albert Ballin, Cuno quit the civil service to join the Hapag shipping company as a director in November 1917. After Ballin's death in November 1918, Cuno was promoted to Hapag's general director in December. As an economic expert, Cuno participated in the post-war negotiations on the armistice, on reparations and peace terms and in other international conferences, including the Genoa Conference, which he left in protest after the signature of the Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union. Cuno was also an important negotiator in talks between the German shipping firms and the government, regarding compensation for the merchant ships delivered to the Allies under the terms of the peace treaty (1920/21). In 1920, Cuno led Hapag into an alliance with United American Lines, helping to reestablish Hapag as a passenger line. He also unofficially represented the Reich's foreign policy interests during his travels abroad. Chancellor Cuno, left, with German President Friedrich Ebert (1923) Cuno rejected several proposals to assume the post of foreign minister (autumn 1922) or minister of finance (after Matthias Erzberger's resignation in 1920), but agreed to form a cabinet after the resignation of Joseph Wirth's second cabinet. Cuno was appointed Reichskanzler on 22 November 1922, by presidential decree and without a vote in the Reichstag. He was the first chancellor in the Weimar Republic who was not a member of a party. Politically, he was quite far from the president, Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert who selected him as chancellor. Cuno had a somewhat aloof position towards the republic and its parliamentary system. He held the Reichstag in fairly low esteem and felt the bickering between the parties to be distasteful. Cuno formed a government mostly composed of non-party economists and members of the German People's Party, German Democratic Party, German Center Party and Bavarian People's Party. The government was referred to, alternatively as a Geschäftsministerium, Regierung der Wirtschaft or Kabinett der Persönlichkeiten, emphasizing that it was not the result of an explicit coalition between the parliamentary parties. Hopes were high for this government of experts, led by a man with excellent connections abroad, to make headway in the difficult talks with the Allies. They were, however, disappointed. Cuno's plan to settle the reparations issue and to stabilize the Mark in the foreign exchange market was rejected by the Allies at the urging of French prime minister/foreign minister Poincaré. When Germany fell a bit behind on its shipments of wood and coal (made as reparations in lieu of lacking gold currency) the French declared this to be a deliberate breach of the agreements and on 11 January 1923 ordered troops to occupy the Ruhr (later joined by Belgians). This move, widely seen as illegal even outside Germany, caused the outraged Cuno government to call for passive resistance: Reparation shipments to France and Belgium were stopped, the mines were told not to make any more deliveries to these states, civil servants and Reichsbahn personnel were told to disobey orders by the occupation authorities. The Ruhr economy, the industrial heartland of Germany, came almost to a complete stop. Financial support payments by the Reich government to those inhabitants of the occupied zone affected by firm closures, deportations and arrests quickly added up to vast sums, mostly financed by printing money. This caused inflation to increase rapidly and the Mark to go into free fall. Attempts by the government to resume talks about reparations in May and June 1923 failed as Poincaré refused to negotiate unless passive resistance was ended first. A wave of strikes against the government began in August 1923. On 12 August 1923, Cuno and his cabinet resigned as a result of a vote of no-confidence initiated by the SPD. Later life Cuno retired from politics and returned to serve as a director at Hapag. In 1926, he once again became its director general. He was involved in negotiations about the release of German property impounded in the U.S. during the war and in working towards the merger with Norddeutsche Lloyd, which happened in 1930. During the 1925 election for Reichspräsident, Cuno was outspoken in his support for Paul von Hindenburg, rather than the candidate of the Centre Party, Wilhelm Marx. In 1932, Cuno joined Wilhelm Keppler to advise Adolf Hitler economically.Christof Brauers: Die FDP in Hamburg 1945 bis 1953. Start als bürgerliche Linkspartei. Martin Meidenbauer Verlagsbuchhandlung, München 2007, , p. 85. Cuno died on 3 January 1933 at Aumühle near Hamburg.

He was Chancellor of Germany twice, from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1926 to 1928, and he also served briefly as Minister President of Prussia in 1925, during the Weimar Republic. With a total of 3 years, 73 days, he was the longest-serving Chancellor during the Weimar Republic (if both of his terms are added together; Heinrich Brüning had the longest continuous tenure, with 2 years and 61 days, slightly longer than Marx's first term). Early life He was born in 1863 in Cologne to Johann Marx, the rector of a Catholic school (1822-1882) and his wife, Gertrude (1826-1909). He had a sister, Barbara, who later headed the Cologne Ursulines. Marx passed his Abitur at the Marzellengymnasium in 1881. He then studied jurisprudence at the University of Bonn from 1881 to 1884. As a student he became a member of Katholischer Studentenverein Arminia Bonn (a part of Kartellverband). Marx married Johanna Verkoyen (1871-1946) in 1891, and they had a total of four children (three sons and a daughter). Legal career In 1888, he passed the Zweite Staatsprüfung for the Prussian civil service and began working as an assessor in Cologne and Waldbröl and later in the land registry in Simmern. In 1894 he became a judge at Elberfeld. In 1904, Marx became Landgerichtsrat at Cologne, in 1907 Oberlandesgerichtsrat at Düsseldorf, in January 1921 Landgerichtspräsident in Limburg an der Lahn and on 27 September 1921 Senatspräsident of the Kammergericht Berlin without the requirement to serve the same day that he was elected president of the Reichstag fraction of the Centre Party. Under the German Empire, dominated by the Protestant Prussia, his religion and political activities were a handicap for his career as a lawyer. Early political career Marx started his political activities in Elberfeld, where he became active in the Centre Party. From 1899 to 1918, he was a member of the Abgeordnetenhaus, the lower chamber of the Landtag of Prussia. From 1899 to 1904, he was the head of the Elberfeld Centre Party. From 1906 to 1919, he was the deputy head of the party in the Rhineland. In 1907, he became the chairman of the Düsseldorf Centre Party and in 1910, he presided over the Augsburg Katholikentag. From 1910 to 1918, he was a member of the Reichstag. In 1911, he founded the Katholische Schulorganisation to fight against the secularisation of the German school system. Marx was elected to the Weimar National Assembly in 1919 and then to the reconstituted Reichstag in 1920, where he remained until 1932. He supported the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 1917 and opposed demands for territorial gains from World War I popular among Rhineland Centrists. Marx also opposed the German Revolution but supported the new Weimar Republic. The Weimar constitution granted Catholics full civil rights, unlike the previous constitution. Marx opposed separatism in the Rhineland and argued against the creation of the Rhenish Republic in December 1918. In the summer of 1919, Marx was one of the few Centre Party members supporting German signature of the Treaty of Versailles, as he feared that failure to do so would result in French annexation of the occupied Rhineland. After , and Matthias Erzberger died, Marx became the head of the Reichstag fraction of the Centre Party on 27 September 1921 and, on 17 January 1922, party chairman. He supported Chancellor Joseph Wirth in his Erfüllungspolitik which attempted to comply with the Treaty of Versailles, notably the reparation demands of the Allies, as far as possible. Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno received Marx's help in mobilising civil disobedience against the Occupation of the Ruhr. However, Marx then helped to replace Cuno's cabinet with the Grand Coalition headed by Gustav Stresemann. When Stresemann's government fell in November 1923, Marx himself stepped up. Chancellor On 30 November 1923, Marx formed a minority cabinet based on the Centre Party, DVP, BVP and DDP. Then, the financial and economic situation of the Reich was dire, and the central government's authority was challenged by right- and left-wing state governments as well as by separatism in the Rhineland. The cabinet's achievements included stabilizing the currency following the introduction of the Rentenmark, fiscal consolidation, the resolution of the conflict between the Reich and Bavaria's right-wing government and de-escalation in the occupied territories. In January 1924, the Emminger Reform replaced the system of trial by jury in Germany with a mixed system of career and lay judges. Following the May election, the second Marx cabinet was formed on 3 June 1924. It was once again a minority government, based on parties that did not have an outright Reichstag majority; it lasted until December 1924. Its focus was on relations with the Allies and on regaining control of the occupied territories in the west. In August, the government signed up to the Dawes Plan on reparation payments. After the December Reichstag elections, Marx was unable to form a cabinet and resigned on 15 December 1924. He remained in office as caretaker until 15 January 1925. In social policy, Marx's first period as Chancellor saw the introduction (in 1924) of family allowances for state employees.Foundations of the Welfare State, 2nd Edition by Pat Thane, published 1996 Presidential candidate In February 1925, Marx became Minister President of Prussia, following a call by the Centre Party in the Landtag. On 18 March, his party nominated him for the presidential election following the death of President Friedrich Ebert. In the first round of voting, Marx was the Centre Party's and, in the second round, the entire Weimar Coalition's candidate. Marx received close to 4 million votes in the first round. However, in the runoff he was defeated by Paul von Hindenburg, as Ernst Thälmann the Communist candidate also stood and split the vote. In addition, the BVP had called on its supporters to vote for Hindenburg. Marx lost by 13.7 million to Hindenburg's 14.6 million votes. In April, Otto Braun replaced Marx as Minister President. Marx resigned after he had been unable to form a working cabinet. Again chancellor Centre party leader Marx at the Reichstag, June 1928. Marx considered leaving politics but on 26 January 1926 he accepted an appointment as Reichsminister der Justiz (Minister of Justice) and Minister for the Occupied Territories, in the second cabinet of Hans Luther. After Luther's government fell, Stresemann suggested Marx as chancellor and Hindenburg appointed him on 17 May 1926. Marx kept in place Luther's decree on the flag (), which had resulted in the previous cabinet's demise. Marx's cabinet unexpectedly survived the referendum on the expropriation of the princes and succeeded in bringing Germany into the League of Nations. Marx also managed to force military commander-in-chief Hans von Seeckt into retirement without provoking resistance by the Reichswehr. He resigned as chancellor on 17 December 1926 over a lost Reichstag vote on the issue of clandestine military relations between the Reichswehr and the Soviet Union. The Social Democrats, who had brought down the cabinet, thereby ruled themselves out of a role in the next one. In January 1927, Marx formed a new government with participation by the right-wing DNVP. This fourth and final Marx cabinet extended the ' (including the ban on the former emperor to enter the country), and passed a law on working hours (14 April 1927) as well as the Gesetz über Arbeitsvermittlung und Arbeitslosenversicherung of 16 July 1927 which established a comprehensive unemployment insurance system. The same year, the government sought to standardize locally administered poor relief payments by fixing them in line with the prices of essential goods. The same year, Germany became the first major industrial nation to sign the Washington Agreement for extended maternity leave. Although the coalition broke up over the issue of the Reichsschulgesetz (school law) and the blame was put on the DVP, it was mostly internal opposition within the Centre Party, notably by Joseph Wirth, Adam Stegerwald, and Theodor von Guérard that resulted in the cabinet's fall. Marx resigned on 12 June. After putting into action an emergency program, Marx was finally dismissed as chancellor by Hindenburg on 29 June 1928. In total, his four terms in office made him the longest-serving Reichskanzler of the Weimar Republic. Later life After the Centre Party's poor performance at the polls in May, Marx eventually also resigned, as party chairman, on 8 December 1928. He then focused on work for numerous associations and civil organisations. In 1932, he resigned his seat in the Reichstag and retired. During Nazi Germany, Marx was charged in the so-called Volksvereinsprozeß (named after the People's Association for Catholic Germany which he had chaired) in 1933, but the charge against him was dropped in 1935. After the end of World War II, he continued to live in Bonn, where he died in 1946. Marx is buried at the Melaten-Friedhof of Cologne.

As Minister of Finance he helped stabilize the Mark during the hyperinflation of 1923. From 1930 to 1933, Luther was head of the Reichsbank and from 1933 to 1937 he served as German Ambassador to the United States. Early life Hans Luther was born in Berlin on 10 March 1879 into a Lutheran family as the son of Otto (1848-1912), a well-off merchant, and Wilhelmine Luther (née Hübner). After attaining the Abitur at the Leibniz-Gymnasium/Berlin, Luther studied law at Geneva, Kiel and Berlin from 1897-1901. His teachers included Otto von Gierke, Franz von Liszt, Heinrich Brunner, Gustav von Schmoller and Hugo Preuss. In 1904, Luther was awarded a Dr.jur. for his dissertation Die Zuständigkeit des Bundesrats zur Entscheidung von Thronstreitigkeiten innerhalb des Deutschen Reiches. He passed the Assessor exam in 1906 and worked in the Prussian administration, in 1906/07 at the city council of Charlottenburg, now a part of Berlin. Luther was married twice. From 1907-1924 to Gertrud (née Schmidt, 1880-1924) and from 1953 to Gertrud Sioli (née Mautz). He had three daughters from his first marriage. Political career=German Empire and local politics In 1907, Luther was elected to the Magdeburg city council where he increased the area assigned to Schreber garden tenfold and litigated against the regional potash industry for polluting the drinking water. From February 1913 to the summer of 1918, Luther was a member of the board of the Preußischer Städtetag (later Deutscher Städtetag). In the summer of 1918, he became Oberbürgermeister (mayor) of Essen. During the Revolution he managed to convince the revolutionary workers' and soldiers' councils to cooperate with the city administration and to accept the mayor's leading role. Ex-officio, as mayor of Essen, he was a member of the Vorläufiger Reichswirtschaftsrat from 1920. Weimar Republic and Reich politics During the creation of the cabinet of Wilhelm Cuno in November 1922, Luther was offered the Reichswirtschaftsministerium (Economic Affairs) and the Reichsinnenministerium (Interior) but he refused both. However, on 1 December 1922 he took over the Reichsministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (food and agriculture). His predecessor, had been forced to resign after only three days in office due to allegations about connections to Rhenish separatists. Luther remained in this office in the cabinet of Gustav Stresemann, focussing on ensuring food supplies for those groups of the population hardest hit by inflation. When Streseman reshuffled his cabinet on 6 October 1923, Luther took over the Ministry of Finance and kept that portfolio in the two cabinets led by Wilhelm Marx which followed. Luther thus was in charge of the currency reform which ended the hyperinflation and introduced a new stable Mark. By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther's predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (Ermächtigungsgesetz) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The restrictive monetary policy by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three emergency tax hikes, brought forward due dates for taxes, increased prepayments of assessed taxes, raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial burden sharing between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs - by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913. Having successfully stabilized the currency, Luther then was a member of the German delegation at the in July and August 1924, where he was in charge of trade policy and financial policy issues. On 30 August 1924, the Rentenmark was replaced as legal tender by the Reichsmark, a new gold-backed currency. Chancellor After the Reichstag elections of December 1924 the parties supporting the minority Marx cabinet were unable to agree on whether the coalition should be extended to include those on the left (SPD) or those on the right (DNVP), president Friedrich Ebert on 9 January 1925 asked the independent Luther to form a government. On 16 January, Luther presented his cabinet that combined features of a party-based government with one made up of experts/technocrats. Each of the coalition parties (Zentrum, BVP, DVP, DNVP) had one representative in the cabinet, the other positions were filled with civil servants who were either members of one of the parties or were politically close to it. Although the DDP was not a member of the coalition, Luther was able to keep Otto Gessler at the Reichswehrministerium. When Ebert died on 28 February, Luther temporarily assumed the role of acting head of state pending the election of a successor. The following presidential election put some strains on the coalition supporting the cabinet. Luther tried to convince Walter Simons, president of the Reichsgericht, to ask the two candidates for the second round of voting to step aside and accept Simons as a compromise of the center. However, Simons refused and Paul von Hindenburg was elected. During his relatively short period in office, Luther and his cabinet managed to accomplish the passage of several important laws and international treaties. In foreign trade, the one-sided most-favoured-nation clause that had governed trade between the Allies and Germany lapsed on 10 January 1925, thus reestablishing Germany's sovereignty in trade policy. The tariff law came into force on 12 August 1925, setting up tariffs for industry and agriculture that were based on the tariff rates of the pre-war years. Trade treaties were negotiated with the UK, the Soviet Union, France, Spain and Italy. In domestic tax policy, a tax reform brought relief as taxes on income, capital and land transfer as well as bill stamp duty and sales tax were all lowered. In foreign policy, the cabinet negotiated the Treaty of Locarno with the UK, Belgium, France and Italy (October 1925), which paved the way for Germany's membership in the League of Nations (September 1926). The ministers of the DNVP left the cabinet in protest over Locarno, forcing Luther to set up a new government that took office in January 1926. This government negotiated the Freundschafts- und Neutralitätsvertrag with the Soviet Union. In social policy, a number of reforms to social insurance were carried out during Luther's time as Chancellor. A decree promulgated by the Reich Minister of Labour in May 1925 extended accident insurance coverage to include eleven occupational diseases, a law of July 1925 extended workmen's compensation coverage to all accidents from and to places of work, and vocational care was introduced that same month. In addition, a decree of May 1925 established compensation for occupational diseases.Farm labor in Germany, 1810-1945; its historical development within the framework of agricultural and social policy by Frieda Wunderlich Luther voluntarily decided to resign after a Reichstag majority censured him on 12 May 1926 after he had asked Hindenburg to issue the presidential Flaggen-Verordnung (5 May 1926), which ordered German embassies and consulates to display not just the official black-red-gold Reichsflagge but also the black-white-red Handelsflagge (trade flag). His successor was Wilhelm Marx. Further career Luther was elected to the supervisory board of the Reichsbahn in the summer of 1926. At the end of 1928 he left, to make room for a representative of the Free State of Prussia. In March 1929, he became a member of the board of directors of the Gemeinschaftsgruppe deutscher Hypothekenbanken (association of German mortgage banks). He also joined the DVP. In 1928/29, Luther was also active in the ' and became its founding president in January 1928. The institution worked on a reform of the federal structure of the Reich, notably the problem of the dominant position of Prussia compared to the other Länder. On 11 March 1930, Luther was appointed as Hjalmar Schacht's successor as president of the Reichsbank. To ensure his independence, he gave up all other offices and also left the DVP. Luther supported Heinrich Brüning's deflation policy out of loyalty and conviction. During the crisis in German banking in June/July 1931, he stretched the envelope—both legally and in terms of the Reichsbank's financial means—to help the banks repay the short-term loans called in by foreign creditors. Criticism by the banks including the demand for his resignation were without foundation and served mainly to hide the banks' responsibility for their own situation. On the evening of April 9, 1932 Hans Luther was shot at on the platform of the Potsdam station. He was injured at the shoulder. The assailants had written a letter before in which they criticized Luther's monetary policy.Knut Borchardt: Das Attentat auf Luther 1932. In: Karl Dietrich Bracher et al. (editors): Staat und Parteien. Festschrift zum 65. Geburtstag von Rudolf Morsey. Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 1992, S. 689–709 After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Luther followed a demand by Hitler and resigned his post on 16 March 1933. He was, however, offered the post of German ambassador to Washington which he accepted. In 1933, Luther lectured at the Columbia University campus.

In 1937, he retired from active public service (im einstweiligen Ruhestand) and in 1942 retired fully. Post-World War II, Luther was trustee of Merck Finck & Co., a private bank in Munich, in 1948/49. He also served as a member of the supervisory board of the Bayerischen Hypotheken und Wechselbank. In 1952, the Munich Hochschule für politische Wissenschaften awarded him an honorary professorship. In 1952-1955, Luther was the chairman of the committee of experts on the territorial restructuring of the Federal Republic of Germany (Sachverständigen-Ausschuß für die Neugliederung des Bundesgebiets). In 1958, he became president of the reestablished Verein für das Deutschtum im Ausland. He died in Düsseldorf on 11 May 1962.

The brigade was composed of the 6th, 10th and 27th Canadian Armoured regiments and saw service in northwest Europe, landing in Normandy on D-Day and remaining in combat up to Victory in Europe Day. The formation sign used to identify the tanks and other vehicles of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade.  History  Soon after the 3rd Canadian Tank Brigade assumed the designation in summer 1943 of the original 2nd Canadian Tank Brigade, the new 2nd Tank was redesignated and reorganized as 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Although reorganized as an armoured brigade, no motor battalion served under its command. The brigade was assigned to the British 2nd Army in January 1944 to train for the upcoming amphibious assault in Normandy. This formation rarely fought as an entity. Its primary role was infantry support and thus its regiments were usually individually tasked out to infantry units to participate in particular operations. One of the occasions when the Brigade did undertake an operation on its own, the Battle of Le Mesnil-Patry on 11 June 1944, ended with only a partial success and severe losses to the Canadians. Following the landing in Normandy, the brigade fought at Caen, advanced across France and Belgium, and took part in operations in the Netherlands and Germany while supporting operations of the Canadian 1st Army and the British 2nd Army.

Equipped with Ram II tanks, in the autumn of 1942 the brigade trained at the newly opened Meaford AFV range on Georgian Bay where the Halifax Rifles had the honour of conducting the first field exercise.  European deployments = United Kingdom  In June 1943 the brigade was dispatched to the United Kingdom. The following month came an intensive inspection of the units of this brigade and of the 3rd Canadian Army Tank Brigade by Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, the commander of I Canadian Corps. The purpose of the inspection was to determine which of the two brigades would remain on the order of battle since there was only room for one such formation.https://servicepub.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/the-evolution-of-the- reconstituted-2nd-canadian-armoured-brigade-independent-1943/ The brigade chosen was the 3rd: The 1st Hussars, The Fort Garry Horse, and The Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment. The 3rd Canadian Army Tank Brigade was raised on 1 January 1943 following a reorganization of the Canadian Armoured Corps in Britain. It adopted the designation 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade (2 CAB) after it was selected by Lieutenant-General Crerar to remain on the order of battle. In August 1943 it was selected to be part of the D-Day invasion force in support of the units of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.  D-Day  The brigade's three regiments landed in Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Unlike their peers in the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade, who were usually paired with their division's 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade, the 2nd was paired with any infantry who were in need of armour support. On 31 July 1945, following a series of battles with heavy infantry losses, Canadian General Guy Simonds ordered the creation of an armoured carrier regiment and the modification of underused American-made M7 Priest self-propelled guns. The 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier squadron was formed, and administered as a squadron of 25th Armoured Delivery Regiment until October 19, 1944, when the squadron was converted to a regiment.http://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context;=cmh This formation rarely fought as an entity.

One of the occasions when the Brigade did undertake an operation on its own, Le Mesnil-Patry / Rots on 11 June 1944, ended with only a partial success and severe losses to the Canadians. 2 CAB fought in the North West Europe Campaign, longer than any other armoured formation, from D-Day to V-E Day, suffering 435 fatal casualties in total. Two of the brigade's tanks, Holy Roller of the 1st Hussars, and Bomb of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, fought continuously from D-Day to the end of the war, the only Canadian tanks to fight unscathed across Northwest Europe. Holy Roller remains the memorial of the Hussars in London, Ontario, and Bomb is preserved today at the Armoury of the Sherbrooke Hussars in Sherbrooke, Quebec.Sandy MacDonald , “Lieuts Walter White, Ernest Mingo and Bomb”, Sunday Daily News, November 11, 2001 See also * Royal Canadian Armoured Corps  References  Bibliography  * Marteinson, J.K. and McNorgan, Michael.

Intuitively, singular homology counts, for each dimension n, the n-dimensional holes of a space. Singular homology is a particular example of a homology theory, which has now grown to be a rather broad collection of theories. Of the various theories, it is perhaps one of the simpler ones to understand, being built on fairly concrete constructions. In brief, singular homology is constructed by taking maps of the standard n-simplex to a topological space, and composing them into formal sums, called singular chains. The boundary operation - mapping each n-dimensional simplex to its (n−1)-dimensional boundary - induces the singular chain complex. The singular homology is then the homology of the chain complex. The resulting homology groups are the same for all homotopy equivalent spaces, which is the reason for their study. These constructions can be applied to all topological spaces, and so singular homology can be expressed in terms of category theory, where homology is expressible as a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of graded abelian groups.  Singular simplices  The standard 2-simplex Δ2 in R3 A singular n-simplex in a topological space X is a continuous function (also called a map) \\\\sigma from the standard n-simplex \\\\Delta^n to X, written \\\\sigma:\\\\Delta^n\\\\to X. This map need not be injective, and there can be non-equivalent singular simplices with the same image in X. The boundary of \\\\sigma, denoted as \\\\partial_n\\\\sigma, is defined to be the formal sum of the singular (n − 1)-simplices represented by the restriction of \\\\sigma to the faces of the standard n-simplex, with an alternating sign to take orientation into account. (A formal sum is an element of the free abelian group on the simplices. The basis for the group is the infinite set of all possible singular simplices. The group operation is \\"addition\\" and the sum of simplex a with simplex b is usually simply designated a + b, but a + a = 2a and so on. Every simplex a has a negative −a.) Thus, if we designate \\\\sigma by its vertices :[p_0,p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n]=[\\\\sigma(e_0),\\\\sigma(e_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma(e_n)] corresponding to the vertices e_k of the standard n-simplex \\\\Delta^n (which of course does not fully specify the singular simplex produced by \\\\sigma), then :\\\\partial_n\\\\sigma=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k \\\\sigma \\\\mid _{[p_0,\\\\ldots,p_{k-1},p_{k+1},\\\\ldots ,p_n]} is a formal sum of the faces of the simplex image designated in a specific way. (That is, a particular face has to be the restriction of \\\\sigma to a face of \\\\Delta^n which depends on the order that its vertices are listed.) Thus, for example, the boundary of \\\\sigma=[p_0,p_1] (a curve going from p_0 to p_1) is the formal sum (or \\"formal difference\\") [p_1] - [p_0].  Singular chain complex  The usual construction of singular homology proceeds by defining formal sums of simplices, which may be understood to be elements of a free abelian group, and then showing that we can define a certain group, the homology group of the topological space, involving the boundary operator. Consider first the set of all possible singular n-simplices \\\\sigma_n(X) on a topological space X. This set may be used as the basis of a free abelian group, so that each singular n-simplex is a generator of the group. This set of generators is of course usually infinite, frequently uncountable, as there are many ways of mapping a simplex into a typical topological space. The free abelian group generated by this basis is commonly denoted as C_n(X). Elements of C_n(X) are called singular n-chains; they are formal sums of singular simplices with integer coefficients. The boundary \\\\partial is readily extended to act on singular n-chains. The extension, called the boundary operator, written as :\\\\partial_n:C_n\\\\to C_{n-1}, is a homomorphism of groups. The boundary operator, together with the C_n, form a chain complex of abelian groups, called the singular complex. It is often denoted as (C_\\\\bullet(X),\\\\partial_\\\\bullet) or more simply C_\\\\bullet(X). The kernel of the boundary operator is Z_n(X)=\\\\ker (\\\\partial_{n}), and is called the group of singular n-cycles. The image of the boundary operator is B_n(X)=\\\\operatorname{im} (\\\\partial_{n+1}), and is called the group of singular n-boundaries. It can also be shown that \\\\partial_n\\\\circ \\\\partial_{n+1}=0. The n-th homology group of X is then defined as the factor group :H_{n}(X) = Z_n(X) / B_n(X). The elements of H_n(X) are called homology classes.  Homotopy invariance  If X and Y are two topological spaces with the same homotopy type (i.e. are homotopy equivalent), then :H_n(X) \\\\cong H_n(Y)\\\\, for all n ≥ 0\\\\. This means homology groups are topological invariants. In particular, if X is a connected contractible space, then all its homology groups are 0, except H_0(X) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}. A proof for the homotopy invariance of singular homology groups can be sketched as follows. A continuous map f: X -> Y induces a homomorphism :f_{\\\\sharp} : C_n(X) \\\\rightarrow C_n(Y). It can be verified immediately that :\\\\partial f_{\\\\sharp} = f_{\\\\sharp} \\\\partial, i.e. f# is a chain map, which descends to homomorphisms on homology :f_* : H_n(X) \\\\rightarrow H_n(Y). We now show that if f and g are homotopically equivalent, then f* = g*. From this follows that if f is a homotopy equivalence, then f* is an isomorphism. Let F : X × [0, 1] -> Y be a homotopy that takes f to g. On the level of chains, define a homomorphism :P : C_n(X) \\\\rightarrow C_{n+1}(Y) that, geometrically speaking, takes a basis element σ: Δn -> X of Cn(X) to the \\"prism\\" P(σ): Δn × I -> Y. The boundary of P(σ) can be expressed as :\\\\partial P(\\\\sigma) = f_{\\\\sharp}(\\\\sigma) - g_{\\\\sharp}(\\\\sigma) - P(\\\\partial \\\\sigma). So if α in Cn(X) is an n-cycle, then f#(α ) and g#(α) differ by a boundary: : f_{\\\\sharp} (\\\\alpha) - g_{\\\\sharp}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\partial P(\\\\alpha), i.e. they are homologous. This proves the claim. Functoriality The construction above can be defined for any topological space, and is preserved by the action of continuous maps. This generality implies that singular homology theory can be recast in the language of category theory. In particular, the homology group can be understood to be a functor from the category of topological spaces Top to the category of abelian groups Ab. Consider first that X\\\\mapsto C_n(X) is a map from topological spaces to free abelian groups. This suggests that C_n(X) might be taken to be a functor, provided one can understand its action on the morphisms of Top. Now, the morphisms of Top are continuous functions, so if f:X\\\\to Y is a continuous map of topological spaces, it can be extended to a homomorphism of groups :f_*:C_n(X)\\\\to C_n(Y)\\\\, by defining :f_*\\\\left(\\\\sum_i a_i\\\\sigma_i\\\\right)=\\\\sum_i a_i (f\\\\circ \\\\sigma_i) where \\\\sigma_i:\\\\Delta^n\\\\to X is a singular simplex, and \\\\sum_i a_i\\\\sigma_i\\\\, is a singular n-chain, that is, an element of C_n(X). This shows that C_n is a functor :C_n:\\\\mathbf{Top} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Ab} from the category of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups. The boundary operator commutes with continuous maps, so that \\\\partial_n f_*=f_*\\\\partial_n. This allows the entire chain complex to be treated as a functor. In particular, this shows that the map X\\\\mapsto H_n (X) is a functor :H_n:\\\\mathbf{Top}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Ab} from the category of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups. By the homotopy axiom, one has that H_n is also a functor, called the homology functor, acting on hTop, the quotient homotopy category: :H_n:\\\\mathbf{hTop}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Ab}. This distinguishes singular homology from other homology theories, wherein H_n is still a functor, but is not necessarily defined on all of Top. In some sense, singular homology is the \\"largest\\" homology theory, in that every homology theory on a subcategory of Top agrees with singular homology on that subcategory. On the other hand, the singular homology does not have the cleanest categorical properties; such a cleanup motivates the development of other homology theories such as cellular homology. More generally, the homology functor is defined axiomatically, as a functor on an abelian category, or, alternately, as a functor on chain complexes, satisfying axioms that require a boundary morphism that turns short exact sequences into long exact sequences. In the case of singular homology, the homology functor may be factored into two pieces, a topological piece and an algebraic piece. The topological piece is given by :C_\\\\bullet:\\\\mathbf{Top}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Comp} which maps topological spaces as X\\\\mapsto (C_\\\\bullet(X),\\\\partial_\\\\bullet) and continuous functions as f\\\\mapsto f_*. Here, then, C_\\\\bullet is understood to be the singular chain functor, which maps topological spaces to the category of chain complexes Comp (or Kom). The category of chain complexes has chain complexes as its objects, and chain maps as its morphisms. The second, algebraic part is the homology functor :H_n:\\\\mathbf{Comp}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Ab} which maps :C_\\\\bullet\\\\mapsto H_n(C_\\\\bullet)=Z_n(C_\\\\bullet)/B_n(C_\\\\bullet) and takes chain maps to maps of abelian groups. It is this homology functor that may be defined axiomatically, so that it stands on its own as a functor on the category of chain complexes. Homotopy maps re-enter the picture by defining homotopically equivalent chain maps. Thus, one may define the quotient category hComp or K, the homotopy category of chain complexes.  Coefficients in R  Given any unital ring R, the set of singular n-simplices on a topological space can be taken to be the generators of a free R-module. That is, rather than performing the above constructions from the starting point of free abelian groups, one instead uses free R-modules in their place. All of the constructions go through with little or no change. The result of this is :H_n(X, R)\\\\ which is now an R-module. Of course, it is usually not a free module. The usual homology group is regained by noting that :H_n(X,\\\\mathbb{Z})=H_n(X) when one takes the ring to be the ring of integers. The notation Hn(X, R) should not be confused with the nearly identical notation Hn(X, A), which denotes the relative homology (below). Relative homology For a subspace A\\\\subset X, the relative homology Hn(X, A) is understood to be the homology of the quotient of the chain complexes, that is, :H_n(X,A)=H_n(C_\\\\bullet(X)/C_\\\\bullet(A)) where the quotient of chain complexes is given by the short exact sequence :0\\\\to C_\\\\bullet(A) \\\\to C_\\\\bullet(X) \\\\to C_\\\\bullet(X)/C_\\\\bullet(A) \\\\to 0.  Cohomology  By dualizing the homology chain complex (i.e. applying the functor Hom(-, R), R being any ring) we obtain a cochain complex with coboundary map \\\\delta. The cohomology groups of X are defined as the homology groups of this complex; in a quip, \\"cohomology is the homology of the co [the dual complex]\\". The cohomology groups have a richer, or at least more familiar, algebraic structure than the homology groups. Firstly, they form a differential graded algebra as follows: * the graded set of groups form a graded R-module; * this can be given the structure of a graded R-algebra using the cup product; * the Bockstein homomorphism β gives a differential. There are additional cohomology operations, and the cohomology algebra has addition structure mod p (as before, the mod p cohomology is the cohomology of the mod p cochain complex, not the mod p reduction of the cohomology), notably the Steenrod algebra structure. Betti homology and cohomology Since the number of homology theories has become large (see :Category:Homology theory), the terms Betti homology and Betti cohomology are sometimes applied (particularly by authors writing on algebraic geometry) to the singular theory, as giving rise to the Betti numbers of the most familiar spaces such as simplicial complexes and closed manifolds. Extraordinary homology If one defines a homology theory axiomatically (via the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms), and then relaxes one of the axioms (the dimension axiom), one obtains a generalized theory, called an extraordinary homology theory. These originally arose in the form of extraordinary cohomology theories, namely K-theory and cobordism theory. In this context, singular homology is referred to as ordinary homology.

He also was the first person to design an automatic loom and built the first all-metal lathe. Early life De Vaucanson was born in Grenoble, France in 1709 as Jacques Vaucanson (the nobiliary particle \\"de\\" was later added to his name by the Académie des SciencesAccount by Christiane Lagarrigue ). The tenth child of a glove-maker, he grew up poor, and in his youth he reportedly aspired to become a clockmaker. He studied under the Jesuits and later joined the Order of the Minims in Lyon. It was his intention at the time to follow a course of religious studies, but he regained his interest in mechanical devices after meeting the surgeon Claude-Nicolas Le Cat, from whom he would learn the details of anatomy. This new knowledge allowed him to develop his first mechanical devices that mimicked biological vital functions such as circulation, respiration, and digestion.  Automaton inventor  All three of Vaucanson's Automata. The Flute Player, The Tambourine Player, and Digesting Duck At just 18 years of age, Vaucanson was given his own workshop in Lyon, and a grant from a nobleman to construct a set of machines. In that same year of 1727, there was a visit from one of the governing heads of Les Minimes. Vaucanson decided to make some androids. The automata would serve dinner and clear the tables for the visiting politicians. However one government official declared that he thought Vaucanson's tendencies \\"profane\\", and ordered that his workshop be destroyed.Wood, Gabby. \\"Living Dolls: A Magical History Of The Quest For Mechanical Life\\", The Guardian, 2002-02-16. In 1737, Vaucanson built The Flute Player, a life-size figure of a shepherd that played the tabor and the pipe and had a repertoire of twelve songs. The figure's fingers were not pliable enough to play the flute correctly, so Vaucanson had to glove the creation in skin. The following year, in early 1738, he presented his creation to the Académie des Sciences. Johann Joachim Quantz, court musician and long- time flute instructor to Frederick II of Prussia, discussed the shortcomings of Vaucanson's mechanical flute player. In particular its inability to sufficiently move the lips resulted in the necessity of increasing the wind pressure for the upper octaves. Quantz discouraged this method as producing a shrill, unpleasant tone. Available at: Deutsches Text Archiv At the time, mechanical creatures were somewhat a fad in Europe, but most could be classified as toys, and de Vaucanson's creations were recognized as being revolutionary in their mechanical lifelike sophistication. Later that year, he created two additional automata, The Tambourine Player and The Digesting Duck, which is considered his masterpiece. The duck had over 400 moving parts in each wing alone, and could flap its wings, drink water, seemingly digest grain, and seemingly defecate. Although Vaucanson's duck supposedly demonstrated digestion accurately, his duck actually contained a hidden compartment of \\"digested food\\", so that what the duck defecated was not the same as what it ate; the duck would eat a mixture of water and seed and excrete a mixture of bread crumbs and green dye that appeared to the onlooker indistinguishable from real excrement. Although such frauds were sometimes controversial, they were common enough because such scientific demonstrations needed to entertain the wealthy and powerful to attract their patronage. Vaucanson is credited as having invented the world's first flexible rubber tube while in the process of building the duck's intestines. Despite the revolutionary nature of his automata, he is said to have tired quickly of his creations and sold them in 1743. His inventions brought him to the attention of Frederick II of Prussia, who sought to bring him to his court. Vaucanson refused, however, wishing to serve his own country.  Government service  In 1741 de Vaucanson was appointed by Cardinal Fleury, chief minister of Louis XV, as inspector of the manufacture of silk in France. He was charged with undertaking reforms of the silk manufacturing process. At the time, the French weaving industry had fallen behind that of England and Scotland. During this time, Vaucanson promoted wide-ranging changes for automation of the weaving process. In 1745, he created the world's first completely automated loom,Chronology of Lyon drawing on the work of Basile Bouchon and Jean Falcon. Vaucanson was trying to automate the French textile industry with punch cards - a technology that, as refined by Joseph-Marie Jacquard more than a half- century later, would revolutionize weaving and, in the twentieth century, would be used to input data into computers and store information in binary form. His proposals were not well received by weavers, however, who pelted him with stones in the street and many of his revolutionary ideas were largely ignored. In 1760 he invented the first industrial metal cutting slide rest lathe. The lathe was described in the Encyclopédie and is exhibited at Musée des Arts et Métiers in France. It was designed to produce precision cylindrical rollers for crushing patterns into silk cloth. https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/metal-turning- lathe/kwGbpYqKSyzcSghttps://www.arts-et-metiers.net/musee/tour-charioter-de- vaucanson These were of copper rather than steel, so far easier to turn on a lathe, which may account for Vaucanson's omission from such works as Derry & Williams, who place this invention around 1768. In 1746, he was made a member of the Académie des Sciences.Biography at Vaucanson.org (fr) Legacy Jacques de Vaucanson died in Paris in 1782. Vaucanson left a collection of his work as a bequest to Louis XVI. The collection would become the foundation of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. His original automata have all been lost. The flute player and the tambourine player were reportedly destroyed in the Revolution. Some had been sold to a glovemaker called Pierre Dumoulin (d. 1781), who exhibited them throughout Europe with great success. Dumoulin’s shows with Vaucanson’s automata in Saint Petersburg started the fashion of automata in Russia. In 1783, it was reported that the automata once exhibited by Dumoulin were still stored in Russia, but Dumoulin had manipulated them so that they would not work after his death. Vaucanson’s proposals for the automation of the weaving process, although ignored during his lifetime, were later perfected and implemented by Joseph Marie Jacquard, the creator of the Jacquard loom.

She was launched on 1 August 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Wiley, wife of United States Senator Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin, and commissioned on 30 November 1943 with Lieutenant Commander James M. Clement in command. Golet was initially ordered with the Balao-class. However, Manitowoc did not receive the drawings for this class from Electric Boat in time to build SS-361 through SS-364 to the new design, so they were built as Gato class. Thus, in some references, these boats are listed with the Balao class.Friedman 1995, p. 209 Golet departed Manitowoc 19 December 1943 via the Mississippi River for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving 28 December. After shakedown training at Panama and final battle practice in Hawaiian waters, she departed Pearl Harbor on 18 March 1944 for her maiden war patrol off the Kurile Islands chain, Southern Hokkaidō and Eastern Honshū, Japan. Severe combinations of fog, rain, and ice were encountered and only one ship worth a torpedo came into view. This enemy proved too fast for Golet to close to torpedo range; she returned to Midway Island on 3 May 1944. Lieutenant Commander James S. Clark took command of Golet, departed Midway Island on 28 May 1944 to patrol off northern Honshū, Japan, and was never heard from again. Golet had been scheduled to depart her area on 5 July and was expected at Midway Island about 12 July or 13 July. She failed to acknowledge a message sent her on 9 July and was presumed lost 26 July 1944. Japanese antisubmarine records available after the war revealed that Golet was the probable victim of a Japanese antisubmarine attack made 14 June 1944.

Qualities Jim Samson points out that it fits in well with Scriabin's mainly dominant quality sonorities and harmony as it may take on a dominant quality on C or F. This tritone relationship between possible resolutions is important to Scriabin's harmonic language, and it is a property shared by the French sixth (also prominent in his work) of which the synthetic chord can be seen as an extension. The example below shows the mystic chord rewritten as a French sixth with notes A and D as extensions: : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 1 1 } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 4/4 1 1 } >> } } The pitch collection is related to the octatonic scale, the whole tone scale, and the French sixth, all of which are capable of a different number of transpositions.\\"Orthography in Scriabin's Late Works\\", p.60. Cheong Wai-Ling. Music Analysis, Vol. 12, No. 1. (Mar., 1993), pp. 47–69. For example, the chord is a whole tone scale with one note raised a semitone (the \\"almost whole-tone\\" hexachord, sometimes identified as \\"whole tone-plus\\"), and this alteration allows for a greater variety of resources through transposition.\\"The Evolution of Twelve-Note Music\\", p.56. Oliver Neighbour. Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, 81st Sess. (1954–1955), pp. 49–61. Leonid Sabaneev interpreted the Prometheus chord as harmonics 8 through 14, without 12 (1, 9, 5, 11, 13, 7 = C, D, E, F, A, B), but the 11th harmonic is 48.68 cents away from the tritone (F), the 13th harmonic is 59.47 cents away from a major sixth (A). : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 1 } } However, to quote Carl Dahlhaus, \\"the interval-distance of the natural-tone-row [overtones] [...], counting up to 20, includes everything from the octave to the quarter tone, (and) useful and useless musical tones. The natural-tone-row [harmonic series] justifies everything, that means, nothing.\\"Sabbagh, Peter (2003). The Development of Harmony in Scriabin's Works, p.12. Universal. . Cites: Dahlhaus, Carl (1972). \\"Struktur und Expression bei Alexander Skrjabin\\", Mu sik des Ostens, Vol.6, p.229. Elliott Antokoletz says the, \\"so-called 'mystic chord',\\" approximates harmonics 7 through 13 (7, 8, 9, 10, (11,) 12, 13 = C, D, E, F, (G,) A, B).Antokoletz, Elliott (1992). Twentieth-Century Music, p.101. Prentice Hall. . The notes of the chord also conform to a Lydian dominant quality, the fourth mode of the melodic minor scale. Use by Scriabin Some sources suggest that much of Scriabin's music is entirely based on the chord to the extent that whole passages are little more than long sequences of this chord, unaltered, at different pitches; but this is rarely the case. More often than not, the notes are reordered so as to supply a variety of harmonic or melodic material. Certain of Scriabin's late pieces are based on other synthetic chords or scales that do not rely on the mystic chord. Other sources suggest that Scriabin's method of pitch organization is based on ordered scales that feature scale degrees. Since the mystic chord is a synthetic chord, the scale from which it derives, sometimes called the \\"Prometheus scale\\", is an example of a synthetic scale. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 6/4 c4 d e fis a bes c } } For example, a group of piano miniatures (Op. 58, Op. 59/2, Op. 61, Op. 63, Op. 67/1 and Op. 69/1) are governed by the acoustic and/or the octatonic scales.\\"Principles of Pitch Organization in Scriabin's Early Post-tonal Period: The Piano Miniatures\\". Vasilis Kallis, Music Theory Online, Vol. 14.3 (Sep 2008) Contrary to many textbook descriptions of the chord, which present the sonority as a series of superposed fourths, Scriabin most often manipulated the voicings to produce a variety of melodic and harmonic intervals. A rare example of purely quartal spacing can be found in the Fifth Piano Sonata (mm. 264 and 268). Measures 263–264 are shown below. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4. = 46 \\\\stemUp \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #263 \\\\bar \\"\\" s4_\\\\markup { \\\\dynamic p \\\\italic { con delizia } }^\\\\markup { \\\\bold \\"Meno vivo\\" } b8^~ b4. s4 8~^\\\\markup { \\\\bold \\"poco rit.\\" } 4\\\\. } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemDown r4 8~( 4 8 **4 fis8_( a4 fis8)) } >> ew Staff << \\\\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn \\\\mergeDifferentlyDottedOn ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemUp \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 s4. b^- fis2.^- } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemDown a8_( g'! cis b' g! cis,) 2.\\\\arpeggio } >> >> } Incomplete versions of the chord spaced entirely in fourths are considerably more common, for example, in Deux Morceaux, Op. 57. According to George Perle, Scriabin used this chord in what he calls a pre-serial manner, producing harmonies, chords, and melodies. However, unlike the twelve tone technique to which Perle refers, Scriabin, like Perle, did not use his Mystic chord as an ordered set and did not worry about repeating or omitting notes or aggregate combinatoriality. Use by other composers Duke Ellington's 1958 piano piece \\"Reflections in D\\". The E dominant 9th chord has 11th and 13th appoggiaturas added, which resolve conventionally. With the increasing use of more dissonant sonorities, some composers of the 20th and 21st centuries have used this chord in various ways.

Under the Empire The son of a farmer attended from 1881-88 the primary school in Greußenheim. In Würzburg he learned the profession of a carpenter. In 1893, he entered the Catholic Gesellenverein in Günzburg (Swabia). From 1900 to 1902 he was a private listener of Lujo Brentano for two semesters for economics and special economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. From 1903-05 he attended lectures at the Graduate School of Cologne. From 1916-19, he was a member of the board of the Reichsernähungsamt. From 1917-18 he belonged to the Prussian House of Lords. During the Weimar Republic As a representative of the Christian trade unions he signed on 15 November 1918 the \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaftsabkommen\\" between the employer's association and the trade unions. From 1919-29 he became the head of the Christian German Union Federation (DGB). He was from 1919 to 1920 a member of the National Assembly. He belonged to the 'Committee for the preliminary discussion of the draft constitution for the German Empire' of the National Assembly. From March 1919 to November 1921 he was Prussian Minister for People's Welfare. From April to November 1921 he held both the office of the Prussian Minister-president, from April 1929 to March 1930 that of the Minister for Transports, from March 1930 to May 1932, the Minister for employment. As Minister of Labour in the cabinet of his former personal assistant Heinrich Brüning he tried to save at least the basics of the Weimar welfare state under the conditions of the Great Depression. He failed therein because of the resistance of the Heavy industry. Nazi Regime Following Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, Stegerwald was attacked by Nazi storm troopers at an election rally in Krefeld on February 21, 1933, while regular police did not interfereDie Niederrheinische Volkszeitung berichtete am 22. Februar 1933 über den Vorfall unter der Überschrift Zentrumsversammlung von Nationalsozialisten gesprengt: „Dramatisch gestaltete sich die Lage, als ein kleiner Trupp das Podium stürmte, auf Stegerwald eindrangen und ihm mehrere Kopfhiebe beibrachte. Ein Schlag war so heftig geführt, dass der Bügel der Brille eine blutige Wunde am Ohr hinterließ.“ – „Sie schlugen den früheren Minister Stegerwald mit Kopfhieben nieder, ohne dass die Polizei zu Hilfe kam“. (in: Wilhelm Hoegner: Die verratene Republik. 1958, S. 345) In March 1933, he led together with Ludwig Kaas and Albert Hackelsberger negotiations with Adolf Hitler. Afterwards the Centre party agreed to the Enabling Act. From 1933-34 he was indicted, along with Wilhelm Marx and Heinrich Brauns, in the trial of the Cologne Volksverein Verlag in his capacity as board member of the National Association for Catholic Germany. He was on the list of politicians to be purged during the Night of the Long Knives, but was warned about this and disappeared into exile for three months.„Während der Röhm-Affaire stand er mit Heinrich Brüning auf der Liste derjenigen, die beseitigt werden sollten. Doch verhinderten, wie er in seinem ersten Lebenslauf nach 1945 schrieb, der Reichspräsident und einflussreiche Kreise der Reichswehr den Plan der Nationalsozialisten. Auf Empfehlung einer ausländischen Botschaft verließ er für kurze Zeit Berlin und lebte drei Monate im Exil“ (vgl. Helmut J. Schnorr: Adam Stegerwald, Gewerkschafter, Politiker der ersten deutschen Republik. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der christlich-sozialen Bewegung in Deutschland. 1966.) After the 20 July plot, he was temporarily arrested under the Aktion Gitter. From August 24, October 19, 1944 he was detained by the Gestapo in Würzburg prison.„Dort scheint ihm die Realität des Dritten Reiches aufgegangen zu sein. Nach dem Zeugnis des Würzburger Kunsthistorikers Kurt Gerstenberg (1886–1968), der zusammen mit Stegerwald eine Gefängniszelle teilte, hat sich der Exminister außerordentlich tapfer gezeigt und die Quälereien und Bitternisse der Haft mit stoischer Ruhe ertragen. Allerdings scheint seine robuste Gesundheit durch die Inhaftierung gelitten zu haben“ (vgl. Rudolf Morsey: Zeitgeschichte in Lebensbildern – Aus dem deutschen Katholizismus des 20. Jahrhunderts. Band 1, 1973, S. 216.). During the time of Nazi Germany he had no influence. After the war In 1945, he was appointed at the behest of the American occupation forces for District President of the district of Lower Franconia. Stegerwald became the leading head of the Würzburg group that was instrumental in the founding of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria in the summer and autumn of 1945, in addition to the Munich group around Josef Müller. Adam Stegerwald died in December 1945 from pneumonia, eleven days before his 71st birthday. Literature * Schnorr, Helmut J.: Adam Stegerwald, Gewerkschafter, Politiker der ersten deutschen Republik.

Owing to a 19th-century dispute, there are currently two Earls of Mar as both the first and seventh creations are currently extant. The first creation of the earldom was originally the provincial ruler of the province of Mar in north-eastern Scotland. First attested in the year 1014,Tribe of Mar: History the \\"seat\\" or \\"caput\\" eventually became Kildrummy Castle, although other sites like Doune of Invernochty were initially just as important. The title evolved into a peerage title, and was made particularly famous by John Erskine, the 23rd/6th Earl of Mar, who was an important Jacobite military leader during the 1715 Jacobite rising. Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar holds the title in the first creation, and James Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie in the seventh. The Earl of Mar and Kellie is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Erskine;Burk's Peerage – Erskine the Countess of Mar is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Mar. The Earldom of Mar, which is one of the seven original Scottish earldoms, is thought to be the oldest peerage in Great Britain, and even Europe.Burk's Peerage – MarThe Ancient Earldom of Mar @electric scotland.com The family seat of Earl of Mar (first creation) is St Michael's Farm, near Great Witley, Worcestershire, and of Earl of Mar (seventh creation) is Hilton Farm, near Alloa, Clackmannanshire.  Early mormaers or earls  The first Mormaer of Mar is usually regarded as Ruadrí (fl. 1131), mentioned in the Book of Deer. Some modern sources give earlier mormaers, i.e. Muirchertach (Latinized as Martachus) and Gartnait (sometimes Gratnach), mentioned respectively in charters of the reigns of king Máel Coluim III (relating to the Céli Dé establishment of Loch Leven) and king Alexander I (relating to the monastic establishment of Scone), though in these cases certain identification with a particular province is difficult. The accounts of the Battle of Clontarf in some of the Irish annals name Domnall mac Eimín meic Cainnig, Mormaer of Mar, as among those killed in 1014 alongside Brian Boru. The Mormaerdom comprised the larger portion of modern Aberdeenshire, extending from north of the River Don southward to the Mounth hills. Its principal seats were Migvie and Doune of Invernochty. The Mormaerdom may initially have alternated between two kin- groups, represented respectively by Morggán, and by Gille Críst. Gilchrist succeeded Morgund, but was himself succeeded by Donnchadh (Duncan), son of Morgund. On the other hand, we do not know Gilchrist's parentage, and chronologically he could have been an elder brother of Donnchadh. No definite succession of earls appears till the 13th century, and from the middle of the 13th century the earls were recognized as among \\"the seven earls of Scotland\\". There was a settlement in around 1230 between Donnchadh and Thomas Durward, grandson, apparently, of Gilchrist, by which Durward had, it is said, £300 of land, a very large amount, which was scattered around the earldom, particularly at Fichlie, near Kildrummy, and Lumphanan in the lowland area. He also had Urquhart, but that probably had nothing to do with the earldom. Donnchadh got the title of Mormaer and the wealthier and militarily more useful upland parts of Mar. Earl Thomas died childless in 1374, but the earldom passed via Donnchadh's daughter Margaret to her husband William, Earl of Douglas.  15th century  While the eleventh (by some counts) holder of the title, William and Margaret's daughter Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, was alone at the Kildrummy Castle, Alexander Stewart entered it and forced her to sign a charter on 12 August 1404 yielding the earldom to him and his heirs. She revoked the charter later that year, but on marrying him, she gave him the earldom for life with remainder to her heirs. The King confirmed her last action the next year. In 1426, Stewart resigned the title so that he could be granted a new one by the King, the new title being more \\"legitimate\\". The King did so, but specified that the earldom and associated lands would revert to the Crown upon the death of the Earl. In 1435, the Earl died, and Robert, Lord Erskine claimed the title, but the King claimed its lands under the specifications of reversion made in the patent. The issue remained unresolved until 1457, when James II obtained a court order declaring the lands as crown possessions. Thereafter, he bestowed the title on his son John, who died without heirs in 1479. It was next granted to James' other son, Alexander, Duke of Albany, but the title was then declared forfeit because of Alexander's alliances with the English. James III created his son John Earl of Mar in 1486, upon whose death in 1503 the title became extinct again.  16th–18th centuries  Mars Wark: The Earl of Mar's house in Stirling, situated on the approach to Stirling Castle, the Earl of Mar was governor of the castle during the mid-16th century. The title was once again created in 1562, for James, Earl of Moray, son of James V, but he, too, could not produce a qualified heir. Moray rebelled in 1565 (see Chaseabout Raid) in protest at the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Consequently, Queen Mary restored (or created) the earldom of Mar for John, Lord Erskine, heir to the Lord Erskine, heir of the ancient Earls through a cousin of Isabel, who quarrelled with James II about the Earldom. His son, also named John, recovered the Mar estates, alienated by the Crown during the long period that his family had been out of possession. John, the 23rd (or 6th Earl counting from 1565) was attainted for rebellion in 1716 (he was also created Duke of Mar in the Jacobite Peerages of Scotland and Ireland, and Earl of Mar in the Jacobite Peerage of England), and the Earldom remained forfeit for over a century.  19th century  In 1824, the Earldom was finally restored by Act of Parliament (5 Geo. IV c. 59) to John Francis Erskine, the heir of the attainted Earl, in his 83rd year. His grandson, the ninth Earl, successfully claimed inheritance the earldom of Kellie and associated titles in 1835. At the death of the 26th Earl of Mar and eleventh Earl of Kellie in 1866, the Earldom of Kellie and the family's estates passed to Walter Erskine, the cousin of the late Earl, and his heir male. Meanwhile, it was assumed that the Earldom of Mar passed to John Francis Goodeve, the late Earl's nephew, and his heir general. Goodeve changed his name to Goodeve Erskine; his claim was agreed upon by all. He even participated in the election of representative peers for the Peerage of Scotland. However, the Earl of Kellie submitted a petition to the House of Lords asking that the Earldom of Mar be declared his, dying before it could be considered. His son, the thirteenth Earl of Kellie, renewed the petition, and the Lords referred it to their Committee on Privileges. The petition made a number of claims: *The original Earldom of Mar was a territorial title rather than a title of peerage and was therefore \\"indivisible.\\" (In other words, the territory could not be separated from the title.) *Alexander Stewart obtained a new Royal charter for the Earldom, rather than receiving it in right of his wife Isabel. *After the death of Alexander Stewart, his lands were passed to the Sovereign in accordance with the charter, and thereafter were disposed of by the Crown. *As the territorial Earldom was \\"indivisible\\", upon the termination of the territory, the earldom must have ended also. *Therefore, since the territorial Earldom had already become non-existent, the 1565 grant was not a revival of that title. Rather, it was a totally new creation, this time in the form of a peerage title. *Since the instrument of the 1565 grant cannot be found, the presumption ought to be that the Earldom passes to heirs-male, and not to heirs-general. Thus, the Earl of Kellie is entitled to the Earldom of Mar as he is the late Earl of Mar's heir male, while John Goodeve Erskine was an heir-general. Goodeve Erskine had different ideas, however. He portrayed the Crown's takeover of the territorial Earldom not as pursuant to a charter, but rather as an act of tyranny. He argued: *James I, in a tyrannical act, seized the lands of Alexander Stewart, when these should have passed to Robert, Lord Erskine. *The \\"true\\" Earls never agreed to terminate their claim to the Earldom. *The 1565 grant was a restitution of the old territorial Earldom rather than a new creation. *Because the title is a restoration of a territorial Earldom, and because the territorial Earldom could pass to heirs-general, John Goodeve Erskine was the rightful heir, being the late Earl of Mar's heir-general. The House of Lords Committee on Privileges ruled in 1875, to the dissatisfaction of many, that the Earldom of Mar was newly created in 1565, passed only to heirs-male, and therefore belonged to the Earl of Kellie, and not to Goodeve Erskine. The Lord Chancellor, Roundell Palmer, 1st Baron Selborne, declared it to be \\"final, right or wrong, and not to be questioned\\". However, there was a sentiment that the Lords had decided wrongly. A bill was brought to Parliament, to allow Goodeve Erskine to assume the title, and was passed without dissent. The Earldom of Mar Restitution Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict.) declared that because of the doubts relating to the 1565 creation, it would be assumed that there are two Earldoms of Mar. The Earldom created in 1565 would be held by the Earl of Kellie. The ancient Earldom, however, was declared to be still in existence, and was given to John Goodeve Erskine. For the purposes of precedence, it is assumed that the Earldom held by Goodeve Erskine's heirs was created in 1404.

Rich in Native American archaeological sites, the monument is administered by the National Park Service in close conjunction with the nearby Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. Wupatki was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The listing included three contributing buildings and 29 contributing structures on . History The many settlement sites scattered throughout the monument were built by the Ancient Pueblo People, more specifically the Cohonina, Kayenta Anasazi, and Sinagua. Wupatki was first inhabited around 500 AD. Wupatki, which means \\"Tall House\\" in the Hopi language, is a multistory Sinagua pueblo dwelling comprising over 100 rooms and a community room and the northernmost ballcourt ever discovered in North America, creating the largest building site for nearly 50 miles. Nearby secondary structures have also been uncovered, including two kiva-like structures. A major population influx began soon after the eruption of Sunset Crater in the 11th century (between 1040 and 1100), which blanketed the area with volcanic ash, improving agricultural productivity and the soil's ability to retain water. By 1182, approximately 85 to 100 people lived at Wupatki Pueblo, but by 1225, the site was permanently abandoned. Based on a careful survey of archaeological sites conducted in the 1980s, an estimated 2,000 people moved into the area during the century following the eruption. Agriculture was based mainly on maize and squash raised on the arid land without irrigation. In the Wupatki site, the residents harvested rainwater due to the rarity of springs. Wupatki National Monument Wukoki ruins complex The dwelling's walls were constructed from thin, flat blocks of the local Moenkopi sandstone, giving the pueblos their distinct red color. Held together with mortar, many of the walls still stand. Each settlement was constructed as a single building, sometimes with scores of rooms. The largest settlement on monument territory is the Wupatki Ruin, built around a natural rock outcrop. With more than 100 rooms, this ruin is believed to be the region's tallest and largest structure for its time period. The monument also contains ruins identified as a ball court, similar to those found in Mesoamerica and in the Hohokam ruins of southern Arizona; this is the northernmost example of this kind of structure. This site also contains a geological blowhole, from which wind escapes from a cave system. Other major sites are Wukoki and The Citadel. Today, Wupatki appears empty and abandoned, but it is remembered and cared for. Although it is no longer physically occupied, Hopi believe the people who lived and died here remain as spiritual guardians. Stories of Wupatki are passed on among Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, and other Native American tribes in the region. Members of the Hopi Bear, Katsina, Lizard, Rattlesnake, Sand, Snow, and Water Clans return periodically to enrich their personal understanding of their clan history. View from atop a Wupatki Pueblo Amidst what would seem a generally inhospitable area due to the lack of food and water sources, several artifacts have been located at the site from distant locations, implying that the people who inhabited Wupatki were involved in trade. During numerous excavations stretching back to the site' exploration in the mid-1800s, items from as far as the Pacific and the Gulf Coasts have been located at the site, such as many different varieties of pottery and seashells.

(hardback) (pbk). In music, a hexachord (also hexachordon) is a six-note series, as exhibited in a scale (hexatonic or hexad) or tone row. The term was adopted in this sense during the Middle Ages and adapted in the 20th century in Milton Babbitt's serial theory. The word is taken from the , compounded from ἕξ (hex, six) and χορδή (chordē, string [of the lyre], whence \\"note\\"), and was also the term used in music theory up to the 18th century for the interval of a sixth (\\"hexachord major\\" being the major sixth and \\"hexachord minor\\" the minor sixth).William Holder, A Treatise of the Natural Grounds and Principles of Harmony (London: Printed by J.

In each hexachord, all adjacent pitches are a whole tone apart, except for the middle two, which are separated by a semitone. These six pitches are named ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la, with the semitone between mi and fa. These six names are derived from the first syllable of each half-verse of the first stanza of the 8th-century Vesper hymn Ut queant laxis resonare fibris / Mira gestorum famuli tuorum, etc.Guido d'Arezzo, \\"Epistola de ignotu cantu [ca. 1030]\\", abridged translation by Oliver Strink in Source Readings in Music History, selected and annotated by Oliver Strunk, 5 vols. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1965): 1:121–25. Citation on p. 124. Melodies with a range wider than a major sixth required the device of mutation to a new hexachord. For example, the hexachord beginning on C and rising to A, named hexachordum naturale, has its only semitone between the notes E and F, and stops short of the note B or B. A melody moving a semitone higher than la (namely, from A to the B above) required changing the la to mi, so that the required B becomes fa. Because B was named by the \\"soft\\" or rounded letter B, the hexachord with this note in it was called the hexachordum molle (soft hexachord). Similarly, the hexachord with mi and fa expressed by the notes B and C was called the hexachordum durum (hard hexachord), because the B was represented by a squared-off, or \\"hard\\" B. Starting in the 14th century, these three hexachords were extended in order to accommodate the increasing use of signed accidentals on other notes.Jehoash Hirshberg, \\"Hexachord\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). The introduction of these new notes was principally a product of polyphony, which required the placing of a perfect fifth not only above the old note B, but also below its newly created variant, this entailing, as a result of the \\"original sin\\" committed by the well-meant innovation B, the introduction of the still newer respective notes F and E, with as consequences of these last C and A, and so on. The new notes, being outside the gamut of those ordinarily available, had to be \\"imagined\\", or \\"feigned\\" (it was long forbidden to write them), and for this reason music containing them was called musica ficta or musica falsa.Andrew Hughes and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, \\"Solmization [solfatio, solmifatio]\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001): §4, \\"Expansion of the Hexachord System\\". 20th century Hauer's tropes.George Perle, Serial Composition and Atonality: An Introduction to the Music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, sixth edition, revised (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991): 145. .

She was praised for her 3-octave contralto vocal range. Her drumming abilities were viewed positively by other musicians and critics. Her struggles with eating disorders would later raise awareness of anorexia and body dysmorphia. Carpenter was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Downey, California, in 1963 with her family. She began to study the drums in high school and joined the Long Beach State choir after graduating. After several years of touring and recording, Carpenters were signed to A&M; Records in 1969, achieving commercial and critical success throughout the 1970s. Initially, Carpenter was the band's full-time drummer, but gradually took the role of frontwoman as drumming was reduced to a handful of live showcases or tracks on albums. While Carpenters were on hiatus in the late 1970s, she recorded a solo album, which was released years after her death. Briefly married in the early 1980s, Carpenter suffered from anorexia nervosa, which was little-known at the time. Her death from heart failure at age 32, related to complications of her illness, led to increased visibility and awareness of eating disorders. Her work continues to attract praise, including appearing on Rolling Stones 2010 list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. Early life Karen Anne Carpenter was born on March 2, 1950, at Grace New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, the daughter of Agnes Reuwer (née Tatum, March 5, 1915 – November 10, 1996) and Harold Bertram Carpenter (November 8, 1908 – October 15, 1988). Harold was born in Wuzhou, China, where his parents were missionaries. He was educated at boarding schools in England before finding work in the printing business. Carpenter's only sibling, Richard, the elder by three years, developed an interest in music at an early age, becoming a piano prodigy. Karen's first words were \\"bye-bye\\" and \\"stop it\\", the latter spoken in response to Richard. She enjoyed dancing and by age four was enrolled in tap dancing and ballet classes. The family moved in June 1963 to the Los Angeles suburb of Downey after Harold was offered a job there by a former business associate. Carpenter entered Downey High School in 1964 at age 14 and was a year younger than her classmates. She joined the school band, initially to avoid gym classes. Bruce Gifford, the conductor (who had previously taught her elder brother), gave her the glockenspiel, an instrument she disliked, and after admiring the performance of her friend and classmate, drummer Frankie Chavez (who had been playing from an early age and idolized jazz drummer Buddy Rich), she asked if she could play those instead. Carpenter wanted a Ludwig drum set because it was used by her favorite drummers, Joe Morello and Ringo Starr. Chavez persuaded her family to buy her a $300 (the equivalent of $ in ) Ludwig kit, and he began to teach her how to play. Her enthusiasm for drumming led to teaching herself how to play complicated lines and studying the difference between traditional and matched grip. Within a year, she could play in complex time signatures, such as the in Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\". Carpenter was initially nervous about performing in public, but said she \\"was too involved in the music to worry about it\\". She graduated from Downey High School in the spring of 1967, receiving the John Philip Sousa Band Award, and enrolled as a music major at Long Beach State where she performed in the college choir with Richard. The choir's director, Frank Pooler, said that Karen had a good voice that was particularly suited to pop and gave her lessons in order for her to develop a three-octave range. Career=The Carpenters alt= Carpenter's first band was Two Plus Two, an all-girl trio formed with friends from Downey High. They split up after she suggested that her brother Richard join the group. In 1965, Karen, Richard, and his college friend Wes Jacobs, a bassist and tuba player, formed the Richard Carpenter Trio. The band rehearsed daily, played jazz in nightclubs, and also appeared on the TV talent show Your All-American College Show. Richard was immediately impressed with his sister's musical talent, saying that she would \\"speedily maneuver the sticks as if she had been born in a drum factory\\". She did not sing at this point; instead, singer Margaret Shanor guested on some numbers. The trio signed a contract with RCA Records and recorded two instrumentals, but they were not released. In April 1966, the Carpenters were invited to audition at a session with bassist Joe Osborn, well-known for being part of the studio-musician collective the Wrecking Crew. Though she was initially expected to just be the drummer, Karen tried singing and impressed everyone there with her distinctive voice. Osborn signed a recording contract with her for his label, Magic Lamp Records; he was not particularly interested in Richard's involvement. In 1967, Jacobs left the trio to study at the Juilliard School, and the Carpenter siblings were keen to try out other musical styles. Along with other musicians, including Gary Sims and John Bettis, the siblings formed the group Spectrum, which focused on a harmonious vocal sound and recorded many demo tapes in Osborn's garage studio, working out how to overdub voices onto multitrack tape. Many of those tapes were rejected by record companies. The group had difficulty attracting a live following, as their sound was too dissimilar from the hard rock and psychedelic rock then popular in clubs. A&M; Records finally signed the Carpenters to a recording contract in 1969. Karen started out as both the group's drummer and co-lead singer, and she originally sang all of her vocals from behind the drum set. She sang most of the songs on the band's first album, Offering (later retitled Ticket to Ride); her brother wrote ten of the album's thirteen songs and sang on five of them. The opening and concluding tracks were sung by both siblings in unison. As well as drumming, Karen played bass guitar on two songs, \\"All of My Life\\" and \\"Eve\\", under Osborn's guidance. On \\"All I Can Do\\", she played in 5/4 time, while \\"Your Wonderful Parade\\" featured multiple snare and bass drum overdubs to emulate the sound of a marching band. The track \\"Ticket to Ride\\", a Beatles cover song that later became the album's title track, was released as the Carpenters' first single; it reached No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next album, 1970's Close to You, featured two hit singles: \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\" and \\"We've Only Just Begun\\". They peaked at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, on the Hot 100. Because she was just tall, it was difficult for people in the audience to see Karen behind her kit. After reviews complained that the group had no focal point in live shows, Richard and manager Sherwin Bash persuaded her to stand at the microphone to sing the band's hits while another musician played the drums (former Disney Mouseketeer Cubby O'Brien served as the band's other drummer for many years). She initially struggled in live performances singing solo, as she felt more secure behind the drum kit. After the release of Now & Then in 1973, the albums tended to have Carpenter singing more and drumming less, and she did become the focal point of all records and live performances; Bash said \\"she was the one that people watched.\\" Starting with the Carpenters' 1976 concert tour and continuing thereafter, she would perform a showcase in which she moved around the stage playing various configurations of drums. Her studio performances benefited from close miking that captured the nuances of her voice well. Though she had a three-octave range, many of the duo's hits prominently feature her lower contralto singing, leading her to quip, \\"The money's in the basement.\\" A promotional photograph of Carpenter from 1973 Carpenter always considered herself a \\"drummer who sang.\\" She preferred Ludwig Drums, including the Ludwig SuperSensitive snare, which she favored greatly. However, she did not drum on every Carpenters recording. She was the only featured drummer on Ticket to Ride and on Now & Then, except for \\"Jambalaya\\". According to Hal Blaine, Karen played on many of the album cuts and he played on most of the Carpenters' studio sessions when she did not play drums herself, but Karen was informed about Blaine's involvement and she approved on the basis that she and Richard wanted hit singles.https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/may-1983-karen- carpenter-1950-1983/ The duo were happy for Blaine to take the role in the studio, as he was a respected session musician and it was easier to record Carpenter's guide vocal without it spilling onto the drum mics. Blaine complimented Karen's drumming skills, but believed her greatest strength was as a vocalist and thought himself more adept at working in a recording studio, which required a different approach from that of an onstage performance.Marc Meyers (May 7, 2012. Hal Blaine on Karen Carpenter, All About Jazz, accessed August 16, 2019. On Made in America, Karen provided percussion on \\"Those Good Old Dreams\\" in tandem with Paulinho da Costa, and played drums on the song \\"When it's Gone (It's Just Gone)\\" in unison with Larrie Londin. In the mid-1970s, Richard Carpenter developed an addiction to Quaaludes. The Carpenters frequently canceled tour dates, and they stopped touring altogether after their September 4, 1978, concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In 1980, Karen performed a medley of standards in a duet with Ella Fitzgerald on the Carpenters' television program Music, Music, Music. In 1981, after release of the Made in America album (which turned out to be their last), the Carpenters returned to the stage and went on some promotional tours, including an appearance for the BBC program Nationwide. \\"Now\\" was the last song Carpenter recorded, in April 1982. Though Richard was concerned about her health, he still thought her voice sounded as good as ever. Solo Carpenter released her first solo record, \\"Looking for Love\\" / \\"I'll Be Yours\\", in 1967 on Osborn's Magic Lamp label. Only 500 copies were pressed, and the label folded shortly afterwards. In 1979, while Richard took a year off to treat his addiction, Karen made a solo album with producer Phil Ramone. The sessions produced music that was different from the usual Carpenters material, tending more toward disco and up-tempo numbers, with more mature lyrics and taking full advantage of Karen's upper vocal register. The album met with a tepid response from Richard and A&M; executives in early 1980 and was shelved by A&M; Records co-owner Herb Alpert, in spite of attempts by producer Quincy Jones to convince him to release the solo record after a remix. A&M; subsequently charged Carpenter $400,000 to cover the cost of recording her unreleased album, to be paid out of the duo's future royalties. A portion of the solo album was commercially released in 1989, when some of its tracks (as remixed by Richard) were included on the album Lovelines, the final album of previously unreleased material from the Carpenters. In 1996, the complete solo album, titled Karen Carpenter, was finally released. Personal life Carpenter had a complicated relationship with her parents. They had hoped that Richard's musical talents would be recognized and that he would enter the music business, but were not prepared for Karen's success. She continued to live with them until 1974. In 1976, Carpenter bought two Century City apartments that she combined into one; the doorbell chimed the opening notes of \\"We've Only Just Begun\\". She collected Disney memorabilia and liked to play softball and baseball. Growing up, she had played baseball with other children on the street and was picked before her brother for games. She studied baseball statistics carefully and became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the early 1970s she would become the pitcher on a celebrity all-star softball team. Petula Clark, Olivia Newton-John and Dionne Warwick were her close friends. While she was enjoying success as a female drummer in what was primarily an all-male occupation, Carpenter was not supportive of the women's liberation movement, saying she believed a wife should cook for her husband and that when married, this was what she planned to do. In early interviews, Carpenter showed no interest in marriage or dating, believing that a relationship would not survive constant touring, adding \\"as long as we're on the road most of the time, I will never marry\\". In 1976, she said the music business made it hard to meet people and that she refused to just marry someone for the sake of it. Carpenter admitted to Olivia Newton-John that she longed for a happy marriage and family. She later dated several notable men, including Mike Curb, Tony Danza, Terry Ellis, Mark Harmon, Steve Martin and Alan Osmond. After a whirlwind romance, she married real-estate developer Thomas James Burris on August 31, 1980, in the Crystal Room of The Beverly Hills Hotel. Burris, divorced with an 18-year-old son, was nine years her senior. A new song she performed at the ceremony, \\"Because We Are in Love\\", was released in 1981. The couple settled in Newport Beach. Carpenter desperately wanted children, but Burris had undergone a vasectomy and refused to get an operation to reverse it. Their marriage did not survive this disagreement and ended after 14 months. Burris was living beyond his means, borrowing up to $50,000 (the equivalent of $ in ) at a time from his wife, to the point where reportedly she had only stocks and bonds left. Carpenter's friends also indicated he was abusive towards her, often being impatient; they stated she remained fearful when he would occasionally lose his temper. Karen Kamon, a close friend, recounted an incident in which she and Carpenter went to their normal hangout, Hamburger Hamlet, and Carpenter appeared to be distant emotionally, sitting not at their regular table but in the dark, wearing large dark sunglasses, unable to eat and crying. According to Kamon, the marriage was \\"the straw that broke the camel's back. It was absolutely the worst thing that could have ever happened to her\\". In September 1981, Carpenter revised her will and left her marital home and its contents to Burris, but left everything else to her brother and parents, including her fortune estimated at 5–10 million dollars (between $ and $ in ). Two months later, following an argument after a family dinner in a restaurant, Carpenter and Burris broke up. Carpenter filed for divorce on October 28, 1982, while she was in Lenox Hill Hospital. Illness and death Carpenter began dieting while in high school. Under a doctor's guidance, she began the Stillman diet, eating lean foods, drinking eight glasses of water a day, and avoiding fatty foods. She reduced her weight to and stayed approximately at that weight until around 1973, when the Carpenters' career reached its peak. That year, she saw a concert photo of herself in which her outfit made her appear heavy. She hired a personal trainer, who advised her to change her diet. The new diet caused her to build muscle, which made her feel heavier instead of slimmer. Carpenter fired the trainer and began her own weight-loss program using exercise equipment and counting calories. She lost about and intended to lose another five pounds. Her eating habits also changed around this time; she would try to remove food from her plate by offering tastes to others with whom she was dining. By September 1975, Carpenter weighed . At live performances, fans reacted with gasps to her gaunt appearance, and many wrote to the pair to inquire what was wrong. She refused to declare publicly that she was in ill health; on her 1981 Nationwide appearance, she simply said she was \\"pooped\\". Richard later stated that he and his parents did not know how to help Karen. In 1981, she told Richard that there was a problem and that she needed help with it. Carpenter spoke with Cherry Boone, who had recovered from anorexia, and contacted Boone's doctor for help. She was hoping to find a quick solution to her problem, as she had performing and recording obligations, but the doctor told her treatment could take from one to three years. She then chose to be treated in New York City by psychotherapist Steven Levenkron. By late 1981, Carpenter was using thyroid replacement medication, which she obtained using the name of Karen Burris, to increase her metabolism. She used the medication in conjunction with increased consumption of the laxatives (up to 80–90 tablets per night) upon which she had long relied, which caused food to pass quickly through her digestive tract. Despite Levenkron's treatment, including confiscation of medications that Karen had misused, her condition continued to deteriorate, and she lost more weight. Carpenter told Levenkron that she felt dizzy and that her heart was beating irregularly. Finally, in September 1982, she was admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, where she was placed on intravenous parenteral nutrition. The procedure was successful, and she gained some weight in a relatively short time, but this put a strain on her heart, which was already weak from years of improper diet. She maintained a relatively stable weight for the rest of her life. Carpenter returned to California in November 1982, determined to reinvigorate her career, finalize her divorce and begin a new album with Richard. On December 17, 1982, she gave her last singing performance in the multi-purpose room of the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California, singing Christmas carols for her godchildren, their classmates and other friends. On January 11, 1983, she made her last public appearance at a gathering of past Grammy Award winners, who were commemorating the awards show's 25th anniversary. She seemed somewhat frail and worn out, but according to Dionne Warwick, was vibrant and outgoing, exclaiming, \\"Look at me! I've got an ass!\\" She had also begun to write songs after returning to California and told Warwick that she had \\"a lot of living left to do.\\" On February 1, 1983, Carpenter saw her brother for the last time and discussed new plans for the Carpenters and resuming touring. Three days later, on February 4, Carpenter was scheduled to sign final papers making her divorce official. Shortly after waking up on that day, she collapsed in her bedroom at her parents' home in Downey. Paramedics found her heart beating once every 10 seconds. She was pronounced dead at PIH Health Hospital - Downey at 9:51 a.m. Carpenter's funeral was held February 8, 1983, at Downey United Methodist Church. Approximately one thousand mourners attended, including her friends Dorothy Hamill, Olivia Newton-John, Petula Clark and Dionne Warwick. Her estranged husband, Thomas Burris, also attended and placed his wedding ring into her casket. Carpenter was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress, California. In 2003 her body was moved in order to be placed with her parents in a mausoleum at the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California. An autopsy released on March 11, 1983, ruled out drug overdose, attributing death to \\"emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa\\". Carpenter was discovered to have a blood sugar level of 1,110 milligrams per decilitre, more than ten times the average. Two years later, the coroner told colleagues that Carpenter's heart failure was caused by repeated use of ipecac syrup, an over-the-counter emetic often used to induce vomiting in cases of overdosing or poisoning. This was disputed by Levenkron, who said that he had never known her to use ipecac and that he had not seen evidence that she had been vomiting. Carpenter's friends were convinced that she had abused laxatives and thyroid medication to maintain her low body weight and thought this had started after her marriage began to crumble. Legacy The Carpenters' star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame Carpenter's singing has attracted critical praise and influenced several significant musicians and singers, including Madonna, Sheryl Crow, Pat Metheny, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Shania Twain, Natalie Imbruglia, and k.d. lang. Paul McCartney has said that she had \\"the best female voice in the world: melodic, tuneful and distinctive.\\" She has been called \\"one of the greatest voices of our lifetime\\" by Elton John. Her drumming has been praised by fellow musicians Hal Blaine, Cubby O'Brien and Buddy Rich and by Modern Drummer magazine. In 1975, she was voted the best rock drummer in a poll of Playboy readers, beating Led Zeppelin's John Bonham. On October 12, 1983, shortly after her death, the Carpenters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1999, VH1 ranked Carpenter at No. 29 on its list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked Carpenter No. 94 on its list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, calling her voice \\"impossibly lush and almost shockingly intimate\\", adding \\"even the sappiest songs sound like she was staring directly into your eyes.\\" Carpenter's death brought media attention to conditions such as anorexia nervosa; the condition had not been widely known beforehand. Her family started the Karen A. Carpenter Memorial Foundation, which raised money for research on anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. Carpenter is known to fans as \\"Lead Sister\\". This originated from a mispronunciation of \\"lead singer\\" by a Japanese journalist in 1974, and she later wore a T-shirt with the nickname during live shows. Biographies A 43-minute film titled Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, directed by Todd Haynes, was released in 1987, and featured Barbie dolls as the characters. It was withdrawn from circulation in 1990 after Haynes lost a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Richard Carpenter. The film's title is derived from the Carpenters' 1971 hit song \\"Superstar\\". Over the years, it has developed into a cult film and was included in Entertainment Weeklys 2003 list of the top 50 cult movies. On January 1, 1989, the similarly titled made-for-TV movie The Karen Carpenter Story aired on CBS with Cynthia Gibb in the title role. Gibb lip-synched the songs to Carpenter's recorded voice, with the exception of \\"The End of the World.\\" Both films use the song \\"This Masquerade\\" in the background while showing Carpenter's marriage to Burris. The movie helped revive the Carpenters' critical standing and increased their music's popularity. Richard Carpenter helped in the production of the documentaries Close to You: Remembering the Carpenters (1997) and Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story (2007). Randy Schmidt wrote a biography about Carpenter entitled Little Girl Blue, published in 2010, which included a foreword by Warwick. It provides a different perspective than those of the other officially endorsed biographies, and it was based on interviews with other friends and associates.

Sometimes the switch will have a flip cover to prevent inadvertent operation A scram or SCRAM, also known as AZ-5 (), is an emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor effected by immediately terminating the fission reaction. It is also the name that is given to the manually operated kill switch that initiates the shutdown. In commercial reactor operations, this type of shutdown is often referred to as a \\"SCRAM\\" at boiling water reactors (BWR), a \\"reactor trip\\" at pressurized water reactors (PWR) and EPIS at a CANDU reactor. In many cases, a SCRAM is part of the routine shutdown procedure, which serves to test the emergency shutdown system. The etymology of the term is a matter of debate. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission historian Tom Wellock notes that scram is English- language slang for leaving quickly and urgently, and cites this as the original and mostly likely accurate basis for the use of scram in the technical context. A persistent alternative explanation posits that scram is an acronym for \\"safety control rod axe man\\", which was supposedly coined by Enrico Fermi when the world's first nuclear reactor was built under the spectator seating at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field. That reactor had an actual control rod tied to a rope, with a man with an axe standing next to it. It could also stand for \\"Safety Control Rods Activation Mechanism\\" or \\"Safety Control Rod Actuator Mechanism\\". Both of these are probably backronyms from the original, non-technical usage. The Russian name, AZ-5 (, in Cyrillic), derives from (), 'Emergency Protection of the 5th Category'. Mechanisms In any reactor, a SCRAM is achieved by inserting large amounts of negative reactivity mass into the midst of the fissile material, to immediately terminate the fission reaction. In light-water reactors, this is achieved by inserting neutron-absorbing control rods into the core, although the mechanism by which rods are inserted depends on the type of reactor. In PWRs, the control rods are held above a reactor's core by electric motors against both their own weight and a powerful spring. A SCRAM is designed to release the control rods from those motors and allows their weight and the spring to drive them into the reactor core, rapidly halting the nuclear reaction by absorbing liberated neutrons. Another design uses electromagnets to hold the rods suspended, with any cut to the electric current resulting in an immediate and automatic control rod insertion. In BWRs, the control rods are inserted up from underneath the reactor vessel. In this case a hydraulic control unit with a pressurized storage tank provides the force to rapidly insert the control rods upon any interruption of the electric current. In both the PWR and the BWR there are secondary systems (and often even tertiary systems) that will insert control rods in the event that primary rapid insertion does not promptly and fully actuate. In CANDU reactors this is achieved by injecting a neutron poison into the reactor core itself via the EPIS or Emergency Poison Injection System. NS Savannah Liquid neutron absorbers are also used in rapid shutdown systems for light water reactors. Following a SCRAM, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant. Neutron poison solutions are water-based solutions that contain chemicals that absorb neutrons, such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or gadolinium nitrate, causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that are attached to the primary coolant system via valves; a varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators in the event of a failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin. In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS), which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron absorber solution into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails. This concern is especially significant in a BWR, where injection of liquid boron would cause precipitation of solid boron compounds on fuel cladding, which would prevent the reactor from restarting until the boron deposits were removed. In most reactor designs, the routine shutdown procedure also uses a SCRAM to insert the control rods, as it is the most reliable method of completely inserting the control rods, and prevents the possibility of accidentally withdrawing them during or after the shutdown. Reactor response Most neutrons in a reactor are prompt neutrons; that is, neutrons produced directly by a fission reaction. These neutrons move at a high velocity, so they are likely to escape into the moderator before being captured. On average, it takes about 13 μs for the neutrons to be slowed by the moderator enough to facilitate a sustained reaction, which allows the insertion of neutron absorbers to affect the reactor quickly. As a result, once the reactor has been SCRAMed, the reactor power will drop significantly almost instantaneously. However, a small fraction (about 0.65%) of neutrons in a typical power reactor comes from the radioactive decay of a fission product. These delayed neutrons, which are emitted at lower velocities, will limit the rate at which a nuclear reactor will shut down. Due to flaws in its original control rod design, scramming an RBMK reactor could raise reactivity to dangerous levels before lowering it. This was noticed when it caused a power surge at the startup of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Unit number 1, in 1983. In 1986, activating AZ-5 on a distressed RBMK was the final action that precipitated the reactor explosion in the Chernobyl disaster. RBMK reactors were subsequently retrofitted to account for the flaw or decommissioned. Decay heat For a reactor that is SCRAMed after holding a constant power level for an extended period (greater than 100 hrs), about 7% of the steady- state power will remain after initial shutdown due to fission product decay. For a reactor that has not had a constant power history, the exact percentage is determined by the concentrations and half-lives of the individual fission products in the core at the time of the SCRAM. The power produced by decay heat decreases as the fission products decay. Etymology Norman Hilberry (left) and Leó Szilárd at Stagg Field, site of the first self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction. Scram is usually cited as being an acronym for safety control rod axe man; however, the term is probably a backronym. The actual axe man at the first chain-reaction was Norman Hilberry. In a letter to Raymond Murray (January 21, 1981), Hilberry wrote: > When I showed up on the balcony on that December 2, 1942 afternoon, I was > ushered to the balcony rail, handed a well sharpened fireman's axe and told, > \\"If the safety rods fail to operate, cut that manila rope.\\" The safety rods, > needless to say, worked, the rope was not cut... I don't believe I have ever > felt quite as foolish as I did then. ...I did not get the SCRAM [Safety > Control Rod Axe Man] story until many years after the fact. Then one day one > of my fellows who had been on Zinn's construction crew called me Mr. Scram. > I asked him, \\"How come?\\" And then the story. In a May 17, 2011, entry on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's official blog, NRC historian Tom Wellock argues that this account is effectively an urban legend and arose many years after the event. Articles from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) indicate that the term stands for \\"safety cut rope axe man\\", referring in that case to the early neutronic safety mechanism of using a person equipped with an axe to cut the rope suspending the control rods over the Chicago Pile nuclear reactor, at which point the rods would fall by gravity into the reactor core, shutting the reactor down. Specifically, Wallace Koehler, a technician working for the Manhattan Project at Chicago Pile 1, under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, and later a research physicist at ORNL, reportedly said that Enrico Fermi coined the term as this acronym. Although Koehler did not serve as a rope-cutting control rod axe-man, he was responsible for dumping a bucket of aqueous cadmium solution into the reactor if reactor period entered into the sub-optimal range. Leona Marshall Libby, who was present that day at the Chicago Pile, recalledThe Uranium People, Crane, Rusak & Co., 1979 that the term was coined by Volney Wilson who led the team that designed the control rod circuitry: > The safety rods were coated with cadmium foil, and this metal absorbed so > many neutrons that the chain reaction was stopped. Volney Wilson called > these \\"scram\\" rods. He said that the pile had \\"scrammed,\\" the rods had > \\"scrammed\\" into the pile. Control Rod and SCRAM Circuitry for the Chicago Pile-1 Other witnesses that day agreed with Libby's crediting \\"scram\\" to Wilson. Tom Wellock, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's historian wrote that Warren Nyer, a student who worked on assembling the pile, also attributed the word to Wilson: \\"The word arose in a discussion Dr. Wilson, who was head of the instrumentation and controls group, was having with several members of his group,\\" Nyer wrote. \\"The group had decided to have a big button to push to drive in both the control rods and the safety rod. What to label it? 'What do we do after we punch the button?,' someone asked. 'Scram out of here!,' Wilson said. Bill Overbeck, another member of that group said, 'OK I'll label it SCRAM.'\\"Tom Wellock, \\"Putting the Axe to the Scram Myth\\", U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Blog, February 18, 2016. The earliest references to \\"scram\\" among the Chicago Pile team were also associated with Wilson's shutdown circuitry and not Hilberry. In a 1952 U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) report by Enrico Fermi, the AEC declassified information on the Chicago Pile. The report included a section written by Wilson's team shortly after the Chicago Pile achieved a self-sustaining chain reaction on December 2, 1942. It included a wiring schematic of the rod control circuitry with a clearly labeled \\"SCRAM\\" line (see image on left and pages 37 and 48).E.

The brigade landed in Normandy in August 1944 and was given the mission of containing the German-held port of Dunkirk for the rest of the war in Europe. In May 1945, the brigade moved to Czechoslovakia and was absorbed into the Czechoslovak Army. Formation The 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade was created on 1 September 1943, when the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade (itself originally formed as 1st Czechoslovak Mixed Brigade in July 1940 from remnants of the1st Czechoslovak Division serving in the French Army) converted to armour and was renamed the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group (this was often simplified to 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade or abbreviated 1st CIABG). The brigade was under the command of Major General Alois Liška.Nigel Thomas, Foreign Volunteers of the Allied Forces 1939–45, p. 5, London:Osprey Publishing, 1998, . The motorised infantry battalion of the brigade traced its lineage back to Czechoslovak units that had fought in Libya and Lebanon, notably the 11th Infantry Battalion which took part in the defence of Tobruk.Nase noviny - The port of Dunkirk in World War II - The Czechoslovaks at Dunkirk 1944-45 Siege of Dunkirk A Cromwell tank of the Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade at De Panne, Belgium in 1945 The formation continued to train in the UK until the summer of 1944 when, with some 4,000 troops under command, it moved to Normandy, joining 21st Army Group at Falaise on 30 August. On 6 October, the brigade advanced to Dunkirk, northern France, and relieved the 154 (Highland) Infantry Brigade on the eastern side of fortress Dunkirk. The brigade was subordinated to the First Canadian Army, which was responsible for the conduct of the siege. The brigade's tank units were primarily equipped with the Cromwell tank and a number of 17-pounder Sherman tanks (Sherman Firefly), Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tanks and M5 Stuart light tanks. Crusader AA tanks were dispatched with the brigade but believed not to have been used. They were supported by a Motor Battalion in M5 Half-tracks and Universal Carriers, an anti-tank battery of 12 Ordnance QF 17-pounder anti-tank guns and a Field Artillery Regiment of two batteries of Ordnance QF 25 pounder gun-howitzers. The unit was supported by a Reconnaissance Squadron that used Humber Light Reconnaissance Cars, M5 Stuarts, Humber Scout Cars and Cromwell tanks. 1st Brigade spent the remainder of the war at Dunkirk, alternately attacking and being attacked by the energetic German garrison, including a successful major raid on German positions on 28 October 1944, Czechoslovak Independence Day. During that time, the brigade was reinforced by French units formed from local French Forces of the Interior (FFI) troops; on 15 October, these were amalgamated into the 110th FFI Infantry Regiment with two battalions allocated for the Siege of Dunkirk. On 24 January 1945, the 110th FFI Regiment was disbanded, with two its battalions and two other FFI battalions used to re-form the French 51st Infantry Regiment, a unit of the regular army. Various British and Canadian formations also supported the siege at one time or another. In November, the brigade passed from the First Canadian Army to the 21st Army Group. In the spring of 1945, the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was expanded to 5,900 Czechoslovak officers and men, some of whom came from nationals recruited in liberated France and a significant group of a tank battalion, an artillery regiment, a motor transport company and a company of engineers from Czechs and Slovaks forced to serve in the Wehrmacht and who were captured by the Allies in Normandy. Return to Czechoslovakia Kyšice by Plzeň On 23 April, a symbolic 140-men strong unit detached from the troops besieging Dunkirk, led by Major Sítek, joined with the 3rd US Army and raised the Czechoslovak flag on its homeland border crossing on 1 May 1945 at Cheb.Václav Straka, Před Dunkerkem (At Dunkirk), a text in book Z válečného deníku by Ladislav Sitenský, Naše vojsko 1991, , page 278 (in Czech) The Dunkirk garrison did not surrender until after the surrender of Germany, 9 May 1945, when 15,500 German troops and three U-boats were captured by the Czechoslovaks. The brigade then marched to Prague, reaching the city on 18 May 1945, eight days after the arrival of Soviet-sponsored Czechoslovak troops commanded by Ludvík Svoboda.Foreign Volunteers, p. 5.

Elements of this force became the nucleus of what was originally called the \\"Dutch Legion.\\" Veterans of the Princess Irene Brigade who were members of the Dutch Army stationed at Wrottesley Park, Wolverhampton during World War II were given the Freedom of the City of Wolverhampton on 19 August 2006. History Although augmented by conscription from overseas citizens from Canada, the United States, the Middle East, the Dutch West Indies (Netherlands Antilles and Suriname), South Africa and Argentina; the Dutch force grew very slowly as troops were detached for other duties i.e. the Commandos, the Navy etc. The unit never totalled more than about 2,000 men at one time with a total of around 3,000 serving, less than the 3,000 to 4,000 personnel normally associated with a brigade. While some 500 Surinamese volunteered for service in the brigade, they were rejected by the Dutch government, on the grounds that their racial background might cause offense to volunteers and conscripts from South Africa.Buddingh', Hans. De geschiedenis van Suriname. Nieuw Amsterdam, 2012, page 280. Despite this some Surinamese did serve in the Brigade and fight during WW2 (see also page on Brigade's website). Some Dutch West Indian personnel nevertheless later saw action with the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in the Pacific theatre. The brigade would be trained first in Guelph, then Stratford, Ontario alongside British units. On 11 February 1941, by approval of Queen Wilhelmina, the Dutch Legion gained a new name, the Prinses Irene Brigade (P.I.B.). On 6 August 1944, the first troops of the P.I.B landed at Graye-sur-Mer Normandy, in northern France. Later, the main force landed and the P.I.B. served under the First Canadian Army until it moved forward with the British Second Army. Heavy fighting took place around the Chateau St Come (\\"Hellfire Corner\\") and the brigade liberated Pont Audemer in the progress. A Loyd Carrier of the Prinses Irene Brigade, in September 1944. In mid-September, the P.I.B. became involved in fighting with German forces at the town of Beringen. It first re-entered Dutch territory at Borkel en Schaft on 20 September 1944, as part of Operation Market Garden – the operation to simultaneously capture nine bridges between the Bocholt-Herentals Canal and the Rhine (at Arnhem). At around this time, the brigade was also involved in combat against the Dutch Waffen-SS volunteer formation Landstorm Nederland, German SS, and paratroopers. From 26 September, the P.I.B guarded the then unnamed bridge spanning the River Maas at Grave. (The bridge known later as John S. Thompsonbrug, was, at the time, the longest bridge in Europe.) On 24 October, the brigade was ordered to move south-west to Tilburg to attack the town from the south during Operation Pheasant while the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacked from the east. The P.I.B. was unable to get to Tilburg and was stranded at Broekhoven, where fighting took place and four soldiers were killed. The Prinses Irene Brigade spent the winter of 1944/45 in the region of Walcheren and North Beveland (Zeeland), losing several soldiers. From Zeeland, the P.I.B. went back to Noord-Brabant. On 31 March 1945, the commander of the P.I.B., Colonel De Ruyter van Steveninck, said goodbye to the three platoons of Marines; the latter subsequently formed II Independent Company and were sent to the USA to join the Royal Netherlands Marines Brigade, who had originally assigned these troops to the P.I.B. so the brigade would have enough troops participating in the liberation of Europe, as requested by the British government. The gap left by the Dutch Marines was filled with replacements from the volunteers from the liberated parts of the Netherlands, who had been trained at Bergen Op Zoom under the command of Frank Looringh van Beeck, a South African officer. On 2 March 1945, the P.I.B. was put under the command of the Netherlands District, under Major General A Galloway, based at the HQ in the city of Tilburg. Operation \\"Orange\\" The P.I.B. was involved in heavy fighting in the town of Hedel, north of Den Bosch, on the River Maas in April 1945. The P.I.B. was supposed to link up with the 30 Royal Marines, of the 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines, at Kerkdriel in an attempt to liberate the Bommelerwaard. However, the Royal Marines gave up due to German opposition in the town of Kerkdriel, leaving the P.I.B. stranded at the bridgehead of Hedel. The Prinses Irene Brigade was under command of the 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines at this time. Still, they fought the Germans with great gallantry, and were able to hold the town for three days. In these fights, the P.I.B. lost twelve men; around thirty were wounded. Several gallantry medals were later awarded for actions in Hedel. At 11:15 hours on 25 April the order to withdraw from the bridgehead, in Hedel, came from 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines. At 23:30 hours III Independent Company withdrew from the town as the last unit to the south side of the river Maas. This effort was completed at 00:30 hours on 26 April. The Princess Irene Brigade entered The Hague on 9 May 1945 as liberators. After the war, the traditions of the brigade were perpetuated by the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene.

The remains of insects can be detected in an enlarged image. Petrified log at the Petrified Forest National Park Petrified wood (from the Latin root petro meaning \\"rock\\" or \\"stone\\"; literally \\"wood turned into stone\\") is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly a silicate, such as opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material. The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water- saturated sediment or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of Opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest. Elements The outline of cells visible in a segment of petrified wood Elements such as manganese, iron, and copper in the water/mud during the petrification process give petrified wood a variety of color ranges. Pure quartz crystals are colorless, but when contaminants are added to the process the crystals take on a yellow, red, or another tint. Following is a list of contaminating elements and related color hues: * carbon – black * chromium – green/blue * cobalt – green/blue * copper – green/blue * iron oxides – red, brown, and yellow * manganese – pink/orange * manganese oxides – blackish/yellow * silicon dioxide – clear/white/grey Petrified wood can preserve the original structure of the stem in all its detail, down to the microscopic level. Structures such as tree rings and the various tissues are often observed features. Petrified wood is a fossil in which the organic remains have been replaced by minerals in the slow process of being replaced with stone. This petrification process generally results in a quartz chalcedony mineralization. Special rare conditions must be met in order for the fallen stem to be transformed into fossil wood or petrified wood. In general, the fallen plants get buried in an environment free of oxygen (anaerobic environment), which preserves the original plant structure and general appearance. The other conditions include regular access to mineral- rich water in contact with the tissues, replacing the organic plant structure with inorganic minerals. The end result is petrified wood, a plant, with its original basic structure in place, replaced by stone. Uses Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, people began flocking to the mountains and deserts hoping to discover any sort of rock, stone or gem that could be turned into jewelry as a source of income. An assortment of rock was discovered which included petrified woods. \\"Rockhounding\\", as hobbyists would call it, became very popular. Many rock clubs began to establish throughout the United States. Soon after collectors started setting up rock shops where they were able to sell their merchandise to the public. As years went by rockhounders would perfect their craft at making jewelry using all sorts of different techniques, equipment, and molds. Having experience with their craft, first-generation rockhounders would soon teach fellow amateurs their skills.

It was released by Square in North America on October 1, 1995 and in Europe and Australia in February 1996. A Japanese release was planned to follow the North American release by a few months but was ultimately cancelled. The story of Secret of Evermore follows a boy and his pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to the fantasy world of Evermore. The player guides both the boy and his shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history: \\"Prehistoria\\" (prehistory), \\"Antiqua\\" (classical antiquity), \\"Gothica\\" (the Middle Ages), and \\"Omnitopia\\" (an imaginative future world). The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series. Secret of Evermore is unique in that it is the only game developed by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release for its graphics and gameplay but was criticized for not being up to the expectations many reviewers had based upon the developer's previous Japanese role-playing games. The game's North American development, Mana-like game mechanics, and ambient music have since helped it to develop a cult following. Gameplay Secret of Evermore takes many of its interface and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana. The game consists mostly of an aerial view setting, where the boy and his dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. If the boy is selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the game's artificial intelligence, and vice versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment or casting alchemy spells; checking status can be performed quickly by rotating through the game's Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the player's hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0%. It then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons. The protagonist wields four different styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all swords, axes, and spears have four versions. Repeated use of them can increase their skill levels to a maximum of three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. The range and power of each type of weapon increases the more it is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. Most swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation, while some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers. The protagonist haggles with a merchant in Antiqua In the four worlds of Secret of Evermore, the in-game currency changes. The shopkeepers in Prehistoria exchange talons; in Antiqua, gemstones; in Gothica, gold coins; in Omnitopia, credits. There are individuals in each region who offer to convert the player's money to the local currency. In either of the game's two marketplaces (in Antiqua and Gothica, respectively), the storekeepers offer to trade in goods instead of money. Certain goods, such as rice, spices, and tapestries, can be bought using the local currency, but others must be exchanged for other goods. Most vendors only specialize in one type of good, and some rare items require an extensive amount of trading to obtain. Alchemy A unique element of Secret of Evermore is its magic system. To cast magic, the boy must be given an \\"Alchemic Formula\\" by one of the many non-playable characters called \\"Alchemists\\". Some Alchemists make their home in out-of-the-way areas and will dispense rare formulas if the player manages to seek them out. Unlike some role-playing games, there are no magic points needed to cast spells. Alchemy Formulas require pairs of ingredients to be used; some are available throughout the game, and others are only native to certain environments. In the primitive realms, ingredients appear such as wax, limestone, clay, and ash. In the advanced realms, however, the ingredients become more complex, for example ethanol and dry ice. A secondary function of the dog is to \\"sniff out\\" ingredients by putting his nose to the ground and smelling for items. The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time, including in huts and cities. If all goes well, the dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on the map where the player can uncover the unseen ingredients. With repeated use, Alchemy Formulas will increase in level, enhancing their curative, offensive, or support effectiveness. Although there are dozens of Formulas available to be found within the game, only nine can be equipped at a time. To overcome this, there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy's current Alchemy list; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use. Plot=Setting The plot revolves around a teenage boy and his dog whom the player must name. Most of the game takes place in the fictional world of Evermore. The player explores four main areas within this world, corresponding to different historical eras: Prehistoria contains cavemen and dinosaurs; Antiqua boasts a colosseum and pyramid theme; Gothica contains medieval castles and is populated by dragons; Omnitopia is a futuristic space station. Throughout their travels the boy, in the company of his dog, often quotes or mentions fictional B movies that relate to their current situation. For example, he compares himself to \\"Dandy\\" Don Carlisle in the film Sink, Boat, Sink after washing ashore at Crustacia. (For legal reasons, all references to movies and actors were fictional.) In addition, the dog's body transforms based on the theme of the area that players are in: in the world of Prehistoria, the dog is transformed into a feral wolf; in the Antiqua region, he becomes a greyhound; in Gothica, he takes the form of a fancy poodle; and in Omnitopia, he becomes a robotic dog that resembles a toaster and is capable of shooting laser beams. Story The story of Secret of Evermore begins with a black and white flashback to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which causes the area to flood with a white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat on the street. The boy hurriedly follows him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tailcoat greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit. The shuttle crash-lands in a dense jungle on top of a plateau. When the boy emerges, he finds a ferocious-looking beast has replaced his dog. He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf is really his pet dog. He tosses a stick for the wolf to fetch, but the wolf retrieves a giant bone instead. The boy shrugs this off and assumes the beast is his dog. In each realm, the boy encounters a citizen of Podunk involved in an original experiment gone awry 30 years before. Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore but are unable to leave. The boy quickly learns the regions are manifestations of those citizens' personal utopias. Each of the three companions acts as the ruler of his or her world: Elizabeth, the Professor's niece, is the tribal chief of Prehistoria; Horace Highwater, curator of the Podunk Museum, oversees Antiqua; Camellia Bluegarden, a portly librarian, is the Queen of Gothica; Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia, with his android butler, Carltron, alongside him. Within Prehistoria, Antiqua, and Gothica, the boy and his canine companion aid Elizabeth, Horace, and Camellia in thwarting attempts by Podunk citizens' robotic clones from ruling their respective areas. The duo finally returns to Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg, who explains everything. He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches. Ruffleberg outfitted him with an intelligence chip to make him a more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg's help, the boy and his canine companion break into Carltron's room. The area is guarded by android clones of the boy and his dog, along with a giant mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place. With Carltron's defeat, the monsters plaguing Evermore disappear, but the world itself grows unstable. The boy returns to each world to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's destruction is averted, and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying he is not as docile as the professor believes. Development Concept art of the game's protagonist wielding a bone as a weapon In early 1994, the development of Secret of Evermore began at SquareSoft, the Redmond, Washington, office of the Japanese parent company Square. The concept of a boy traveling with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies was dictated from overseas. Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline. This led to popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG. The game's associate producer and writer, George Sinfield, decided they would be familiar to American players. The game's working title was Vex and the Mezmers. Producer Alan Weiss's original concept had a group of magic users who \\"could tell dream stories and transport the listeners into the experience, virtually\\". During a storytelling session, Vex is trapped and starts to corrupt the dreams. The game was to have the player find Vex and defeat him. Sinfield asked for its name to be changed. The studio had a naming competition which resulted in Secret of Evermore; composer Jeremy Soule claims to have been the team member who submitted the name \\"Evermore\\". Many elements of Secret of Evermore were copied from Secret of Mana because they had proven to be effective. The size of the game was an early issue. It was decided that it would be single-player to preserve memory—it was originally planned to be only 12-megabits. However, the game doubled to 24-megabits near the end of development. Daniel Dociu designed various pieces of concept art. Using computer software, including SGI Indy II and Alias workstations, the game's artwork and design were mapped out by three animators, four background artists, and a 3D rendering artist. It was put together using the company's SAGE (Square's Amazing Graphical Editor) program, led by programmer Brian Fehdrau. Rather than having to hand off their work to the programmers, the artists and designers were able to test their ideas directly using the SAGE program. Using another company program, SIGIL (Square Interpreted Game Intelligence Language), Secret of Evermore the final product was produced. One of the worlds that was cut was called Romancia \\"where 'everything is all flowers and sweet stuff, excessively so.' It was pink and purple.\\" There is a persistent misconception that the game is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to Secret of Mana. Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore. Fehdrau explained in an interview that Secret of Evermore was not created in place of Trials of Mana and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff and would otherwise never have been assembled. Several of the team members later joined Humongous Entertainment, which spawned Cavedog Entertainment, while the rest of the team spread to other Seattle-area game studios like Electronic Arts, Boss Game Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Gas Powered Games, among others. Secret of Evermore was released on October 1, 1995, in North America. In 1996, it was translated into German, French and Spanish for the non-English-speaking market in some PAL territories, including Australia and New Zealand. Some PAL versions were packaged in a large box and included a strategy guide. Music Jeremy Soule composed and produced the score for Secret of Evermore—his first video game project. In high school Soule was a big fan of video games, but he felt most of their scores \\"lacked drama and intensity\\". After completing high school, Soule created an experimental demo showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like. Soule was hired by Square Soft after they had reviewed the demo to score Secret of Evermore. Soule describes it as a mix of ambient sounds and low-key music. The soundtrack was released on a CD containing 29 tracks, the first eight of which are arranged versions of the original sound. The disc was published by Square and was only available initially to those who pre-ordered Secret of Evermore. Reception Secret of Evermore received positive reviews from most media outlets. They praised its graphics. Scary Larry of GamePro, however, found the spell animations weak compared to those of other Square games, and said the bosses are large but strangely unimpressive. A highlight for some critics was gameplay, particularly the unique alchemy system and aspects also found in Secret of Mana such as the ring menu. However, others found the mechanics needlessly hard to get used to. Nintendo Power praised the game for its graphics, sound, play control, story, and variety but criticized it for its awkward battle system and simple A.I. Although the quality of the musical compositions and sound effects were praised, Scary Larry complained of the player character's dog barking \\"constantly\\". Super Play and GamePro both felt the game was not up to the standards of other Square games. Victor Lucas of Electric Playground praised the game saying that while it did not reach the heights of Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI, it was still a highly enjoyable experience. Mega Fun argued it was on par with those games, with graphics that were nearly as good. Others argued that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for Next Generation said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, \\"as a debut title for a new team of designers, it points to a rosy future\\". Video Games praised Squaresoft USA's very first title, noting that while the menu and control schemes were taken from previous Square games, its mood, story, and setting were enough to set it apart from the earlier titles. In a retrospective review, Allgame editor Scott Alan Marriott described the game as \\"a good, solid RPG, but those expecting memorable characters or a dramatic, involving story will most likely be disappointed\\". Three reviewers from Gamefan praised the game. Two were skeptical that an American made role playing game could match Square's internally produced titles such as Final Fantasy, but they were impressed with the game. One reviewer, however, noted that he missed the Japanese-style art found in other Square games and although the art in Secret of Evermore was good, it was aimed at an American audience.

Created in February 1942 at Duns in Scotland, it was commanded by Major General Stanisław Maczek and at its peak numbered approximately 18,000 soldiers. The division served in the final phases of the Battle of Normandy in August 1944 during Operation Totalize and the Battle of Chambois and then continued to fight throughout the campaign in Northern Europe, mainly as part of the First Canadian Army. History Map of the route taken by the Division during World War II. Battle of Falaise. Crusader tank of the 1st Armoured Division near Haddington 1943. After the fall of Poland and then France in 1940, the remaining Poles that had fought in both campaigns retreated with the British Army to the United Kingdom. Formation Stationed in Scotland the Polish 1st Armoured Division was formed as part of the Polish I Corps under Wladyslaw Sikorski, which guarded approximately 200 kilometres of British coast in 1940-1941. The commander of the Division, General Stanislaw Maczek, was Poland’s premier mechanized commander, and many of his subordinate officers from the unit he commanded in 1939, the 10th Mechanized Brigade, had made their way to Britain with him. They were organized on the British Armoured Division model, equipped with British uniforms, weapons and tanks. They were initially equipped and trained on Crusader tanks but in late 1943 and early 1944 these were replaced with Sherman tanks and Cromwell tanks. They then participated in war games together with the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Normandy Polish Crusader AA MKII tank of the 1st Polish Armoured Regiment near Caen at the beginning of the Falaise operation. By the end of July 1944, the 1st Armoured had been transferred to Normandy, its final elements arriving on 1 August. The unit was attached to the First Canadian Army as part of the 21st Army Group. This may have been done to help in communication, as the vast majority of Poles did not speak English when they arrived in United Kingdom from 1940 onwards. The Division joined combat on 8 August during Operation Totalize. It twice suffered serious casualties as a result of \\"friendly fire\\" from Allied aircraft, but achieved a victory against the Wehrmacht in the battles for Mont Ormel,The battle: history , Memorial of Coudehard - Montormel and the town of Chambois. This series of offensive and defensive operations came to be known as the Battle of Falaise, in which a large number of German Army and SS divisions were trapped in the Falaise PocketThe battle: August 19th, 1944: the closing of the pocket , Memorial of Coudehard - Montormel and subsequently destroyed. Maczek's division had the crucial role of closing the pocket at the escape route of the trapped German divisions, hence the fighting was desperate and the 2nd Polish Armoured Regiment, 24th Polish Lancers and 10th Dragoons, supported by the 8th and 9th Infantry Battalions, took the brunt of German attacks by units attempting to break free from the pocket. Surrounded and running out of ammunition, they withstood incessant attacks from multiple fleeing panzer divisions for 48 hours until they were relieved (for more read about General Kitching' controversy). The total losses of the division from August 7 when it entered combat until the end of the battle of Falaise on August 22 were 446 killed, 1501 wounded, and 150 missing, or 2097 soldiers in total during about two weeks of fighting. Belgium and the Netherlands After the Allied armies broke out from Normandy, the Polish 1st Armoured Division pursued the Germans along the coast of the English Channel. It liberated, among others, the towns of Saint-Omer, Ypres, Oostnieuwkerke, Roeselare, Tielt, Ruislede, and Ghent. During Operation Pheasant a successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by General Maczek allowed the liberation of the city of Breda without any civilian casualties (29 October 1944). The Division spent the winter of 1944-1945 on the south bank of the river Rhine, guarding a sector around Moerdijk, Netherlands. In early 1945, it was transferred to the province of Overijssel and started to push with the Allies along the Dutch- German border, liberating the eastern parts of the provinces of Drenthe and Groningen including the towns of Emmen, Coevorden and Stadskanaal. German POWs interrogated by a Lieutenant of the 1st Polish Armoured Division during Operation Pheasant, October 1944 Germany In April 1945, the 1st Armoured entered Germany in the area of Emsland. On 6 May, the Division seized the Kriegsmarine naval base in Wilhelmshaven, where General Maczek accepted the capitulation of the fortress, naval base, East Frisian Fleet and more than 10 infantry divisions. There the Division ended the war and, joined by the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, undertook occupation duties until it was disbanded in 1947; it, together with the many Polish displaced persons in the Western occupied territories, formed a Polish enclave at Haren in Germany, which was for a while known as \\"Maczków\\". The majority of its soldiers opted not to return to Poland, which fell under Soviet occupation, preferring instead to remain in exile.The battle: 1-sza Polska Dywizja Pancerna - Organization , Memorial of Coudehard - Montormel Many artefacts and memorabilia belonging to Maczek and the 1st Polish Armoured Division are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.

(July 1, 1954 – May 9, 1989) was an American country music singer. During his career, Whitley only recorded two albums but charted 12 singles on the Billboard country charts, and 7 more after his death. Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Whitley grew up in nearby Sandy Hook, Kentucky. Whitley began his career there in 1970, performing in Ralph Stanley's band. Establishing himself as a lead singer in bluegrass music, Whitley moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1983 and began his recording career there. His first Top 20 Country Hit single, \\"Miami, My Amy\\", was released in 1986. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album Don't Close Your Eyes, the title song, \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\" and \\"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\\" were number one hits. Years of alcoholism severely compromised his health and he died of alcohol intoxication in 1989 at his Goodlettsville home at the age of 34. His later singles, \\"I Wonder Do You Think of Me\\", \\"It Ain't Nothin'\\", and \\"I'm Over You\\", were released after his death. Early life Whitley was born to Faye Ferguson (editor of The Elliott County News) and Elmer Whitley (an electrician) in Ashland, Kentucky, but was raised 46 miles away in Sandy Hook, and attended Sandy Hook High School.Hicks, Jack. – \\"Singer Keith Whitley's Memory Alive Through Songs, Love in Home Town\\". – The Kentucky Post. – September 25, 1991.\\"Country Music Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33\\". – Lexington Herald-Leader. – May 10, 1989.

The Whitley family is of English and Scots-Irish descent and has lived in the Elliot County area since the 1840s. While Whitley was a teenager in Sandy Hook, he and his friends would pass the time drinking bootleg bourbon and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at 120 mph. The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley's neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a 120-foot cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken collar bone.Associated Press – \\"Whitley Just Getting Started Despite 18-Year Music Career\\". – Salina Journal (KS) – Thursday, October 27, 1988. Whitley lost his brother Randy in an October 1983 motorcycle accident, and his father Elmer. Most of his family moved to Texas, along with the musician Justin Fulcher. Musical career Whitley is known for his neotraditional brand of country popularized by hit artists such as George Strait and Randy Travis. In 1969 he performed in a musical contest in Ezel, Kentucky, with brother Dwight on five-string banjo. Ricky Skaggs was also in the contest. Skaggs and Whitley hit it off right away and quickly befriended each other.Rowe, Norman. – Album Echoes Country Classics\\". – Richmond Times- Dispatch. – April 20, 1986 Fifteen-year-old Whitley and 16-year-old Skaggs were discovered in Ft. Gay, West Virginia, by Ralph Stanley who was 45 minutes late for a show due to a flat tire. Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought were the Stanley Brothers playing on a jukebox. However it was Whitley and Skaggs, who \\"sounded just like me and Carter in the early days\\". The two soon joined Ralph's band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974. Whitley also played with J.D. Crowe & the New South in the mid-1970s. During this period, he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell. He moved to Nashville in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with RCA Records. Whitley's first solo album, A Hard Act to Follow, was released in 1984, and featured a more mainstream country style. While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style, the songs he produced were inconsistent. Critics regarded the album as too erratic. Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album, L.A. to Miami. L.A. to Miami, released in 1985, would give him his first Top 20 country hit single, \\"Miami, My Amy\\". The song was followed by three more hit songs: \\"Ten Feet Away\\", \\"Homecoming '63\\", and \\"Hard Livin'\\", The album also included \\"On the Other Hand\\" and \\"Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her\\". \\"On the Other Hand\\" was pitched to Whitley before Randy Travis released the song as a single and when Whitley's version wasn't released as a single, Travis released his in 1986, as did George Strait with \\"Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her\\". During his tour to promote L.A. to Miami, he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer Lorrie Morgan. The pair were married in November 1986, and they had their only child, a son, Jesse Keith Whitley, in June 1987. Whitley also adopted Lorrie's daughter, Morgan, from her first marriage. During the new recording sessions in 1987, Whitley started feeling that the songs he was doing were not up to his standards, so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved. He asked if he could assert himself more with the songs and production. The new album, titled Don't Close Your Eyes, was released in 1988, and the album sold extremely well. The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing, \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\". Also on the album was a remake of Lefty Frizzell's classic standard \\"I Never Go Around Mirrors,\\" and the song became a huge hit at Whitley's concerts. The first three singles from the album—\\"When You Say Nothing at All,\\" \\"I'm No Stranger to the Rain,\\" and the title cut—all reached number one on Billboard Magazine's country charts during the fall of 1988 and the winter of 1989, with the title track \\"Don't Close Your Eyes\\" being ranked as Billboard's No. 1 Country song of 1988. Shortly thereafter, \\"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\\" also earned Whitley his first and only Country Music Association award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male. In early 1989, Whitley approached Sony Music Nashville chairman Joe Galante with the intention of releasing \\"I Never Go Around Mirrors\\" as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called I Wonder Do You Think of Me, and was to result in his next album release. Death On the morning of Tuesday, May 9, 1989, Whitley awoke and had a brief phone call with his mother. He was then visited by his brother-in-law Lane Palmer, and the two had coffee and they were planning a day of golf and having lunch, after which Whitley had planned to start writing songs for Lorrie Morgan and himself to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer departed at approximately 8:30 am,Jinkins, Shirley. – \\"A country music love story of death, drinking and devotion\\". – Fort Worth Star-Telegram. – October 14, 1997. informing Whitley to be ready to leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley unconscious on his bed and called an ambulance. Whitley was pronounced dead at the hospital. The official cause of death was determined to be acute ethanolism (alcohol poisoning), and Davidson County Medical Examiner Charles Harlan stated that his blood alcohol level was 0.47 (the equivalent of 20 1-ounce shots of 100-proof whiskey\\"Alcohol Cuts Short a promising career\\". – Associated Press. – (c/o Salina Journal). – August 10, 1989. and almost five times the then Tennessee level of 0.10 legal driving limit, and nearly six times the current 0.08 legal limit to drive).Edwards, Joe. – \\"Keith Whitley discovered dead – Alcohol overdose cause of death\\". – Austin American-Statesman. – May 10, 1989.\\"Country Singer Keith Whitley, 33\\". – Associated Press. – (c/o Chicago Tribune). – May 10, 1989.Hurst, Jack. – \\"Whitley's Last Days\\". – Chicago Tribune. – May 14, 1989.Green, Barbara. – \\"Whitley Fans Hate 'To See a Good Man Go To Waste\\". – Richmond Times-Dispatch. – May 17, 1989.

The day after his death, Music Row was lined with black ribbons in memory of Whitley. He is buried in the Spring Hill Cemetery outside Nashville, Tennessee. His gravestone reads, \\"Forever yours faithfully\\" (part one) and \\"His being was my reason\\" (part two). The \\"yours\\" in part one means Whitley, and the \\"my\\" in part two means Morgan, who has a future burial spot next to him. Posthumous releases At the time of his death, Whitley had just finished work on his third and final studio album, I Wonder Do You Think of Me. The album was released three months after his death, on August 1, 1989. The album produced two more No. 1 hits, with the title track and \\"It Ain't Nothin'.\\" \\"I'm Over You\\" also saw the Top 5 in early 1990, reaching No. 3. Two new songs were added to \\"Greatest Hits\\": The first, \\"Tell Lorrie I Love Her\\" was written and recorded at home by Whitley for Morgan, originally intended as a work tape for Whitley's friend Curtis 'Mr. Harmony' Young to sing at Whitley's wedding. The second was \\"'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose\\", a 1987 demo taken from Tree that originally featured harmony vocals by childhood friend Ricky Skaggs. Lorrie Morgan, with creative control and license to Whitley's namesake, recorded her voice alongside Whitley's, and released it as a single, which rose to No. 13 and won them 1990's CMA award for Best Vocal Collaboration as well as a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. RCA also released a compilation of performance clips (from his days in the Ralph Stanley-Fronted Clinch Mountain Boys), interviews, and some previously unreleased material under the title \\"Kentucky Bluebird\\". The album produced hits for Whitley as well, including a duet with Earl Thomas Conley, named \\"Brotherly Love,\\" which peaked at No. 2 in late 1991 and gave Whitley his second consecutive posthumous Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. In 1994, Whitley's widow, Lorrie Morgan, organized several of Whitley's friends in bluegrass and some of the big names in country at the time to record a tribute album to Whitley. The album, Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album, was released in September 1994 via BNA. It included covers of Whitley's songs from artists such as Alan Jackson, Diamond Rio, and Ricky Skaggs. The album also included four previously unreleased tracks recorded by Whitley in 1987, one of which had Morgan dubbed in as a duet partner. The album also included two original songs: \\"Little Boy Lost\\", co- written and sung by Daron Norwood, and \\"A Voice Still Rings True\\", a multi- artist song. Alison Krauss's rendition of \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\" was released as a single from the album, reaching number 3 on the country charts in 1995. In 1995, the album Wherever You Are Tonight was released, produced by Lorrie Morgan, featuring restored demos of 1986–1988, with crisper 1990s recording techniques and a full orchestra. The album and single of the same name both did very well on the Billboard and R&R; charts and brought \\"Super Hits\\" and \\"The Essential Keith Whitley\\" in 1996. \\"The Essential\\" contained the remastered and long since unavailable LP and Whitley's debut, the 6-Track \\"A Hard Act to Follow\\", and a scrapped song from 1986's \\"LA to Miami\\", \\"I Wonder Where You Are Tonight\\". In 2004, songwriter Jeff Swope began writing a film treatment for a biographical film concerning Whitley's life and death that was shelved in 2006. On April 13, 2010, he announced that pre-production was set to begin again, pending investors.Mirrors, The Keith Whitley Story – WordPress, April 13, 2010 Several film projects depicting Whitley's life were slated. One idea was a film version of the George Vescey-Lorrie Morgan-penned \\"Forever Yours, Faithfully\\". While Morgan's book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitley's final moments, perhaps the most research went into a project titled \\"Kentucky Bluebird\\", which was to star writer/actor/director David Keith. This project was in development hell for several years, and was halted in late 2006 also, after difficulties with casting and funding.

The term phalloplasty is also occasionally used to refer to penis enlargement. The first phalloplasty done for the purposes of sexual reassignment was performed on Michael Dillon, a trans man, in 1946 by Dr. Harold Gillies, which is documented in Pagan Kennedy's book The First Man-Made Man. History The Russian surgeon Nikolaj Bogoraz performed the first reconstruction of a total penis using rib cartilage in a reconstructed phallus made from a tubed abdominal flap in 1936. The first female to male gender reassignment procedure was performed in 1946 by Sir Harold Gillies on fellow physician Michael Dillon, and his technique remained the standard one for decades. Later improvements in microsurgery made more techniques available. Indications A complete construction or reconstruction of a penis can be performed on patients who: * Have congenital anomalies such as micropenis, epispadias, and hypospadias * Have lost their penis * Are trans men who desire sex reassignment surgery as part of their gender transition. Techniques and related procedures There are different techniques for phalloplasty. Construction of a new penis (sometimes called a neophallus) typically involves taking a tissue flap from a donor site (such as the forearm). Extending the urethra through the length of the neophallus is another goal of phalloplasty.. With all types of phalloplasty in trans men, scrotoplasty can be performed using the labia majora (vulva) to form a scrotum where prosthetic testicles can be inserted. If vaginectomy, hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy have not been performed, they can be done at the same time. Earlier techniques used a bone graft as part of reconstruction. Long- term follow-up studies from Germany and Turkey of more than 10 years proved that these reconstructions maintain their stiffness without later complications. Unfortunately, the reconstructed penis cannot become flaccid again without breaking the internal bone graft. Temporary lengthening can also be gained by a procedure that releases the suspensory ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone, thereby allowing the penis to be advanced toward the outside of the body. The procedure is performed through a discreet horizontal incision located in the pubic region where the pubic hair will help conceal the incision site. However, scar formation can cause the penis to retract. Therefore, the American Urological Association \\"considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious.\\" As of November 2009, there is research in progress to synthesize corpora cavernosa (erectile tissue) in the lab on rabbits for eventual use in patients requiring penile construction surgery. Of the rabbits used in the preliminary studies, 8 of 12 had biological responses to sexual stimuli that were similar to the control, and four caused impregnation.\\"Bioengineered corporal tissue for structural and functional restoration of the penis\\" by Kuo-Liang Chen, Daniel Eberli, James J. Yoo, and Anthony Atala (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 106 No. 45, November 9, 2009)  Penile implants  An inflatable penile implant inserted into corpus cavernosum of the penis Phalloplasty requires an implanted penile prosthesis to achieve an erection. Penile prostheses are implanted devices intended to restore the erectile rigidity in biological men and to build a neophallus (new penis) in trans men. Penile implants were used in phalloplasty surgeries both in cis and trans men since 1970s. There are two main types of penile implants – malleable and inflatable implants. Both types have a pair of cylinders implanted into the penis and replace the non-erectile tissue in biological men and serve as the core for the neophallus in trans men. The cylinder of the inflatable implant is filled with sterile saline solution. Pumping saline into the chambers of this cylinder produces an erection. The glans of the penis, however, remains unaffected. In sex-reassignment surgeries, a new penis is formed with the use of penile implant surrounded with a tissue flap. The pump unit of inflatable penile implants resembles a human testicle and can serve as an artificial testicle for concomitant scrotoplasty. Initially, standard penile implants were used in phalloplasty procedures. However, since there is no corpus cavernosum in the penis undergoing phalloplasty, and the fact that standard penile implants were designed to be implanted in corpus cavernosum, there were many adverse outcomes. Since 2015, Zephyr Surgical Implants proposes malleable and inflatable penile implants particularly designed for phalloplasty surgeries. Implantation procedures are usually done in a separate surgery to allow time for proper healing. Explanation of techniques=Flap from the arm An operation using the forearm as a donor site is the easiest to perform but results in a cosmetically undesirable scar on the exposed area of the arm. Arm function may be hampered if the donor site does not heal properly. Electrolysis and/or laser hair reduction is required for a relatively hairless neophallus. Sometimes a full-scale metoidioplasty is done a few months before the actual phalloplasty to reduce the possibility of complications after phalloplasty. Sensation is retained through the clitoral tissue at the base of the neophallus, and surgeons will often attempt to connect nerves together from the clitoris or nearby. Nerves from the flap and the tissue it has been attached to may eventually connect. This does not necessarily guarantee the ability to achieve genital orgasm after healing, as the most important task of nerve reconnection is to ensure the penis is able to sense injury, but it is rare to lose the ability to orgasm. The following explanation of this technique has many similarities to other approaches, but the construction of the glans differs. * The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the forearm marked for graft size. After the graft is taken, another graft will be used to cover the arm (resulting in a secondary scar). * The graft is dissected to expose the veins and antebrachial cutaneous nerves. (the latter done carefully for later reattachment) * If the urethra is being constructed at the same time as the phallus, it is joined at this step. If not, the glans is shaped. Sometimes glansplasty is done in a separate surgical stage after urethral extension. * A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \\"borrowed\\" to allow easier joining of the graft with the preexisting tissues. * The vein is carefully attached to the femoral artery. * The blood supplies from the graft and the vein leading to the femoral artery are joined. * The clitoral hood and ligament are cut away, and the nerve bundle is isolated for the time being. While this assumes the clitoral tissue is assimilated (buried) into the penis base, some surgeons give the option of leaving it as-is in a post metoidioplasty like state. * The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles. * If the urethra was extended, it is now joined with a catheter that will remain in place for healing purposes for two to four weeks. Otherwise, the skin is sutured up and/or the scrotum is fabricated. Example of completed radial forearm flap phalloplasty with no urethra extension. If the patient chooses to have the urethra extended to the glans of the neophallus, it is formed by the following steps: * The labia minora is injected with a mixture of saline and epinephrine. * It is then split open and layers separated using sharp and blunt dissection. * The layers are wrapped around a catheter and stitched. * A mucosal flap from the vagina may be used to bridge the urethra with the extension. This is often done in a separate procedure. Alternative graft locations include the mouth/cheeks or experimentally, the intestines. If the labia minora is not used during construction of the urethral extension, (or in the chance there is enough material remaining) it can be used during glansplasty to provide for better results compared with a full thickness skin graft. Flap from the side of the chest A relatively new technique involving a flap from the side of the chest under the armpit (known as a musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi free transfer flap) is a step forward in phalloplasty. The advantages of this technique over the older forearm flap technique include: * Hairlessness (little to no electrolysis needed) * Aesthetic appearance of normally colored skin (the glans may be tattooed to proper color) * Capable of tactile sensation (as with any form of phalloplasty, this does not necessarily mean the ability to have a genital orgasm after healing, as the erogenous zone is limited to the base of the penis) * Leaves an inconspicuous scar * Has a lower occurrence of complications from both the initial surgery and the erectile prosthesis insertion The disadvantages include: * Uses a motor nerve so erogenous sensation cannot be achieved, only tactile sensation. * It can pull the nipple to the side causing it to be off the usual location. This is a three-part surgery that takes place over a period of six to nine months. The steps consist of: Neophallus creation using MLD free flap * The surgery starts (after the patient is prepped) with the side of the chest marked for flap size. * The flap is dissected to expose the veins and the thoracodorsal nerves. * The flap, while still attached to the blood supply, is formed to a rough phallus shape by rolling the edges together. * A segment of vein going to the patient's groin is \\"borrowed\\" to allow easier joining of the flap with the preexisting tissues. * The vein is carefully attached to the femoral artery. * The blood supplies from the flap and the vein leading to the femoral artery are joined. * The clitoral hood and ligament are cut away and the nerve bundle is isolated. * The flap is partially attached physically while the surgeon attempts to join the nerve bundles. During initial recovery, the neophallus is protected from contact with other tissues with a specially constructed dressing as to avoid blood supply complications. After three months, urethroplasty (urethral extension) is performed. * The neophallus is dissected and a buccal (oral) mucosa graft inlaid into the created cavity and extended to the native urethra and joined to permanently allow urination while standing * A catheter is placed for several weeks to allow for proper healing After another three to six months, a device that allows an erection can be inserted. Flap from the leg female-to-male sex reassignment prior to glansplasty penis with tissue grafting scar on the left hip The lower leg operation is similar to a forearm flap with the exception that the donor scar is easily covered with a sock and/or pants and hidden from view. Other details are the same as forearm flap, especially the need for permanent hair removal before the operation. A flap from the leg or another area where the scar is less noticeable may be combined with free forearm flap to create the urethral lengthening or to sculpt the glans penis. Pubic area flap The flap location is around the pelvic bone, usually running across the abdomen under the belly button. As such, there is a large horizontal scar that may not be aesthetically acceptable. The flap has a less natural appearance and may not maintain an erectile implant long term. Electrolysis is required before surgery with the alternative being clearing of hair via shaving or chemical depilatory. Gillies technique This technique was pioneered by Sir Harold Delf Gillies as one of the first competent phalloplasty techniques. It was simply a flap of abdominal skin rolled into a tube to simulate a penis, with urethral extension being another section of skin to create a \\"tube within a tube.\\" Early erectile implants consisted of a flexible rod. A later improvement involved the inclusion of a blood supply pedicle which was left in place to prevent tissue death before it was transplanted to the groin. Most latter techniques involve tissues with attached pedicle. Abdominal muscle Skin grafted muscle flaps have fallen from popularity. This procedure is a minimum of 3 steps and involves implantation of an expansion balloon to facilitate the amount of skin needed for grafting. The grafts have a less natural appearance and are less likely to maintain an erectile implant long term. Subcutaneous soft silicone implant This phalloplasty procedure involves the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone implant under the penile skin. No-touch surgical technique This technique for penile prosthesis implantation is a surgical procedure developed by J. Francois Eid for the implantation of a penile implant. Implantation through the use of the \\"No-Touch\\" Technique minimizes the risk of infection. As advancements in the design and manufacturing process of the IPP improved its mechanical survival infection has emerged as the leading cause of implant failure. Although relatively infrequent (varying from .06% to 8.9%) infection of a penile prosthesis results in serious medical consequences for the bearer, requiring complete removal of the device and permanent loss of penile size and anatomy. Bacterial contamination of the device occurs during the surgery, and is caused by allowing direct or indirect contact of the prosthesis with the patient's skin. Over 70% of infections form from skin organisms including Staphylococcus epidermis, aureus, streptococcus and Candida albicans. Traditional strategies to combat infections aim at decreasing skin colony count such as scrubbing skin preparation with alcohol and chlorhexidine or kill bacteria once the implant is contaminated by skin flora such as intravenous antibiotics, antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic-coated implants. The \\"No-Touch\\" technique is unique in that it aims at preventing bacterial contamination of the prosthesis by completely eliminating contact of the device with the skin. Paired with the antibiotic-coated implant, the \\"No Touch\\" Technique decreases infection to a rate of 0.46%, opposing the traditional method which has an infection rate of 5%. The use of an antibiotic-coated implant and a no-touch surgical technique with skin preparation measures and peri-operative antibiotic use has been found to be of high importance in the prevention of infection among penile implants. J. Francois Eid developed his no-touch technique in 2006 on the hypothesis that eliminating any contact between the prosthesis and the skin, either directly or indirectly via surgical instruments or gloves, should reduce the incidence of contamination of the device with skin flora responsible for infection. =Procedure= Three days prior to the procedure, a patient is placed on oral fluoroquinolone, an antibacterial drug. During this time, the patient scrubs their lower abdomen and genitals daily with chlorhexidine soap. On the day of the surgery, Vancomycin and Gentamicin are administered intravenously one to two hours prior to the procedure. The lower abdomen and genitals are shaved, scrubbed for five minutes with a Chlorhexidine sponge and prepped with Chorhexidine/Alcohol applicator. The area is then draped with a surgical drape and a Vi Drape over the genitalia. Before the incision is made, a Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder through the urethra. A 3-cm scrotal incision is made on the penoscrotal raphe and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue to the Buck's fascia. A Scott retractor, a flexible device that holds open the skin of the surgical site, is applied to the area. Up until this stage of the surgery, the process has been consistent with the sanitary practices associated with standard surgical sterility.Richard Pearcy & Raj Persad, publication date unknown, \\"Inflatable penile prosthesis,\\" in BJU International Website Atlas of Surgery and Surgical Devices, see , accessed 31 May 2014 At this stage of the \\"No-Touch\\" Technique, after the incision has been made, all instruments, including surgical gloves that have touched skin are discarded. A loose drape is then deployed over the entire surgical field and secured at the periphery with adhesive strips. A small opening in the drape is then made overlying the incision and yellow hooks utilized to secure the edges of the opening to the edges of the incision, completely covering and isolating the patient's skin. At this point, new instruments and equipment are replaced and the entire prosthesis is inserted through the small opening of the loose drape. The loose drape allows for manipulation of the penis and scrotum required for this procedure without touching the skin. Implantation of the device continues with an incision and dilation of corpora, sizing and placing the penile cylinders, and placement of the pump in the scrotum and the reservoir in the retropubic space. Saline is used throughout the implantation for irrigation. Once the corporotomies are closed and all of the tubing and components of the prosthesis covered with a layer of Buck's fascia, subcutaneous tissues are closed and the \\"No-Touch\\" drape is removed and the skin closed. Future In the future, bioengineering may be used to create fully functional penises. Common complications As phalloplasty has improved over the decades, the risks and complications from surgery have been reduced. However, there is still a possibility of a need for revision surgery to repair incorrect healing. A study of postoperative men showed that on average, 25% had one or more serious complications of the neopenis. The ones reported consisted of: * Loss of the phallus from either disease or blood supply issues * Cephalic vein thrombosis (blood clot) * Arterial ischemia (shortage of blood supply) * Infection * Distal limited necrosis (death of parts of the penis) * Hematoma (bruise) In the same study, chances of complications of the extended urethra were higher, averaging 55%. The most common complications reported were: * Urinary fistula (hole) requiring perineal urethrostomy * Urinary fistula (hole) with conservative treatment * Urinary retention (from stenosis or narrowing of the new urethra) * (Erectile) prosthesis change (from complications) * (Erectile) prosthesis explantation (removal of the prosthesis without replacement) There is also a possibility of fat embolism \\"associated with liposuction and autologous fat transfer, a procedure where fat from liposuction is injected back into the same patient’s face, breast, buttocks or penis\\".

They are known in English as spiny oysters (though they are not, in fact, true oysters). Description Spondylus varius in Mayotte. The many species of Spondylus vary considerably in appearance. They are grouped in the same superfamily as the scallops. They are not closely related to true oysters (family Ostreidae); however, they do share some habits such as cementing themselves to rocks rather than attaching themselves by a byssus. The two halves of their shells are joined with a ball-and-socket type of hinge, rather than with a toothed hinge as is more common in other bivalves. They also still retain vestigial anterior and posterior auricles (\\"ears\\", triangular shell flaps) along the hinge line, a characteristic feature of scallops, though not of oysters. As is the case in all scallops, Spondylus spp. have multiple eyes around the edges of their mantle, and they have relatively well-developed nervous systems. Their nervous ganglia are concentrated in the visceral region, with recognisable optic lobes connected to the eyes. Evolutionary history The genus Spondylus appeared in the Mesozoic era, and is known in the fossil records from the Triassic Cassian beds in Italy (235 to 232 million years ago) onwards. About 40 extinct species are known. Fossil valve of Spondylus crassicosta from the Pliocene of Italy Fossils of these molluscs can be found in fossiliferous marine strata all over the world. For example, they are present in Cretaceaous rocks in the Fort Worth Formation of Texas, and in the Trent River Formation of Vancouver, as well as in other parts of North America.Finsley, Chalres. 1999. A Field Guide to the Fossils of Texas. Gulf Publishing. Lanham, Maryland. plate 55.Ludvigsen, Rolf & Beard, Graham. 1997. West Coast Fossils: A Guide to the Ancient Life of Vancouver Island. pg. 104 Distribution Spiny oysters are found in all subtropical and (especially) tropical seas, usually close to the coasts. Ecology Spondylus are filter feeders. The adults live cemented to hard substrates, a characteristic they share, by convergent evolution, with true oysters and jewel boxes. Like the latter, they are protected by spines and a layer of epibionts and, like the former, they can produce pearls. The type of substrate they use depends on the species: many only attach to coral, and the largest diversity of species is found in tropical coral reefs; others, (particularly S. spinosus) however, easily adapt to man-made structures, and have become important invasive species. Others still are often found attached to other shells, perhaps the most common belonging to the genus Malleus. Uses Archaeological evidence indicates that people in Neolithic Europe were trading the shells of S. gaederopus to make bangles and other ornaments throughout much of the Neolithic period. The main use period appears to have been from around 5350 to 4200 BC. The shells were harvested from the Aegean Sea, but were transported far into the center of the continent. In the LBK and Lengyel cultures, Spondylus shells from the Aegean Sea were worked into bracelets and belt buckles. Over time styles changed with the middle neolithic favouring generally larger barrel-shaped beads and the late neolithic smaller flatter and disk shaped beads. Significant finds of jewelry made from Spondylus shells were made at the Varna Necropolis. During the late Neolithic the use of Spondylus in grave goods appears to have been limited to women and children. S. crassisquama is found off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador and has been important to Andean peoples since pre-Columbian times, serving as both an offering to the Pachamama and as currency.Carter, Benjamin. \\"Spondylus in South American Prehistory\\" in Spondylus in Prehistory: New Data and Approaches. Ed. Fotis Ifantidis and Marianna Nikolaidou. BAR International Series 2216. Oxford: Archaeopress, 2011: 63-89. In fact, much like in Europe, the Spondylus shells also reached far and wide, as pre-Hispanic Ecuadorian peoples traded them with peoples as far north as present-day Mexico and as far south as the central Andes.Shimada, Izumi. “Evolution of Andean Diversity: Regional Formations (500 B.C.E-C.E. 600). The Cambridge History of the Native People of the Americas. Vol. III, pt. 1. Ed. Frank Salomon & Stuart B. Schwartz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999: 350-517, esp. \\"Mesoamerican-Northwest South American Connections\\", pp. 430-436. The Moche people of ancient Peru regarded the sea and animals as sacred; they used Spondylus shells in their art and depicted Spondylus in effigy pots.Katherine Berrin and Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru: Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. Spondylus were also harvested from the Gulf of California and traded to tribes through Mexico and the American Southwest. Even today, there are collectors of Spondylus shells, and a commercial market exists for them. Additionally, some species (especially S. americanus) are sometimes found in the saltwater aquariums. S. limbatus was commonly ground for mortar in Central America, giving raise to its junior synonym, \\"S. calcifer\\". Some Mediterranean species are edible and, in particular S. gaederopus, is commonly consumed in Sardinia. Tropical species, however, tend to bioaccumulate saxitoxin. Species Spondylidae taxonomy has undergone many revisions, mostly due to the fact that identification is traditionally based on the shell only, and this is highly variable. To add to this, while some shallow-water species are extremely common, at least two deep-water ones are known from a single specimen, while a third (S. gravis) was only rediscovered after 77 years. At least another common species (S. regius) has a different shell when it grows in deep water.

It is caused by Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative species of bacterium. Septicemic plague is a life-threatening infection of the blood, most commonly spread by bites from infected fleas. Like some other forms of gram-negative sepsis, septicemic plague can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, and is almost always fatal when untreated. However, it only occurs in a minority of cases of Yersinia infection. It is the rarest of the three plague varieties; the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague.  Signs and symptoms  The usual symptoms are: * Abdominal pain * Bleeding under skin due to blood clotting problems * Bleeding from mouth, nose or rectum * Gastrointestial symptoms, including Nausea, Vomiting, which can be with Blood and Diarrhea * Fever * Chills * Low blood pressure * Organ failure * Shock * Death of tissue (gangrene) causing blackening in extremities, mostly fingers, toes and nose * Difficulty breathing However, septicemic plague may cause death before any symptoms occur. Also, the above symptoms are common to many human illnesses and are not considered diagnostic of any form of plague. Cause= Transmission  Human Yersinia infections most commonly result from the bite of an infected flea or occasionally an infected mammal, but like most bacterial systemic diseases, the disease may be transmitted through an opening in the skin or by inhaling infectious droplets of moisture from sneezes or coughs. In both cases septicemic plague need not be the result, and in particular, not the initial result, but it occasionally happens that bubonic plague for example leads to infection of the blood, and septicemic plague results. If the bacteria happen to enter the bloodstream rather than the lymph or lungs, they multiply in the blood, causing bacteremia and severe sepsis. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where tiny blood clots form throughout the body, commonly resulting in localised ischemic necrosis, tissue death from lack of circulation and perfusion. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, the unclotted blood bleeds into the skin and other organs, leading to red or black patchy rash and to hematemesis (vomiting blood) or hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The rash may cause bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites, usually red, sometimes white in the center. Septicemic plague is caused by horizontal and direct transmission. Horizontal transmission is the transmitting of a disease from one individual to another regardless of blood relation. Direct transmission occurs from close physical contact with individuals, through common air usage, from direct bite from a flea or an infected rodent. Most common rodents may carry the bacteria and so may Leporidae such as rabbits: right Significant carriers of the bacteria in the United States include: * Rats * Prairie dogs * Squirrels * Chipmunks * Rabbits The bacteria are cosmopolitan, mainly in rodents in all continents except Australia and Antarctica. The greatest frequency of human plague infections occur in Africa. The bacteria most commonly appear in rural areas and wherever there is poor sanitation, overcrowding, and high rodent populations in urban areas. Outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or hunting where plague- infected animals may be found, increase the risk of contracting septicemic plague, and so do certain occupations such as veterinary or other animal- related work. Diagnosis A doctor or veterinarian will perform a physical exam which includes asking about the medical history and possible sources of exposure. The following possible test could include: * Blood samples (detecting antibodies) * Culture samples of body fluids (check for the bacteria Yersinia pestis) * Kidney and liver testing * Checking lymphatic system for signs of infection * Examining body fluids for abnormal signs * Checking for swelling * Checking for signs of dehydration * Checking for fever * Checking for lung infection  Prevention  The following steps and precautions should be used to avoid infection of the septicemic plague: * Caregivers of infected patients should wear masks, gloves, goggles and gowns * Take antibiotics if close contact with infected patient has occurred * Use insecticides throughout house * Avoid contact with dead rodents or sick cats * Set traps if mice or rats are present around the house * Do not allow family pets to roam in areas where plague is common * Flea control and treatment for animals (especially rodents) Treatment Starting antibiotics early is a first step in treating septicemic plague in humans. One of the following antibiotics may be used: * Streptomycin * Gentamicin * Tetracycline or Doxycycline * Chloramphenicol * Ciprofloxacin Lymph nodes may require draining and the patient will need close monitoring. In animals, antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline can be used. Intravenous drip may be used to assist in dehydration scenarios. Flea treatment can also be used. In some cases euthanasia may be the best option for treatment and to prevent further spreading.  Prognosis  Untreated septicemic plague is almost always fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent. Death is almost inevitable if treatment is delayed more than about 24 hours, and some people may even die on the same day they present with the disease.  Epidemiology  In 2015, Taylor Gaes, a 16-year-old in Larimer County in northern Colorado, contracted septicemic plague and subsequently died after being bitten by a flea that had bitten a rodent on his family's rural property. Only three people in Colorado had contracted the bacteria in the previous thirty years.  History  Septicemic plague was the least common of the three plague varieties that occurred during the Black Death from 1348 to 1350 (the other two being bubonic plague and pneumonic plague). Like the others, septicemic plague spread from the East through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea. Major port cities such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest. The massive loss of working population in Europe following the Black Death, resulting in increased economic bargaining power of the serf labour force, was a major precipitating factor for the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.  Other animals  Septicemic plague is a zoonosis, a disease that generally is acquired by humans from animals, such as rodents and carnivores. Goats, sheep and camels also may carry the bacteria. Cats rarely develop clinical signs but can be infected. Areas west of the Great Plains of North America are one region where plague-infected animals commonly occur. Plague-infested animals are found in many other countries as well, especially in developing countries where health controls are not effective. Animals that commonly carry plague bacteria are largely rodents and Leporidae, but carnivores sometimes also become infected by their prey. Prey animals are not immune to the disease, and outbreaks of various strains of plague, such as sylvatic plague, have on occasion devastated populations of black-tailed prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets. Plague has been active in black-tailed prairie dog populations since the 1960s. In the United States outbreaks only occur in the western States and they are devastating, with mortality rates near 100% because the animals have no immunity to the plague. Survivors are the ones that happened not to become infected and colonies that recover from a plague outbreak remain at risk. Because black-footed ferrets prey on black- tailed prairie dogs, wild ferret populations also fall victim to sylvatic plague. An outbreak can kill nearly 100% of ferrets in a population, and surviving ferrets commonly face starvation because the prairie dogs are their main prey. Spray-and-vaccinate campaigns have aimed at preventing the spread of the plague among these animals. Similar septicemic problems occurs in many countries across the world, especially in developing countries where spending on health systems is very low and health controls are not effective.

Historically, they were appointed by the British Crown in overseas protectorates (such as Bechuanaland (now Botswana), or colonies (such as South Australia), and some still exist in this capacity. The United States of America once had a resident commissioner in the Philippines and the Puerto Rico resident commissioner resides in Washington DC. State governments of today's Republic of India have a resident commissioner to represent them in New Delhi. The British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations Resident commissioners appointed by the British Crown typically reside in the territorial unit of which they are in charge. This also the case with most otherwise styled commissioners. In certain complex colonial units within the British Empire, the high commissioner to whom was given the highest \\"regional\\" supervision (either residing in one of the constitutive territories, e.g. in the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), first by the governor on Fiji, then from 1952 onwards on the Solomon Islands; or even in a neighbouring colony, e.g. the Governor of the Straits Settlements as High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States) would commonly be represented in territories not comprising his residence by a resident commissioner, though in some places (including some of the Federated Malay States) similar officials were formally styled as residents, a more diplomatic title; otherwise another type of official was also possible (e.g. the British Consul in the protected state of Tonga, a Polynesian kingdom; an administrator on Nauru; a mere chief magistrate on tiny Pitcairn). In some cases his task was comparable to the lieutenant-governor of a minor colony, especially as the high commissioner could be a British colonial governor doubling as such. South Australia South Australia was the only Colony in Australia authorised by an Act of Parliament, the South Australia Act 1834, which set out the requirement for a Governor, representing the Crown, and a Resident Commissioner, reporting to Colonisation Commissioners. The survey and sale of land, as well as migration arrangements and funding, were responsibilities of the Resident Commissioner. The first Resident Commissioner to be appointed was James Hurtle Fisher on 14 July 1836, but when George Gawler was appointed Governor in 1838 to replace John Hindmarsh, he was given the role of Resident Commissioner as well, effective in October 1838. Western Pacific Territories The following territories had resident commissioners: *The British Solomon Islands from 1893 until they got a governor (who also became the high commissioner) in 1952 * The Gilbert and Ellice Islands were administered as a British protectorate by a resident commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), and from 1916 to 1972 as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony; from 1972, the colony had an own governor until the independence of Tuvalu (1978) and Kiribati (1979); * The Union Group protectorate from 1916, (later a separate state called Tokelau) *The Cook Islands, since the 11 June 1901 incorporation into New Zealand (previously there was a British resident). *Niue since 1901 (later under a high commissioner) soon annexed to the dominion of New Zealand (1901-1904 as part of the Cook Islands) see List of resident commissioners of Niue *A special case were the New Hebrides, for these were an Anglo-French colonial condominium, so he had a French colleague styled résident, subordinate to France's haut commissaire (high commissioner) in the Pacific Ocean (from 22 March 1907 the Governor of New Caledonia); both were abolished at the independence of the Republic of Vanuatu in 1980 Southern Africa While the post of High Commissioner for Southern Africa (HCSA) was held 27 January 1847 - 31 May 1910 by the governors of the Cape Colony, then until 6 April 1931 by the governors-general of the Union of South Africa, after that date filled separately until 1963, there have been resident representatives in the constituent territories: *In Bechuanaland Protectorate, after a few deputy and special commissioners, there were resident commissioners since it was made dependent on the HCSA on 9 May 1891; in 1892-1923 there were also two assistant commissioners, for the north and the south respectively. *In the British Swaziland protectorate, since it was dependent on the HCSA in 1902 (before administered through Transvaal, under an administrator); afterwards both got a separate commissioner. *From 18 March 1884 Basutoland became a separate colony, as one of the High Commission Territories, it got its resident commissioner, instead of a Cape government agent (since it became a British protectorate in 1868). The Republic of India In India, a resident commissioner is the representative of the state government with an office in New Delhi, who is also supposed to manage the reception of state government functionaries who visit New Delhi. She/he coordinates with various ministries of the central government, central PSUs, multi-lateral and bilateral agencies and various other organisations on behalf of the state government. she/he is an IAS officer.List of Resident Commissioners of States / UTs, Department of Personnel & Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions The United States of America *The Resident Commissioner of the Philippines held a similar position when the Philippines was a United States territory and then commonwealth.

The position ended with Philippine Independence in 1946. *The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico does not reside there but represents the U.S. commonwealth in the continental United States, particularly in the capital of Washington, DC. The resident commissioner represents Puerto Rico in the United States House of Representatives, where they have a status equivalent to a territorial delegate, as well as before executive departments. *In most other U.S. overseas (and historically pre-state) territories, a similar representative position is styled delegate.

The game was originally intended for the Nintendo 64's DD add-on, but ended up turning into a standard console game after the add-on failed. Using the Transfer Pak accessory that was bundled with the game, players are able to view, organize, store, trade, and battle their own Pokémon uploaded from Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue, and Pokémon Yellow. One of the main focuses of the game is the completion of the four stadium cups, each of which is a series of three-on-three Pokémon battles against an ordered lineup of opponents. Another battle mode called Gym Leader Castle allows battles against the eight Kanto gym leaders and the Elite Four. Other features of Pokémon Stadium include mini-games, versus-style battles, a hall of fame, compatibility with the Game Boy Printer, and a built-in emulation function for Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue, and Pokémon Yellow. Pokémon Stadium went on to become one of the Nintendo 64's best-selling titles, reaching one million copies sold before the end of 2000. Critical reception of the game was mixed, with critics praising the game's visuals but finding fault with the audio quality. A sequel, Pokémon Stadium 2, was released in 2000 as a counterpart for the next-generation Pokémon Gold, Pokémon Silver, and Pokémon Crystal games. Gameplay The player's Dragonite faces off against the opponent's Parasect. Pokémon in this game may be rented or imported from Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow. Unlike the Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow, Pokémon Stadium does not have a storyline or a well-defined world, meaning that it is not considered a role-playing video game. Instead the game challenges the player to defeat trainers at the Stadium, a tournament consisting of 4 \\"Cups\\" and 80 battles in total, as well as the Gym Leader Castle, where the player battles the 8 Kanto Gym Leaders, the Kanto Elite Four, and the Champion. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, a battle against Mewtwo will be unlocked. Defeating Mewtwo unlocks another round of Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Mewtwo battle, but with higher AI difficulty. In Stadium mode, the player is challenged to earn trophies by winning the Pika Cup, Petit Cup, Poké Cup, and Prime Cup, each having its own set of rules and restrictions. In the Poké and Prime Cups, four trophies may be earned, one for each level of difficulty, but the Pika and Petit Cups only award one trophy each. After choosing a Cup to compete in, the player decides on a party of six Pokémon, which may include available rental Pokémon and/or Pokémon imported from a Game Boy cartridge. In each battle, the player and the opponent are only allowed to use three of their six Pokémon. The player wins a trophy after successfully completing all battles in a Cup. If certain conditions are met using imported Pokémon from a Game Boy cartridge, the player will be awarded a Pikachu with the move Surf, which unlocks a mini-game in Pokémon Yellow. In the Gym Leader Castle, the player initially challenges the eight Kanto Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games, followed by the Elite Four, and finally the Champion. Before battling a Gym Leader, however, the player must defeat a gym's three Pokémon trainers. Like in the Stadium, the player has to pick a team of six Pokémon and may only use three at a time for battling. Each time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of eight randomly selected prize Pokémon will be awarded, which can be transferred to the player's Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow game using the Transfer Pak. The prize Pokémon are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, Kabuto, and Omanyte. Other features Pokémon Stadium includes other features, such as mini-games, a Game Boy Tower (a way to play the Game Boy games on the console via emulation), the Victory Palace (a showcase of Pokémon that have been present in the player's team once achieving victory), Oak's Lab (featuring connectivity to the Game Boy titles including a Pokédex), Free Battle (a battle between two players with set rules), Battle Now (a battle with pre-determined teams), and Gallery. The video game can work with a Game Boy Pokémon game cartridge, allowing people to play their Pokemon that are stored on their Game Boy cartridge on their television through the Nintendo 64 console. A player's Pokémon that is on a Game Boy can also be saved to the Nintendo 64 in the video game's lab. The lab area of Pokémon Stadium lets players study each Pokémon's behavior and attacks. Mini-games Nine mini-games are included in Pokémon Stadium, located under Kids Club, and each game allows up to four players. If any of the four player slots are not taken, the computer takes over the excess slots. In \\"Sushi Go-Round\\", the player controls a Lickitung that has to try to eat more expensive sushi than other players. The mini-game \\"Snore War\\" has players control a Drowzee and attempt to put the other Drowzees to sleep by using the move hypnosis. The \\"Rock Harden\\" mini-game requires players to have their Pokémon use the move harden to stop boulders from damaging them. \\"Clefairy Says\\" is a version of the game Simon Says. The player has to press the controller's buttons in the same sequence that is put on the blackboard by the instructor Clefairy. When the sequence is completed successfully, the Clefairy will dance in that sequence. \\"Run, Rattatta, Run\\" has players race against each other as a Rattatta on a treadmill that has walls which pop up throughout the race. The goal is to leap over the walls and to not knock into them. In \\"Ekans' Hoop Hurl\\", the goal is to toss a curved Ekans over Digletts. Each successful toss gives the player points. \\"Dig, Dig, Dig\\" is a race to see which Sandshrew can dig for water the fastest. Development= Pocket Monsters Stadium The first Pocket Monsters' Stadium was released in Japan on August 1, 1998. Once intended as a Nintendo 64DD launch title with a March 1998 release date, it was instead converted to a standard Nintendo 64 game on a 32MB cartridge. Because of technical limitations, this version features only 42 Pokémon that are available for battle, instead of the full 151 Pokémon from the Game Boy versions as originally planned. The remaining Pokémon can be viewed in a Pokémon encyclopedia called the Pokédex, but the models lack the required animations for battle. Connectivity with the Pokémon Game Boy trilogy is available using the Transfer Pak. Hal Laboratory president Satoru Iwata, who would later head Nintendo itself, was the one who managed to port the battle system to work in the Nintendo 64, taking a whole week to read the entire Game Boy source code, and afterwards convert Shigeki Morimoto's programming from the Pokémon games. The game sold a reported 270,000 copies in its first month of release. This version was not released outside Japan, and as such the numbering of the subsequent 2 is ahead of the North American releases. International release On February 16, 1999, Nintendo announced that it would be showing Pokémon Stadium 2 in a Japan-exclusive event called Pokémon Festival '99. Early reviews of the game from Japan's Weekly Famitsu Crew were favorable. Because the first game had met criticism for its difficulty, the AI was toned down for the sequel to make it easier for average players. Released as Pokémon Stadium throughout North America and Europe, this version supports the transfer of all first generation Pokémon to and from Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow via the N64 Transfer Pak. Nintendo also released a limited edition bundle in North America that included Pokémon Stadium, a Transfer Pak, a Nintendo 64 console, two controllers, a poster, the strategy guide by Prima Games, and a \\"Cool Porygon\\" trading card. Reception Pokémon Stadium received mixed reviews from critics. GameSpot contributor Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 5.7 \\"mediocre\\" review, writing that the gameplay \\"feels scaled down and oversimplified, even when compared with the original Game Boy games\\". IGN's Peer Schneider wrote an 8.2 \\"great\\" review of the game, calling it \\"a must-buy for Pokémon fans\\", but also citing that \\"the audio is nowhere near the quality of some of the recent Nintendo releases\\". Regarding the game's announcer, a frequent complaint among critics, RPGamer's Ben Martin wrote that: \\"With a very limited vocabulary and continual comments thoughout [sic] every single action, it certainly is a nice option to be able to turn this guy off\\". In his review on gaming website Cubed3, Ross Morley praised the game's battle system for its \\"beautiful 3D models, special effects and range of options\\". In its first month of sales in North America, Pokémon Stadium sold over one million copies, and it became the best-selling console game in the region during the year 2000. Nintendo of America announced that it would be released as a Player's Choice title, a well-selling game with a lower suggested retail price, on December 26, 2000. Approximately 3.97 million copies have been sold: 3.16 million in the United States, 710,765 in Japan, and 100,000 in the United Kingdom. Sequel Months after its debut, a follow-up to Pokémon Stadium, tentatively titled Pokémon Stadium Gold/Silver, was announced by Nintendo. The game was released in 2000 and 2001 as Pokémon Stadium 2, featuring the 251 Pokémon from the first two generations. Transfer Pak compatibility was included for Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal—as well as Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow.

It has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system for both free and open-source software and proprietary projects and products. Trac integrates with major version control systems including (\\"out of the box\\") Subversion and Git. Trac is used, among others, by the Internet Research Task Force, Django, FFmpeg, jQuery UI, WebKit, 0 A.D., and WordPress. Trac is available on all major operating systems including Windows via Installer or Bitnami, OS X via MacPorts or pkgsrc, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux or FreeBSD, as well as on various cloud hosting services.  History  Inspired by CVSTrac, Jonas Borgström and Daniel Lundin from Edgewall Software started writing svntrac in August 2003 using SQLite and Subversion. In December 2003 they renamed it to Trac. In February 2004 the Trac version was changed first from 0.0.1 to 0.1 and then directly from 0.1 to 0.5. That release was followed in March 2004 by 0.6 and 0.7, and 0.8 in November 2004. Edgewall Software is an umbrella organization for hosting edgewall.org for the community to collaborate on developing open source Python software. It used to offer software development, consulting and support services. Some of the earliest community members to collaborate in the open source development of Trac were Rocky Burt in March 2004, Christopher Lenz and Francois Harvey in May 2004, Christian Boos and Otavio Salvador in December 2004 and Mark Rowe March 2005. In August 2005 the license was changed from the GNU General Public License to a modified BSD license. The first release under this final license was Trac 0.9 in October 2005. It introduced PostgreSQL database support. Trac 0.10, released in September 2006, was an important release that first introduced the component system that to this day allows plugins to extend and add features to Trac's core. Trac itself since this point consists mainly of optional plugin components that can be disabled or replaced entirely. MySQL database support is added as one such core component. This release added support for version control systems other than Subversion by external plugins. Mercurial support was provided through a separate plugin due to its GPL license restrictions. Trac 0.11, released in June 2008, changed the HTML template system from ClearSilver to Genshi, breaking compatibility with many of the older plugins. Trac 0.12 was released in June 2010 and became a stable long term release with the latest point release 0.12.7 from July 2015. It added internationalization and localization support using Babel, and allows using multiple version control repositories at once. Trac 0.13 was never released, and instead was turned into Trac 1.0 in September 2012, the previous stable long term supported version with the latest point release 1.0.13 from September 2016. It included the previously external plugin for Git version control support. Trac 1.1.1 from February 2013 through 1.1.6 from July 2015 are releases without long term support and compatibility guarantees, that turned into Trac 1.2 from November 2016. Trac 1.4 from August 2019 is the current stable release with long term support. It requires Python 2.7 and uses the Jinja template system.  Core features  Trac offers a no-frills approach to project management by deeply integrating ticket tracking, version control (for which multiple repositories per environment are supported), and wiki. It allows hyperlinking information between these systems, include wiki content directly in a ticket or list tickets automatically on wiki pages. The ticket system can be used for tracking bugs, tasks, issues, incidents or any other kind of ticket. Customized reports can be generated from parametric stored SQL queries or using an interactive ticket query system. There is also an integrated search engine and a fine-grained permission system. Additional project management features include grouping tickets into milestones and a roadmap where the milestones and their progress are listed and visualized. The recent activity is shown on a timeline page, and users are notified by email or can subscribe to RSS or iCalendar feeds.  Additional features  Trac has an extensive plugin ecosystem which offers many optional features and integration with external tools, and keeps the core system simple and easy to use. Besides the core SVN and Git support, Trac can connect via plugins to many other version control systems, including: * Bazaar * CVS * Darcs * Mercurial * Monotone * Perforce Other features provided by plugins include: * Account Manager * Multiple project support * Spam-Filtering * Blog plugin * Discussion/Forum plugin * Guestbook plugin * Pastebin plugin * XML-RPC plugin * Tags plugin * Continuous integration plugins  See also  * Comparison of project management software * Comparison of issue-tracking systems * Software configuration management * TracExplorer - Visual Studio and TortoiseSvn Bugtraq Integration * Agilo for Trac is an agile Scrum tool based on Trac. * Apache Bloodhound is built on top of Trac to add multiple projects support, ease of installation and ease of use. * Apache Allura Python based project management software * Kallithea Python based project management software with good code review support * Redmine though developed in Ruby its design was significantly influenced by Trac  References  External links  * Category:Free project management software Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:Free wiki software Category:Bug and issue tracking software Category:Cross-platform free software Category:2003 software Category:Software using the BSD license ","title":"Trac"},{"id":"431202","text":"Oonopidae, also known as goblin spiders, is a family of spiders consisting of over 1,600 described species in about 113 genera worldwide, with total species diversity estimated at 2000 to 2500 species. The type genus of the family is Oonops Keyserling, 1835. Goblin spiders are generally tiny, measuring about 1 to 3 millimeters. Some have scuta, hardened plates on their abdomens. Oonopids usually have six eyes, the anterior median eyes having been lost. However, four-eyed (Opopaea viamao), two-eyed (e.g. Coxapopha, Diblemma) and even completely eyeless species (e.g. Cousinea, the cave-dwelling Blanioonops) are also known. The family is permeated with unusual morphological traits, many of which are limited to males. Examples include heavily modified mouthparts (e.g. Coxapopha, Xyccarph), sternal pouches (sometimes alternatively called holsters; e.g. Grymeus) and extensions of the carapace (e.g. Ferchestina, Unicorn). The male pedipalps are also often highly modified. The genus Opopaea, for example, exhibits an expanded palpal patella while male Ischnothyreus are characterized by completely sclerotized, pitch-black pedipalps. Members of the genus Orchestina are believed to be able to jump, as both sexes have greatly enlarged femora on the fourth leg pair. Oonopidae are seldom seen by people as they are too small to be easily noticed. They are generally found in the leaf litter layer and under rocks, but they also constitute a significant component of the spider fauna living in the canopy of tropical rainforest. Three blind Afrotropical genera (Anophthalmoonops, Caecoonops, Termitoonops) are exclusively found in termite nests. A few species, such as the pantropical Heteroonops spinimanus and Triaeris stenaspis, are thought to be parthenogenetic as no males have yet been collected.  Fossil record  Oonopidae are frequently encountered as subfossils preserved in copals and as fossils preserved in amber. Oonopids even occur in more amber deposits than any other spider family, which may be accounted for by their widespread distribution, small size, and wandering behaviour, as amber appears to be biased towards trapping such spiders. In contrast, sedimentary fossils of Oonopidae are unknown. Most fossil oonopids described from amber are assigned to the extant genus Orchestina. This genus was already widespread by the end of the Cretaceous, as indicated by specimens found in amber dating back approximately 100 million years. This makes Orchestina the oldest extant spider genus along with the Archaeidae. Orchestina's fossil record even includes a pair of spiders that were entombed during copulation.

It carries New York State Route 440 (NY 440) and New Jersey Route 440\\\\. It is the fifth-longest steel arch bridge in the world, and it was the longest in the world at the time of its completion. The bridge is also one of four connecting New Jersey with Staten Island; the other two roadway bridges are the Goethals Bridge in Elizabeth and Outerbridge Crossing (which also carries Route 440) in Perth Amboy, and the rail-only span is the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, all of which cross the Arthur Kill. The original roadway carried two lanes of motor traffic in each direction, as well as a walkway. A project to provide increased clearance required to accommodate New Panamax ships began in 2013. Half of the new roadway was opened to one lane of traffic each northbound and southbound on February 20, 2017, and the second half of the roadway was fully opened on February 11, 2019. The new roadways each carry two lanes of unidirectional motor traffic plus shoulders for disabled vehicles in addition to a separate path for pedestrians and bicyclists, which opened on May 24, 2019. The desired navigational clearance was achieved June 8, 2017. History=Planning and construction The original deck of the Bayonne Bridge In 1921, the Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) was created to oversee transportation in the Port of New York and New Jersey. At the time, bridges in New York City were being built at a brisk pace. Not long after, in 1928, the Port Authority opened its first two bridges between New Jersey and Staten Island: the Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing. There were plans for a third bridge to Staten Island near Bayonne, New Jersey, across the Kill Van Kull. All three bridges were built to complement the traffic from a future fourth bridge or a tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn. Initially, a tunnel was advocated for the third crossing of the Kill van Kull, but a bridge was selected. It was to be designed by Swiss master bridge-builder Othmar Ammann and architect Cass Gilbert, who decided to build parallel to the street networks of both Bayonne and Port Richmond. This required a longer span than if the bridge had been built perpendicular to the Kill Van Kull. Ammann, the master bridge builder and chief architect of the Port Authority, chose the steel arch design after rejecting a cantilever and suspension design as expensive and impractical for the site, given a requirement by the Port Authority that the bridge must be able to accommodate the future addition of rapid transit tracks. The eventual design of the bridge called for a graceful arch that soars above the Kill Van Kull and supports a roadbed long without intermediary piers. Two viaducts at either end of the main span would bring the roadway up to the height of the arch. The Port Richmond viaduct was long and the Bayonne viaduct was long, supported by piers that ranged from tall. The total length of the bridge is with a mid-span clearance above the water of in order to make room for the United States Navy's tallest ships at the time. The arch resembles a parabola, but is made up of 40 linear segments. The design of the steel arch is influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge designed by Ammann's mentor, Gustav Lindenthal. Gilbert had designed an ornamental granite sheathing over the steelwork as part of the original proposal, but as in the case of the George Washington Bridge, the stone sheathing was eliminated in order to lower the cost of the bridge due to material shortages during the Great Depression, leaving the steel trusses exposed on both bridges. It was the first bridge to employ manganese steel for the main arch ribs and rivets. Construction on the bridge began in 1928. At the time, it was supposed to be open in early 1932 and was supposed to cost $16 million (), but it ended up costing only $13 million to build (). The bridge had to be built without blocking shipping traffic on the Kill Van Kull. To do this, engineers used hydraulic jacks to support the two sides of the arch while the two pieces, consisting of prefabricated truss segments that were made up of high-strength alloy steel, were being built toward a point in a middle. Afterward, prefabricated pieces of the roadway's support structure were hung from cables connected to the arch.  Opening  The bridge with its original deck, seen from the North Shore Branch embankment at Nicholas Avenue The Bayonne Bridge opened on November 15, 1931, after dedication ceremonies were held the previous day. On opening day, about 7,000 pedestrians and 17,000 vehicles crossed the bridge. The new crossing was expected to reduce Staten Islanders' average commutes by an average of 18 to 20 minutes, since motorists from the north and east previously had to go to the west side of Staten Island and enter using the Goethals Bridge or Outerbridge Crossing. The Bayonne Bridge's dedication ceremony was attended by David M. Dow, the Secretary for Australia in the United States, and the same pair of golden shears used to cut the ribbon was sent to Australia for the ribbon-cutting of the Sydney Harbour Bridge four months later. After the ceremony in Sydney, the scissor blades were separated and one was sent back to the Port Authority. Time referred to the symmetric detail of the bridge as \\"impressive and haunting,\\" while the commune of Bayonne in France sent a congratulatory telegram. When the Bayonne Bridge opened, it was the longest steel arch bridge in the world, barely surpassing its more massive-arched \\"sister bridge\\" in Australia—the Sydney Harbour Bridge—by and taking the distinction from the Hell Gate Bridge a few miles to the northeast. The American Institute for Steel Construction selected the Bayonne Bridge as the \\"Most Beautiful Steel Bridge\\" in 1931, choosing it over the George Washington Bridge for that status. The Bayonne Bridge has a lightweight design, weighing only , compared to the Sydney Harbour Bridge's . The Bayonne Bridge is also half as wide and shorter than its sister bridge, with its roadway being wide and the arch's highest point being . Between 1939 and 1942, during World War II, the space under the Bayonne Bridge's Staten Island approach became the Archer Daniels Midland Manhattan Project Storage Site, utilized for storing uranium. The material was used in the nuclear weapons developed during the Manhattan Project, and about 2,007 barrels weighing were stored under the bridge. Due to the long half-life and high radioactivity of unrefined uranium ore, the site became highly polluted and was later designated a federal Superfund site. In 1951, twenty years after the bridge opened, the New Jersey tollbooth was re-landscaped by the Port Authority and the City of Bayonne, and in 1956, some land under the New Jersey approach viaduct was set aside to create the Juliette Street Playground. The Bergen Point Ferry, which paralleled the bridge, stayed in service until 1961. A new toll plaza in Staten Island was created in 1964 and made into one-way operation in 1970, with tolls only being collected for vehicles entering the island. The bridge became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1985. It was the longest through arch bridge in the world. Roadbed-raising project The bridge with its original deck, seen at sunset In the 2000s, the Port Authority started planning on a project to allow larger container ships to use the Kill Van Kull. The expansion of the Panama Canal, allowed large ships coming from Asia to reach the East Coast, but the bridge was too low for these larger ships to pass under it on the way to and from Newark Bay. Its clearance of between above the Kill Van Kull depending on the tide already meant that some contemporary ships, which could reach above the waterline, had to fold down antenna masts, take on ballast, or wait for low tide to pass through. New, larger \\"New Panamax\\" ships made things worse. If the problem were not fixed, the Port of New York and New Jersey could have lost significant shipping business to other ports such as Charleston, South Carolina. In August 2009, the Port Authority started a planning analysis to determine how to fix the air draft problem. =Specifications= The Port Authority commissioned the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) to conduct a study of the question, which was completed in 2009, and authorized up to $10 million for planning and engineering services to develop options to deal with the bridge's low clearance. The CoE study looked at three options for the bridge, besides the no-build option. The quickest option they identified, and the one ultimately chosen, was a $1.7 billion project to raise the bridge's roadway to increase its height by 40 percent, which could be accomplished by 2019 at the earliest. It would need a clearance of to handle the new ships. Another option presented was to build a new cable-stayed bridge, which would have cost $2.15 billion and taken until 2022. The most expensive option would be to get rid of the bridge altogether and replace it with either a bored tunnel or an immersed tunnel through which traffic would traverse under the Kill Van Kull. This option would have taken the longest, being complete in 2024 and costing $2.2 to $3 billion. In initial planning documents, a vertical-lift bridge was also considered, but this was not investigated further in the CoE study. Another study, an environmental review by the U.S. Coast Guard, was commissioned in 2009. The review was required because the project would take place over a navigable waterway. The study cost over $2 million, took four years, and resulted in 5,000 pages of reviews. Despite its duration and cost, which precluded the start of construction until 2013, it was one of the Coast Guard's quickest environmental reviews for such a major project. In March 2012, the Port Authority submitted a request to the federal government for an expedited environmental review process, which was approved in July 2012 even though some residents in Newark and Staten Island said they wanted the Coast Guard to conduct a full environmental review. New section in Bayonne New section in Port Richmond According to the Port Authority, the \\"Raise the Roadway\\" project will have many benefits, the first being that it would allow larger, more environmentally friendly ships to pass through the port. As a result of the project, the proportion of the arc above the roadway would be reduced, with only 22 cables suspending the new roadway below the arch as opposed to 30 cables holding up the old roadway. As for the roadway itself, the single roadway would be replaced by two new roadway decks with new supporting piers and approach roads. Route 440 would be widened from one roadway with no shoulders and four lanes, to two roadways with two lanes each, a median divider, and shoulders. There would also be a bikeway and walkway the entire length of the bridge, with access ramps to replace stairs. The design also allows for future transit service such as light rail. Extending the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line to Staten Island over the bridge has been proposed, though final design plans do not include a rapid transit component. Finally, the project would support nearly 2,800 jobs and $240–380 million in wages throughout the construction industry, as well as $1.6 billion of economic activity. The CoE estimated that raising the Bayonne Bridge would produce a $3.3 billion national benefit, noting that 12% of all US international containers pass under the bridge, that the port indirectly creates 269,900 jobs, and that port activity generates $11 billion in annual national wages. The project would allow 12,000-container ships to pass under the bridge, increasing capacity; before the project, the largest ships allowed to pass under the bridge were 9,000-container ships. Congressmen from both New York and New Jersey pressed the Port Authority to act quickly, despite lowered revenues from reduced traffic at the Port Authority's six crossings. The Port Authority announced its official plan in 2011. The Coast Guard held two public meetings about the bridge in 2012. Improvements at Port Jersey on the Upper New York Bay were also underway. =Construction= Late 2016 state, with both old deck and new The Port Authority believed that it was possible to build the new roadway without interrupting traffic flow between Staten Island and Bayonne. In July 2012, the Port Authority announced construction would begin in the middle of 2013, to be completed by 2017. In this timeline, removal of the existing roadway would be completed by late 2015, in time for the opening of the widened Panama Canal. The project would cost $1.7 billion and last five years. One of the challenges faced by the project was the tight confines of the construction area: residential homes lay less than from the work site, though none of them were in the path of the construction itself. In 2014, Staten Islanders living near the Port Richmond work site filed a lawsuit, alleging that the construction work violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by exposing predominately-minority communities in Port Richmond to toxins. In 2015, some Bayonne residents lodged complaints due to excessive noise, vibrations, dust over their neighborhood, and construction debris falling off the bridge (such as paint chips), though the Port Authority later settled those complaints. The project would also necessitate the temporary closure of a park in Bayonne. Additionally, the Bayonne Bridge would remain open to vehicle traffic throughout the construction. On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority's Board of Commissioners awarded a $743.3 million contract to a joint venture of Skanska Koch and Kiewit Infrastructure Company. The bridge's clearance would be raised approximately , from to , with the construction of a new roadway above the existing roadway within the current arch structure. The construction involved building support columns first, then adding prefabricated road segments using a gantry crane that rolled on top of the arch. The gantry crane would construct one rope-supported section of the new roadway at a time, using a temporary beam to support the existing roadway while each rope was replaced. The existing roadway would then be removed. Temporary bridge closures allowed new floor beams to be attached to the arch's ropes in order to support steel stringers that would hold up the new roadway. This work was expedited by Barack Obama's presidential administration due to the importance of the project to national commerce, being one of the first applicants to Obama's \\"We Can't Wait\\" initiative of important infrastructure projects. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also considered the project a high priority for his state. The pedestrian walkway, cantilevered from the western side of the roadway, was temporarily closed on August 5, 2013, for reconstruction. It was to be moved to the eastern side of the bridge. The walkway was scheduled to reopen in 2017. In 2015, the completion date was delayed to 2019, due to unfavorable weather conditions in the winter of 2014–2015. The Port Authority revised its timeline, expecting traffic to be shifted to the new roadway in early 2017, the old roadway to be removed by late 2017, and the project to be completed in mid-2019 with the completion of the roadway for southbound traffic. In November 2016, the future northbound span, intended temporarily for both directions of travel, was completed. A New-Panamax ship, the CMA CGM Theodore Roosevelt, about to transit under the heightened Bayonne Bridge in September 2017 On February 20, 2017, the completed eastern (future northbound) roadway opened for traffic, with one lane in each direction, and the old lower roadway was permanently closed. The western (future southbound) roadway was scheduled to be completed in 2019, at which time there would be two lanes in each direction and a pedestrian walkway. Also on February 20, the Bayonne Bridge became the first Port Authority crossing to use a fully automated and cashless electronic toll collection system. All vehicles proceed without stopping at the toll plaza. Those with E-ZPass are billed in the usual way, while cameras record the license plate numbers of those without an E-ZPass tag and their registered owners soon receive a toll bill by mail.Villanova, Patrick. \\"Bayonne Bridge's new elevated roadway set to open\\", The Jersey Journal, February 17, 2017. Accessed February 17, 2017. \\"A new era for the Bayonne Bridge will begin Monday when the newly constructed elevated roadway on the 85-year-old arch bridge opens to drivers.... Last week, the Port Authority revealed the bridge's new cashless toll on the Staten Island side of the Kill van Kull.... Toll payments will not change for drivers with E-ZPass, but for the less than 10 percent of Bayonne Bridge drivers who do not use E-ZPass, an overhead camera will photograph their vehicle's license plate and a toll bill will be mailed to the registered owner.\\" The desired navigational clearance was achieved June 8, 2017.Project milestones Two years after the opening of the northbound roadway, on February 11, 2019, the new southbound roadway was completed, and the traffic flow of the bridge was restored to two lanes in each direction. The pedestrian and bike path opened May 24, 2019. The overall project received the 2020 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement award from the American Society of Civil Engineers, citing the \\"first-of-its-kind construction sequence, ... keeping both road and sea traffic open.\\" Traffic View of the bridge's original deck from the lower chord From January to November 2016, the Bayonne Bridge carried about 4,500 vehicles per day. The E-ZPass automatic collection system was used by 91% of drivers for toll payment.Port Authority of NY and NJ, 2016 Monthly Traffic and Percent of E‐ZPass Usage, accessed November 5, 2016 In 2011, it carried an average of 19,378 vehicles per day, which dropped to a daily average of 15,221 vehicles in 2014 after construction started, and further to 10,840 in 2015. The Bayonne Bridge is more lightly trafficked than any other Port Authority crossing. In September 2007, MTA Regional Bus Operations began a limited-stop bus route (the S89) that crosses the bridge. The route's termini are the Hylan Boulevard bus terminal in Eltingville, Staten Island and the 34th Street Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Station in Bayonne. This is the first interstate bus service offered by the MTA. Tolls , the cash tolls going from New Jersey to New York are $16 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York-issued E-ZPass users are charged $11.75 for cars and $10.75 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $13.75 for cars and $12.75 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the cash rate. Tolls are collected only for southbound traffic. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for northbound drivers, and at the same time, southbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were changed to eastbound- only at that time. Open-road cashless tolling began on February 20, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries located on the Staten Island side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly. In popular culture The Bayonne Bridge appears in the 2005 science fiction film War of the Worlds, being shown in the background several times in the scenes set in the lead character's Bayonne home; it is destroyed in an attack by aliens.\\"Most liquor licenses? Bumpiest town? Local municipalities hold unusual distinctions,\\" Union City Reporter, August 27, 2006. The bridge and surrounding Bayonne community was also featured in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind and the HBO prison drama Oz.

Typically, it is a net or cloth garment covered in loose strips of burlap (hessian), cloth, or twine, sometimes made to look like leaves and twigs, and optionally augmented with scraps of foliage from the area. Military personnel, police, hunters, and nature photographers may wear a ghillie suit to blend into their surroundings and conceal themselves from enemies or targets. The suit gives the wearer's outline a three-dimensional breakup, rather than a linear one. When manufactured correctly, the suit will move in the wind in the same way as surrounding foliage. Some ghillie suits are made with light and breathable material that allows a person to wear a shirt underneath. A well-made ghillie suit is extremely effective in camouflaging its wearer. A ghillie-suited soldier sitting perfectly still with local flora attached to their webbing is nearly impossible to detect visually, even at close range. However the suit does nothing to prevent thermal detection using technologies such as FLIR. In fact, the warmth of the heavy suit can make a wearer stand out more than a standard soldier when viewed using these methods. Iranian Navy sniper in a ghillie suit  History  Gille is a Scots Gaelic word for a young man or older boy who works as an outdoor servant. \\"Ghillie\\" is a mis-spelling. The term \\"ghillie suit\\" may be a reference to the Gille Dubh (English: black-haired youth or dark-haired lad), an Earth spirit clothed in leaves and moss in Scottish mythology.David Amerland (2017), The Sniper Mind: Eliminate Fear, Deal with Uncertainty, and Make Better Decisions, St. Martin's Press, p. 53, The Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment formed by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat during the Second Boer War, is the first known military unit to use ghillie suits and in 1916 went on to become the British Army's first sniper unit. The Lovat Scouts were initially recruited from Scottish Highland estate workers, especially professional stalkers and gamekeepers.Pegler (2004), S. 129 Similar sniper outfits in the Australian Army are nicknamed \\"yowie suit\\", named for their resemblance to the Yowie, a mythical hominid similar to the Yeti and Bigfoot which is said to live in the Australian wilderness.  Technical and safety considerations  Although highly effective, conventional ghillie suits (made in fabric or 3d leafsuits) are impractical for many situations where camouflage is useful. They tend to be very heavy and hot. Even in moderate climates, the temperature inside the ghillie suit can reach over 50 °C (120 °F). The burlap is also flammable, unless treated with fire retardant, so the wearer may be at increased risk from ignition sources such as smoke grenades or white phosphorus. What is more, conventional ghillie and 3d leafsuits are made using fabric, so they retain water, and this dramatically increases weight. Another impractical side effects is that conventional ghillie suits are not designed to work under IR spectrum, so they are highly detectable using nightvision devices. To enhance safety, the US Army Soldier Systems Center has developed an inherently fire- resistant, self extinguishing fabric to replace the jute or burlap. This material was field tested in late 2007 at the Sniper School at Fort Benning and has been standard issue since June 2008. Civilians have purchased ghillie suits to commit crimes. Police arrested an Australian man after they found that he had assaulted women while wearing such a suit.  References  Further reading  * Kevin Dockery: Stalkers and Shooters: A History of Snipers.

Born in 1892 in Bavaria, Strasser served in World War I in an artillery regiment, rising to the rank of first lieutenant. He joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1920 and quickly became an influential and important figure. In 1923, he took part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and was imprisoned, but released early for political reasons. Strasser joined a revived NSDAP in 1925 and once again established himself as a powerful and dominant member, hugely increasing the party's membership and reputation in northern Germany. Personal and political conflicts with Adolf Hitler led to his death in 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives. Early life Gregor Strasser was born on 31 May 1892 into the family of a Catholic judicial officer who lived in the Upper Bavarian market town of Geisenfeld. He grew up alongside his younger brother Otto, who was considered the more intellectual of the two. He attended the local Gymnasium and after his final examinations, served an apprenticeship as a pharmacist in the Lower Bavarian village of Frontenhausen from 1910 until 1914. World War I When war broke out in Europe in 1914, Strasser suspended his studies at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to enlist as a volunteer in the German Imperial Army. He served in the 1st Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment, rising to the rank of Oberleutnant and winning the Iron Cross of both classes for bravery. In 1918, he resumed his studies at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg. He passed his state examination in 1919 and in 1920, he started work as a pharmacist in Landshut. Paramilitary career In 1919, Strasser and his brother joined the right-wing Freikorps led by Franz Ritter von Epp. The aim of the group was to suppress Communism in Bavaria. He established and commanded the Sturmbataillon Niederbayern (\\"Storm Battalion Lower Bavaria\\"), with the young Heinrich Himmler employed as his adjutant. Strasser was well known for his enormous stature, commanding personality, and his boundless organizational energy. By March 1920, Strasser's Freikorps was ready to participate in the failed Kapp Putsch, whereas his brother Otto had turned to the left of the political spectrum and helped combat this right-wing coup d'état. The Strasser brothers advocated an anti-capitalist social revolutionary course for the NSDAP, which at the same time was also strongly antisemitic and anti-communist. Political career SA officials at a party rally, 1928 Nazi Party activities By 1920, Strasser, and his paramilitary group had joined forces with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party (NSDAP), another far-right political party seated in Munich. During the autumn of 1922, Strasser officially became a member of the NSDAP and the SA. Strasser's leadership qualities were soon recognized and he was appointed as regional head of the Sturmabteilung (\\"Storm Detachment\\"; SA) in Lower Bavaria. In November 1923, he took an active part in the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch, a coup attempt by Hitler and Ludendorff against the Weimar Republic. He was tried with other putschists shortly after Hitler's trial, convicted of aiding and abetting high treason—his actual arrest was for attempting to recruit soldiers for the NSDAP, which had been outlawed—on 12 May and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and a small fine. After a few weeks Strasser was released because he had been elected a member of the Bavarian Landtag for the NSDAP- associated \\"Völkischer Block\\" on 6 April and 4 May (in the Palatinate) 1924, respectively. In December 1924 Strasser won a seat for the \\"völkisch\\" National Socialist Freedom Movement in the Reichstag. He represented the constituency Westphalia North. After the refoundation of the NSDAP by Adolf Hitler on 26 February 1925, Strasser became the first Gauleiter of Lower Bavaria. Because Strasser led up to 2,000 men in Landshut and was overworked, he began looking for an assistant. Heinrich Himmler, who obtained the job, was tasked with expanding the organization in Lower Bavaria. In December 1926, Strasser's Gau merged with that of the Upper Palatinate and Strasser headed the enlarged Gau. After a subsequent partition on 1 October 1928, the Upper Palatinate was taken over by Adolf Wagner while Strasser continued as Gauleiter of Lower Bavaria until 1 March 1929.. Role in NSDAP's national organisation After 1925, Strasser's organizational skills helped transform the NSDAP from a marginal south-German splinter party into a nationwide party with mass appeal. Due to the public-speaking ban issued against Hitler, Strasser had been deputized (by Hitler) to represent the party in the north and speak. Through much of 1925, Strasser took full advantage of his liberties as a member of the Reichstag; using his free railroad passes, he traveled extensively throughout northern and western Germany appointing Gauleiters, setting up party branches, and delivering numerous public speeches. Lacking Hitler's oratorical gifts to move the masses, Strasser's personality alone was nonetheless sufficient to influence an audience. His concerted efforts helped the northern party so much that before the end of 1925, there were some 272 local NSDAP chapters compared to the 71 that existed prior to the failed putsch. Strasser's brand of socialism is discernible from a speech he made to the Reichstag in November 1925: Strasser established the NSDAP in northern and western Germany as a strong political association, one which attained a larger membership than Hitler's southern party section. The party's own foreign organization was also formed on Strasser's initiative. Together with his brother Otto, Strasser founded the Berlin Kampf-Verlag (\\"Combat Publishing\\") in March 1926, which went on to publish the left-leaning weekly newspaper the Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (\\"Berlin Workers Newspaper\\"). Strasser appointed the young university-educated political agitator from the Rhineland, Joseph Goebbels as the managing editor of the Kampfverlag, a man who was drawn to the NSDAP political message and to Strasser himself. The two men drafted a revised version of the NSDAP political program during the winter of 1925–1926, one which leaned much further to the left and unfortunately, incensed Hitler. To deal with these proposed changes head-on, Hitler called for a meeting in the northern Bavarian city of Bamberg. Goebbels and Strasser traveled there hoping to convince Hitler of the new message. During the speech at Bamberg, Hitler lambasted the extreme leftist ideas in the new draft, ideas which he conflated more with Bolshevism, a development which profoundly shocked and disappointed Strasser and Goebbels. Strasser's follow-on speech was bumbled and ineffectual, the result of Hitler's powerful oration; Hitler's refutation of Strasser's policy suggestions at Bamberg demonstrated that the party had officially become Hitler's and the NSDAP centered around him. Placating the northern German NSDAP branches in the wake of Bamberg, Hitler assigned leadership of the SA, which was temporarily vacated by Ernst Roehm, to one of Strasser's own key members, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon. More importantly perhaps, Hitler began a personal campaign to lure away Strasser's chief lieutenant, Goebbels, into his personal fold—a move which proved immediately successful. The future Führer also struck a deal with Strasser to disband the Northern Working Group of the NSDAP and asked him to assume responsibility for the party propaganda department. Strasser accepted this position, but a car accident March 1926 proved a setback: he was bedridden as a result. Upon recovery, he was welcomed back into this position. Thus, in addition to his Gauleiter responsibilities, from 16 September 1926 until 2 January 1928, he was the NSDAP's national leader for propaganda (Reichspropagandaleiter). Strasser left his propaganda post to take up new responsibilities as Chairman of the NSDAP Organizational Committee, later, the Organizational Department (Organisationsableitung). Between 1928–1932, Hitler turned over the NSDAP's national organisational work to Strasser, whose skills were better suited to the task, as Hitler was uninterested in organisational matters and preferred to give his attention to ideological concerns. By June 1932, Strasser was named Reichsorganisationsleiter, and had further centralized the Party's organizational structure under his command. During the course of the reorganisations, Strasser refashioned the NSDAP district boundaries to more closely align with those of the Reichstag and increased the authority of Gauleiters. Strasser reorganised both the party's regional structure and its vertical management hierarchy. The party became a more centralized organization with extensive propaganda mechanisms. In the 1928 General Election on 20 May, Strasser was elected from electoral constituency 26 (Franconia) as one of the first 12 Nazi deputies to the Reichstag. While the NSDAP only received 2.6 per cent of the national vote that year, it became the second largest party in the Reichstag by September 1930, securing 18.3 per cent of the vote. Strasser's organisational strengthening contributed to this success and the Nazis became the largest party in July 1932 with 37.3%. Conflicts with Hitler The Great Depression greatly affected Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new regional daily newspaper in Berlin, the Nationaler Sozialist. Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism. Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \\"pushed to the wall\\". In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser's extreme socialist ideas and appointed Goebbels as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda. When Hitler visited Goebbels on 2 May 1930, Goebbels banned the evening edition of the Nationaler Sozialist. Gregor Strasser distanced himself from his brother and relinquished his position as publisher of the Nationaler Sozialist by the end of June, while Otto left the Party at the beginning of July. In August 1932, Hitler was offered the job of Vice-Chancellor of Germany by then Chancellor Franz von Papen at the behest of President Paul von Hindenburg, but he refused. Strasser urged him to enter a coalition government, but Hitler saw the offer as placing him in a position of \\"playing second fiddle\\". While many in his inner circle, like Goebbels, saw his resistance as heroic, Strasser was frustrated and believed Hitler was wrong to hold out for the Chancellorship. The ideological and personal rivalry with Hitler grew when the successor Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher had discussions with Strasser as to becoming Vice-Chancellor in December 1932. Schleicher hoped to split the NSDAP with Strasser's help, pulling the left wing of the NSDAP to his \\"national conservative\\" side to stop Hitler. Hitler was furious and demanded that Strasser refuse Schleicher's offer. At a meeting of Nazi Reichstag members Hitler confronted the 30-40 that supported Strasser, forcing them to publicly support the former and denounce the latter. Strasser resigned from his party offices on 8 December 1932, just seven weeks before the NSDAP obtained political power. Hitler temporarily took over the post of Reichsorganisationsleiter, eventually turning it over to Robert Ley. On 16 January 1933, Hitler \\"publicly repudiated Strasser\\" for his interactions with Schleicher. In March 1933, Strasser officially exited politics by renouncing his Reichstag seat. Later life=Life after politics Having renounced his seat in the Reichstag, Strasser sought to return to his pre-politics profession as a chemist. Through his own connections and with Hitler's consent he was provided with the opportunity to take up a directorship of Schering- Kahlbaum, a chemical-pharmaceutical company that was the Berlin subsidiary of IG Farben, so long as he promised to cease all political activity, which he did. He detached himself from politics, refusing to meet former political associates and, contrary to some reports, had no contact with his brother Otto's Black Front organisation. Death Having achieved national power in January 1933, Hitler and the NSDAP began eliminating all forms of opposition in Germany. In what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, the entire SA leadership was purged, which took place from 30June to 2July 1934. Hitler, along with other top Nazis such as Hermann Göring and Himmler, targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries, were rounded up, arrested, and shot by members of the Schutzstaffel (SS) and Gestapo. Among them was Strasser. Historian Richard Evans surmises that Strasser was most likely killed for having been allegedly offered a position by the predecessor conservative Weimar government, a tie which made him a potential political enemy, due to the personal enmity of Himmler and Göring, both of whom Strasser had been critical of during his role in the party's leadership. Whether Strasser was killed on Hitler's personal orders is not known. He was shot once in a main artery from behind in his cell, but did not die immediately. On the orders of SS general Reinhard Heydrich, Strasser was left to bleed to death, which took almost an hour. His brother Otto had emigrated in 1933.

Conway was occupied on several university positions and from 1918 to 1931 was a representative of the combined English universities as a conservative member in the House of Commons. In 1872 he took up mountain climbing and went on expeditions to Spitsbergen from 1896 to 1897 and the Bolivian Andes in 1898. He is an author of books on art and exploration, which include Mountain Memories (1920), ′'Art Treasures of Soviet Russia (1925), and Giorgione as a Landscape Painter (1929). Background and education Conway was born at Rochester, England, on 12 April 1856, the son of Reverend William Conway, who later became rector of St. Margaret's, Westminster. He was the youngest of three children having two older sisters, Elizabeth Ann (1852-1916) and Martha (1854-1938). He was educated at Repton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and became a close friend of Karl Pearson. He became interested in woodcuts, engraving and early printed books; his History of the Woodcutters of the Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century was published in 1884. Mountaineering Conway was a member of the Alpine Club, of which he was president from 1902 to 1904. In 1892, in the course of an exploring and mountaineering expedition undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association, he made an ascent of a subsidiary summit of Baltoro Kangri, claiming a world altitude record with a height of 23,000 ft (7,010 m). However, subsequent measurements have revised his height to 22,322 ft (6,804 m). In 1896–97 he explored the interior of Spitsbergen, and the following year he explored and surveyed the Bolivian Andes, climbing \\"Sorata\\" (known today as Ancohuma, 21,086 ft / 6,427 m) and Illimani (21,122 ft / 6,438 m). He also attempted Aconcagua (22,831 ft / 6,959 m) stopping short of the summit by 50-ft and explored Tierra del Fuego making an attempt on Sarmiento. At the Paris exhibition of 1900 he received the gold medal for mountain surveys, and the Founders Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1905. He served as President of the Alpine Club for 1902–04 and became the first president of The Alpine Ski Club at its inaugural meeting in 1908. In 1924, Conway evaluated evidence from the 1924 British Mountaineering Expedition and believed George Mallory and Andrew Irvine had climbed Mt. Everest. Academic career Conway's Karakoram map showing the environs of the Hispar Glacier, based on his 1892 survey From 1884 to 1887 Conway was Professor of Art at University College, Liverpool; and from 1901 to 1904 he was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge University. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts in mapping 5,180 square km of the Karakoram Range in the Himalayas three years earlier. In 1889 he published a book concerning his research on Albrecht Dürer. He was assisted in this by the polymath Lina Eckenstein who was the sister of a fellow mountaineer. Conway was the first Director-General of the Imperial War Museum and a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1922 to 1937.https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp01009/william-martin- conway-1st-baron-conway-of-allington His photograph collection formed the basis of the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. He was also responsible for the restoration of Allington Castle. Political career Conway had been involved in politics for some time, consorting with both major parties allegedly in pursuit of a knighthood and a barony; he received both. He was mentioned as a possible Liberal candidate for Wolverhampton South in early 1900, but withdrew his candidature 'owing to domestic circumstances'. He was elected Unionist Member of Parliament for the Combined English Universities in 1918, serving until 1931, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Conway of Allington, of Allington in the County of Kent, in the Dissolution Honours. He died in London on 19 April 1937. The title became extinct on his death.

They are best known for recording the hit \\"Barbara-Ann\\" in 1958, which was released in 1961 and reached on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. (It was covered by the Beach Boys in 1965 on their album, Beach Boys' Party!; this version when released as a single made .) The Regents also had a second chart hit with \\"Runaround\\", which hit later in 1961. Original members * Ernie Maresca (replaced by Don Jacobucci) * Chuck Fassert (brother of \\"Barbara-Ann\\" author Fred Fassert) * Guy Villari (Gaetano Villari, August 11, 1942, the Bronx, New York – September 21, 2017, Middletown, Orange County, New York) * Sal Cuomo * Tony Gravagna Biography They formed in the Bronx, New York, in 1958. Group members included Guy Villari on lead; Sal Cuomo, first tenor; Chuck Fassert, second tenor; Don Jacobucci, sax player/baritone; Tony Gravagna on bass. An earlier version of the group from 1957 was called The Monterays, and included Villari, Cuomo, Fassert and Ernie Maresca (who later had a hit with \\"Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)\\", and also wrote songs such as the Regents' \\"Runaround\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\" recorded by Dion). The group recorded demos in Bell Sound, Associated, and Regent Sound studios. They were signed to Seville Records as The Desires, however, none of the songs they recorded were released, until the group had success three years later as The Regents. The Regents' name came from a combination of recording a demo at Regent Sound studio, and the fact that Villari smoked Regents cigarettes. In 1958 the group recorded Villari's \\"A Teenager's Love\\". At the same recording session they waxed \\"Barbara-Ann\\" in three takes. Shortly afterwards, Tony Gravagna was installed into the group. Unable to secure a recording contract, they disbanded about a year later. Eddie Jacobucci revived the Regents by accident. His group, the Consorts, lacked original songs for an audition, so they recorded a version of \\"Barbara-Ann\\". The owner of Cousins Records heard the track and decided to release the original version by the Regents. The original group reunited, and Cousins released \\"Barbara-Ann\\" in March 1961. It became a No. 1 record in New York; the demand was such that Cousins leased it to Roulette/Gee for worldwide distribution, and it reached in the Billboard Hot 100. Their follow-up release, \\"Runaround\\", written by Maresca, went to on the pop chart and R&B.; They released two more records for Gee, but after a royalties dispute with the record label, the group broke up. They reformed in 1973 with Villari the only remaining original member. The group enjoyed success in concerts group and toured across the United States. In 1988 they were selected as one of only four \\"oldies\\" groups to appear on the Grammy Awards Show. The Cadillacs, The Flamingos and The Angels were the other three. In 1995 a new group of Regents was formed. Along with Villari, Tony Valitutto, Frank Civatillo and Tony Cacace made up the vocals, while Richard Rogers, Joel DeRuggiero and Sal DiCicco provided the instrumentation. Namesakes A group called The Regents released a gatefold album in 1964 (unusual for rock groups at the time). It was recorded live in Hollywood, California and titled The Regents Live at the A.M.-P.M. Discotheque (Capitol SKAO 2153). Another band by the name of the Regents recorded the song \\"7 Teen\\" in 1979. It reached on the UK Singles Chart. There was another band with the same name (1963–67) from Tacoma, Washington. They were part of the Pacific North West sound of the early 1960s.

Originally it was a fictional US government organization in the novels of author Clive Cussler. Cussler later created and, until his death in 2020, led the actual organization which is dedicated to \\"preserving our maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts.”NUMA at NUMA's website Additionally \\"NUMA does not actively seek private funding. Most of the financial support for the projects comes from the royalties from Clive Cussler’s books.\\"About NUMA at NUMA's website  The fictional NUMA  In the Dirk Pitt series of adventure novels by Clive Cussler that debuted in 1973 with The Mediterranean Caper novel, NUMA is a government organization. The fictional NUMA is devoted to oceanic exploration and investigation, and is the agency employing the main characters in the series of books. Its headquarters is a 30-story building located on the east bank of the Potomac River, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, D.C.. The agency comprises over five thousand employees and scientists that often work around the clock on expeditions. It is often referred to as a marine version of NASA or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an American scientific agency focused on the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere, and has research vessels that conduct many missions that are similar to the actual NUMA. The fictional NUMA is headed by the character Admiral James Sandecker, with Rudi Gunn as second in command, although Dirk Pitt is eventually asked to take over when Sandecker pursues the vice- presidency. Housed inside this headquarters is one of the world's most advanced computer systems which contains almost every known piece of information, both current and ancient, about the sea. The computer center takes up the entire 10th floor but is in an \\"open\\" setting with a raised circular platform that uses a hologram to display an artificial intelligence designed by Hiram Yeager, named Max, at its center. There are no cubicles. Hiram Yeager designed, runs, and maintains the computer lab. Real world organization Clive Cussler founded NUMA as a private non-profit organization in 1979, naming it after a fictional government agency in his series of Dirk Pitt novels. The Sea Hunters Cussler and NUMA have helped produce a television series on underwater exploration called The Sea Hunters, which chronicles the discovery and subsequent removal and conservation of the CSS H. L. Hunley in 1995. The show also features a number of other shipwrecks in various international locations, and on occasion the failure to find anything at all, such as their attempts to find the Holland III prototype submarine. The show features Cussler and James Delgado, who is also an author and executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The show gives an in- depth explanation of the story of the shipwreck NUMA is exploring, including information about the ship's history and how it sank. Two books titled The Sea Hunters were authored by Clive Cussler about NUMA's explorations.

Its main ritual was a dog sacrifice to protect grain fields from disease. Games (ludi) in the form of \\"major and minor\\" races were held.The ludi cursoribus are mentioned in the Fasti Praenestini; see Elaine Fantham, Ovid: Fasti Book IV (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 263. The Robigalia was one of several agricultural festivals in April to celebrate and vitalize the growing season,Mary Beard, J.A. North and S.R.F. Price. Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 45. but the darker sacrificial elements of these occasions are also fraught with anxiety about crop failure and the dependence on divine favor to avert it.Rhiannon Evans, Utopia antiqua: Readings of the Golden Age and Decline at Rome (Routledge, 2008), pp. 185–188. Description The Robigalia was held at the boundary of the Ager Romanus.Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space, p. 234. Verrius Flaccus sites it in a grove (lucus) at the fifth milestone from Rome along the Via Claudia.CIL 12 pp. 236, 316), as cited by Woodard. The celebration included games (ludi) and a sacrificial offering of the blood and entrails of an unweaned puppy (catulus).Columella, De re rustica 10.337–343. Most animal sacrifice in the public religion of ancient Rome resulted in a communal meal and thus involved domestic animals whose flesh was a normal part of the Roman diet;C. Bennett Pascal, \\"October Horse,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 85 (1981), pp. 275–276; general discussion of victims' edibility by Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"Profanus, profanare,\\" in Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion (Brill, 1980), pp. 25–38. the dog occurs as a victim most often in magic and private rites for Hecate and other chthonic deities,David Soren, \\"Hecate and the Infant Cemetery at Poggio Gramignano,\\" in A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), pp. 619–621. but was offered publicly at the LupercaliaPlutarch, Roman Questions 68; Eli Edward Burriss, \\"The Place of the Dog in Superstition as Revealed in Latin Literature,\\" Classical Philology 30 (1935), pp. 34–35. and two other sacrifices pertaining to grain crops.Boyle and Woodard, Ovid: Fasti, p. 255. Origin Like many other aspects of Roman law and religion, the institution of the Robigalia was attributed to the Sabine Numa Pompilius,William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 108; Tertullian, De spectaculis 5. in the eleventh year of his reign as the second king of Rome.Pliny, Natural History 18.285. The combined presence of Numa and the flamen Quirinalis, the high priest of Quirinus, the Sabine god of war who become identified with Mars,Boyle and Woodard, Ovid: Fasti, p. 254; Beard, Religions of Rome, p. 106, note 129; Woodward, Indo-European Sacred Space, p. 136. may suggest a Sabine origin.Franklin, Lupercalia, p. 75. The name Quirinus was supposed to derive from the Sabine town of Cures. In his notes to Aeneid 1.292 and 6.859, Servius says that \\"when Mars rages uncontrolled (saevit), he is called Gradivus; when he is calm (tranquillus), he is called Quirinus.\\" Therefore, since Quirinus is the \\"Mars\\" who presides over peace, his temple is within the city; the temple for the \\"Mars of war\\" is located outside the city limit. The name was also connected to Quirites, Roman civilians, and the civil comitia curiata, in contrast to military personnel and the comitia centuriata. Quirinus was assimilated with the deified Romulus, possibly as late as the Augustan period. See Robert Schilling, \\"Quirinus,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 145. The late Republican scholar Varro says that the Robigalia was named for the god Robigus,Varro, De lingua latina 6.16. who as the numen or personification of agricultural disease could also prevent it.A.M. Franklin, The Lupercalia (New York, 1921), p. 74. He was thus a potentially malignant deity to be propitiated, as Aulus Gellius notes.Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 5.12.14: In istis autem diis, quos placari oportet, uti mala a nobis vel a frugibus natis amoliantur, Auruncus quoque habetur et Robigus (\\"Auruncus and Robigus are also regarded as among those gods whom it is a duty to placate so that they deflect the malign influences away from us or the harvests\\"); Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 234. But the gender of this deity is elusive.In addition to Varro, Verrius Flaccus (CIL 1: 236, 316) and others hold that he is male; Ovid, Columella (see following), Augustine, and Tertullian regard the deity as female. A.J. Boyle and R.D. Woodard, Ovid: Fasti (Penguin Books, 2000), p. 254 online. The agricultural writer Columella gives the name in the feminine as Robigo, like the word used for a form of the disease of wheat rust,Vergil, Georgics 1.151. The 4th-century agricultural writer Palladius devotes a chapter contra nebulas et rubiginem, on preventing miasma and mildew (1.35). which has a reddish or reddish-brown color. Both Robigus and robigo are also found as Rubig- which, following the etymology-by-association of antiquity,Davide Del Bello, Forgotten Paths: Etymology and the Allegorical Mindset (Catholic University of America Press, 2007), passim. was thought to be connected to the color red (ruber) as a form of homeopathic or sympathetic magic.Burriss, \\"The Place of the Dog in Superstition, pp. 34–35. The color is thematic: the disease was red, the requisite puppies (or sometimes bitches) had a red coat,Fowler, Roman Festivals, pp. 90–91. the red of blood recalls the distinctively Roman incarnation of Mars as both a god of agriculture and bloodshed.This dual function of Mars, contradictory perhaps to the 21st-century mind, may not have seemed so to the Romans: \\"In early Rome agriculture and military activity were closely bound up, in the sense that the Roman farmer was also a soldier (and a voter as well)\\": Beard, Religions of Rome, pp. 47–48 online and 53. See also Evans, Utopia antiqua, p. 188 online. William Warde Fowler, whose work on Roman festivals remains a standard reference,William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 89. entertained the idea that Robigus is an \\"indigitation\\" of Mars, that is, a name to be used in a prayer formulary to fix the local action of the invoked god.Precise naming, in connection with concealing a deity's true name to monopolize his or her power, was a crucial part of prayer in antiquity, as evidenced not only in the traditional religions of Greece and Rome and syncretistic Hellenistic religion and mystery cult, but also in Judaism, ancient Egyptian religion, and later Christianity. See Matthias Klinghardt, “Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,” Numen 46 (1999) 1–5; A.A. Barb, \\"Antaura. The Mermaid and the Devil's Grandmother: A Lecture,\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 29 (1966), p. 4; Karen Hartnup, On the Beliefs of the Greeks: Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy (Brill, 2004), pp. 97–101 online (in connection with compelling demons). Augustine of Hippo derided the proliferation of divinities as a turba minutorum deorum, \\"a mob of mini-gods\\" (De civitate Dei 4.9, dea Robigo among them at 4.21); see W.R. Johnson, \\"The Return of Tutunus,\\" Arethusa (1992) 173–179. See also indigitamenta. In support of this idea, the priest who presided was the flamen Quirinalis, and the ludi were held for both Mars and Robigo.Tertullian, De spectaculis 5: Numa Pompilius Marti et Robigini fecit (\\"Numa Pompilius established [games] for Mars and Robigo\\"). The flamen recited a prayer that Ovid quotes at length in the Fasti, his six-book calendar poem on Roman holidays which provides the most extended, though problematic, description of the day.Ovid, Fasti 4.905–942; Boyle and Woodard, Ovid: Fasti, pp. 254–255 et passim on the nature of this work. Other observances Chariot races (ludi cursoribus) were held in honor of Mars and Robigo on this day.Fasti Praenestini; Tertullian, De spectaculis 5; Fantham, Ovid: Fasti Book IV, p. 263. The races had two classes, \\"major and minor,\\" which may represent junior and senior divisions. In chariot racing, younger drivers seem to have gained experience with a two-horse chariot (biga) before graduating to a four- horse team (quadriga).Jean-Paul Thuillier, \\"Le cirrus et la barbe. Questions d'iconographie athlétique romaine,\\" Mélanges de l'École française de Rome Antiquité 110.1 (1998), p. 377. Other horse and chariot races in honor of Mars occurred at the Equirria and before the sacrifice of the October Horse. Calendar context A section of the Fasti Praenestini, with the entry on the \\"Feast of Robigo\\" at bottom right (\\"ROB\\"). The Fasti Praenestini also record that on the same day the festival celebrated a particular class of sex workers: \\"pimped-out boys,\\"Pueri lenonii, boys managed by a leno, pimp. following the previous day's recognition of meretrices, female prostitutes regarded as professionals of some standing.Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 32 online. Other April festivals related to farming were the Cerealia, or festival of Ceres, lasting for several days in mid-month; the Fordicidia on April 15, when a pregnant cow was sacrificed; the Parilia on April 21 to ensure healthy flocks; and the Vinalia, a wine festival on April 23.Beard, Religions of Rome, p. 45. Varro considered these and the Robigalia, along with the Great Mother's Megalensia late in the month, the \\"original\\" Roman holidays in April.Varro, De lingua latina 6.15–16; Fantham, Fasti, p. 29. The Robigalia has been connected to the Christian feast of Rogation, which was concerned with purifying and blessing the parish and fields and which took the place of the Robigalia on April 25 of the Christian calendar.Daniel T. Reff, Plagues, Priests, and Demons: Sacred Narratives and the Rise of Christianity in the Old World and the New (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 100. The Church Father Tertullian mocks the goddess Robigo as \\"made up,\\" a fiction.Tertullian, De spectaculis 5 (nam et robiginis deam finxerunt, \\"you see, they even make up a goddess of wheat disease\\"); Woodward, Indo-European Sacred Space, p. 136.

Construction Bainbridge was laid down on 15 August 1899, by Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company at their shipyard in Philadelphia, as one of nine ships built to a design by the US Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair. Although the name-ship of her class, Bainbridge was not the first ship of the class to be laid down or completed. Bainbridge was launched on 27 August 1901. She was placed in reserve commission at Philadelphia on 24 November 1902, with Lieutenant G. W. Williams in command, and towed to Norfolk, Virginia. She was placed in full commission on 12 February 1903. The cost for the hull and machinery was $283,000. The Bainbridge-class design was intended to combine high speed with improved seaworthiness, and had a raised forecastle instead of the \\"turtleback\\" forecastle common in European designs. The hull was long overall and between the perpendiculars, with a beam of and a mean draft of . Design displacement was and full load, although all ships of the class, including Bainbridge were overweight, with Bainbridge displacing full load when completed. Bainbridge was powered by triple expansion steam engines rated at , fed by four Thornycroft boilers which raised steam at . Design speed was , she reached a speed of during sea trials. Four funnels were fitted. Armament consisted of two /50 caliber guns, five 6-pounder () guns and two torpedo tubes. Service history=First commissioning Assigned to the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, she spent the next three months completing trials and outfitting. On 1 June 1903, her flotilla made the trip to Annapolis, Maryland, where it became part of the North Atlantic Fleet's recently formed Coast Squadron. A week later, Bainbridge left Annapolis with the Flotilla and the Coast Squadron and headed south to Newport News, Virginia. The destroyer and her traveling companions set out on 18 June for a summer of drills and exercises in New England waters. Those evolutions consisted of a search problem followed by joint maneuvers with units of the Army, most of which took place along the coast of Maine. Detached from the Coast Squadron on 26 September 1903, the 1st Torpedo Flotilla returned to Hampton Roads to fit out for service on the Asiatic Station. Following weeks of preparation, Bainbridge stood out of Chesapeake Bay and headed south with the rest of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla and on 12 December 1903. After stops in South Carolina at Charleston and Parris Island, the little convoy arrived at Key West, Florida, on 18 December. The auxiliary cruiser relieved Baltimore as the flotilla's escort for the remainder of the journey to the Far East. Transfer to the Far East Setting out on 23 December 1903, the flotilla proceeded by way of Puerto Rico and the Canary Islands to Gibraltar where it arrived on 27 January 1904. Resuming the voyage on 31 January, the warships stopped at Algiers for a week in early February. On 9 February, they arrived at Valletta, Malta, where the flotilla and Buffalo had to lay over for a fortnight while went into dry dock to have her propellers repaired after damaging them while mooring. Transiting the Suez Canal on 26 February, the flotilla stayed at Port Suez, Egypt, until the 29th when it headed down the Red Sea to Aden. In March, Bainbridge and her companions visited Bombay, India, and Colombo, Ceylon. They made the last stop before reaching their destination, a port call at Singapore, between 3 and 9 April. The flotilla then made the relatively short final leg of the voyage, from Singapore to Cavite in the Philippines, on 9 April 1904. Far East duty Their successful completion of the four-month voyage from the east coast to the Orient did much to prove torpedo-boat destroyers capable of extended operations at sea with the fleet. The manner in which she and her colleagues served on the Asiatic Station, alternating between duty in Chinese waters and service in the Philippines, further substantiated their utility and hinted at their ultimate versatility. Less than seven weeks after arriving in the Philippines, Bainbridge led the flotilla, she wore the flotilla commander's flag, out of Manila Bay on its way to its first tour of duty in China. The warships spent June and early July at Hong Kong, making the passage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on 11 July. For the rest of the summer, Bainbridge and the other destroyers joined the Asiatic Fleet's Battleship Squadron in gun and torpedo drills off the Chinese coast and spent much time showing the flag in Chinese ports. The latter employment, supporting American diplomatic presence in China, had taken on an increasing importance as the Imperial Chinese government's effectiveness degenerated in the course of the nineteenth century and during the early years of the twentieth century. Foreign governments felt compelled to send naval forces to provide protection for their nationals conducting all sorts of business in China but then used this need as a pretext to extort quasi-colonial concessions from the prostrate nation. As a result, the Great Powers entered into a fierce competition for political and economic advantage in China. Bainbridge and her flotilla-mates served as a part of American diplomacy's effort both to maintain Chinese sovereignty and to keep access open to American interests in China. Russo- Japanese War This, her first, tour of duty in China coincided with one of the several occasions when the friction over benefits in China created enough heat to burst into the flames of war. Earlier in the year, war between Japan and Russia began with Japan's attack on the Russian squadron at Port Arthur. Unable to bottle the Russian ships up securely in Port Arthur or to lure them out to their destruction, the Japanese set about investing their base. After several months, the siege forced the Russian squadron to attempt the run to Vladivostok on 10 August 1904. Japanese mines sank or damaged several Russian ships; and, in the ensuing confusion, some Russian ships were separated from the main body before it retired back into Port Arthur to its ultimate doom. Thus, Bainbridge found herself at Shanghai when , one of the refugees from Admiral Vitgeft's squadron, sought sanctuary there. When her pursuers sent a destroyer into the Yangtze to reconnoiter Askold, Rear Admiral Yates Stirling dispatched Bainbridge to deter the probe and to discourage a repetition of the high-handed Japanese behavior at Chefoo where they had violated international law by seizing another refugee from Vitgeft's squadron after she had interned herself in the neutral port. The ploy succeeded. The Japanese chose to allow Askold to intern herself, and the Russian commander wisely did so. Following that incident, Bainbridge spent another two months in Chinese waters before departing Shanghai on 4 October. She and her flotilla-mates then passed three weeks at Hong Kong before resuming the voyage to the Philippines on 26 October. The destroyer reached Cavite on 28 October and spent the remainder of 1904 and the first few weeks of 1905 engaged in local operations, mostly torpedo drills and gunnery practice. In March 1905, Bainbridge and the destroyer flotilla left the Philippines with the Battleship Squadron for dry docking in Hong Kong. She returned to Manila with those units early in April, and the destroyers received orders to head \\"south to patrol the coast of Palawan and the waters north of Borneo....\\" These orders came in response to reports that Russian Rear Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's Baltic Fleet had finally set sail after a three-month layover at Madagascar to complete its voyage to join the war in the Far East. Bainbridge and her colleagues spent the next few months guarding the American Philippines against neutrality violations by the Russians and the Japanese. This danger effectively evaporated with the nearly complete destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet by Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 and 28 May. \\"Show the flag\\" - China 1905–1906 On 1 July 1905, Bainbridge stood out of Manila Bay with the flotilla to accompany the battleship and cruiser squadrons on the annual northern redeployment to conduct summer exercises and to \\"show the flag\\" in Chinese waters. The first portion of the normal summer drills and port visits went off as usual; but, early in August, China displayed another burst of nationalism when a boycott was organized in response to the Chinese exclusion policy then in effect on the American west coast. Initially, this brought little disruption to the Asiatic Fleet's routine. The warships carried out their exercises and visited Chinese ports as usual. The destroyers even returned south to the Philippines in October according to custom. Only then came the break with normal routine. Instead of passing the winter months in the Philippines, Bainbridge and Barry spent just six weeks there before returning north to China late in November after President Theodore Roosevelt chose to brandish the \\"Big Stick\\". The mission lasted through the winter with the destroyers joining other ships of the Asiatic Fleet in repeated calls at Chinese ports in a vigorous display of the naval might of the United States. By the spring of 1906, the Chinese national feeling against the United States had subsided so that, though Bainbridge and Barry remained in Chinese waters and continued to \\"show the flag,\\" they were also able to resume many of the normal training evolutions more typical of their annual summer sojourns in Chinese waters. Her stay in northern waters thus continued through the summer and into the fall. At the end of September, Bainbridge and Barry left Chefoo, China, in company with to return to the Philippines for the first time since the previous fall. After stopping off at Amoy, China, from 3 to 8 October, the warships arrived back at Cavite on the 10th. First decommissioning On 9 January 1907, Bainbridge was placed out of commission at the Cavite Navy Yard to undergo repairs to her machinery. Problems with the boilers in the new destroyers had been reported as early as 1905 when the Asiatic Fleet commander's report alluded to the need to retube them as soon as circumstances allowed. The repairs appear to have staggered, no doubt to allow some of the flotilla to remain active and possibly because of limited yard facilities. Three of them; , and had been out of commission at Cavite since early December 1905. Presumably, Bainbridges decommissioning date had been arranged to nearly coincide with Chaunceys return to active duty on 12 January 1907. Bainbridge remained out of service at Cavite for nearly 14 months before being recommissioned on 2 April 1908, Ens. Joseph V. Ogan in command. Second commissioning − Xinhai Revolution For three years after her return to active service, the warship carried out a normal routine for Asiatic Fleet destroyers unburdened by extraordinary diplomatic demands. This meant drilling and patrolling in the Philippines each winter followed by exercises conducted in Chinese waters in the summer. Near the end of the 1911 summer cruise, however, events transpired to upset this pattern. Disturbances in China in September and early October 1911 led to an anti-Manchu revolt which grew into the revolution that toppled the dynasty in 1912. This sequence of events kept Bainbridge and the other destroyers from returning to the Philippines from north China in the fall of 1911. Instead, they remained in Chinese waters, where they were soon joined by every available Asiatic Fleet ship, to protect Americans and their interests in China through the winter and into the spring of 1912. Second decommissioning Still, by the spring of 1912, the remarkable restraint that both factions in the struggle for power in China displayed toward foreign lives and rights allowed much of the recently assembled foreign naval might to stand down. Accordingly, though some of her sisters stayed on station in the Yangtze River, Bainbridge headed back to the Philippines. Her return coincided with, and may have been caused in part by, a widespread manpower shortage that forced a number of torpedo boats and destroyers into a form of caretaker status. Upon her return from China, Bainbridge was placed in reserve on 24 April 1912. Third commissioning USS Bainbridge (Destroyer # 1) Ship's officers and men pose on a pier, alongside Bainbridge, 1914–1916, while she was serving in Asiatic waters. Note life rings and neatly arranged line. Bainbridge remained in this semi-active state for almost a year, resuming full active duty on 1 April 1913, with Lieutenant (junior grade), later Admiral, Raymond A. Spruance in command. Though she became fully active once again, complications on the international scene still held her back from the old comfortable routine. In mid-April, the diplomatic crisis over the California Alien Land Law of 1913 arose with Japan and forestalled the usual summer deployment to Chinese waters. Instead, Bainbridge and the rest of the flotilla stayed close by Luzon as part of the defenses for Manila Bay in the event of a war. The situation eased considerably by the end of May, but the destroyers kept close to their Philippine base all during the summer and fall of 1913 and through the winter of 1913 and 1914. Circumstances seemed to change later because Bainbridge and her division mates sailed off on the familiar cruise to north China in the summer of 1914. That tour of duty, however, did not signal a return to the schedule of old but, instead, proved to be the last of those regular summer journeys north in the Far East. In 1915, Bainbridge made a short deployment to Shanghai but it came late in the fall, November and December, rather than in the summer and it was her last visit to China. She and her sisters spent all of 1916 patrolling in the Philippines and continued so engaged during the first three months of 1917. Even the entry of the United States into World War I in the spring of 1917, which found Bainbridge moored at Cebu in the southern islands, did not disrupt her schedule of Philippine operations immediately. Only in mid-summer 1917 did orders arrive sending her and her sisters to duty in European waters. World War I On 1 August 1917, Bainbridge stood out of Cavite with the rest of her division and embarked on the long voyage to Europe. She steamed by way of Borneo, Singapore, Ceylon, and India, making extended pauses at Columbo, Ceylon, where the division had to wait for Barry to repair a damaged propeller, and at Bombay, India, before reaching the southern terminus of the Suez Canal on 23 September. The division transited the canal on 25 September arriving at Port Said, Egypt, early in the afternoon. After a week at Port Said, Bainbridge headed across the Mediterranean with the division. Although they had yet to reach their base of operations, the destroyers really began their war service upon entering the Mediterranean Sea where German and Austro-Hungarian submarines based on the Dalmatian coast were highly active. Bainbridge, in fact, claimed her only submarine contact just a week after departing Port Said on her way to Gibraltar. She had steamed with the division to Malta, arriving in Valletta on 6 October and leaving again the following day escorting some ships to Naples. On the 8th, her lookouts spied a U-boat on the surface stalking one of her charges, SS Camilla Rickmers, and Bainbridge charged to the attack. Before she could close the target to within gun range, however, the submarine submerged and escaped. On the 9th, Bainbridge and her division mates saw the merchant ships safely into Naples where they stood down for almost a week. She and her colleagues stood out of Naples on the last leg of their voyage on 15 October and reached their new base at Gibraltar on the 20th. The warship served nine months in the European war zone based at Gibraltar escorting Allied shipping into and out of the Mediterranean Sea and between various points on the western Mediterranean littoral. On 15 July 1918, Bainbridge departed Gibraltar in company with to return to the United States. Sailing by way of the Azores and Bermuda, the two warships reached Charleston, S.C., on 3 August. She operated out of Charleston, carrying out a variety of patrol and escort missions, until 27 November when she set out for Boston. The destroyer served along the northeastern coast until the summer of 1919. Final decommissioning and fate On 3 July 1919, Bainbridge was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1919. She was sold to Joseph G. Hitner, of Philadelphia, on 3 January 1920 for conversion to mercantile service as a fruit carrier.

The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. The name is associated especially with the Tenthredinoidea, by far the largest superfamily in the suborder, with about 7,000 known species; in the entire suborder, there are 8,000 described species in more than 800 genera. Symphyta is paraphyletic, consisting of several basal groups within the order Hymenoptera, each one rooted inside the previous group, ending with the Apocrita which are not sawflies. The primary distinction between sawflies and the Apocrita – the ants, bees, and wasps – is that the adults lack a \\"wasp waist\\", and instead have a broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax. Some sawflies are Batesian mimics of wasps and bees, and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger. Sawflies vary in length, most measuring ; the largest known sawfly measured . The larvae are caterpillar-like, but can be distinguished by the number of prolegs and the absence of crochets in sawfly larvae. The great majority of sawflies are plant-eating, though the members of the superfamily Orussoidea are parasitic. Predators include birds, insects and small animals. The larvae of some species have anti-predator adaptations such as regurgitating irritating liquid and clustering together for safety in numbers. Sawflies are hosts to many parasitoids, most of which are Hymenoptera, the rest being Diptera. Adult sawflies are short-lived, with a life expectancy of 7–9 days, though the larval stage can last from months to years, depending on the species. Parthenogenetic females, which do not need to mate to produce fertilised eggs, are common in the suborder, though many species have males. The adults feed on pollen, nectar, honeydew, sap, other insects, including hemolymph of the larvae hosts; they have mouth pieces adapted to these types of feeding. Sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female uses her ovipositor to drill into plant material (or, in the case of Orussoidea, other insects) and then lays eggs in groups called rafts or pods. After hatching, larvae feed on plants, often in groups. As they approach adulthood, the larvae seek a protected spot to pupate, typically in bark or the soil. Large populations of species such as the pine sawfly can cause substantial damage to economic forestry, while others such as the iris sawfly are major pests in horticulture. Outbreaks of sawfly larvae can defoliate trees and may cause dieback, stunting or death. Sawflies can be controlled through the use of insecticides, natural predators and parasites, or mechanical methods. Sawflies first appeared 250 million years ago in the Triassic. The oldest superfamily, the Xyeloidea, has existed into the present. Over 200 million years ago, a lineage of sawflies evolved a parasitoid lifestyle, with carnivorous larvae that ate the eggs or larvae of other insects. Sawflies are distributed globally, though they are more diverse in the northern hemisphere. Etymology Sawfly laying eggs in a plant, using the serrated saw-like ovipositor for which the group is named The suborder name \\"Symphyta\\" derives from the Greek word symphyton, meaning \\"grown together\\", referring to the group's distinctive lack of a wasp waist between prostomium and peristomium. Its common name, \\"sawfly\\", derives from the saw-like ovipositor that is used for egg-laying, in which a female makes a slit in either a stem or plant leaf to deposit the eggs. The first known use of this name was in 1773. Sawflies are also known as \\"wood-wasps\\". Phylogeny Carl Gerstäcker established the suborder Symphyta In his original description of Hymenoptera in 1863, German zoologist Carl Gerstäcker divided them into three groups, Hymenoptera aculeata, Hymenoptera apocrita and Hymenoptera phytophaga. But four years later in 1867, he described just two groups, H. apocrita syn. genuina and H. symphyta syn. phytophaga. Consequently, the name Symphyta is given to Gerstäcker as the zoological authority. In his description, Gerstäcker distinguished the two groups by the transfer of the first abdominal segment to the thorax in the Apocrita, compared to the Symphyta. Consequently, there are only eight dorsal half segments in the Apocrita, against nine in the Symphyta. The larvae are distinguished in a similar way. The Symphyta have therefore traditionally been considered, alongside the Apocrita, to form one of two suborders of Hymenoptera. Symphyta are the more primitive group, with comparatively complete venation, larvae that are largely phytophagous, and without a \\"wasp-waist\\", a symplesiomorphic feature. Together, the Symphyta make up less than 10% of hymenopteran species. While the terms sawfly and Symphyta have been used synonymously, the Symphyta have also been divided into three groups, true sawflies (phyllophaga), woodwasps or xylophaga (Siricidae), and Orussidae. The three groupings have been distinguished by the true sawflies' ventral serrated or saw-like ovipositor for sawing holes in vegetation to deposit eggs, while the woodwasp ovipositor penetrates wood and the Orussidae behave as external parasitoids of wood-boring beetles. The woodwasps themselves are a paraphyletic ancestral grade. Despite these limitations, the terms have utility and are common in the literature. While most hymenopteran superfamilies are monophyletic, as is Hymenoptera, the Symphyta has long been seen to be paraphyletic. Cladistic methods and molecular phylogenetics are improving the understanding of relationships between the superfamilies, resulting in revisions at the level of superfamily and family. The Symphyta are the most primitive (basal) taxa within the Hymenoptera (some going back 250 million years), and one of the taxa within the Symphyta gave rise to the monophyletic suborder Apocrita (wasps, bees, and ants). In cladistic analyses the Orussoidea are consistently the sister group to the Apocrita. The oldest unambiguous sawfly fossils date back to the Middle or Late Triassic. These fossils, from the family Xyelidae, are the oldest of all Hymenoptera. One fossil, Archexyela ipswichensis from Queensland is between 205.6 and 221.5 million years of age, making it among the oldest of all sawfly fossils. More Xyelid fossils have been discovered from the Middle Jurassic and the Cretaceous, but the family was less diverse then than during the Mesozoic and Tertiary. The subfamily Xyelinae were plentiful during these time periods, in which Tertiary faunas were dominated by the tribe Xyelini; these are indicative of a humid and warm climate. The cladogram is based on Schulmeister 2003.  Taxonomy  There are approximately 8,000 species of sawfly in more than 800 genera, although new species continue to be discovered. However, earlier studies indicated that 10,000 species grouped into about 1,000 genera were known. Early phylogenies such as that of Alexandr Rasnitsyn, based on morphology and behaviour, identified nine clades which did not reflect the historical superfamilies. Such classifications were replaced by those using molecular methods, starting with Dowton and Austin (1994). As of 2013, the Symphyta are treated as nine superfamilies (one extinct) and 25 families. Most sawflies belong to the Tenthredinoidea superfamily, with about 7,000 species worldwide. Tenthredinoidea has six families, of which Tenthredinidae is by far the largest with some 5,500 species.

It does not sting. Many species of sawfly have retained their ancestral attributes throughout time, specifically their plant- eating habits, wing veins and the unmodified abdomen, where the first two segments appear like the succeeding segments. The absence of the narrow wasp waist distinguishes sawflies from other members of hymenoptera, although some are Batesian mimics with coloration similar to wasps and bees, and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger. Most sawflies are stubby and soft- bodied, and fly weakly. Sawflies vary in length: Urocerus gigas, which can be mistaken as a wasp due to its black-and-yellow striped body, can grow up to in length, but among the largest sawflies ever discovered was Hoplitolyda duolunica from the Mesozoic, with a body length of and a wingspan of . The smaller species only reach lengths of . The European hornet is a wasp-waisted Apocritan with a sting, not a Symphytan. Heads of sawflies vary in size, shape and sturdiness, as well as the positions of the eyes and antennae. They are characterised in four head types: open head, maxapontal head, closed head and genapontal head. The open head is simplistic, whereas all the other heads are derived. The head is also hypognathous, meaning that the lower mouthparts are directed downwards. When in use, the mouthparts may be directed forwards, but this is only caused when the sawfly swings its entire head forward in a pendulum motion. Unlike most primitive insects, the sutures (rigid joints between two or more hard elements on an organism) and sclerites (hardened body parts) are obsolescent or absent. The clypeus (a sclerite that makes up an insects \\"face\\") is not divided into a pre- and postclypeus, but rather separated from the front. The antennal sclerites are fused with the surrounding head capsule, but these are sometimes separated by a suture. The number of segments in the antennae vary from six in the Accorduleceridae to 30 or more in the Pamphiliidae. The compound eyes are large with a number of facets, and there are three ocelli between the dorsal portions of the compound eyes. The tentorium comprises the whole inner skeleton of the head. Three segments make up the thorax: the mesothorax, metathorax and prothorax, as well as the exoskeletal plates that connect with these segments. The legs have spurs on their fourth segments, the tibiae. Sawflies have two pairs of translucent wings. The fore and hind wings are locked together with hooks. Parallel development in sawfly wings is most frequent in the anal veins. In all sawflies, 2A & 3A tend to fuse with the first anal vein. This occurs in several families including Argidae, Diprionidae and Cimbicidae. Aposematically coloured caterpillar-like larva of Abia sericea The larvae of sawflies are easily mistaken for lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars). However, several morphological differences can distinguish the two: while both larvae share three pairs of thoracic legs and an apical pair of abdominal prolegs, lepidopteran caterpillars have four pairs of prolegs on abdominal segments 3-6 while sawfly larvae have five pairs of prolegs located on abdominal segments 2–6; crochets are present on lepidopteran larvae, whereas on sawfly larvae they are not; the prolegs of both larvae gradually disappear by the time they burrow into the ground, therefore making it difficult to distinguish the two; and sawfly larvae only have a single pair of minute eyes, whereas lepidopteran larvae have four to six eyes on each side of the head. Sawfly larvae behave like lepidopteran larvae, walking about and eating foliage. Some groups have larvae that are eyeless and almost legless; these larvae make tunnels in plant tissues including wood. Many species of sawfly larvae are strikingly coloured, exhibiting colour combinations such as black and white while others are black and yellow. This is a warning colouration because some larvae can secrete irritating fluids from glands located on their undersides.  Distribution  Sawflies are widely distributed throughout the world. The largest family, the Tenthredinidae, with some 5,000 species, are found on all continents except Antarctica, though they are most abundant and diverse in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere; they are absent from New Zealand and there are few of them in Australia. The next largest family, the Argidae, with some 800 species, is also worldwide, but is commonest in the tropics, especially in Africa, where they feed on woody and herbaceous angiosperms. Of the other families, the Blasticotomidae and Megalodontidae are Palearctic; the Xyelidae, Pamphilidae, Diprionidae, Cimbicidae, and Cephidae are Holarctic, while the Siricidae are mainly Holarctic with some tropical species. The parasitic Orussidae are found worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The wood-boring Xiphydriidae are worldwide, but most species live in the subtropical parts of Asia. Behaviour and ecology Rose stem sawfly (Hartigia trimaculata) larva in a rose stem Sawflies are mostly herbivores, feeding on plants that have a high concentration of chemical defences. These insects are either resistant to the chemical substances, or they avoid areas of the plant that have high concentrations of chemicals. The larvae primarily feed in groups; they are folivores, eating plants and fruits on native trees and shrubs, though some are parasitic. However, this is not always the case; Monterey pine sawfly (Itycorsia) larvae are solitary web-spinners that feed on Monterey pine trees inside a silken web. The adults feed on pollen and nectar. Anti-predator adaptation: spitfire sawfly larvae grouped together for safety in numbers Sawflies are eaten by a wide variety of predators. While many birds find the larvae distasteful, some such as the currawong (Strepera) and stonechats (Saxicola) eat both adults and larvae. The larvae are an important food source for the chicks of several birds, including partridges. Sawfly and moth larvae form one third of the diet of nestling corn buntings (Emberiza calandra), with sawfly larvae being eaten more frequently on cool days. Black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) chicks show a strong preference for sawfly larvae. Sawfly larvae formed 43% of the diet of chestnut-backed chickadees (Poecile rufescens). Small carnivorous mammals such as the masked shrew (Sorex cinereus), the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) predate heavily on sawfly cocoons. Insects such as ants and certain species of predatory wasps (Vespula vulgaris) eat adult sawflies and the larvae, as do lizards and frogs. Pardalotes, honeyeaters and fantails (Rhipidura) occasionally consume laid eggs, and several species of beetle larvae prey on the pupae. The larvae have several anti-predator adaptations. While adults are unable to sting, the larvae of species such as the spitfire sawfly regurgitate a distasteful irritating liquid, which makes predators such as ants avoid the larvae. In some species, the larvae cluster together, reducing their chances of being killed, and in some cases form together with their heads pointing outwards or tap their abdomens up and down. Some adults bear black and yellow markings that mimic wasps. Parasites Parasitoidal chalcid wasps (Dahlbominus fuscipennis (sv)) emerging from a sawfly cocoon Sawflies are hosts to many parasitoids, most of which are parasitic Hymenoptera; more than 40 species are known to attack them. However, information regarding these species is minimal, and fewer than 10 of these species actually cause a significant impact on sawfly populations. Many of these species attack their hosts in the grass or in other parasitoids. Well known and important parasitoids include Braconidae, Eulophidae and Ichneumonidae wasps. Braconid wasps attack sawflies in many regions throughout the world, in which they are ectoparasitoids, meaning that the larvae live and feed outside of the hosts body; braconids have more of an impact on sawfly populations in the New World than they do in the Old World, possibly due to no known ichneumonid parasitoids living in North America. Some braconid wasps that attack sawflies include Bracon cephi, B. lisogaster, B. terabeila and Heteropilus cephi. Female braconids locate sawfly larvae through the vibrations they produce when feeding, followed by inserting the ovipostior and paralysing the larva before laying eggs inside the host. These eggs hatch inside the larva within a few days, where they feed on the host. The entire host's body may be consumed by the braconid larvae, except for the head capsule and epidermis. The larvae complete their development within two or three weeks. Ten species of wasps in the family Ichneumonidae attack sawfly populations, although these species are usually rare. The most important parasitoids in this family are species in the genus Collyria. Unlike Braconid wasps, the larvae are endoparasitoids, meaning that the larvae live and feed inside the hosts body. One well known Ichneumonid is Collyria coxator, which is a dominant parasitoid of C. pygmaeus. Recorded parasitism rates in Europe are between 20 – 76%, and as many as eight eggs can be found in a single larva, but only one Collyria individual will emerge from its host. The larva may remain inside of their host until spring, where it emerges and pupates. Several species in the family Eulophidae attack sawflies, although their impact is low. Two species in the genus Pediobius have been studied; the two species are internal larval parasitoids and have only been found in the northern hemisphere. Parasitism of sawflies by Eulophids in grass exceeds 50%, but only 5% in wheat. It is unknown as to why the attack rate in wheat is low. Furthermore, some fungal and bacterial diseases are known to infect eggs and pupa in warm wet weather. Outbreaks of certain sawfly species, such as Diprion polytomum, have led scientists to investigate and possibly collect their natural enemies to control them. Parasites of D. polytomum have been extensively investigated, showing that 31 species of hymenopterous and dipterous parasites attack it. These parasites have been used in successful biological control against pest sawflies, including Cephus cinctus throughout the 1930s and 1950s and C. pygmaeus in the 1930s and 1940s. Life cycle and reproduction Adult male newly emerged from its cocoon Like all other hymenopteran insects, sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. Many species are parthenogenetic, meaning that females do not need fertilization to create viable eggs. Unfertilized eggs develop as male, while fertilized eggs develop into females (arrhenotoky). The lifespan of an individual sawfly is two months to two years, though the adult life stage is often very short (approximately 7 – 9 days), only long enough for the females to lay their eggs. The female uses its ovipositor to drill into plant material to lay her eggs (though the family Orussoidea lay their eggs in other insects). Plant-eating sawflies most commonly are associated with leafy material but some specialize on wood, and the ovipositors of these species (such as the family Siricidae) are specially adapted for the task of drilling through bark. Once the incision has been made, the female will lay as many as 30 to 90 eggs. Females avoid the shade when laying their eggs because the larvae develop much slower and may not even survive, and they may not also survive if they are laid on immature and glaucous leaves. Hence, female sawflies search for young adult leaves to lay their eggs on. These eggs hatch in two to eight weeks, but such duration varies by species and also by temperature. Until the eggs have hatched, some species such as the small brown sawfly will remain with them and protects the eggs by buzzing loudly and beating her wings to deter predators. There are six larval stages that sawflies go through, lasting 2 – 4 months, but this also depends on the species. When fully grown, the larvae emerge from the trees en masse and burrow themselves into the soil to pupate. During their time outside, the larvae may link up to form a large colony if many other individuals are present. They gather in large groups during the day which gives them protection from potential enemies, and during the night they disperse to feed. The emergence of adults takes awhile, with some emerging anywhere between a couple months to 2 years. Some will reach the ground to form pupal chambers, but others may spin a cocoon attached to a leaf. Larvae that feed on wood will pupate in the tunnels they have constructed. In one species, the jumping-disc sawfly (Phyllotoma aceris) forms a cocoon which can act like a parachute. The larvae live in sycamore trees and do not damage the upper or lower cuticles of leaves that they feed on. When fully developed, they cut small perforations in the upper cuticle to form a circle. After this, they weave a silk hammocks within the circle; this silk hammock never touches the lower cuticle. Once inside, the upper-cuticle's disc separates and descends towards the surface with the larvae attaching themselves to the hammock. Once they reach the round, the larvae work their way into a sheltered area by jerking their discs along. The majority of sawfly species produce a single generation per year, but others may only have one generation every two years. Most sawflies are also female, making males rare. = Life cycle of Cladius difformis (bristly rose slug) = File:Cladius difformis larva.jpgLarva File:Cladius difformis pupa dorsal.jpgPupa, dorsal view File:Cladius difformis pupa ventral.jpgPupa, ventral view File:Cladius difformis female.jpgFemale File:Cladius difformis male.jpgMale Relationship with humans The pine sawfly Diprion pini is a serious pest of forestry. Caterpillar-like larvae of Iris sawfly on yellow flag, showing damage to host plant Sawflies are major economic pests of forestry. For example, species in the Diprionidae, such as the pine sawflies, Diprion pini and Neodiprion sertifer, cause serious damage to pines in regions such as Scandinavia. D. pini larvae defoliated in the largest outbreak in Finland, between 1998 and 2001. Up to 75% of the trees may die after such outbreaks, as D. pini can remove all the leaves late in the growing season, leaving the trees too weak to survive the winter. Little damage to trees only occurs when the tree is large or when there is minimal presence of larvae. Eucalyptus trees can regenerate quickly from damage inflicted by the larvae; however, they can be substantially damaged from outbreaks, especially if they are young. The trees can be defoliated completely and may cause \\"dieback\\", stunting or even death. Sawflies are serious pests in horticulture. Different species prefer different host plants, often being specific to a family or genus of hosts. For example, Iris sawfly larvae, emerging in summer, can quickly defoliate species of Iris including the yellow flag and other freshwater species. Similarly the rose sawflies, Arge pagana and A. ochropus, defoliate rose bushes. The giant woodwasp or horntail, Urocerus gigas, has a long ovipositor, which with its black and yellow colouration make it a good mimic of a hornet. Despite the alarming appearance, the insect cannot sting. The eggs are laid in the wood of conifers such as Douglas fir, pine, spruce, and larch. The larvae eat tunnels in the wood, causing economic damage. Alternative measures to control sawflies can be taken. Mechanical methods include removing larvae from trees and killing them by squishing or dropping them into boiling water or kerosene, although this is not practical in plantations. Predators can also be used to eliminate larvae, as well as parasites which have been previously used in control programs. Small trees can be sprayed with a number of chemicals, including maldison, dimethoate and carbaryl, if removing larvae from trees is not effective enough.

It is connected to Lower New York Bay on the south by the Narrows. Ellis Island (north) and Liberty Island (south) are shown in the northwest corner of the bay. Upper New York Bay, or Upper Bay, is the traditional heart of the Port of New York and New Jersey, and often called New York Harbor. It is enclosed by the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island and the Hudson County, New Jersey, municipalities of Jersey City and Bayonne. Overview The Upper Bay is fed by the waters of the Hudson River (historically called the North River as it passes Manhattan), as well as the Gowanus Canal. It is connected to Lower New York Bay by the Narrows, to Newark Bay by the Kill Van Kull, and to Long Island Sound by the East River, which despite the name, is actually a tidal strait. It provides the main passage for the waters of the Hudson River as it empties through the Narrows. The channel of the Hudson as it passes through the harbor is called the Anchorage Channel and is approximately 50 feet deep in the midpoint of the harbor.\\"Anchorage Channel dredging project\\" A project to replace two water mains between Brooklyn and Staten Island which will eventually allowing for dredging of the channel to nearly was begun in April 2012. It contains several islands including Governors Island, near the mouth of the East River, as well Ellis Island, Liberty Island, and Robbins Reef which are supported by a large underwater reef on the New Jersey side of the harbor. The reef was historically one of the largest oyster beds in the world and provided a staple for the diet of all classes of citizens both locally and regionally until the end of the 19th century, when the beds succumbed to pollution. Historically, it has played an extremely important role in the commerce of the New York metropolitan area. The Statue of Liberty National Monument recalls the immigrant experience during the late 19th and early 20th century. Since the 1950s, container ship traffic has been primarily routed through the Kill Van Kull to Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, where it is consolidated for easier automated transfer to land conveyance. As a consequence, the waterfront industries of the Upper Bay experienced a decline leading to diverse plans for revitalization, though important maritime uses remain at Red Hook, Port Jersey, MOTBY, Constable Hook, and parts of the Staten Island shore. Liberty State Park opened in 1976. In recent years, it has become a popular site for recreation sailing and kayaking. The harbor is traversed by the Staten Island Ferry, which runs between Whitehall Street at the southernmost tip of Manhattan near Battery Park (South Ferry) and St. George Ferry Terminal on Richmond Terrace in Staten Island near Richmond County Borough Hall and Richmond County Supreme Court.

The festival is also locally termed \\"eriin gurvan naadam\\" (), \\"the three games of men\\". The games are Mongolian wrestling, horse racing, and archery, and are held throughout the country during midsummer. Women have started participating in the archery and girls in the horse-racing games, but not in Mongolian wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO. Overview Naadam is the most widely watched festival among Mongols and is believed to have existed for centuries in one fashion or another. It has its origin in the activities, such as military parades and sporting competitions such as archery, horse riding and wrestling, that followed the celebration of various occasions, including weddings or spiritual gatherings. It later served as a way to train soldiers for battle and was also connected to Mongols' nomadic lifestyle. Mongolians practice their unwritten holiday rules that include a long song to start the holiday, then a Biyelgee dance. Traditional cuisine, or Khuushuur, is served around the Sports Stadium along with a special drink made of horse milk (airag). The three games of wrestling, horse racing, and archery are recorded in the 13th-century book The Secret History of the Mongols. During the Qing dynasty's rule, Naadam became a festival officially held by sums. Now it formally commemorates the 1921 Revolution, when Mongolia declared independence from Qing dynasty and coincides with Mongolian State Flag Day. Naadam also celebrates the achievements of the new state.Atwood Christopher Pratt, 1964-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, Facts On File, Ink It was celebrated as a Buddhist/shaman holiday until secularization in the 1930s under the Communist influence of the Soviet Union. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Naadam in Ulaanbaatar The biggest festival (National Naadam) is held in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, during the National Holiday from July 11 to 13, in the National Sports Stadium. It begins with an elaborate introduction ceremony featuring dancers, athletes, horse riders, and musicians. After the ceremony, the competitions begin. The competitions are mainly horseback riding. Naadam is also celebrated in different regions of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia in July and August. In the Tuva Republic, Naadam is on 15 August. The three sports are called \\"Danshig\\" games. They became the great celebration of the new nation, where the nobility got together to dedicate to the Bogd Khan (Jabzundamba Khutugtu), the new head of state. Genghis Khan's nine horse tails, representing the nine tribes of the Mongols, are still ceremonially transported from Sukhbaatar Square to the Stadium to open the Naadam festivities. At the opening and closing ceremonies, there are impressive parades of mounted cavalry, athletes and monks. Another popular Naadam activity is the playing of games using shagai, sheep anklebones that serve as game pieces and tokens of both divination and friendship. In the larger Naadam festivals, tournaments may take place in a separate venue. And the festival looks amazingly colorful like red and blue. Three Games=Wrestling Wrestling in the 2005 Naadam festival A total of 512 or 1024 wrestlers meet in a single-elimination tournament that lasts nine or ten rounds. Mongolian traditional wrestling is an untimed competition in which wrestlers lose if they touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. When picking pairs, the wrestler with the greatest fame has the privilege to choose his opponent. Wrestlers wear two-piece costumes consisting of a tight shoulder vest (zodog) and shorts (shuudag). Only men are allowed to participate. Each wrestler has an \\"encourager\\" called a zasuul. The zasuul sings a song of praise for the winning wrestler after rounds 3, 5, and 7. Winners of the 7th or 8th stage (depending on whether the competition features 512 or 1024 wrestlers) earn the title of zaan, \\"elephant\\". The winner of the 9th or 10th stage is called arslan, \\"lion\\".\\"The Maulers of Mongolia\\", Black Belt magazine, July 1969, p. 22 In the final competition, all the \\"zasuuls\\" drop in the wake of each wrestler as they take steps toward each other. Two-time arslans are called the titans / giants, or avraga. Horse racing Unlike Western horse racing, which consists of short sprints generally not much longer than 2 km, Mongolian horse racing as featured in Naadam is a cross-country event, with races 15–30 km long. The length of each race is determined by age class. For example, two-year-old horses race for ten miles and seven-year-olds for seventeen miles. Up to 1000 horses from any part of Mongolia can be chosen to participate. Race horses are fed a special diet. Children from 5 to 13 are chosen as jockeys and train in the months preceding the races. While jockeys are an important component, the main purpose of the races is to test the skill of the horses.\\"Naadam Festival.\\" The Center for the Study . 16 Apr 2008 http://www.csen.org/Mongol.Nadaam/Mongol.text.html Before the races begin, the audience sings traditional songs and the jockeys sing a song called Gingo. Prizes are awarded to horses and jockeys. The top five horses in each class earn the title of airgiyn tav and the top three are given gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winning jockey is praised with the title of tumny ekh or leader of ten thousand. The horse that finishes last in the Daaga race (two-year-old horses race) is called bayan khodood (meaning \\"full stomach\\"). A song is sung to the Bayan khodood wishing him luck to be next year's winner.

Archery A women's archery competition held during the 2005 Naadam festival In this competition both men and women may participate. It is played by teams of ten. Each archer is given four arrows; the team must hit 33 \\"surs\\". Men shoot their arrows from 75 meters away while women shoot theirs from 65 meters away. Traditionally the archers wear their national clothing (Deel) during the competition. All the archers wear leather bracers up to the elbow on their outstretched arm, so that the deel’s cuff does not interfere with shooting. Mongolian archery is unique for having dozens of surs as targets. Each sur is a small woven or wooden cylinder. They are placed on top of each other forming a wall three-high, which is approximately 8 inches high by 5 feet wide. Knocking a sur out of the wall with an arrow counts as a hit, though knocking a sur out of the centre will bring a competitor more points. When the archer hits the target, the judge says uuhai which means \\"hooray\\". After each hit, an official repairs the damaged wall and makes it ready for the next attempt. The winners of the contest are granted the titles of \\"national marksman\\" and \\"national markswoman\\".

It was released for the GameCube on November 21, 2003, in Japan; March 22, 2004, in North America; and May 14, 2004, in Europe. Unlike previous titles, the game does not feature random encounters with Pokémon; instead, the player can steal (\\"snag\\") the Pokémon of other Pokémon Trainers. The game also features several battle modes for single-player and multiplayer gameplay. The game is set in the desertous region of Orre. The player protagonist is Wes, a former member of Team Snagem. Throughout the game, the player rescues \\"Shadow Pokémon\\"—Pokémon who have had their hearts darkened by Team Cipher, an antagonistic organization—via snagging. Rui, a non-player character, serves as Wes's sidekick and identifies Shadow Pokémon. Pokémon Colosseum was exhibited at E3 2003. North American pre-orders were packaged with a bonus disc that allows the player to download the Pokémon Jirachi. Upon release, the game was generally well-received, with praise directed at its graphics and music. It was a commercial success, with 1.15 million copies sold in the United States and 656,270 in Japan. Gameplay The player battles with Sudowoodo and Hitmontop, who are both identifiable as Shadow Pokémon by the purple border of their avatars. This battle against the opponent's Trapinch and Numel is conducted on Mt. Battle, a common setting for battles. Pokémon Colosseum is a 3D role-playing game viewed from a third-person perspective. The player, controlling a Pokémon Trainer named Wes (default name), moves through various towns and other locations (traversed using a type of one-wheeled motorcycle), battling enemy Trainers and completing quests. Items are purchased at \\"Pokémon Mart\\" locations using the game's currency, \\"Pokémon Dollars\\" (File:Pokébuck sign.png). When a battle starts, the screen switches to a turn-based interface where the player's and enemies' Pokémon fight. Most battles are of the \\"double battle\\" format, which means two Pokémon on each side at one time. However, each Trainer can carry up to six Pokémon at one time, so once a Pokémon is defeated, his or her Trainer must switch out another one unless no more are left. Battles are also conducted at \\"Colosseums\\" in several cities. Unlike most Pokémon games, Colosseum does not feature random encounters. The player begins the game with two Pokémon. More are obtained throughout the game by \\"Snagging\\" them from other Trainers using Poké Balls of various strengths. Only specifically designated \\"Shadow Pokémon\\", whose hearts have been artificially closed, can be Snagged. Pokémon can be traded between Colosseum and the Game Boy Advance games Pokémon Ruby or Sapphire Each of the player's Shadow Pokémon has a purple gauge that is drained by battling and coming to like the player. Once a Pokémon's gauge is empty, the player may \\"Purify\\" the Pokémon by bringing him or her to Celebi's shrine in Agate Village, or by using a rare \\"Time Flute\\" item. Purifying Shadow Pokémon is desirable because while in that status, they will often disobey the player, they cannot gain experience points, and their moves are at first restricted to \\"Shadow Rush\\". Additionally, Shadow Pokémon will sporadically enter \\"Hyper Mode\\" state during battle, causing them to disobey the player character or attack themselves until the condition is alleviated by selecting the \\"Call\\" battle command. Aside from the story mode, Colosseum also features several non-canonical battle modes. In the \\"Quick Battle\\" mode, the player can battle either CPU trainers or friends, using Pokémon obtained in the story mode or randomly assigned ones. Battles in this mode do not result in gain of experience points or money. In the single-player battle mode, the player competes at Colosseums—stadiums used throughout the game for Pokémon battles—and earns \\"Poké Coupons\\", another currency which can be used to buy rare items. In the \\"Gang Battle\\" mode, up to four players can compete in a tournament. The first can use Pokémon obtained in the story mode, or from the Game Boy Advance games. Players two through four, however, can only use Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games. Plot Pokémon Colosseums 3D alt=A dim mayor's office on the first floor of a small building features a brown carpet, red sofas, a large television with the news on, and an unoccupied, large desk with a black vinyl chair. A staircase in the back leads out of the room. The teenage boy, and a teenage girl with orange hair and a denim jacket, are standing near the unseen front door. In the center of the room stand three men wearing red, blue, and green full-body suits, as well as two more wearing punk attire. These men are centered around a taller man sporting a red and white afro about three feet in diameter; he is turned away from the teenage boy and girl. Setting Pokémon Colosseum is set in the Orre region. Orre is a mostly desertous region in which no wild Pokémon can be found (although the sequel, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, adds wild Pokémon spots to the region). Orre consists of many cities, towns, and Colosseums. Characters The game's player protagonist is by default named , but as with most Pokémon games, the player can change his name. Wes's Starter Pokémon are Espeon and Umbreon, two fox-like Pokémon who start at level 25 and 26, respectively. Additionally, shortly after the game begins, the player meets the game's partner character, Rui; she accompanies Wes on his journey, and uses her ability to see shadow Pokémon to help combat the efforts of the game's villains. , a criminal organization that uses the \\"Snag machine\\" technology to capture the Pokémon of Trainers, serves as an antagonistic entity in the game. However, shortly after the game's start, is revealed to be the main antagonistic force, having partnered with Snagem to obtain Pokémon from Trainers, corrupting them, and distributing them throughout Cipher and other places such as Pyrite Town. Wes is a former employee of Team Snagem. The organization also employs many grunt workers, as well as four administrators: disco-loving , the explosively-tempered bodybuilder, , the queen of the Under, , and the strategist of a scientist, . Story The game begins with a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a dilapidated train engine in the middle of the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon. As the game progresses, Wes becomes a target of a powerful organization known as Team Cipher. After leaving Phenac, he visits Pyrite Town, where Rui was kidnapped. In Pyrite, Shadow Pokémon are openly offered to winners of the town's Colosseum tournament. The local police force is powerless to stop the practice, so Duking, an influential man in Pyrite, asks Wes to enter the tournament and investigate. Wes enters the Colosseum challenge and defeats four trainers to win. Inside a nearby building, a Cipher Peon is about to present the Shadow Pokémon prize, but another one recognizes Wes. The pair then battle their way through the building and a maze-like cave set in the rock behind. Eventually, they face and defeat Miror B., one of four Cipher Admins. Afterwards, Wes returns a Pokémon Miror B. stole from Duking. A team of kids working in Duking's house introduce themselves as members of an anti-Cipher news network, known as the Kids Grid, who pledge their help to Wes and Rui. Their next stop is Agate Village, a forested village in the mountains. As Rui introduces Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun to the center of the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there. Upon reaching Mt. Battle, people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher has already taken over the first section of the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim. Dakim owns a Shadow Entei, who is one of the trio of legendary beasts. After defeating Dakim, Wes heads to The Under, which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town, and under the control of Cipher. More members of the Kids Grid are here. They tell the player of Venus, another Cipher administrator, who has influence over The Under. After Wes confronts Venus, the owner of the second legendary beast Suicune, she flees. Next, Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon. After defeating numerous Cipher peons, Wes faces Ein, the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast Raikou. Wes and Rui then go to Realgam Tower. All four administrators are there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum at the top of the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be interrupted by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are sent to jail. Development and release Pokémon Colosseum was developed by the Japanese game developer Genius Sonority, and published by Nintendo. Just as Nintendo 64 predecessors Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 had served as home console counterparts to the first- and second-generation handheld titles, Colosseum had a similar role for the third generation. The new concept for Pokémon Colosseum was influenced by RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Persona 2 over the Pokémon mold. When asked in an interview with Prima Games why the gameplay of Colosseum did not mirror that of the handheld Pokémon games, Pokémon director Junichi Masuda explained: \\"How players communicate with each other has been key to the Pokémon games – it is the backbone of all Pokémon game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game.\\" The city of Phoenix, Arizona was primarily used as the basis for the Orre region. The transition to 3D also brought new graphical changes. Wes was designed to look \\"hazy\\" and about 17 years old. Genius Sonority ported most of the models and animations of first- and second- generation Pokémon from Stadium and Stadium 2. Genius Sonority based most of Orre on the real-life city of Phoenix, Arizona. As a whole, the graphics were influenced more by manga than by established Pokémon convention. A preview for the game was hosted at E3 2003. Upon completion of development, Colosseum received a rating of \\"E\\" (Everyone) from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, \\"All Ages\\" from Computer Entertainment Rating Organization, and \\"3+\\" from Pan European Game Information. The game was released on November 21, 2003 in Japan; March 22, 2004 in North America, and May 14, 2004 in Europe. Nintendo also published supplementary media to unlock additional content. Pre- ordered copies of the game came with a bonus disc that contains trailers for the game and the film Pokémon: Jirachi Wish Maker. The North American disc also contains the exclusive Pokémon Jirachi that can be downloaded to the player's copy of Ruby or Sapphire. The Japanese release contains a downloadable Celebi instead and requires a completed save file of Pokémon Colosseum. The disc also updates the software in Ruby and Sapphire to remove a \\"berry glitch\\" discovered in 2003. Despite public anticipation the Bonus Disc was not released in PAL territories, prompting Nintendo to issue an official apology. However a Jirachi was later included in the PAL version of the game Pokémon Channel. In Japan, scannable cards for the Nintendo e-Reader were available for purchase that featured additional trainers to battle and Shadow Pokémon. Reception=Critical response Pokémon Colosseum was generally well-received upon release, with respective scores of 73/100 and 73.46% from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. Allgame staff writer Scott Alan Marriott gave the game three and a half stars out of five, although he did not review the game with more depth. Critics praised Colosseum as the first true 3D role-playing installment in the Pokémon series. Gamers Hell reviewer John K. called it \\"certainly a step in the right direction to a good 3D Pokémon game\\", although he felt that the limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true overworld detracted from the experience. IGN staff writer Craig Harris said that the adaptation of the Pokémon RPG formula to the 3D zeitgeist \\"does a decent enough job\\" and is \\"a bit more linear and straightforward\\". The new 3D graphics received mixed remarks. Harris called the game \\"[g]raphically ... a mixed bag\\", praising the visual style of the game's Pokémon but criticizing the \\"poorly modeled and animated, angular\\" style of the Trainers. GameSpot reviewer Ryan Davis offered a similar opinion, concluding that \\"[t]he visual style ... has gone off the deep end\\". GamePro writer Star Dingo called the graphics as a whole \\"insanely cute\\" but criticized the lack of animations showing two Pokémon attacking in tandem. GameZone's review took a more positive stance, saying that \\"[a]nimations are brief but impressive; each attack move is more elaborate and more extravagant on the 'Cube.\\" Nintendo Power thought similarly, commending the \\"amazing level of detail\\". GameZone compared the overall town design and environments to those of the landmark Final Fantasy VII. Dingo complained that \\"there are some characters to talk to and chests to find, but no 'overworld' with free-roaming monsters to capture.\\" John K. stated that \\"[t]he towns are made with enough detail, but sometimes a bit dull.\\" Harris denounced the game's usage of old Pokémon battle cries, a recurring complaint of the series. Dingo called the music as a whole \\"a bit too low-tech and synthetic\\". GameZone, in contrast, stated that the sound effects evoke nostalgia for Pokémon Red and Blue, and that the music tracks \\"have more depth than any of the songs from the previous games.\\" John K. said that the music is neither annoying nor entertaining. Retronauts described Colosseum as \\"terrible\\", citing the reuse of graphics from the Pokémon Stadium games. In 2006, Nintendo Power listed Colosseum as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console. Sales Three weeks before its release, pre-orders of Pokémon Colosseum made it the best-selling game on Amazon.com. In the game's first week of release in the United Kingdom, it boosted the GameCube's market share from 16% to 32%. It was the best-selling GameCube game of May 2004, and fourteenth among all consoles. In 2005, the game was certified as part of Nintendo's Player's Choice line in North America, representing at least 250,000 copies sold. As of 2007, the game has sold over 1.15 million copies in the United States and 656,270 in Japan. It is the best-selling RPG for the GameCube. Legacy Pokémon Colosseum spawned a high-profile tournament in the United Kingdom entitled \\"Pokémon Colosseum Battlemaster 2004\\". The first round of battles was held at Toys \\"R\\" Us locations, with later battles taking place in movie theaters. Across Europe, the game was bundled with GameCube consoles shortly after its release. Special editions of this set also included a copy of Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire —a game that allows players to organize and store up to 1,500 Pokémon from their games—as well as a memory card and a Game Boy Advance–GameCube link cable. A manga adaptation of Colosseums plot was printed in 2004 issues of the Japanese magazine CoroCoro Comic and titled . The game was followed by a 2005 sequel entitled Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. Set in Orre five years after Colosseum, it features a new protagonist snagging Shadow Pokémon from Team Cipher. Shadow Lugia is the game's mascot, and serves as an antagonist whom the player can snag. The game alludes to Wes, Rui, and The Under, though they do not appear.

Early life and education Salvatore at a book signing in 2008 Salvatore was born in Leominster, Massachusetts, the youngest of a family of seven. A graduate of Leominster High School, Salvatore has credited his high school English teacher with being instrumental in his development as a writer. During his time at Fitchburg State College, he became interested in fantasy after reading J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, given to him as a Christmas gift.Clute, John. And John Grant. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy. New York: ST. Martkin’s Press, 1997 He developed an interest in fantasy and other literature, promptly changing his major from computer science to journalism. He earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications/Media from Fitchburg. He earned this degree in 1981 and later a Bachelor of Arts in English. Before taking up writing full-time, he worked as a bouncer.Clute, John. And John Grant. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1997. Publishers Weekly. May 17, 2004, Vol. 251 Issue 20, p23 He attributes his fierce and vividly described battle scenes to his experience as a bouncer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLf1hBUr9M4Pringle, David eds. St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers. Detroit, Michigan: St. James Press, 1996 In the fall of 1997, his letters, manuscripts, and other professional papers were donated to the R. A. Salvatore collection at his alma mater, Fitchburg State University in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Career In 1982, he started writing more seriously, developing a manuscript he titled Echoes of the Fourth Magic.Shippey, T. A. ed. Magill's Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy vol II. Pasadena, California: Salem Press, 1996. He created the setting of Ynis Aielle for the novel, writing it in longhand by candlelight. In an interview with comic book website Project Fanboy, Salvatore said he landed the deal for his first book when, after finishing the script for Echoes of the Fourth Magic in early 1987, he sent the work to TSR and several other publishers. TSR was looking for an author to write the second book in the Forgotten Realms line and asked Salvatore to audition. In July 1987, Salvatore won the spot to write the book. His first published novel was The Crystal Shard from TSR in 1988. The first hardcover novel from TSR was Salvatore's The Legacy (1992). After Passage to Dawn (1996), TSR's management picked a new author to write stories about Drizzt; Mark Anthony's Drizzt novel The Shores of Dusk was completed by the time Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR, but Wizards opted not to publish that one and instead brought Salvatore back to write about Drizzt, beginning with The Silent Blade (1998). The Silent Blade won the Origins Award that year. Salvatore went on to publish several series of books in the Forgotten Realms campaign world, while lately his popularity surged due to his Demon Wars sagas and his two Star Wars books. One of his most popular characters is Drizzt Do'Urden, a drow, or dark elf, portrayed against the stereotypes of his race, who defies a nation of evil enemies with his swordsmanship and courage. He abandons the Underdark, a barren land of unmarked and limitless tunnels where deadly creatures continually lurk. His journey for freedom leads him to the surface where he faces discrimination at every turn because of his dark heritage. Drizzt stumbles along in a harsh world until he finally comes upon friends who understand the kindness of his heart. Together, they fight for justice against sinister enemies who dare to disrupt the peace of Drizzt's newfound homeland. In 1999, Salvatore was tasked with writing Vector Prime, the first novel in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. Vector Prime was extremely controversial among Star Wars fans because its plot included the death of Chewbacca, making the Wookiee the first major character from the original trilogy to be permanently killed off in the Star Wars expanded universe novels. Salvatore was ordered by Lucasfilm Ltd. to kill off the character. Many fans thought that Salvatore himself had made this decision, but it was actually Randy Stradley, the then-editor at Dark Horse Comics.Randy Stradley on DarkHorse.com message boards In February 2008, Devil's Due Publishing published Spooks, a comic book about a U.S. government anti-paranormal investigator/task force created by Larry Hama and Salvatore. Hama created the military characters and plots, and Salvatore covered the monster characters. In 2010, Wizards of the Coast announced a new deal with Salvatore to write six more books featuring Drizzt the dark elf. The books were released between 2011 and 2016. Writing for video games In addition to his novels, Salvatore wrote the story for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC video game Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone (2004), working with the design team at Stormfront Studios. The game was published by Atari and was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and BAFTA. CDS books commissioned him to edit a four book series based on the interactive online EverQuest game.Raugust, Karen. \\"*The Expanding World of EverQuest\\". Publishers Weekly. May 17, 2004, Vol. 251 Issue 20, p23 He also wrote the bot chat lines for the Quake III bots. Salvatore was hired as creative director for upstart game developer 38 Studios, which was owned by former baseball player Curt Schilling. He wrote the dialogue and created a backstory spanning ten thousand years for the fantasy game Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, which was released in February 2012,http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/121/1218070p1.html and sold over one million units. However, three months later 38 Studios declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. The company laid off its entire staff, including Salvatore, with the $2 million fee for his services having never been paid. Salvatore claimed he harbored no ill will toward Schilling in a 2014 interview with The Escapist. \\"Why would I sue Curt [for the $2 million]? Maybe he made a couple of bad business decisions ... [but] he didn't do anything nefarious, and he got wiped out. He's lying in the gutter and you want me to kick him in the head? Why would anyone do that?\\" BibliographyReferencesReviews * Cassada, Jackie. “The Lone Drow (book).” Library Journal September 15, 2003, Vol. 128 Issue 15, p95 * Cannon, Peter. Zaleski, Jeff.

The story follows Beethoven's secretary and first biographer Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbé) as he attempts to ascertain the true identity of the Unsterbliche Geliebte (Immortal Beloved) addressed in three letters found in the late composer's private papers. Schindler journeys throughout the Austrian Empire interviewing women who might be potential candidates as well as through Beethoven's own tumultuous life. Plot When Ludwig van Beethoven dies, his assistant and close friend Schindler deals with his last will and testament. It reads that his estate, music and affairs will be left to his \\"immortal beloved\\", but there remains a question as to who is Beethoven's \\"immortal beloved\\", an unnamed woman mentioned in one of his letters. Schindler embarks on a quest to find out. He meets the women who played a part in Ludwig's life; through their stories, retrospective footage of Beethoven from his younger years until his death is featured as the film progresses. The conclusion ultimately is that the individual is Johanna Reiss, the daughter of Anton Van Reiss, a prosperous Viennese upholsterer. In the film, she becomes pregnant by Beethoven; when by an accidental turn of events he does not marry her in time, she marries his brother, Kaspar. The love turns to hate, worsened by the long legal battle between Beethoven and Johanna over custody over their son, Karl van Beethoven (whom everyone believes is Beethoven's nephew), following Kaspar's death. Finally, Ludwig gets custody over his \\"nephew\\", but the strict upbringing and promotion of the boy as another child prodigy—which Karl himself knows all too well he is not—leads to Karl attempting suicide. Beethoven is blamed and his reputation is ruined. Schindler finally speaks to Johanna, who says she has made her peace with him. She met him at his deathbed, where he gave her a signed letter, giving her custody over Karl. She tells Schindler about their intentions to elope, but Beethoven never showed up, and she felt betrayed. Schindler realizes what happened and gives her the letter to the \\"Immortal Beloved\\" in which she finally reads what happened that night they were supposed to meet. Shocked to find out how an unfortunate event and misunderstanding has kept them apart, she visits the grave of Beethoven in the closing scene.

Written in the summer of 1812 from the spa town of Teplice, the letter has generated a great deal of speculation and debate amongst scholars and writers as to her identity. Among the candidates, then and now, are Giulietta Guicciardi, Thérèse von Brunswick, Josephine Brunsvik, Antonie Brentano, and Anna-Marie Erdödy, some of whom are portrayed in the film. The film's writer and director, Bernard Rose, though not a historian, claimed that he had successfully identified the addressed woman as Beethoven’s sister-in-law Johanna (Reiss) van Beethoven, a claim no scholar on Beethoven has endorsed. The film also implies that Karl, Beethoven's nephew, was in reality the couple's son. Biographer Gail S. Altman disputed Rose's claim in a bookAltman, Gail S.

Emanuel Levy gave the film a \\"C\\" rating, calling it a \\"speculative chronicle\\" that lacks the \\"vibrant energy and charm\\" of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart biopic Amadeus (1984).

Immortal Beloved. EmanuelLevy.com. Wayback Machine. 2006. Retrieved 11 August 2014. Roger Ebert was highly complimentary of the film. He gave it 3½ stars out of four, stating in his review: \\"Immortal Beloved has clearly been made by people who feel Beethoven directly in their hearts\\". He asserted that Oldman \\"at first seems an unlikely choice...then we see that he is right\\". Janet Maslin also offered a positive review, stating: \\"thanks to its hugely effective use of Beethoven's most thrilling, tumultuous music, this film exerts much the same hypnotic power\\". She praised the performance of Oldman, writing that \\"he captures Beethoven as a believably brilliant figure struggling with his deafness and other demons\\". MSN Movies, in a 2011 publication, wrote: \\"Oldman's performance is unimpeachable. He dives deep into the role with powerful passion and makes the audience feel the pain of the genius as he loses his hearing and fails to shape his nephew into a similarly talented musician.

The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Research Council (NRC). The National Academy of Medicine provides national and international advice on issues relating to health, medicine, health policy, and biomedical science. It aims to provide unbiased, evidence-based, and authoritative information and advice concerning health and science policy to policy-makers, professionals, leaders in every sector of society, and the public at large. Operating outside the framework of the U.S. federal government, it relies on a volunteer workforce of scientists and other experts, operating under a formal peer-review system. As a national academy, the organization annually elects new members with the help of its current members; the election is based on the members' distinguished and continuing achievements in a relevant field as well as for their willingness to participate actively. History The institute was founded in 1970, under the congressional charter of the National Academy of Sciences as the Institute of Medicine. On April 28, 2015, NAS membership voted in favor of reconstituting the membership of the IOM as a new National Academy of Medicine and establishing a new division on health and medicine within the NRC that has the program activities of the IOM at its core. These changes took effect on July 1, 2015. Overview The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance. The work is conducted by committees of volunteer scientists—leading national and international experts—who serve without compensation. Committees are composed in an attempt to assure the requisite expertise and to avoid bias or conflict of interest. Every report produced by committee undergoes extensive review and evaluation by a group of external experts who are anonymous to the committee, and whose names are revealed only once the study is published. Victor Dzau is President and Chairman of the Council. His six-year term began on July 1, 2014. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Executive Officer is J. Michael McGinnis. The majority of studies and other activities are requested and funded by the federal government. Private industry, foundations, and state and local governments also initiate studies, as does the academy itself. Reports are made available online for free by the publishing arm of the United States National Academies, the National Academies Press, in multiple formats. The academy is both an honorific membership organization and a policy research organization. Its members, elected on the basis of their professional achievement and commitment to service, serve without compensation in the conduct of studies and other activities on matters of significance to health. Election to active membership is both an honor and a commitment to serve in Institute affairs. The bylaws specify that no more than 80 new members shall be elected annually, including 10 from outside the United States. The announcement of newly elected members occurs at the Annual Meeting in October. As of October 20, 2015, the number of regular members plus international and emeritus members is 2,012. An unusual diversity of talent among NAM members is assured by the charter stipulation that at least one-quarter be selected from outside the health professions, from such fields as the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as law, administration, engineering, and the humanities. The New York Times called the NAM (then called the IOM) the United States' \\"most esteemed and authoritative adviser on issues of health and medicine, and its reports can transform medical thinking around the world.\\"Gardiner Harris (August 25, 2011). \\"Vaccine Cleared Again as Autism Culprit\\" The New York Times.

The first ADAT recorders shipped over a year later in February or March 1992.Peterson, George; Robair, Gino [ed.] (1999). Alesis ADAT: The Evolution of a Revolution. Mixbooks. p. 2. More audio tracks could be recorded by synchronizing up to 16 ADAT machines together, for a total of 128 tracks. While synchronization had been available in earlier machines, ADAT machines were the first to do so with sample-accurate timing - which in effect allowed a studio owner to purchase a 24-track tape machine eight tracks at a time. This capability and its comparatively low cost, originally introduced at $3995, were largely responsible for the rise of project studios in the 1990s.George Petersen, \\"In Memoriam: Keith Barr 1949-2010\\", Mix Magazine Online, Aug 2010, http://mixonline.com/news/keith_barr_obit_2508/index1.html Several versions of the ADAT machine were produced. The original ADAT (also known as Blackface) and the ADAT XT recorded 16 bits per sample (ADAT Type I). A later generation of machines—the XT-20, LX-20 and M-20—supports 20 bits per sample (ADAT Type II). All ADAT machines use the same high-quality S-VHS tape media. Tapes recorded in the older Type I format can be read and written in the more modern machines, but not the other way around. Later generations record at two sample rates, 44.1 and 48 kHz, common in the audio industry. All models allow pitch control by varying the sample rate, and thus tape speed accordingly. An original Blackface could record at 44.1 kHz (or other desired sample rates) if the pitch was lowered or raised by a specific amount. An indicator on the LED display showed when 44.1KHz was reached. With locate points it was possible to store sample-exact positions on tape, making it easy to find specific parts of digital recordings. Using auto play and auto record functions made it possible to punch in/out at predetermined points, rather than relying on human timing ability to start and stop recording at precisely the right instant. ADAT machines could be controlled externally with the Alesis LRC (little remote control), which could be attached to the ADAT with a 1/4\\" tip/sleeve plug, and featured the transport controls and most commonly used functions. Alternatively, the BRCAlesis BRC (big remote control) could be used, which included many more features which the stand-alone ADAT did not have, such as song naming, more locate points and MIDI timecode synchronization. Current status ADAT tapes are still available through some pro-audio retailers with products from Maxell, EMTEC (formerly the tape division of BASF). ADAT HD24 Although it is a tape-based format, the term ADAT now refers to its successor, the Alesis ADAT HD24, which features hard disk recording rather than the traditional tape-based ADAT, which in turn is now considered obsolete. Many still use the ADAT as a simple I/O (in/out) for transfer of analog to digital signals. ADAT is also currently used as an abbreviation for the ADAT Lightpipe protocol, which transfers eight tracks in a single fiber optic cable. The ADAT cable standard is no longer strictly tied to ADAT tape machines and is now used by analog-to-digital converters, input cards for digital audio workstations, effects machines, etc. One of the original benefits of utilizing ADAT versus S/PDIF or AES3 was that a single cable could carry up to eight channels of audio. (AES10 (MADI) can now carry up to 64 channels.)

DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece. DAWs are used for producing and recording music, songs, speech, radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and nearly any other situation where complex recorded audio is needed.  History  Early attempts at digital audio workstations in the 1970s and 1980s faced limitations such as the high price of storage, and the vastly slower processing and disk speeds of the time. In 1978, Soundstream, who had made one of the first commercially available digital audio tape recorders in 1977, built what could be considered the first digital audio workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time. The Digital Editing System, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11/60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (Digital Audio Processor), a Braegen 14\\"-platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system. Interface cards that plugged into the PDP-11's Unibus slots (the Digital Audio Interface, or DAI) provided analog and digital audio input and output for interfacing to Soundstream's digital recorders and conventional analog tape recorders. The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system's hard disks and produce simple effects such as crossfades. By the late 1980s, a number of consumer-level computers such as the MSX (Yamaha CX5M), Apple Macintosh, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga began to have enough power to handle digital audio editing. Engineers used Macromedia's Soundedit, with Microdeal's Replay Professional and Digidesign's \\"Sound Tools\\" and \\"Sound Designer\\" to edit audio samples for sampling keyboards like the E-mu Emulator II and the Akai S900. Soon, people began to use them for simple two-track audio editing and audio mastering. In 1989, Sonic Solutions released the first professional (48 kHz at 24 bit) disk-based nonlinear audio editing system. The Macintosh IIfx-based Sonic System, based on research done earlier at George Lucas’ Sprocket Systems, featured complete CD premastering, with integrated control of Sony's industry-standard U-matic tape-based digital audio editor. In 1994, a company in California named OSC produced a 4-track editing-recorder application called DECK that ran on Digidesign's hardware system, which was used in the production of The Residents' \\"Freakshow\\" [LP]. Many major recording studios finally \\"went digital\\" after Digidesign introduced its Pro Tools software in 1991, modeled after the traditional method and signal flow in most analog recording devices. At this time, most DAWs were Apple Mac based (e.g., Pro Tools, Studer Dyaxis, Sonic Solutions). Around 1992, the first Windows-based DAWs started to emerge from companies such as Innovative Quality Software (IQS) (now SAWStudio), Soundscape Digital Technology, SADiE, Echo Digital Audio, and Spectral Synthesis. All the systems at this point used dedicated hardware for their audio processing. In 1993, the German company Steinberg released Cubase Audio on Atari Falcon 030. This version brought DSP built-in effects with 8-track audio recording & playback using only native hardware. The first Windows-based software-only product, introduced in 1993, was Samplitude (which already existed in 1992 as an audio editor for the Commodore Amiga). In 1996, Steinberg introduced a revamped Cubase (which was originally launched in 1989 as a MIDI sequencing software for the Atari ST computer, later developed for Mac and Windows PC platforms, but had no audio capabilities until 1993's Cubase Audio) which could record and play back up to 32 tracks of digital audio on an Apple Macintosh without the need of any external DSP hardware. Cubase not only modeled a tape-like interface for recording and editing, but, in addition, using VST also developed by Steinberg, modeled the entire mixing desk and effects rack common in analog studios. This revolutionized the DAW world, both in features and price tag, and was quickly imitated by most other contemporary DAW systems. Integrated DAW control screen, 48-track digital mixer integrated on hard disk recorder including data storage and audio interface. (TASCAM X-48) An integrated DAW consists of a digital signal processing, control surface, audio converters, and data storage in one device. Integrated DAWs were popular before commonly available personal computers became powerful enough to run DAW software. As personal computer power and speed increased and price decreased, the popularity of costly integrated systems dropped. Software DAW Ardour) DAW can simply refer to the software itself, but traditionally, a computer- based DAW has four basic components: a computer, a sound card or other audio interface, audio editing software, and at least one user input device for adding or modifying data. This could be as simple as a mouse and keyboard or as sophisticated as a piano-style MIDI controller keyboard or automated audio control surface for mixing track volumes. The computer acts as a host for the sound card, while the software provides the interface and functionality for audio editing. The sound card typically converts analog audio signals into digital form, and digital back to analog audio when playing it back; it may also assist in further processing of the audio. The software controls all related hardware components and provides a user interface to allow for recording, editing, and playback. Computer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities (and some also have video- related features). For example, they can provide a practically limitless number of tracks to record on, polyphony, and virtual synthesizers or sample- based instruments to use for recording music. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves. Simple smartphone-based DAWs, called mobile audio workstation (MAWs), are used (for example) by journalists for recording and editing on location. Common functionality As software systems, DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer. A waveform display is another common feature. Single-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time. Multitrack DAWs support operations on multiple tracks at once. Like a mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain, equalization and stereo panning of the sound on each track. In a traditional recording studio additional rackmount processing gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path to add reverb, compression, etc. However, a DAW can also route in software or use audio plug-ins (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track. Perhaps the most significant feature available from a DAW that is not available in analog recording is the ability to undo a previous action, using a command similar to that of the undo function in word processing software. Undo makes it much easier to avoid accidentally permanently erasing or recording over a previous recording. If a mistake or unwanted change is made, the undo command is used to conveniently revert the changed data to a previous state. Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo are familiar and common computer commands and they are usually available in DAWs in some form. More common functions include the modifications of several factors concerning a sound. These include wave shape, pitch, tempo, and filtering. Commonly DAWs feature some form of mix automation using procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs. The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points. By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan). Automation data may also be directly derived from human gestures recorded by a control surface or MIDI controller. MIDI recording, editing, and playback is increasingly incorporated into modern DAWs of all types, as is synchronization with other audio or video tools. Plug-ins There are countless software plugins for DAW software, each one coming with its own unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Some of the functions of these plugins include digital effects units which can modify a signal with distortion, resonators, equalizers, synthesizers, compressors, chorus, virtual amp, limiter, phaser, and flangers. Each have their own form of manipulating the soundwaves, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transform it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins can be used in layers, and further automated to manipulate the original sounds and mold it into a completely new sample.

These are often designed to run on a variety of operating systems and are usually developed non-commercially. The development of digital audio for Linux and BSD fostered technologies such as ALSA, which drives audio hardware, and JACK. JACK allows any JACK-aware audio software to connect to any other audio software running on the system, such as connecting an ALSA- or OSS-driven soundcard to a mixing and editing front-end, like Ardour or Rosegarden. In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, and it can be configured to use a computer's resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the DAW's latency. This kind of abstraction and configuration allows DJs to use multiple programs for editing and synthesizing audio streams, or multitasking and duplexing, without the need for analogue conversion, or asynchronous saving and reloading files, and ensures a high level of audio fidelity. *Audacity is a free and open-source digital audio editor that can run on Microsoft Windows, but also on OS X, Linux, and other Unix-like systems (including OpenSolaris and TrueOS); it is particularly popular in the podcast community, and also has a large following among the visually impaired due to its keyboard interface. MIDI playback is available (from version 2.2.0 onwards). It concentrates more on sound manipulation and management than discrete events and sequencing. *Rosegarden is a multi-featured audio application that includes audio mixing plugins, a notation editor, and MIDI. *The MusE Sequencer is a similarly featured audio application that includes an audio mixer and a MIDI sequencer. *As an independent project, there is a DAW entirely made in Excel by digital audio artist and IT enthusiast Dylan Tallchief. Other open-source programs include virtual synthesizers and MIDI controllers, such as those provided by FluidSynth and TiMidity. Both can load SoundFonts to expand the voices and instruments available for synthesis and expand the ports and channels available to synthesizers. Such virtualization allows users to expand the traditional limitations of ADC-DAC hardware. The Linux Audio Development (LAD) mailing list is a major driving force in developing standards, such as the LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 plugin architectures. The Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugin standard is supported as an option by some such programs but is generally implemented as a separate plugin, not a built-in option, due to Steinberg's licensing scheme. Among others, the creators of Audacity provide an optional, somewhat minimalist, VST-to-LADSPA bridge plugin for their software, but it is a separate download. Multiple DAW developers also offer free versions of their commercial DAWs, with reduced functionality. Examples include Pro Tools First and Studio One Prime.

Atlantic Ocean View over the Lower New York Bay from Wolfe's Pond Park on Staten Island Lower New York Bay is a section of New York Bay south of the Narrows, the relatively narrow strait between the shores of Staten Island and Brooklyn. The southern end of the bay opens directly to the Atlantic Ocean between two spits of land, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Rockaway, Queens, on Long Island. The southern portion between Staten Island and New Jersey, at the mouth of the Raritan River, is named Raritan Bay. The Hudson Canyon, the ancient riverbed of the Hudson River which existed during the last ice age when the ocean levels were lower, extends southeast from Lower New York Bay for hundreds of miles into the Atlantic Ocean. The nearby part of the Atlantic Ocean between New Jersey and Long Island is the New York Bight. History and geography Since before the time of the Lenape, the Native American inhabitants of the area, the Lower Bay has sustained a rich marine ecosystem with multiple fish species and molluscs, especially oyster, clam and mussel beds. In the 20th century, due to increased population and industrial pollution, the water quality of the bay and its ability to support marine life was severely diminished. The water quality of the bay began to improve with the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act. The main shipping channel through Lower New York Bay is the Ambrose Channel, 2,000 feet wide and dredged to a depth of 40 feet. The channel is navigable by ships with up to a 37-foot draft at low tide.United States coast pilot: Atlantic coast.

Publisher: University of Michigan Library (January 27, 2010) Language: English ASIN: B0037CEPUY The entrance to the Ambrose Channel was marked for many years by the Lightship Ambrose, which was superseded by the Ambrose Light. The bay contains popular beaches at Brighton Beach and Coney Island in Brooklyn. There are also beaches on Staten Island. Just outside the bay, facing the Atlantic, are the beaches of Sandy Hook and the Rockaways.

The New- York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. p. 149 Swinburne Island was originally called Dix Island, but was renamed in honor of Dr. John Swinburne, a noted military surgeon during the Civil War. In the early 20th century, both islands were used as a quarantine station, housing immigrants found to have been carrying contagious diseases when they landed at Ellis Island. At the start of World War II the United States Merchant Marine used both islands as a training station (which opened in 1938); the Quonset huts built during this period still stand on Swinburne Island. The other major use for the two islands during World War II were as anchorages for antisubmarine nets that fenced off New York Bay from the Atlantic Ocean to keep enemy submarines out. Both islands are now part of Gateway National Recreation Area. Fort Lafayette was on a small island in the Narrows, just off the Brooklyn shore. That island was removed during construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Coney Island, originally separated from the southern shore of Brooklyn by a narrow strait, has since been connected to the main part of Long Island by landfill, and is now a peninsula despite its name.

It features all 251 Pokémon from the first and second generations of the franchise. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, in North America on March 26, 2001, and in Europe on October 10, 2001. In Western regions it was titled Pokémon Stadium 2, as it was the second Stadium game to be released outside Japan, in which it was the third game in the series. It supports Dolby Surround sound. Like its predecessor, Pokémon Stadium 2 is compatible with the Transfer Pak accessory, allowing players to use Pokémon trained in the three original Game Boy Pokémon games (Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow) and the three Game Boy Color games (Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal). The majority of the game takes place inside the fictional White City, where various facilities for battling, organizing, researching, and playing with Pokémon are located. The Japanese edition also features the capability to use the Pokémon Mobile System from Pokémon Crystal. Gameplay A battle between the player's Graveler and the opponent's Ekans. Pokémon Stadium 2 does not have a storyline. Progress can be made by winning trophies in the Stadium, a tournament mode consisting of four \\"Cups\\", as well as completing the Gym Leader Castle, where the player earns badges by defeating Gyms specializing in different Pokémon types. When all Stadium trophies have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, the player's rival will want to battle. Defeating the rival will unlock Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Rival at a higher difficulty level. Set in a new town called White City, the Stadium is home to the Poké Cup, Prime Cup, Challenge Cup, and Little Cup, each having its own rules and regulations. With the exception of the Challenge Cup, the player first assembles a team of six Pokémon consisting of any combination of rental Pokémon or imported Pokémon from a Game Boy cartridge. In the Challenge Cup, the parties of the player and opponents are chosen completely randomly. In the same fashion as the first Stadium, each combatant chooses only three of their six Pokémon to use in a battle before beginning. In the Gym Leader Castle, the player is challenged to collect Gym badges by defeating trainers at the eight Johto League Gyms. Pokémon battles follow the same three-on-three format as in the Stadium, and either imported or rental Pokémon may be used to construct a team of six. Each Gym is known for using a specific type of Pokémon, but the Gym's trainers can have Pokémon of a different type for balance. The Elite Four can be battled after collecting all eight badges, and upon their defeat, a rival battle is unlocked. Defeating the rival unlocks the Kanto Gym Leaders and subsequently the Pokémon Champion Red. Additional features The Mini-Game Park is an area in White City where up to four players can play 12 different Pokémon-themed mini-games. Though not required, Pokémon from the players' inserted Game Boy cartridge can be used in certain mini-games. In Free Battle mode, players may conduct practice battles. Players can select rules from any of the tournament cups or use modified rules. Up to four players may participate, using any combination of rental Pokémon and those imported via the Transfer Pak. Pikachu can say its name when you choose the trainer icon from the Pokémon section screen. At the Game Boy Tower, Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal can be played on the Nintendo 64. Winning Stadium cups and completing the Gym Leader Castle eventually unlock higher speed options. In Japan, through use of the mobile phone adapter bundled with copies of Crystal, the player could access a \\"Mobile Stadium\\" game mode in which the player battled other players downloaded from the mobile phone service in a tournament. It was also possible to play against friends through transferring the information across the mobile adapter. Development The success of Japan's Pokémon Stadium 2, released internationally as Pokémon Stadium, led to the development of a third entry. Scheduled for a late 2000 release, the game was to be demonstrated publicly at the 2000 Nintendo Space World festival. By July 20, 2000, the game's title was changed from Pokemon Stadium 3 to Pokemon Stadium Gold/Silver. Nintendo announced more information on October 3, including the dates of the Japanese release and official tournaments. On October 25, Nintendo set the game's North American release date for March 26, 2001. Reception Pokémon Stadium 2 received favorable reviews from critics. While discussing the mixed quality of the Pokémon console games, Retronauts described it as \\"outstanding\\".

The same word, \\"AMBULANCE\\", appears with identical typography, but reading in the normal direction, on the front of the vehicle near the top. Mirror writing is formed by writing in the direction that is the reverse of the natural way for a given language, such that the result is the mirror image of normal writing: it appears normal when it is reflected in a mirror. It is sometimes used as an extremely primitive form of cipher. A common modern usage of mirror writing can be found on the front of ambulances, where the word \\"AMBULANCE\\" is often written in very large mirrored text, so that drivers see the word the right way around in their rear-view mirror. Some people are able to produce handwritten mirrored text. Notably, Leonardo da Vinci wrote most of his personal notes in this way. Mirror writing calligraphy was popular in the Ottoman Empire, where it often carried mystical associations. Ability to write mirrored text An informal Australian newspaper experiment identified 10 true mirror-writers in a readership of 65,000.News in Science - Mirror writing: my genes made me do it - 02/06/2004 A higher proportion of left- handed people are better mirror writers than right-handed people, perhaps because it is more natural for a left-hander to write backwards. 15% of left- handed people have the language centres in both halves of their brain. The cerebral cortex and motor homunculus are affected by this, causing the person to be able to read and write backwards quite naturally. In an experiment conducted by the Department of Neurosurgery at Hokkaido University School of Medicine in Sapporo, Japan, Scientists proposed that the origin of mirror writing comes from damage caused through accidental brain damage or neurological diseases, such as an essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, or spino-cerebellar degeneration. This hypothesis was proposed because these conditions affect a \\"neural mechanism that controls the higher cerebral function of writing via the thalamus.\\" Another study by the same university discovered that damage was not the only cause. The scientists observed that normal children exhibited signs of mirror writing while learning to write, thus concluding that currently there is no exact method for finding the true origin of mirror writing. As with left-handedness, mirror writing is sometimes \\"corrected\\" in children. Notable examples The notes on Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man image are in mirror writing. Leonardo da Vinci wrote most of his personal notes in mirror, only using standard writing if he intended his texts to be read by others. The purpose of this practice by Leonardo remains unknown, though several possible reasons have been suggested. For example, writing left handed from left to right would have been messy because the ink just put down would smear as his hand moved across it. Writing in reverse would prevent such smudging. An alternative theory is that the process of rotating the linguistic object in memory before setting it to paper, and rotating it before reading it back, is a method of reinforcement learning. From this theory, it follows the use of boustrophedonic writing, especially in public codes, may be to render better recall of the text in the reader.

(Inscribed front). :File:ElijahAbelGraveFront.jpg was one of the earliest African-American members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is considered by many to have been the first African-American elder and seventy in the Latter Day Saint movement. Abel, although predominantly of Scotch and English descent, appears by his African heritage to have been the first and one of the few black members in the early history of the church to have received the priesthood. And it was his distinction to be the faith's first missionary to have descended in part through African bloodline. But in 1849, Brigham Young declared all African-Americans ineligible to hold the priesthood and Abel's claim to priesthood right was also challenged. As a skilled carpenter, Abel often committed his services to the furthering of the work and to the building of LDS temples. He died in 1884, shortly after serving a final mission for the church (in his lifetime he officially served three) to Cincinnati, Ohio. Early life & conversion to the LDS faith Elijah Abel was born in Frederick-Town, Maryland on 25 July 1808 to Delilah Williams, who was of Scotch descent, and Andrew Abel, an Englishman. A grandmother of Elijah was \\"half white,\\" or Mulatto; his paternal grandfather, Joseph Abel, was a member of the English House of Commons. Thus was Elijah considered to be \\"Octoroon,\\" or one-eighth African. For many years there was apparent confusion regarding his birth-year. Some sources put the year at 1808, others at 1810. However, the 1850 Census record appears to provide sufficient evidence for marking 1808 as the year of Abel's birth. Moreover, both Elijah's patriarchal blessing and his grave marker record \\"1808\\" as his birth-year. Abel's mother, who died when he was 8 years old, was purportedly a slave from South Carolina, but the evidence for this has never been produced, and that Abel's mother was Quadroon, or a quarter-part black, throws some doubt on the assertion. Some authors — both academics and fiction writers — have speculated (but based on the assumption Abel was the son of a slave) that he migrated to Canada, and probably by way of the underground railroad. But this assertion, too, apart from circumstantial evidence, remains entirely unsubstantiated, with William Kesler Jackson, Abel's biographer, indeed stating that, apart from the period of his later missionary service there, \\"this writer has been unable to find any evidence that Elijah Abel ever lived in Canada.\\" One intriguing possibility behind young Elijah's removal from Maryland to Ohio, as Jackson and Stevenson both note, is that he may have had a sister, possibly even his twin — Nancy Abel Rousten (1807/8-1896) — who he may have followed to Ohio in 1832, when she moved and settled there (in Milton, Miami County, just a few miles northeast of Cincinnati) with her new husband, George Rousten — a white man of German descent born, remarkably, in Frederick County in 1808, just as Nancy and Elijah were. If such be the case, Nancy more than likely shared with Elijah a one-eighth African bloodline heritage as well (even though census data list her as \\"Mulatto\\"). Were then these Marylanders, given such truly diverse heritage, slaves? One truth to consider is that, at least in the western regions of 1820-30s Maryland, as observed by its residents who were living in the counties of \\"Frederick, Washington, and Allegheny ... there are but few slaves.\\" But all of this aside, once in Ohio, the Roustens never transitioned again, but were lifelong residents of that state. Certain it is that young Elijah Abel eventually, by whatever means or motivation, did find his way west to Ohio, for, having now entered his 20s, he was baptized in September 1832 at Cincinnati as a member of Joseph Smith's nascent two-year-old church by local Mormon elder and blacksmith Ezekiel Roberts, a young father of two. Soon after, Abel moved to the Kirtland, Ohio area, to join in fellowship with the main body of Latter- day Saints congregating there (Roberts — who possibly encouraged Abel to relocate as part of the Lord's mandate that His people \\"gather\\" at \\"the Ohio\\" — may have gone, too, particularly since Roberts is shown by civil records to have stayed connected with the main body of Saints, including being driven with them from Missouri and settling with them at Nauvoo: Roberts signed an 1839 affidavit for Missouri damages and his name appears on 1842 Nauvoo tax records). Priesthood ordination Upon the Prophet Joseph Smith's January 1836 declaration that Elijah Abel was \\"entitled to the Priesthood and all the blessings,\\" Abel — who had been, over the many preceding months, an active participant in the construction of the Kirtland Temple (1833–36) by which the Saints would be \\"endowed with power from on high\\" — was ordained an elder of the church on 25 January (the three LDS offices in the Melchizedek Priesthood to which eligible men found worthy were ordained, in their order of ascending hierarchy, are Elder, Seventy, and High Priest). The officiator in that priesthood ordinance was Ambrose Palmer, a high priest who was also branch president in New Portage (now Barberton), Ohio, where Abel was then residing (the ordination was \\"licensed\\" at Kirtland on 31 March 1836 by the Prophet Joseph and second counselor in the First Presidency Frederick G. Williams). Temple participation, patriarchal blessing & calling as a Seventy Elijah was also at this time blessed to participate in the mighty spirit-filled \\"Pentecostal season\\" that accompanied the completion and springtime dedication of the Kirtland Temple, all of which made 1836 a particularly momentous year for him. But then, at year's end, and only 11 months after his priesthood ordination, Abel was, under the hands of Seventies President Zebedee Coltrin, ordained a Seventy and inducted into that priesthood body's Third Quorum on 20 December (and later licensed to said priesthood office at Nauvoo in 1841 by Seventies Presidents Joseph Young, Brigham's brother, and Albert P. Rockwood). As if such an outpouring of heavenly gifts still weren't enough, Elijah also received at this time his patriarchal blessing under the hands of the Prophet Joseph's father, Presiding Patriarch Joseph Smith, Sr (this ordinal revelation of, what is meant to be, a \\"declaration of lineage\\" through the church patriarch was recorded by Warren A. Cowdery, a church scribe and newspaper editor, but also a brother to Assistant President of the Church Oliver Cowdery). The Patriarch began: \\"Brother Able [sic] ... the Lord hast had his eye upon thee, and brought thee through straits and thou hast come to be rec[k]oned with the saints of the most High.\\" Important here to note, at the outset of this \\"father's blessing\\" which Father Smith \\"seals\\" upon Abel, is that the revelatory voice itself concedes that \\"Thou hast been ordained an Elder ... to secure thee against the power of the destroyer\\" and \\"thou shalt be blessed even forever\\" (italics added). The common practice when giving patriarchal blessings was to declare an individual to be a descendant of a specific tribe of Israel. Abel, however, was declared an \\"orphan\\" from a father who \\"hath never done his duty toward thee,\\" but — just as if he were Father Smith's \\"own son\\" — Elijah was promised \\"Thou shalt be made equal to thy brethren, and thy soul be white in eternity and thy robes glittering.\\" In this way Abel was perhaps instead \\"adopted\\" into the House of Israel, for the recorded blessing does not specifically declare his tribal lineage (then, too, with Abel's diverse bloodline mixture, the predominant affiliation may have remained for the patriarch somewhat ambiguous or unclear). The glorious promises the blessing does reveal, including the pronouncement, \\"Thy name is written in the Lamb's book of life,\\" are duly warranted, however, \\"because of the covenants of thy fathers\\" (which terminology does tend to imply for Latter-day Saints, however, an Abrahamic descent). Yet a realization of those promises are still declared contingent upon Abel's \\"seek[ing] first the kingdom of heaven\\" (i.e., living a righteous life that seeks to build up God's kingdom on earth while enduring faithfully to the end, to merit one's heavenly crown). But also in 1836, \\"to secure [him] against the power of the destroyer,\\"Patriarchal Blessing of Elijah Abel, c. 1836, recorded by W. A. Cowdery with penned preamble, \\"[Patriarchal] Blessing of Elijah Able [sic] who was born in Frederick County, Maryland, July 25th 1808.\\" \\"Joseph Smith’s Patriarchal Blessing Record\\" (1833-1843), 88. LDS Church Archives. Abel was among those who received the first of the church's revealed \\"higher\\" ordinances — that of the \\"Initiatory\\" — and he was thus \\"washed and anointed\\" in the Kirtland Temple, ostensibly by Judge Alvah Beaman and Ruben P. Hedlock (as is now corroborated by a document that in 2019 was catalogued by archivists of The Joseph Smith Papers project). For although Zebedee Coltrin, some forty-five years after the fact and apparently in error, claimed to have washed and anointed Elijah himself, Abel informed then-Apostle Joseph F. Smith that Coltrin did not in fact perform this sacred ordinance, which now seems supported by evidence.The historical record cites Zebedee Coltrin, in (what evidence now discredits as being) his temple \\"anointing\\" capacity on Abel's behalf, as claiming to have experienced \\"unpleasant feelings\\" — the most vile, in fact, that he'd ever felt in his life — when his hands came into contact with Elijah's less-than-white skin (Coltrin was 75-years-old when he gave this testimony in 1879, saying that he only \\"administered\\" the ordinance at the Prophet Joseph Smith's express direction, vowing thereafter to \\"never again anoint another person who had Negro blood in him, unless I was commanded by the Prophet to do so\\" — See Stevenson, \\"Negro Preacher,\\" p. 176; Bringhurst, \\"Neither White nor Black,\\" Ch 4, note 78). As a postscript to this ordinal occasion of 1836, then, it seems a curious fact that no such loathsome feeling of discomfort as was ostensibly felt by Coltrin was ever reported or intimated as having been experienced by Father Smith, when he boldly laid his hands on the crown of Elijah Abel's head to, as it were, bless him as he would his \\"own son.\\" The prophetic words of warning, comfort, counsel and promise, moreover, which flowed on that occasion from the grand old patriarch's lips might well have been for this blessing's African-American recipient among the most glorious his young ears had ever heard. Mission to Upper Canada During the late 1830s, Abel labored as a missionary in New York and Upper Canada, an assignment which, for the Prophet Joseph's part, may have played into a safe- haven and proselyting solution for black slave refugees while also helping to create an effective deflection from perceived Mormon sympathies toward the abolitionist movement in the United States (a perception that agitated an already unfavorable situation for the Latter-day Saints as they sought to realize their dreams for a \\"Zion\\" community in Missouri). In June 1838, while Abel was serving in St. Lawrence County, New York, he baptized 25-year-old Eunice Ross Kinney, who throughout her life and even after Abel's death remembered him as a \\"powerful\\" minister, one who had been \\"ordained [i.e., by proxy sanctioned, commissioned, sent forth with authority] by Joseph the martyr.\\"Kinney, Eunice. (5 July 1885). Letter to Wingfield Watson. L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. Provo, Utah. See also Eunice Kinney, \\"My Testimony of the Latter Day Work\\". (c. 1885). Microfilm typescript, MS 4226. LDS Church Archives. Abel taught Kinney and others he baptized that \\"the time was drawing near for [Christ's] coming but He would not come till God had a people prepared to receive Him, with all the gifts and blessings that adorned His church anciently,\\"Concepts germane to an understanding of Mormonism's claim to a restoration of primitive Christianity and its promise of a paradisaical return to the Edenic \\"garden of the Lord\\" are informed by Underwood (1993), who frames eschatologically the faith's declaration of a dramatic reclamation of \\"pristine purity\\": \\"Primitivism focuses on what is to be restored, while millenarianism emphasizes when and how the former glory will be recovered. The link between primordium and millennium is well illustrated in Mormonism\\" (p. 140). and Abel in his ministry oft-quoted the Apostle Peter: \\"Think it not strange, brethren, concerning the fiery trials\\"Fiery trials\\" and affliction touched the lives of missionaries and potential gospel proselytes alike in the history of early Mormonism. As an illustration of this, and to provide a glimpse of Abel's exercise of priesthood power, Jackson (2014) presents instances of Abel's performance of ancillary priesthood ordinances while in the mission field. One was on behalf of Eunice Kinney, whose mind and spiritual sensibilities had become clouded by a spirit of darkness — her mind and soul \\"wracked\\" with doubt, frustration, and anger. Upon receiving in \\"vision\\" a revelation of her distress and being commanded by the spirit of God to do so, Abel immediately took leave to attend to her, whereupon he \\"rebuked\\" for her sake the oppressive spirit so afflicting her, explaining, after the evil had fled, that he had been commanded to \\"rebuke the power that was destroying\\" her. The other ordinal action was on behalf of Eunice's husband. But for Mr. Kinney it was not an ordinance of blessing but one, rather, of biblical cursing — referred to as a \\"dusting of the feet.\\" The same was revealed by Christ to His apostles (see Matt 10:14-15; Luke 10:10-12; Acts 13:51), and it was an ordinal measure that in July 1830 had been restored through modern revelation to Joseph Smith (D&C; 24:15; 84:92-95), and then directed and recommended, as prompted by the spirit of God, to ordained ministers of the gospel, of which Abel was one. Because Elijah could yet see salvational hope for his gospel reviler, this only \\"partial\\" invocation of the ordinal curse — to help assuage the railing disbelief of an \\"unbeliever\\" — could still serve as a \\"testimony\\" or witness against severe or scornful rejection and contempt for the gospel message. In this case, just such a mocking derision was made manifest in the behavior of Mr. Kinney, who bitterly and publicly renounced Abel's gospel teachings, demanding a \\"sign\\" of their truthfulness. As Elijah was scripturally aware that any miraculous sign must follow only \\"them that believe\\" (Mark 16:17) and that they who request such are of \\"a wicked and adulterous generation\\" (Matt 16:4), he declared to Mr. Kinney: \\"You shall have what you asked, but it will make your heart ache.\\" Abel then, by his priesthood authority, invoked an ordinal cursing of \\"sore affliction\\" which would follow Mr. Kinney's disbelief \\"until you repent and humble yourself before God.\\" Eunice thereafter reported that Abel's words were \\"fulfilled to the letter,\\" their many subsequent joint afflictions culminating in the great anguish of seeing their three-year-old son at death's door with an illness beyond the skill of physicians. Humbled to tears, Mr. Kinney prayed for forgiveness, and the child soon thereafter returned to full health. The Kinneys, as Eunice later recounted in their conversion story, immediately recognized the hand of God in the literal fulfillment of Abel's words, and both \\"went down into the water and [were] buried with Christ in baptism.\\" Abel then confirmed them members of the Church by the \\"laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\\" (Jackson, pp. 64-67; Underwood, pp. 27, 49, 51, 71-72). which are to try you...\\" (1 Pet 4:12). Due to civil unrest and rebellion in Upper Canada, Abel's missionary travels were not infrequently punctuated with perilous situations and persecutions; he was even falsely accused of the murder of a family of six and aggressively pursued by a mob bearing hot tar and feathers. And yet such circumstances of unwarranted strife and even torment were certainly not unfamiliar to many Mormon missionaries of the time, nor to their leaders. In retrospect, Abel's providential escape from his enemies in his foreign travels to the East did seem to fulfill a patriarchal promise (while also foreshadowing a dreadful civil warJoseph Smith's Christmas Day 1832 prophecy at Kirtland, Ohio (D&C; 87) foretelling a great war and even greater ones to follow antecedent to the Lord's Second Coming seems to be, in the declaration of Elijah Abel's patriarchal blessing four years later, referenced quite vividly by the Prophet's father, Joseph Smith, Sr. That war, as section 87 of the book of Doctrine & Covenants boldy anticipates, was to begin with \\"the rebellion of South Carolina\\" and proceed in its \\"sore vexation\\" of both the \\"Northern States\\" and \\"Southern States,\\" who would \\"call on ... the nation of Great Britain, as it is called\\" and on \\"other nations\\" for aid in their defense. This great war between North and South would \\"terminate in the death and misery of many souls\\" (verses 1, 3). As the Prophet warned in the final year of his life: \\"I see, by the visions of the Almighty, this nation, if she continues to disregard the cries and petitions of her [oppressed people] ... that God will come out of his hiding place and vex this nation with a sore vexation — yea, the consuming wrath of an offended God shall [with] distress and woe ... smoke through the nation\\" (Underwood, pp. 47-48). But this great civil conflict would only serve, the Lord declares through His prophet, as the starting point — for it would initiate, as Jackson aptly describes the future advent, \\"a whole series of wars 'poured out upon all nations', an uncanny prediction of the rise of total war and the total state,\\" which would literally, as Father Smith prophesied to Elijah, \\"lay waste the nations\\" (Jackson, pp. 56-58; 93; 113). that would soon strike at the heart of his own country): > Thou shalt see [the destroyer's] power in laying waste the nations, & the > wicked slaying the wicked, while blood shall run down the streets like > water, and thy heart shall weep over their calamities. Angels shall visit > thee and thou shalt receive comfort. They shall call thee blessed and > deliver thee from thine enemies. They shall break thy bands and keep thee > from afflictions. Nauvoo, temple building & civil marriage Abel moved from Kirtland to Commerce (soon renamed Nauvoo), Illinois in 1839, upon returning from his Canadian mission. He may have settled on the property he came to own — Block 111, located northwest of the city \\"flats\\", on the banks of the Mississippi. While living at Nauvoo, Abel continued to further immerse himself in church work and activity. One such duty was the sacred privilege of performing \\"baptisms for the dead\\" (the second of the church's \\"higher\\" ordinances to be revealed), of which Abel is known in his life to have performed at least two: one for a friend by the name of \\"John F. Lancaster\\", and one for his mother, Delilah. In this early period of the church, and before the full \\"temple endowment\\" or \\"celestial marriage\\" rites (among the church's highest) had been revealed, these hallowed ordinances for the Saints' departed loved ones were initially performed, not in temples as they would later be, but generally in the frigid waters of the Mississippi River, upon the winding banks of which their \\"City Beautiful\\" had been built. Soon, however, the performance of these rites for the deceased were transferred to more suitable and sacred settings amidst 12-oxen fonts, such as would grace the magnificent Nauvoo Temple then rising majestically on a high bluff above the city — in the splendid construction of which (1841–46) Elijah was blessed to employ his talents. Another of Abel's duties included acting as an undertaker (for the most part, he was likely responsible for the fashioning of coffins and the digging of graves) at the request of Joseph Smith (this may have been in response to the area-sweeping Malaria epidemic of 1839-40). Abel continued, of course, to work in Nauvoo as a carpenter (he was a member of the group called the House Carpenters of the Town of Nauvoo), and it is clear that while Abel was at Nauvoo he was personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph, whom he considered a dear friend. Joseph's high estimation of Abel is palpably evident in the Prophet's dictated phrasing of Elijah's priesthood license: Therein, after declaring his ordination as \\"an Elder\\" of the restored church of Christ, Joseph recommends Elijah as his \\"worthy brother in the Lord,\\" one who is \\"duly authorized\\" to spread the gospel in a manner \\"equal to the authority of that Office\\" — a man of \\"good moral character,\\" possessing \\"zeal for the cause of righteousness,\\" with a \\"diligent desire to persuade men to forsake evil & embrace truth ... Praying for his success & prosperity in our Redeemer's Cause,\\" the Prophet thus certifies Abel unequivocally, and \\"confidently\\" recommends him \\"to all candid and upright people\\" as \\"a worthy member of society\\" deserving of all \\"fellowship and esteem.\\"Priesthood License of Elijah Abel.

See also a scanned image of the certificate at the online document repository of The Joseph Smith Papers Project. In turn, Abel's love and devotion for the Prophet were palpably manifest when, on 6 June 1841, he and six other men, including Hosea Stout, quickly mobilized themselves as an expeditionary militia force to attempt the rescue of Joseph Smith after his unlawful arrest by Missouri and Illinois officers at Quincy, Illinois. By the time they reached Quincy, however, Smith having obtained a writ of habeas corpus had been returned safely to Nauvoo.History of the Church, 4:365. In 1842 Abel gathered up his belongings (deeding his Block 111 property to Nauvoo Stake President William Marks) and moved again, this time returning back to Cincinnati, Ohio, probably on assignment by Joseph Smith. There he continued his carpentry and boarded for a time with a local painter, one \\"John Price\\" on Eighth Street, between Sycamore and Broadway. But on 16 February 1847, thirty-nine-year-old Elijah married 16-year-old Mary Ann AdamsMary Adams' Parents. The Ohio county of residence of Mary Ann's parents (John and Anna Weston Adams) at the time of their deaths — Hamilton, located just 15 miles north of Cincinnati — is, curiously, the home county of Ezekiel Roberts, the Mormon elder who baptized Elijah Abel in 1832. Stevenson (2014) suggests, therefore, that Hamilton County may have been where Elijah was baptized. But also, as Mary's family were erstwhile residents of Hamilton (perhaps moving there, to Mount Healthy township, after Mary's birth in Nashville), it may also have been where Elijah was first introduced to Mary. Hamilton County lies 60 miles south of Miami County, where lived, according to Jackson (2013), a possible sister of Elijah, Nancy Abel Rousten. of Nashville, Ohio,1850 Census. The census record registers Mary Ann Adams Abel as being 19 years old, and her husband Elijah Abel as being 42 years old, which effectively pushes back his birthdate to 1808. who was also, in her heritage, one-eighth African-American, or Octoroon.Mary Adam's Ancestors. Though little else is known, Mary's paternal grandmother was Asenath Bartlett (1779–1872) of Townsend, Massachusetts, whose mother and grandmother shared a first name: \\"Submit.\\" Abel acted as a leader of the church in Cincinnati, and was recognized as such by Joseph Smith, who pronounced to Orson Hyde and others, \\"Go to Cincinnati ... and find an educated negro, who rides in his carriage, and you will see a man who has risen by the power of his own mind to his exalted state of respectability.\\" Not all church leaders were as accepting of Abel, however. Meeting in Cincinnati, 1843 On 25 June 1843, a regional conference occurred in Cincinnati (then a hot-bed of conflict between what generally were viewed as Underground Railroad-escaping blacks and abolitionist-hating Irish Catholics) where the apostles John E. Page, Orson Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, and future-apostle Lorenzo Snow presided as part of a \\"Traveling High Council\\" to organize a Mormon branch there. During the conference questions regarding Abel and his membership were addressed, including those that touched upon recent complaints from some of the local \\"white\\" populace about Abel's public preaching activity. Apostle John E. Page stated that while \\"he respected a coloured Brother, wisdom forbid that we should introduce [him] before the public.\\" Pratt and Kimball supported Page's statements, and the leaders resolved to restrict Abel's activities as a member of the church. At the conclusion of the conference, Abel was called to serve a second mission locally, but he was instructed to visit and teach only the \\"coloured population\\". In their deliberations, the leaders had also referenced some of Abel's potentially threatening actions that stemmed from his time in Upper Canada, where his activity to encourage flight to the American \\"Zion\\" from the civil uprisings there was viewed with disdain by his colleagues, for such activity ostensibly may have been seen by the British government as smacking of \\"pro-American sympathizing,\\" or even treason in absentia — potentially inciting, or further exacerbating, continued revolt. The missionary associates who so accused him (e.g., John Beckstead, Christopher Merkeley, John Broeffle, and also some, incidentally, like Zenas Gurley and James Blakeslee, who later apostatizedAfter the Smith brothers' martyrdom and the church's succession crisis, Zenas Gurley, now a Seventy, became disaffected and apostatized, thereafter joining with the \\"Strangites\\" and their leader James Strang, who excommunicated Gurley after his 1852 break with them over their practice of polygamy. Gurley, who had led a branch of Strangites in Wisconsin, went on to help establish and to lead what later became known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, serving, as would his son, as one of its apostles. Together with Elijah Abel's old stake president, William Marks (who had also apostatized), Gurley ordained Joseph Smith III (the Prophet Joseph's eldest surviving son) as the new church's president in 1860 (see Stevenson, 2013 and 2014; Jackson). Gurley's son reported that it was through a very affecting sermon his father heard preached in Ontario by Mormon elder James Blakeslee that he was converted to the restored gospel, \\"absorbed,\\" as he was, \\"by the wonderful but glorious news of communication being once more opened between the heavens and the earth.\\" It is possible, too, that Elijah Abel in some way participated with Blakeslee in Gurley's conversion and baptism; what is certain is that there was an association of Blakeslee with Abel in their proselyting labors in Canada and upstate New York (Stevenson). As for Blakeslee, he, like Gurley, eventually defected to the lure of Strangism and apostatized from the church. Baptized as Elijah Abel was, in 1832, Blakeslee went on to organize, ten years later, a branch of the church in Utica, New York, where he helped to shelter the Saints fleeing from the dangerous chaos and civil strife born of the Upper Canada Rebellion. And just as Gurley had done, Blakeslee ended up renouncing the Prophet of the Restoration — in May 1844 — after the esoteric Latter-day Saint doctrine of \\"plural marriage\\" had begun to show a more public face. Along with Francis Higbee, Charles Ivins, and Austin Cowles, who all embraced, as it were, the same spirit of disillusionment and apostasy, Blakeslee was excommunicated. He continued in this wayward vein, just as Gurley had done, by adopting the philosophies of James Strang. And later, both men, having abandoned the Strangites, adopted the teachings of William Smith, the Prophet's apostate brother. Smith had begun his own movement in 1847, attracting the likes of fellow apostate (and former apostle) Lyman Wight. But when William, too, announced his own new version of polygamy, both Gurley and Blakeslee became fully disenchanted. Their joint exit from their affiliations with all of these groups that had gone the way of polygamy was the catalyst that gave birth to what later became known as the Community of Christ. Together with Joseph Smith III, Gurley as a member of that church's First Presidency, and Blakeslee, as a member of its Council of Twelve Apostles, the leadership of this breakaway LDS faith would likewise be required to confront the question of blacks in relation to priesthood. That moment came in 1865, with the end of the American Civil War — which unfathomable devastation the Prophet Joseph Smith had prophesied would strike at the very heart of the nation, to answer (by \\"feel[ing] the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God\\") for its centuries-long sins against God and against His oppressed children, arising as that terrible conflict would \\"through the slave question\\" (D&C; 87:6; D&C; 130:12-13 - 2 April 1843). This governing body confessed candidly at that time that they did not yet feel they possessed wisdom sufficient to address such a delicate, complex issue. But in 1889 a freed slave living in Upper Canada became the first black member to be ordained to the RLDS priesthood (Stevenson, 2013 and 2014). from the church) cited also Abel's claims \\"that an elder ... had as much authority\\" as a high priest in the church and, most outrageously for them — in light of early Mormonism's millenarian worldview that espoused gathering to a \\"central\\" Zion — \\"that there would be stakes of Zion in all the world.\\" Yet despite these allegationsThe \\"missionary\\" allegations against Abel had originally surfaced in a 1 June 1839 meeting convened at Quincy, Illinois — precisely during the time when Joseph Smith, now escaped from his bitter Liberty Jail confinement, was laboring with the struggling Missouri-driven Saints in establishing their new home at Commerce (Nauvoo), 47 miles to the north, on the banks of the Mississippi. As such, Smith was not present at the hearing, nor therefore does the degree of priority for addressing its concern, nor even perhaps its ascertained validity based on reports and information, appear to have been very high in the Prophet's estimation (consumed as he surely was with worries for food and shelter for his people). Nevertheless, convened at the Quincy meeting were quorum members and presiding officers of the Seventy. Also attending was a young 23-year-old elder visiting his brother, who lived about two miles from the town. He had, only two weeks earlier, arrived from Commerce, where he had spent three days among \\"the elders of the church\\" in counsel with \\"the presidents of the church\\" — Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and Sidney Rigdon — from whom he had received \\"much instruction\\" (Sessions). His name was Jedediah M. Grant. The energetic young elder had come with a petition from North Carolina requesting that he be granted re-appointment to return to continue his missionary labors there. The request was granted, but before he left, he was asked to fulfill one last assignment: for somehow it was Grant, an elder, whom the presiding officers had selected as the priesthood representative they wished to have convey to the body of the Seventy the complaints brought before them by Elijah Abel's missionary associates. And so, with Elijah himself strangely in absentia (for there is no mention in the minutes of his presence), Jedediah Grant performed this parting duty on the day before he boarded a return-steamboat headed for North Carolina to there begin a second mission for the church (one which historians have described as \\"three legendary years\\") in the southern states (Sessions). As for Abel's accusers, Zenas H. Gurley was a new member of the church – a poverty-stricken Wesleyan Methodist from Ontario – who had been baptized and ordained an elder by late spring 1838, after Abel had been laboring in upstate New York and Canada for some months. But it appears the two were in some sense \\"companions,\\" as together, in mid-to-late June, they ordained to the priesthood one Captain William Riley of Williamsburg. One of the participants at the Quincy hearing who sat amidst the gathered Seventy, and who heard the testimony of Abel's missionary \\"accusers\\" — indeed, one who included himself as one of the \\"testators\\" — was not, however, one of Abel's missionary colleagues — for his name was Zebedee Coltrin. But as one of the Seven Presidents of the Quorums of Seventies, Coltrin was there, it seems, to preside as well. Also testifying at the hearing were John Broeffle (who in his correspondence consistently referred to his fellow missionary Abel as \\"the Negro\\") and his cousins John & George Beckstead, Robert Burton, and Moses Smith. It had been to the home of the Beckstead brothers' father, Alexander (an LDS leader in the Ontario region), that a violent mob once had pursued \\"the Negro preacher\\" with tar and feathers and a trumped-up accusation of a family's mass-murder, but Beckstead safely hid Abel away. Brother Beckstead later professed that he had triumphed in dispersing the mob by getting \\"his wife to shoot them\\" (Stevenson, 2013, p. 200). What seems most to have agitated Elijah's colleagues was Abel's presumption of his status within the church but also the confident, lofty views he seems to have espoused regarding his priesthood office and, especially, that he viewed himself — a black elder of the restored Church — as perhaps helping to create a \\"welding link\\" between the races, bringing them together in a \\"bond\\" of love and mutual understanding. Abel was correct in his view that the offices of elder, Seventy, and high priest within the church possess the \\"same authority,\\" for they do — the Melchizedek Priesthood. And in the absence of a higher office, an elder officiates with the same authority and in lieu of that office. But Abel's aspirations for equality, misinterpreted perhaps in various ways, clearly did not sit well with his missionary \\"brethren.\\" Neither, in his millenarianist zeal, did Abel's encouragement of the Ontario Saints (a large number indeed following his advice) to flee over the St. Lawrence river from the rifle-fire, danger and chaos of their civil strife (for many were seen falsely as \\"subversives\\" and \\"rebels\\") to the relative safety of the American \\"Zion.\\" But even as Abel involved himself in this \\"Moses exodus\\" type of adventure, seen by his accusers to be of itself risky and dangerous on many levels, Abel simultaneously continued also to profess that \\"stakes of Zion\\" would one day be found \\"in all the world.\\" One accuser, Christopher Merkeley, who also may have been a companion of Elijah's, complained that Abel had, moreover, at one point, threatened to knock Merkeley down during a water passage up Lake Ontario. But all of this aside — with the Ontario Saints being vilely persecuted, dragged to the courts, thrown into prison, and chased by mobs amidst an explosive civil war involving Brits, French-Canadians, and Americans — Abel biographer Russell W. Stevenson concludes that Abel's advice to leave Canada, thereby avoiding the violent skirmishes, possible arrest and even death, \\"was sound; the St. Lawrence Riverway had become a war zone.\\" Even so, the Saints, by in fact heeding Abel's advice in looking to the American \\"Zion\\" as a refuge, hadn't realized \\"that it [Missouri] was a second powder keg\\" (see Stevenson, 2013 and 2014; Jackson; D&C; 57:1-4). of teaching what was, at the time, perceived by many to be \\"false doctrine,\\" no disciplinary action was taken against Elijah. Indeed, today, Abel's statements seem prophetic. Up until 1843, Abel had suffered very little discrimination from within the church. The results of the conference, however, marked a turning point for Abel and other colored, faithful adherents of the faith. For the first time, race was used as a criterion for limiting church activities. The leaders of the conference, however, made no statement that would suggest that the resolution of the meeting had been based on heaven-sent revelation or that it constituted any sort of doctrinal mandate, but rather, they deemed it an act of prudence to address the dynamic racial and politically turbulent climate of the times. The 1849 priesthood ban As a leader in the church at Cincinnati and one of the three presiding area Seventies at a specially convened branch conference on 1 June 1845, Elijah Abel moved for the excommunication of three women — identified as \\"Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Evans, and Miss Jane Roberts\\" — for \\"speaking disrespectfully against the leaders of the church,\\" a motion which was \\"moved and seconded.\\" The church, despite reorganization, still reeled in over the loss of its beloved Prophet-martyr, murdered at Carthage Jail, along with his brother Hyrum, by a mob less than a year before. But by overcoming previous dissent and discord, the Cincinnati branch of 32 members \\"all in good standing\\" could claim that it was, by mid-1845, more unified than it had been \\"for the last three years.\\" The few black individuals adhering to the Latter-day Saint faith had the full fellowship of the early church, including entering into priesthood leadership positions, such as Abel had. In 1844 at Boston, Joseph T. Ball, for example, had been the first man of African descent to become a branch president — indeed, the first ever to preside over an LDS congregation; Ball had been earlier called in 1841 by the Quorum of the Twelve on a mission to South America. But then, in 1849, Brigham Young, who was the prophet of the church at the time (having succeeded Joseph to the church presidency after the Prophet's martyrdom), issued a church-wide ban on blacks from being ordained to the priesthood (although the policy's initial reveal by Young to the Twelve may have occurred up to two years earlier at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, possibly \\"between 8 and 14 April 1847\\"). Young's pronouncements in 1849 constitute the earliest known statements which officially exclude blacks from an ordinal endowment or a wielding of priesthood power, stating in part, \\"The Lord has given [Cain's descendants] blackness, so as to give the children of Abel an opportunity to cult[ivate] [or 'keep' — i.e., preserve his \\"priesthood birthright\\" and maintain as separate] his place with his des[cendants] in the eternal worlds.\\"Meeting Minutes, 13 February 1849. \\"Selected Collections\\". LDS Church Archives. The first official LDS Church documentation of Priesthood denial was this 13 February statement by President Brigham Young included in his \\"Manuscript History\\" (a companionate statement to the \\"Cain's descendants\\" quotation above), given in response to an enquiry by newly called apostle Lorenzo Snow regarding Priesthood redemption for black Africans: \\"Because Cain cut off the lives of Abel to prevent him and his posterity [from] getting the ascendency over Cain and his generations ... the Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the Priesthood, that Abel and his progeny might yet ... have their dominion, place, and blessings ... in the world to come.\\" But whereas Joseph Smith who, in his 1844 campaign for the U.S. Presidency, had come to view slavery as \\"an evil\\" to be eradicated via slave- owner compensation, Brigham Young saw it as a Godly \\"sentence\\" upon \\"the seed of Ham\\" that the abolitionist proponents of the Civil War, in their attempts to \\"destroy the decrees of the Almighty\\" and to free the slaves, could not and would not undo — see Journal of Discourses 10:250. But what seems most peculiar today about the 19th century Latter-day Saint stance with respect to race is that, according to the pseudepigraphic work Joseph and Aseneth, first brought to light in 1890, modern Josephites (which Latter-day Saints claim themselves predominantly to be) share bloodline relations with the Egyptians through Asenath, daughter of Pentephres, a royal Egyptian priest and, therefore, a descendant of the Canaanite Egyptus, according to LDS scripture (Abr 1:23-27). This decision may have been brought about, in part, by the actions of William McCary, an African-American convert to the church with mixed Indian blood, living in Cincinnati, who believed he was a prophet and claimed on various occasions to be Jesus and Adam, father of the human race. For in 1847, as the Saints paused at Winter Quarters on the banks of the Missouri, before continuing on to the Rocky Mountains, a seemingly penitent McCary had expressed to Brigham Young and members of the Quorum of the Twelve his anguish and confusion over his racial status, saying that he wished to be seen as \\"a common brother\\" despite being \\"a little shade darker,\\" to which Brigham kindly reassured him: \\"We don't care about the color ... It's nothing to do with blood, for of one blood has God made all flesh ... We have one of the best Elders, an African in Lowell [Massachusetts] — a barber [referring to Q. Walker Lewis].\\"William McCary meeting with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. (26 March 1847). Recorded by Thomas Bullock. \\"Minutes\\" (1839-1877). LDS Church Archives. President Young enjoined McCary to \\"shew by your actions\\" a genuine repentance before God, for, he said, the Saints have but \\"to serve the Lord with all our hearts\\" and \\"repent [to] regain what we have lost.\\" Yet following this incident at the Mormon encampment, in which McCary had been offered forgiveness and church fellowship by Brigham and the Twelve (who had even, at Young's request, pooled together their private funds to assist him in securing a wagon and supplies to join the Saints in their westward trek), McCary broke their trust and was promptly excommunicated. It was discovered that McCary had performed, within his own house, polygamous \\"sealings\\" with Caucasian women that were clearly unauthorized. In the wake of McCary's scandal and excommunication, the Brethren immediately distanced themselves from him while encouraging the Saints, to ensure their own safety, to do the same. For his part, McCary made a \\"fast trot\\" from Mormon society and the surrounding settlements, fleeing to Missouri, but then later and finally to Canada. Some residents of Cincinnati, Winter Quarters, and other townships had entertained McCary's teachings, including his promulgation of an \\"immediate consummation\\" sort of polygamous union, and upon whose adherents he was said to confer \\"priesthood blessings\\" using a \\"golden rod.\\" But even after the 1847-49 official prohibition for all Latter-day Saint \\"brethren of color,\\"Utah Territory Black Slavery Code enactment, January–February 1852. Negro-slave policy in the Territory of Utah (together with a formal reiteration or official declaration of LDS Church policy regarding the 1849 priesthood ban) was codified into law by Utah's territorial legislature on 4 February 1852, one month after Governor Brigham Young appeared before that body on 16 January to formally petition for the policy's codification. Young's gubernatorial remarks on that occasion were recorded by then-Apostle Wilford Woodruff. See Lester E. Bush, Jr. (1984). Chapter 3: \\"Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview,\\" in Lester E. Bush, Jr. and Armand L. Mauss (eds). Neither White nor Black: Mormon Scholars Confront the Race Issue in a Universal Church. Midvale, Utah: Signature Books. Elijah Abel himself continued to remain involved in the church. As one who already held the priesthood, he continued to serve as a Seventy in Cincinnati (inclusively from 1842 to 1853)Meeting Minutes, 25 June 1843. \\"Conference of Elders of the Church,\\" Cincinnati, Ohio. LDS Church Archives. and years later, in the autumn of 1883, also served yet another mission to this former hometown shortly before his death.\\"Deaths,\\" Deseret News, December 25, 1884. As the church continued to migrate its members to the mountain-valleys of the West, however, Mormons were exposed to a larger population of blacks, and anti-black political attitudes continued to increase. Even before moving West, other influential black members of the church had included \\"Black Pete\\" — a member of the \\"Morley Family\\" who in the early days of the church at Kirtland, Ohio became notorious, by drawing from his Protestant revivalist \\"enthusiasm\\" and \\"slave shout\\" past, in appearing authentic to the area's new members (particularly its young people) as the \\"revelator\\" he claimed to be. He was ultimately disfellowshipped by Joseph Smith because of his teachings and ecstatic demonstrations, disappearing from the community soon thereafter. And the aforementioned Q. Walker Lewis from Lowell, Massachusetts, although \\"well respected by early Mormon leaders,\\" also found himself under scrutiny during this period. Lewis was ordained an elder by William Smith, Joseph Smith Jr.'s younger brother who later apostatized. And so it was, that by 1847, in the unfavorable light of these and other developments, Abel's authority had begun to be challenged, despite his being well-respected within his church community. In the immediate future span of only fourteen years this worsening social and political climate would culminate in national civil war. Trek west & family life in Utah In May 1853, Abel and his family migrated as part of the Appleton M. Harmon pioneer company to Utah Territory, the new headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After the company's arrival in the Salt Lake Valley on 17 October and his family's initial move to Mill Creek just a few miles south of Salt Lake City, Abel continued to work as a carpenter as part of the LDS public works program. One of his main projects, given his already-rich personal history in temple- building, was the labor he performed in the decades-long construction (1853-1893) of the Salt Lake Temple. By 1860 the Abel family had moved to Salt Lake City's Thirteenth Ward, and only a short distance from the Temple Block. For a short time a 43-year-old white schoolteacher by the name of Alex Warrender, who in 1858 had crossed the overland trail as a teamster, boarded with the Abel family. Abel himself remained a member of the Seventy and continued to be active in the church. Along with Mary Ann and their oldest son Moroni, Elijah was rebaptized on 15 March 1857 (by priesthood officiator and millwright Archibald Gardner; and confirmed by beekeeper Washington Lemmon) as part of the Brigham Young and Jedediah M. Grant-inspired \\"Mormon Reformation\\". In the Saints' storied \\"Move South\\" during the Utah War, to avoid conflict with Johnston's invading army in 1858, Abel stayed behind to \\"assist\\" his fellow \\"watchmen\\" to ensure, should the invaders make any false move, that the emptied city be set aflame and left in ashes. But the U.S. troops marched through Salt Lake City without incident. In addition to his carpentry, the Abels together managed the Farnham House hotel, located on 2nd South Street, which was advertised as a \\"first class\\" boarding house that boasted \\"good stabling and corrals.\\" The Abels' establishment charged $11/week for room & board ($9/week or $2/day for board only) and 75¢ for a single meal. By 1860, two more children were born to Elijah and Mary Ann, and by 1862, as the War to Prevent Southern Independence raged in the East, their growing family had relocated to the Tenth Ward. Very little is known about the personal lives of the Abel family. In 1870 they moved forty miles north to Ogden, Utah for a short time before returning to Salt Lake City. Of the known children born to Elijah and Mary Ann, three were born in Cincinnati — Moroni, Enoch, and Anna Rebecca, whom they named after Mary's mother — and five more in Utah Territory, all by 1870: Delilah, whom they named after Abel's mother, Mary, Elijah Jr., Maggie, and Flora. They also took into their home a young woman (about Moroni's age) from Ohio — Rola — whom they adopted. Utah residents during this period remembered the Abel family as traveling up and down the Wasatch front (a mountain valley stretch of contiguous towns from Provo to Ogden) entertaining audiences with their \\"minstrel shows\\". Abel biographer W. Kesler Jackson: > It seems most likely that Abel played the fiddle or violin, while the family > — including eight children between the ages of about one and twenty years > old — acted, danced, sang, or played along with their father on other > instruments. \\"There was a family of colored folks by the name of Able > [sic],\\" remembered one Utah resident, \\"who went around from ward to ward and > put on performances for the public.\\" Tragedy struck the family in 1871 when firstborn Moroni — son of Elijah and Mary's youth who had crossed the plains with them and just entered manhood — died. And only six years later, after the family had moved back to the territorial capital, Abel's dear Mary Ann herself, his 47-year-old wife of three decades, died of pneumonia on 27 November 1877 ... \\"Brigham Young died the same year,\\" wrote Russell W. Stevenson, \\"and Ables [sic] approached John Taylor, his successor, again requesting his endowment,\\" but it was again withheld from him. Yet notwithstanding the many years of repeated temple- ordinance denials for himself and his family from his honored Brethren (see below), Abel, ever-faithful, served a final mission to Ohio and Canada in 1883-84, during which period of service, however, he became ill. Further- declining health resulted in his returning to Utah in December 1884. Abel died only two weeks after his return, on Christmas Day — \\"in full faith of the Gospel,\\" his last-day-of-the-year obituary read. His body was interred at Salt Lake City Cemetery alongside Mary (whose headstone reassured loved ones: \\"Only Sleeping\\") and where his original grave marker is inscribed with the words of a seemingly reconciled soul: \\"Elijah Able — At Rest.\\" Denial of temple ordinances Although Abel remained a faithful member of the church his entire life, he was not exempt from discrimination that existed in his church and state. His membership, participation, and leadership in the church both during and after his Illinois and Ohio years was frequently questioned and challenged. After moving to Utah Territory, Abel asked Brigham Young for permission to be sealed to his wife and children, which was denied. Abel again requested a sealing five years later to his deceased wife, son, and daughter, this time from President John Taylor, who then passed it on for the body of the Twelve to consider. But his request was again refused, and neither was he allowed to enter the temple to be endowed. 1879 meeting on Joseph Smith's statements about blacks and the priesthood While there were yet no attempts to take away Abel's priesthood authority, that authority was questioned by church leaders. In 1879, a meeting was held on Saturday, 31 May, at the residence of Provo mayor Abraham O. Smoot to discuss the conflicting versions of Joseph Smith's views on blacks and the priesthood in response to Abel's petition to be sealed to his recently deceased wife. President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles John Taylor, his secretary L. John Nuttall, mayor Smoot, apostle Brigham Young, Jr. (son of the late prophet), and Zebedee Coltrin were in attendance. According to Nuttall, who detailed the meeting in his journal, Coltrin and Smoot made statements about all they could recollect Joseph Smith having ever said about blacks and the priesthood. John Taylor recounted a story he had remembered and then asked Coltrin to confirm if the account was accurate. In this story, Coltrin had at one time remarked that black people should not have the priesthood, to which Smith had responded with the account of the Apostle Peter's vision in Acts 10, in which he was commanded by God to \\"not call any man common or unclean\\" and to teach the Gentiles despite being a Jew himself, implying that blacks should have the priesthood. However, Coltrin denied that this conversation had ever taken place. Though it would seem apparent that the Prophet himself related the story to Taylor, the recorded minutes of the meeting do not make it clear where Taylor originally heard the story. Smoot — a SouthernerSmoot, as a slaveholder of the South, \\"once refused,\\" writes W. Kesler Jackson, \\"to hand out campaign literature for Joseph Smith's bid for the [U.S.] presidency because part of Smith's platform included a denunciation of slavery and a plan for compensated emancipation\\" (Jackson, p. 107). from a line of slaveholder progenitors who had himself continued his practice of it in Utah — stated that he, Thomas B. Marsh, Warren Parrish, and David W. Patten had asked Joseph Smith in 1836 and 1838 if blacks could have the priesthood, whereupon Joseph informed them that, while blacks could be baptized, including those who were enslaved (but solely with their master's consent), they could not hold the priesthood (it remains unclear, however, whether Smith's alleged priesthood reference was intended by him to apply only to blacks still in bondage). According to Nuttall, Coltrin and Smoot both wrote down their respective accounts in the course of the meeting, then signed their names to them. The brethren would in their deliberations regarding Abel and the validity of his priesthood ordination adjourn for the present but would, following a brief recess, resume their discussion within a few days' time. Some scholars of Mormon history describe the recollected statements given at the Smoot home in 1879 as \\"apocryphal\\"Stories considered by some to be \\"apocryphal\\" in nature continue to persist in collective memory, not only within Mormon culture generally (as the same may hold true in other faiths), but also as drawn from Elijah Abel's life specifically (Jackson). These stories include the much- repeated anecdote that Elijah lived for a time with Joseph Smith and his family at the Prophet's Nauvoo \\"home\\" — which, if the tale holds merit, most likely refers to the Joseph Smith log Homestead near the Mississippi river shore (Bringhurst, 1981, pp. 82; 100, note 23; Jackson, p. 62). There is also the story that Elijah was present at the Mansion House bedside of the Prophet's father at the time of the elder Smith's death in 1840 (which death was the result of lingering complications stemming from the Commerce, Illinois Malaria epidemic of 1839-40). However, this last oft-quoted tradition (Arave, 2002) appears actually to carry some validity by virtue of Abel's well- documented \\"undertaker\\" role at Nauvoo in providing caskets for the bodies of the dead (and perhaps even interment services). A degree of credence is lent to the tale also by the \\"paternal\\" connection Elijah shared with his patriarch, who in 1836 laid his hands upon Abel's head and pronounced a most cherished \\"patriarchal blessing\\" upon the young elder (Jackson). or, collectively, as \\"an artifact [...] recorded forty-five years after the fact.\\" In his biography of Abel, W. Kesler Jackson states that the two accounts given touching upon the doctrinal \\"priesthood and race\\" question contradict not only each other but also other historical records, just as the \\"facts\\" surrounding the actual priesthood ordination of Elijah Abel have long been contradictory, remaining for many years, until only recently, in a rather confused state. Some sources, for example, state that Abel was ordained to the priesthood by Joseph Smith, while other records indicate that he was ordained by Zebedee Coltrin.Minutes of the Seventies Journal, Hazen Aldrich, entry for 20 December 1836. LDS Church Archives, as cited by Alma Allred, \\"The Traditions of Their Fathers, Myth versus Reality in LDS Scriptural Writings,\\" in Newell G. Bringhurst and Darron T. Smith, eds. (2006). Black and Mormon. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. He was in fact, as stated and documented above, first ordained to the priesthood by Ambrose Palmer in January 1836, then as a Seventy by Coltrin in December of the same year. Coltrin claimed additionally, however, that Abel had been ordained to the Seventy in exchange for his work on the temples (at Kirtland and Nauvoo), but that Joseph Smith, after Coltrin later confronted him, and upon reflecting a moment on the matter, then realized his \\"error\\" and promptly \\"dropped\\" Abel, because of \\"his lineage\\", from the quorum. Coltrin reported that he had this conversation with Joseph Smith in 1834, yet Abel didn't receive the priesthood nor did Coltrin ordain him a Seventy until 1836 (thus making it impossible for Abel to have been \\"dropped\\" from any such ordinal capacity in 1834), nor was construction even begun on the Nauvoo Temple until 1841. Joseph Smith's nephew and later- successor to the church presidency, Joseph F. Smith, contradicted Coltrin, in turn, by professing: \\"Coltrin's memory [is] incorrect as to Brother Abel being dropped from the quorum of Seventies to which he belonged\\" (italics added). Smith punctuated his statement by pointing out that he had verified as being in Abel's possession two certificates (which notarized the 1836/1841 priesthood licensings referenced above) that declared Abel to be a bonafide elder of the church and a Seventy. Even so, what the 'Smoot meeting' at the end of May 1879 accomplished — beyond suddenly bringing into \\"formal\\" question Abel's long-held authority in a high-profile (and for Elijah possibly humiliating) setting after more than 40 years — was simply a reaffirmation (though momentarily placed on hold) of the LDS Church's 1849-born policy of excluding blacks from receiving the priesthood. The meeting did not change the fact (as neither those meetings preceding or following it would) that Elijah Abel had long been granted by a prophet of God, and retained yet still, the Melchizedek priesthood. 1879 meetings with Taylor, Smith, and the Seventy Within a week after the meeting to discuss Joseph Smith's statements on blacks and the priesthood (a recess that surely afforded Joseph F. Smith the required time for his investigation that resulted in a documented personal interview with Elijah Abel), the appointed brethren met again on 4 June to continue their discussion of the topic. Elijah Abel of course was there, and it may well have been for him somewhat reminiscent of a Salt Lake City Council House meeting he'd attended just two months earlier, on 25 March, consisting of 71 members from the church's 33 Seventies quorums. Abel had, on that occasion, stood and addressed the “general meeting of the Presidents and members of the Seventies,\\" fondly reflecting upon his nearly 45-years’ experience as a priesthood-bearing Latter-day Saint. He had recounted there — as he now did for his brethren again, in the first days of June — “his appointment an[d] ordination as a Seventy, and a member of the 3rd Quorum.\\" He recalled for them Joseph's personal words to him, \\"that those ... called to the Melchisadec [sic] Priesthood [having] magnified that calling would be sealed up unto eternal life.\\"\\"A Record of all the Quorums of Seventies in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\". (5 March 1879). CR3/51, box 3, folder 2. LDS Church Archives. \\"The chronological proximity of the Smoot meeting and Abel's defense at the Seventies meeting,\\" observes Jackson, \\"seems to indicate that the status of blacks (as it related to priesthood and temple ordinances) was then undergoing deep scrutiny at the highest levels. It makes sense that Abel would be asked to weigh in — as a long-time black Seventy.\\" Abel again now, in June, found himself personally defending his priesthood before his brethren, outlining especially for President Taylor and Apostle Joseph F. Smith its history — which was indeed precious to him — and reaffirming that the \\"Prophet Joseph told him he was entitled to the priesthood.\\"\\"Council Meeting Minutes\\". (4 June 1879). Lester E. Bush papers, Special Collections, J. Williard Marriott Library, University of Utah. Armored with these statements of personal testimony — and the promises he'd received not only from his revered patriarch, but more especially from Father Smith's prophet-son, who was the Lord's chosen mouthpiece on earth — Abel was defending his right to be sealed eternally to his family in the holy temple of God. Abel expressed to President Taylor his lifelong hope that his endowment of priesthood might prove one day \\"the welding link\\" (see D&C; 128:18) to bond all of God's people together regardless of race. By meeting's end, John Taylor — concluding at last that Joseph Smith had made \\"an exception\\" and had given Abel the priesthood despite his race, perhaps because he was an Octoroon (or one-eighth black) and perhaps also, as per Coltrin's testimony, because he had further proved his worthiness by helping to advance and to build the early church — decided that Abel's priesthood would be \\"allowed to remain.\\" Posthumous commentary on Abel's priesthood Notwithstanding this seeming triumph for Abel, Church President Joseph F. Smith, in 1902, 1904, and 1908 (his memory perhaps in a state of failing recollection of his theretofore stoic defense of Abel and his former pronouncements of 1879 and 1895 to the contrary), declared Abel's ordination to the priesthood as \\"null and void by [Joseph Smith] himself because of his blackness\\" — suggesting (based anew on Coltrin's antiquated testimony) that the Prophet Joseph before his death had, in realizing his \\"mistake\\", repented of his initial endorsement that Abel receive the priesthood. These statements just after the turn of the century, particularly astonishing by their posthumous nature (Abel having long-since expired from the world), were clearly inaccurate: for, from the moment of the Prophet Joseph's 1836 sanction of his priesthood ordination at Kirtland, Elijah Abel went on to faithfully serve for nearly half a century in the Third Quorum of the Seventy, until his death in 1884. Now, moreover, scarcely a score of years had passed since Joseph F. Smith had himself been the one to ordain Abel and to set him apart to serve a church mission immediately antecedent to the Mormon elder's death. President Smith's son who would later succeed him in the presidency, Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, went so far as to suggest that there had been two Elijah Abels — one white and one black.Letter of Joseph Fielding Smith to Mrs. Floren S. Preece, 18 January 1955. S. George Ellsworth Papers, Utah State University, Logan (see also Letter from Joseph Fielding Smith to Joseph H. Henderson, 10 April 1963). Legacy Though Abel died in 1884, his life and in particular his ordination to the priesthood were a topic of conversation and debate long after his death. When questions concerning Blacks receiving the priesthood or temple blessings arose, the story of Elijah Abel was often told. All eligible men within the LDS Church were, of course (albeit more than a century after the 1849 ban), admitted to the priesthood beginning in 1978 — when all former \\"authority\\" restrictions based on race were lifted with the revelation received by then-prophet and President of the Church Spencer W. Kimball. But long even before this, Abel's son and grandson, Enoch and Elijah, had both been ordained already to the Melchizedek priesthood: Enoch was ordained an elder on 27 November 1900; and Elijah to the same office on 29 September 1935.Bringhurst, Newell G.; Smith, Darron T., eds.

Davis wrote in a letter to Chemical News \\"A Chemical Engineer is a person who possesses chemical and mechanical knowledge, and who applies that knowledge to the utilisation, on a manufacturing scale, of chemical action.\\" He proposed the name Society of Chemical Engineers, for what was in fact constituted as the Society of Chemical Industry. At the first General Meeting of the Society in 1882, some 15 of the 300 members described themselves as chemical engineers, but the Society's formation of a Chemical Engineering Group in 1918 attracted about 400 members.Colin Duvall and Sean F, Johnston (2000) Scaling Up: The Institution of Chemical Engineers and the Rise of a New Profession Kluwer Academic Publishers In 1905 a publication called The Chemical Engineer was founded in the US,The Cornell daily Sun Volume XXV, Number 25, 26 October 1904 and in 1908 the American Institute of Chemical Engineers was established.John C. Olsen (December 1932), Chemical Engineering As A Profession: Origin and Early Growth of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers In 1924 the Institution of Chemical Engineers adopted the following definition: \\"A chemical engineer is a professional man experienced in the design, construction and operation of plant and works in which matter undergoes a change of state and composition.\\"Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers volume 2 page 23 (1924) As can be seen from the later definition, the occupation is not limited to the chemical industry, but more generally the process industries, or other situations in which complex physical and/or chemical processes are to be managed. The UK journal The Chemical Engineer (began 1956) has a series of biographies available online entitled “Chemical Engineers who Changed the World”, www.thechemicalengineer.com Chemical engineers who changed the world  Overview  Chemical engineers use computers to manage automated systems in production plants. Historically, the chemical engineer has been primarily concerned with process engineering, which can generally be divided into two complementary areas: chemical reaction engineering and separation processes. The modern discipline of chemical engineering, however, encompasses much more than just process engineering. Chemical engineers are now engaged in the development and production of a diverse range of products, as well as in commodity and specialty chemicals. These products include high-performance materials needed for aerospace, automotive, biomedical, electronic, environmental and military applications. Examples include ultra-strong fibers, fabrics, adhesives and composites for vehicles, bio-compatible materials for implants and prosthetics, gels for medical applications, pharmaceuticals, and films with special dielectric, optical or spectroscopic properties for opto-electronic devices. Additionally, chemical engineering is often intertwined with biology and biomedical engineering. Many chemical engineers work on biological projects such as understanding biopolymers (proteins) and mapping the human genome.  Employment and salaries According to a 2015 salary survey by the AIChE, the median annual salary for a chemical engineer was approximately $127,000.Chemical Engineering Progress June 2015 The survey was repeated in 2017 and the median annual salary dropped slightly to $124,000. The decrease in median salary was unexpected. A factor contributing to the decline may be that 2017’s survey was conducted by a different research and analysis firm. Median salaries ranged from $70,450 for chemical engineers with fewer than three years of experience to $156,000 for those with more than 40 years in the workforce. In the UK, the IChemE 2016 Salary Survey reported a median salary of approximately £57,000, with a starting salary for a graduate averaging £28,350.Institution of Chemical Engineers Annual Review 2016 Chemical engineering in the USA is one of the engineering disciplines with the highest participation of women, with 35% of students compared with 20% in engineering.Brawner, C. E., Lord, S. M., Layton, R. A., Ohland, M. W., & Long, R. A., (2015) International Journal of Engineering Education Vol. 31, No. 6(A), 1431, \\"Factors Affecting Women’s Persistence in Chemical Engineering\\" In the UK in 2014, students starting degrees were 25% female, compared with 15% in engineering.The Chemical Engineer, March 2015 p 20 US graduates who responded to a 2015 salary survey were 18.8% female.

The rocket exploded on its launch pad at the Alcântara Launch Center, killing 21 people. Background This was the third attempt to launch the VLS-1 rocket. The first attempt, in 1997, ended in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1999, the rocket failed three minutes into the flight and was remotely terminated. The rocket cost $6.5 million.  Payloads  The launch was suppose to carry the UNOSAT and SATEC in to orbit. Both were destroyed due to the explosion. Accident On August 22, 2003, at 13:26:05 (local time) an inadvertent propellant ignition destroyed the launch vehicle as it stood on its launch pad at the Alcântara Launch Center in the state of Maranhão in northern Brazil. Twenty-one people standing on the launch pad died when one of the rocket's four first stage motors ignited accidentally. The explosion caused a fire in the nearby jungle brush, and produced a large cloud of smoke that was visible from far away. Twenty-one people died in the explosion. The number of casualties was initially unknown due to the catastrophic nature of the failure. The death toll was determined by holding a roll call. Aftermath Aftermath of explosion The explosion leveled the rocket's launch pad, reducing a 10-story high structure to a pile of twisted metal. The rocket had been scheduled to launch in just a few days and had two satellites on board when the explosion occurred. After the explosion, the Brazilian Space Agency was criticized for using solid-propellant rockets, which are easier to build and ignite than liquid-propellant rockets, but also lack throttle controls and emergency shut-offs. The incident has caused a significant delay to the Brazilian space program because of government inquiries as well as the fact that many scientists and engineers who worked on the program were killed when the rocket exploded. Plano Brazil. Retrieved on 2013-12-19. An investigation by the Brazilian Government after the explosion found \\"dangerous buildups of volatile gases, deterioration of sensors and electromagnetic interference\\" at the launch site.Space program management contributed to rocket explosion Red Orbit. Retrieved on 2012-03-06. Before the accident, the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) monitored the spying activities of French agents from the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), but also from Russian, American and Iranian secret services. The ABIN carried out investigation to determine if the French agents were responsible for the sabotage of the rocket, and concluded that they were not involved in the accident.

In the US, it was initially published by Wizards of the Coast; The Pokémon Company eventually took over publishing the card game in June 2003. In 2016, it was the year's top-selling toy in the strategic card game subclass. In 2017, it had an 82% share of Europe's strategic card game market. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 30.4billion cards worldwide. Gameplay Yu-Gi-Oh! cardsleft Players assume the role of a Pokémon trainer and use their Pokémon to battle their opponent's Pokémon. Players play Pokémon to the field and attack their opponent's Pokémon. A Pokémon that has sustained enough damage is knocked out, and the player who knocked it out draws a Prize card. There are usually six Prize cards, and the primary win condition is to draw all of them. Other ways to win are by knocking out all the Pokémon the opponent has on the field so that the opponent has none left, or if at the beginning of their opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw in the opponent's deck. Players begin by having one player select heads or tails, and the other flips a coin; the winner of the coin flip will decide who goes first or second. The player going first cannot attack their first turn, unless the card says otherwise. (Dice may be used in place of coins, with even numbers representing heads and odd numbers representing tails). Players then shuffle their decks and draw seven cards, then play one Basic Pokémon onto the field. This Pokémon is known as the Active Pokémon and is usually the one that attacks and receives damage. If a player does not have any Basic Pokémon, they must shuffle and draw a new hand, and the opponent may draw one additional card. Once both players have at least one Basic Pokémon, they can play up to five more Basic Pokémon onto their \\"Bench\\" (representing the maximum-carry limit of six from the video games). Players then take the top six cards of their deck and place them to the side as Prize Cards. Play then begins with the player who won the coin flip. Play alternates between players who may take several actions during their turn, including playing new Basic Pokémon, evolving their Pokémon, playing Trainer cards and Energy cards, and using Pokémon Abilities. A player may also retreat their Active Pokémon, switching the Active Pokémon with one on the Bench. At the end of their turn, a player may use one of their Active Pokémon's attacks, provided the prerequisite amount and types of Energy are attached to that Pokémon. Effects from that attack are then activated and damage may be placed on the Defending Pokémon; some attacks simply have effects but do not do damage. Damage may be modified depending on whether the defender has a weakness or a resistance to the attacker's Pokémon type. If the final damage exceeds the defending Pokémon's HP, it is knocked out, and the active player takes a prize card and ends their turn. Card types Basic Pokémon are the foundation of all decks. Without them, a player cannot play the game since both players begin the game by placing a Basic Pokémon in the Active position on the field. Each Pokémon card depicts a Pokémon from the video games. Each player may have up to six Pokémon on the playing field at a time: one \\"Active\\" Pokémon and up to five on the bench. Each Pokémon card has a name, a type, and an amount of Health Points (HP). All Pokémon feature attacks; these typically deal damage to the opponent's active Pokémon, or occasionally, their benched Pokémon; however, an attack may also perform different functions, such as drawing cards, inflicting Special Conditions, or altering the opponent's board state. The vast majority of these attacks require Energy, which comes in the form of Energy cards. Abilities, known as Poké-Powers and Poké-Bodies until 2011, are not attacks but simply effects that either are activated under certain conditions or remain in effect as long as the Pokémon with the Ability remains in play. The other type of Pokémon card is an Evolved Pokémon. Basic Pokémon is Pokémon that have not evolved and can be played directly onto the Bench. In contrast, an Evolved Pokémon cannot normally be placed directly onto the field; they must be played on top of the corresponding lower-stage Pokémon. Stage 1 Pokémon evolve from Basic Pokémon, and Stage 2 Pokémon evolve from Stage 1 Pokémon. As a Pokémon evolves, it gains HP and its attacks change, typically becoming more powerful. Pokémon EX cards were first introduced in the TCG set EX Ruby and Sapphire, and typically have higher Hit Points than other Pokémon, yet award an extra prize card to the opponent when defeated. Baby Pokémon cards, introduced in Neo Genesis, are a special kind of Basic Pokémon that have low HP but attack with strange and occasionally very powerful effects. Mega Pokémon, introduced in XY, evolve from Pokémon-EX, but are a special stage; as such, effects on Stage 1 Pokémon do not apply to Mega Pokémon. Break Pokémon were also introduced in the BreakThrough Expansion Later In the X and Y Series. Variations of Basic, Evolved, and Baby Pokémon cards have appeared in many sets, usually indicated with a word before or after the Pokémon's name. Secret Rare Pokémon cards are some of the rarest cards. They are usually represented by a shiny holofoil and a gold outline. These cards include Shiny Pokémon, Trainers, alternate-art Pokémon, and some rarer Mega evolution cards. Pokémon-GX cards were introduced with the Pokémon Sun and Moon expansion. These cards have a specific move set at the bottom of their card that can only be used once per game. Only one GX move can be played per game, so if there are three different Pokémon-GX cards in your deck only one of the three GX moves can be used. Introduced with the Sun and Moon expansion are Alolan forms; existing Pokémon that have an alternate form with a different design and type. Energy cards are attached to a Pokémon to power that Pokémon's attacks. Typically, only one Energy card may be played per turn. There are two main categories of Energy cards: Basic Energy and Special Energy. The nine different Basic Energy types, which correspond to Pokémon card types, are Grass, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, and Fairy. Two additional types, Dragon and Colorless, do not have their Energy cards and instead use other types of Energy. Basic Energy cards are used only to fulfill costs for attacking and retreating, while Special Energy cards have additional benefits. Most attacks require a certain type and amount of Energy. If an attack requires a certain type and amount of Energy, then that type and amount of Energy must be attached to the Pokémon. If the attack has a Colorless Energy requirement, that requirement can be met by any Energy card. Trainer cards perform various functions to affect the game, for example healing Pokémon, discarding energy from the opposing Pokémon or retrieving cards from the discard pile. Before the Diamond & Pearl expansion, all cards that were not Pokémon or Energy were considered Trainer cards. Trainers have since been subdivided into categories. Item cards directly affect the battling Pokémon, Tool cards are attached to a Pokémon and modify their features, Stadium cards affect the entire field, and Supporters are more powerful Items, only one of which can be played per turn.

Instead of and Metal types appeared when Pokémon Gold and Silver introduced the Dark and Steel types in the video games; the Dragon-type was introduced in the Japanese Dragon Selection set; and finally, the Fairy type was introduced in the Japanese XY set to correspond to its introduction in the video games, but were removed for the Japanese Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield sets. While most Pokémon have only one type, three exceptions are EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua which introduced dual-type Pokémon that have two different types, XY: Steam Siege, and the HeartGold and SoulSilver era sets. Dual-types were utilized in Pokémon Legend cards, to emphasize the multiple Pokémon the mechanic has in the HeartGold and SoulSilver sets. In August 2016, the Steam Siege expansion from the XY Series reintroduced dual-type Pokémon, this time with regular Pokémon being multiple types as well as EX Pokémon. # Starting with the Sword & Shield expansion set Sword & Shield, Poison-type Pokémon in-game are now Darkness; they were previously Psychic. Previously starting with the Diamond & Pearl expansion set Great Encounters , Poison-type Pokémon in-game were changed to Psychic; they were previously Grass. # Starting with the Black & White expansion set Dragon Vault, Dragon-type Pokémon in-game are now Dragon; they were previously Colorless. Sets With the announcement of SM12: Cosmic Eclipse in North America, 86 different sets have been released in English and 76 in Japanese. A rarely played format is Unlimited, in which all cards released in English are legal (except oversized cards, such as promotional boxes) Every few sets, new Mechanics or types of cards are introduced to the game. Several of these include: Dark Pokémon (Team Rocket); Owners' Pokémon and Stadium cards (Gym Heroes); Darkness-type and Metal-type Pokémon, the second generation, and Pokémon Tools (Neo Genesis); Shining Pokémon (Neo Revelation); Light Pokémon (Neo Destiny); Supporter cards and Technical Machines (Expedition); Crystal- type Pokémon (Aquapolis); Pokémon-ex (EX Ruby & Sapphire); Dual-type Pokémon (EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua); Pokémon Star (EX Team Rocket Returns); Delta Species Pokémon and Holon's Pokémon (EX Delta Species); Pokémon LV.X, the separation of Trainer, Supporter and Stadium cards, and the addition of Metal and Darkness as Basic Energy types (Diamond and Pearl); Pokémon With Items (Mysterious Treasures);Pokémon-GX, with a move that is playable only once a game (Sun & Moon); and V cards, first introduced in (Sword & Shield). Trainer cards of which two can be played at once (Stormfront); owner-specific Pokémon SP (Platinum), Pokémon LEGEND (HeartGold and SoulSilver Collection), Pokémon PRIME which replaces Pokémon Lv. X (\\"HeartGold and SoulSilver Collection\\"), Full Art cards (Black and White), Dragon-type Pokémon, BREAK evolution cards which replace Pokémon PRIME (XY BREAKthrough), and the newly release GX cards from Sun and Moon. These changes, along with yearly format rotations, make for a constantly evolving game.  Card collecting  The circle in the bottom right is the symbol for a Common card There are many different ways of trading and purchasing Pokémon cards. Pokémon cards can be found in stores in a variety of ways including pre-constructed decks, promo cards included with a few packs, booster boxes of 36 packs, or individual packs. Subsequently, cards can also be bought individually through websites and individual sellers online. However, buyers should be aware that fake Pokémon cards are also available through online sellers. Pokémon cards have different rarities. From lowest to highest rarity, cards can be rated Common (depicted by a circle in the bottom corner), Uncommon (depicted by a diamond in the bottom corner), Rare (depicted by a star in the bottom corner). Japanese cards use letters instead of shapes to represent rarities. From lowest to highest rarity, cards can be rated C, U, R, RR, SR, and UR. In a single pack of cards in the United States you can expect to get 10 cards total. You are guaranteed 5 common Pokémon cards, 3 uncommon cards, 1 holographic card, and 1 rare card. Some rare cards can be rarer than others. Typically, these cards have art that covers the whole card (known as a full art card) or half of the card. A secret rare card is a full art card (sometimes rainbow or single-color themed) that has a number in the corner that surpasses the number of normal print cards in the set (ex. 242/220). Major collectors tend to use protective casing for rare cards in order to keep their value. The most expensive Pokémon card ever sold was the \\"Pikachu Illustrator\\" card. It sold for $233,000 on ZenMarket on July 3, 2020. Competitive play In addition to the collectible aspect of the card game, The Pokémon Company International (formerly known as Pokémon USA) has also created Play! Pokémon, formerly known as Pokémon Organized Play (POP), which is in charge of the organization of an official League program, where players can battle others in local environments and earn player points, two-card booster packets from a promotional set, badges, stickers and other materials. These are run by League leaders and owners. POP also runs a professor program, in which individuals age 18 or over may become a professor, who can sanction and run tournaments and leagues. A-League Leader may assist in organizing the league, while a League Owner is the one officially in charge of the league, reporting to the Organized Play program any results and/or problems every seven weeks. The leagues run in yearly cycles, based on a certain aspect of one of the Pokémon Video Game or Trading Card Game: the current cycle is based upon the Newest sets of the last two years. Prerelease tournaments are organized just before each set is released. Usually, they are run on the two weekends before a set is released in stores to the public. At Prerelease Tournaments players are given three booster packs from the judge and must construct a 40 card deck, with only 4 prize cards, using only the cards pulled from the packs and the judges provide the energy, but not special energy cards. Many fans have come up with alternative methods of playing the Trading Card Game. Certain websites such as PokéCap are dedicated to providing players with a new twist to their card game with new game rules they can follow. New methods may be based more on the video game adaptations of Pokémon or the Pokémon television show. Players in a tournament are split into three age categories: Junior (10 years old and younger), Senior (11 to 14 years old), and Master (15 years old and older). Notable references include Austin Brewen who won the first junior tournament, Brenden Zhang who won the first Senior Tournament, and Arturo Heras who won the first Master Tournament. These tournaments play several rounds, where players will play a standard game against each other and wins and losses will be recorded. In most tournaments, there are some Swiss-style rounds where players are paired up against others of similar win/loss ratios, usually from their age group (this does not always occur in smaller events, though). Afterward, there will either be a cut off the top record-holders (approximately the top 1/8 of participants) where players will play best two out of three matches and the loser gets eliminated (standard tournament bracket style), with an eventual winner. POP runs a season for these tournaments, which allows players to earn larger prizes and play in a more competitive environment in comparison to League. These range from City and State Championships, all the way up to the Pokémon World Championships, the single invite-only event of the year. Players can earn invites to the World Championships by winning or ranking high at National Championships, doing well at tournaments to get Championship Points, or by qualifying in the Last Chance Qualifier. The World Championships is a three- day tournament, with one eventual winner in each age group; the winner of the Masters Division age group is generally noticed as the best player in the world for that season. Some of these methods are only used in the United States, as PUI and POP are based in the United States, but they are represented by local distributors who provide the Organized Play program to their own country. 2017 Worlds - Anaheim California 2018 Worlds - Nashville Tennessee Major tournaments On August 26–27, 2000, forty-two Pokémon trainers from around the world met at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu for the Tropical Mega Battle, an international communication event for the Pokémon Trading Card Game. The Tropical Mega Battle brought together children aged 14 and under from the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Canada, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for two days in Honolulu, Hawaii. Children participating in the Tropical Mega Battle received invitations through Qualifier tournaments, DCI rankings, and other events in their respective countries. The Super Trainer Showdowns were large Pokémon TCG tournaments held in the United States by Wizards of the Coast between 2000 and 2001. The tournaments were open to the public. Each tournament consisted of three age groups: 10 and under, 11 to 14 years old, and 15 years old and over. Each Super Trainer Showdown was preceded by a series of Qualifier Tournaments held in cities around the United States and abroad in which players in the 11-to-14 and 10-and-under age groups could win trips for themselves and a parent or guardian to the Super Trainer Showdown event. To date, there have been four Super Trainer Showdowns. The first Super Trainer Showdown was held in Long Beach, California inside of the cruise liner, the Queen Mary on July 22, 2000. The format was unlimited, meaning that all Pokémon cards released in the United States were legal for deck construction. The second Super Trainer Showdown was held at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey on November 18, 2000. There were over 700 players in all three age divisions competing for the title. The tournament was eight rounds of Swiss-style pairings followed by a cut to a top-eight single-elimination playoff. All the games were best-of-one. The third Super Trainer Showdown was held again in the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey. It was held on June 23–24, 2001 and more than 1,600 players attended the event. The format for this event was titled \\"Modified\\" and allowed players to construct 60-card decks using a maximum of four of any card other than basic energy from specific sets. The fourth and final Super Trainer Showdown was held at the San Antonio Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas on December 1–2, 2001. The format was again \\"Modified\\", however the newest set Neo Discovery was also legal for the tournament. Although TPCI tries to keep Organized Play as equal as possible all over the Earth, there are some notable differences in how POP is run outside of the United States. The Pokémon Card Laboratory (PCL), located in Japan, is the designer of new cards and the ultimate authority on any matter relating to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It can declare rulings on any in-game circumstance, issue errata, change card text after publishing, and change the basic game rules, although the latter three rarely occur. PCL runs Organized Play in Japan. The Pokémon Trading Card Game in most European countries is currently handled by The Pokémon Company International. Certain countries have no direct official presence; in these regions, distributors of the game run tournaments. European countries can qualify for positions at the Pokémon Trading Card Game World Championships each year, through National Championships and European Rankings. Reception The reviewer from the online second volume of Pyramid stated that \\"Pokemon is the second most popular CCG in Japan (behind Magic: The Gathering, of course), and it's no fluke. The game plays like a kinder, gentler version of Magic, with easier rules and graphics geared to the younger crowd.\\" Video games There are a few video games based on the card game. Pokémon TCG Online (PTCGO) is the official digital version of the card game available for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Android and iPad. It was originally released on April 2011 as Pokémon Trainer Challenge. The game initially offered three starting decks and featured more content after release. After April 6, 2011, players could buy cards from the Black and White series, which have a code to be digitally represented. Players can also create a custom avatar. There were booster pack codes which allow booster packs up to Black and White-Boundaries Crossed, to be purchased from the online shop. However, as of Black and White- Plasma Storm, the code card within booster packs directly redeem as online booster packs of their respective set. GamesRadar praised the game, stating \\"Everything looks to be faithfully recreated, including the card mat, prize card layout, and even coins.\\" The eponymously titled Pokémon Trading Card Game, known as Pokémon Card GB in Japan, was developed for the Game Boy Color, releasing in Japan on December 1998 and later in North America and Europe in 2000. The game is based on the rules of the card game and features 226 cards from the game, as well as infrared linking for multiplayer and trading. The game was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. A sequel, Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjō! was released exclusively in Japan on March 2001. An instruction game on the rules of the game was released in 1999: Pokémon Play It!, with Version 2 following in 2000.

Origins He was the son of John Fitzalan, 2nd Baron Arundel (1364-1390), by his wife Elizabeth le Despenser, daughter of Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer. Career He became 3rd Baron Arundel on his father's death in 1390 and Baron Maltravers on his grandmother's death in 1405. He was with the army in Scotland in 1383 and with the English Fleet in the western coast of France. Heir to Earldom of Arundel In 1415, his father's cousin Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel died, leaving John Fitzalan as his closest male heir. The Earldom of Arundel had been entailed to heirs male, and so the next year John Fitzalan was summoned to Parliament as Earl of Arundel. However the inheritance was challenged by Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who was married to the 5th Earl's eldest sister. The dispute was not settled during their lifetimes, and John Fitzalan was subsequently summoned to Parliament as Baron Maltravers, not as Earl of Arundel. Marriage and progeny Arms of Berkeley: Gules, a chevron between ten crosses pattée six in chief and four in base argent He married Eleanor Berkeley (died 1 August 1455), a daughter of Sir John Berkeley (1352–1428) of Beverstone Castle in Gloucestershire by his wife Elizabeth Betteshorne.

She carried a Congressional committee on a tour of North Africa in 1909, and the next year, joined in a special South American cruise commemorating the 100th anniversary of the first autonomous government of Buenos Aires, Argentina. As American interests in the Caribbean were threatened by internal political changes in several nations, Chester patrolled off Mexico, Santo Domingo, and Haiti, and transported a Marine occupation force in 1911. Later that year, she carried men and stores to the steam patrol yacht , station ship at the then-Austrian port of Trieste, returning to Boston with the American consul at Tripoli. In April, 1912, Chester was ordered by the United States Navy to escort back to New York, after Carpathia had picked up the survivors from the sinking of .Titanic Inquiry of Harold Bride After a period in reserve from 15 December 1911 – 5 November 1913, Chester returned to duty in the Gulf of Mexico guarding American citizens and property during the revolution in Mexico. 1914 In early 1914, Chester played a significant role in the United States occupation of Veracruz. :On 2 January 1914, Chester was off Gulfport, Mississippi. Aboard her, President Woodrow Wilson held a conference with John Lind, his personal envoy for Mexican affairs.The Landing at Veracruz, Jack Sweetman, @ 1968, p.25 (Note: At that time, there was no U.S. Ambassador to Mexico; President Wilson had appointed Nelson O'Shaughnessy as Chargé d'Affaires ad interim before Mexican President Victoriano Huerta.) :On 21 April, just after 08:00 hrs, immediately upon receipt of orders to \\"seize Custom House\\" at Veracruz, Admiral Frank F.

She returned to Boston for overhaul and another period in reserve, from 12 December 1914 – 4 April 1915. After 1914 Late 1915 and early 1916 found Chester in the Mediterranean to aid in relief work in the Middle East, and off the Liberian coast to protect American interests and show American support for the government there threatened by insurrection. Chester returned for duty as receiving ship at Boston, where she was out of commission in reserve from 10 May 1916 – 24 March 1917. World War I paravane aboard the USS Chester in 1918. When recommissioned, Chester operated on protective patrol off the East Coast until 23 August, when she sailed for Gibraltar, and duty escorting convoys on their passage between Gibraltar and Plymouth, England. On 5 September 1918, the cruiser sighted an enemy submarine on her starboard bow. In attempting to ram the enemy, Chester passed directly over the submarine as she dived, damaging her own port paravane. Depth charges were hurled at the submarine's presumed position, but no further contact was made. At war's end, Chester carried several Allied armistice commissions on inspection tours of German ports, then carried troops to the Army units operating in northern Russia. On her homeward bound voyage, on which she cleared Brest, France on 26 April 1919, she carried Army veterans to New York, which she reached 7 May. 11 days later, she arrived at Boston Navy Yard for overhaul, and was decommissioned there on 10 June 1921. In 1927, she was towed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, and on 10 July 1928, her name was changed to York. She was sold for scrap on 13 May 1930.

Several Scilla species are valued as ornamental garden plants. Systematics Scilla has most recently been classified as belonging to the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae; the subfamily was formerly treated as a separate family, Hyacinthaceae. Prior to that it was placed in the tribe Hyacintheae of the family Liliaceae. The precise number of Scilla species in the genus depends on which proposals to split the genus are accepted. Other proposals separate particularly the Eurasian species into a number of smaller genera such as Othocallis Salisb., e.g. Scilla siberica would become Othocallis siberica. The common bluebell of British and European bluebell woods, still occasionally referred to by a former name, Scilla non-scripta, is now known as Hyacinthoides non-scripta. Several African species previously classified in Scilla have been removed to the genus Ledebouria. The best known of these is the common houseplant still sometimes known as Scilla violacea but now properly Ledebouria socialis.

Zeldovich and often abbreviated as the SZ effect) is the distortion of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) through inverse Compton scattering by high-energy electrons in galaxy clusters, in which the low-energy CMB photons receive an average energy boost during collision with the high-energy cluster electrons. Observed distortions of the cosmic microwave background spectrum are used to detect the disturbance of density in the universe. Using the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, dense clusters of galaxies have been observed.  Overview  The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect can be divided into: * Thermal effects, where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their temperature * Kinematic effects, a second-order effect where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their bulk motion (also called the Ostriker–Vishniac effect, after Jeremiah P. Ostriker and Ethan Vishniac.) * polarization Rashid Sunyaev and Yakov Zeldovich predicted the effect, and conducted research in 1969, 1972, and 1980. The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is of major astrophysical and cosmological interest. It can help determine the value of the Hubble constant. To distinguish the SZ effect due to galaxy clusters from ordinary density perturbations, both the spectral dependence and the spatial dependence of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are used. Analysis of CMB data at higher angular resolution (high \\\\ell-values) requires taking into account the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect. Current research is focused on modelling how the effect is generated by the intracluster plasma in galaxy clusters, and on using the effect to estimate the Hubble constant and to separate different components in the angular average statistics of fluctuations in the background. Hydrodynamic structure formation simulations are being studied to gain data on thermal and kinetic effects in the theory. Observations are difficult due to the small amplitude of the effect and to confusion with experimental error and other sources of CMB temperature fluctuations. However, since the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is a scattering effect, its magnitude is independent of redshift. This is very important: it means that clusters at high redshift can be detected just as easily as those at low redshift. Another factor which facilitates high-redshift cluster detection is the angular scale versus redshift relation: it changes little between redshifts of 0.3 and 2, meaning that clusters between these redshifts have similar sizes on the sky. The use of surveys of clusters detected by their Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect for the determination of cosmological parameters has been demonstrated by Barbosa et al. (1996). This might help in understanding the dynamics of dark energy in surveys (South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, Planck).  Observations  First measurements of the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect from the alt=This picture taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array is known to be one of the most galaxy clusters, known as RX J1347-1145 In 1984, researchers from the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory first detected the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect from clusters of galaxies . Ten years later, the Ryle Telescope was used to image a cluster of galaxies in the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect for the first time. Instruments built specifically to study the effect include the Sunyaev–Zeldovich camera on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment, and the Sunyaev–Zeldovich Array, which both saw first light in 2005. In 2012, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) performed the first statistical detection of the kinematic SZ effect. In 2012 the kinematic SZ effect was detected in an individual object for the first time in MACS J0717.5+3745.

This height is usually a few inches lower than the 29 inch (73.7 cm) height of the traditional desk. Without a proper typing desk or table, professional or student typists would sit on cushions or thick telephone books. The first generations of typewriters, in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, spurred the invention and production of a variety of typewriter desks. All of the early typewriter desks were sturdy since typewriters needed to be heavy in order to maintain the alignment of the moving parts and not skid over the desk when the carriage was moved. Although newer and portable models became lighter, all-day typing on a portable machine was slower and uncomfortable compared to typing on a heavier office model. Originally, typewriters were very costly machines which one tried to protect from dust or accidents. They were also very ungainly or even ugly to those unfamiliar with them, and getting them out of sight was useful for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, early typewriter desks often had some method for hiding the typewriter or getting it out of the way within the desk, sometimes by swiveling or turning it. Also, a \\"typist\\" was of lower status than was a \\"secretary\\" or general office worker, so if the machine could be moved out of view except when needed, the desk was no longer just for typing. After World War I typewriters gradually became less costly and more common; the typewriter desk was more or less standardized into a few forms: the regular desk with a depressed center section, an \\"L\\" shaped desk with a permanent or hinged (after removing the typewriter) lower level for the typewriter at the side, and versions incorporating lowering or hiding mechanisms. A popular alternative was the \\"typing table\\", a table just large enough for the typewriter (so that it could be rolled up to another desk) on thin legs with casters with brakes so that it wouldn't roll away. Frequently such tables had hinged side-leaves to hold the typist's copy when used alone but allowing it to also be used with a desk. Today, typewriter desks still exist and are in production but as computer desks. In order to achieve the highest typing results the height of table should be 75 cm, the width of desk (distance from eyes to computer screen 50–70 cm) not more than 80 cm.

It has been called \\"the single most important document in New York City's development,\\"Augustyn & Cohen, pp.100–06 and the plan has been described as encompassing the \\"republican predilection for control and balance ... [and] distrust of nature\\". It was described by the Commission that created it as combining \\"beauty, order and convenience.\\" The plan originated when the Common Council of New York City, seeking to provide for the orderly development and sale of the land of Manhattan between 14th Street and Washington Heights, but unable to do so itself for reasons of local politics and objections from property owners, asked the New York State Legislature to step in. The legislature appointed a commission with sweeping powers in 1807, and their plan was presented in 1811. The Commissioners were Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father of the United States; the lawyer John Rutherfurd, a former United States Senator; and the state Surveyor General, Simeon De Witt. Their chief surveyor was John Randel Jr., who was 20 years old when he began the job. The Commissioners' Plan is arguably the most famous use of the grid plan or \\"gridiron\\" and is considered by many historians to have been far- reaching and visionary. Since its earliest days, the plan has been criticized for its monotony and rigidity, in comparison with irregular street patterns of older cities, but in recent years has been viewed more favorably by urban planners. There were a few interruptions in the grid for public spaces, such as the Grand Parade between 23rd Street and 33rd Street, which was the precursor to Madison Square Park, as well as four squares named Bloomingdale, Hamilton, Manhattan, and Harlem, a wholesale market complex, and a reservoir.\\"Map of the city of New York and island of Manhattan as laid out by the Commissioners appointed by the Legislature, April 3, 1807\\" New York Public Library Digital Collections (zoomable map) Central Park, the massive urban greenspace in Manhattan running from Fifth Avenue to Eighth Avenue and from 59th Street to 110th Street, was not a part of the plan, as it was not envisioned until the 1850s. The numbering was also extended through Manhattan and the Bronx. History of the gridiron The gridiron layout of a town or city is not new. It is, in fact, \\"the most pervasive city design on earth\\" and can be found in \\"Italy and Greece, in Mexico, Central America, Mesopotamia, China [and] Japan.\\"Holloway, p.151 It can be found in the Old and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt, and in Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley in 2154 BCE with a population of 40,000 people,Koeppel (2015), pp.1–2 where many historians claim it was invented, and from where it may have spread to Ancient Greece.Higgins, p.55 The Greek city of Miletus was rebuilt after destruction by the Persians on a grid plan, with Hippodamusoften called \\"the father of European urban planning\\"Glaeser, Edward (2011) Triumph of the City: How Our Best Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier New York: Penguin. p.19. as the local originator of the rectilinear grid system for the city centered on the agora, a concept he probably did not invent, but had heard about from elsewhere.Koeppel (2015), p.2Rose (2016), pp.70-71 Hippodamus went on to spread the grid to Piraeus, Rhodes, and other cities in Greece.Higgins, pp.50–67 The grid plan, or \\"Hippodamian plan\\",Koeppel (2015), p.3 was also utilized by the Ancient Romans for their fortified military encampments, or castra, many of which evolved into towns and cities; Pompeii is the best- preserved example of Roman urban planning using the gridiron system. In France, England, and Wales, castra evolved into bastides, agricultural communities under a centralized monarchy. This example was followed on the European continent in cities such as New Brandenburg in Germany, which the Teutonic Knights founded in 1248, and in the many towns planned and built in the 14th century in the Florentine Republic. The gridiron idea spread with the Renaissance, although in many cities, for instance London following the Great Fire of 1666, it failed to take root. However the rapid expansion of cities In the British Empire necessitated adoption of new neoclassical urban plans in particular the Scottish Enlightenment 'New Towns' of Edinburgh of 1767 and Glasgow of 1781 were particularly influential in the English-speaking countries. In some European cities, such as Amsterdam and Paris, destruction of parts of the city by fire, warfare and other calamities offered an opportunity for the grid system to be used to replace more evolutionary street layouts, especially in outlying areas, while the central city, often sheltered behind medieval walls, remained organic and undesigned.Koeppel (2015), pp.1–16Somewhat the opposite situation pertains in modern American cities, where the city itself is, more often than not, laid out in a grid, while the sprawling suburbs which surround it are dominated by curving streets, with side streets, many ending in cul-de-sacs, which offer poor connectivity. In the city, there are multiple routes between two points for either the pedestrian or the automobile driver, while the suburbs force the traveler to choose between a small number of possible routes, and frequently will offer only one path between two points. The curving, poorly connected streets inhibit walking and make it almost inevitable than every journey will be taken by car. The gridded city, then, is highly adaptable, while the ungridded suburb is not. See Rose (2016), pp.124-125 \\"A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia\\" (1683) by Thomas Holme, the first map of the city. In the United States the gridiron now predominates. In areas that were under Spanish control, the 1753 Laws of the Indies specified the use of the gridiron in newly built communities, and the results can be seen in St. Augustine, Florida; Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico; and in San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles in California.Higgins, p.76Rose (2016), p.89In the rest of the Americas, the grid system can be seen in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, among other cities. Koeppel (2015), pp.1–16. The French also built the nucleus of New Orleans, Louisiana on a grid, in part influenced by the Spanish Law of the Indies, which provided numerous practical models in the New World to copy from.Powell, Lawrence N. (2012) The Accidental City: Improvising New Orleans. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. pp.62-63. Although some English colonial cities, such as Boston, had streets that adhered more to natural topography and happenstance, others, such as Savannah, Georgia, Baltimore, and Philadelphia had been built to the gridiron concept from the beginningEldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.110A street map of Savannah in 1818 can be found in Ballon, p.50in Philadelphia's case, William Penn specified the city's orthogonal pattern when he founded it in 1682, although its blocks turned out to be too large, encouraging the creation of intermediate streets, while James Oglethorpe's Savannah, with its significantly smaller blocks, was not conducive to large-scale development, restricting the city's economic influence.Higgins pp.67–68 New Amsterdam, however, had not been laid out in a grid pattern by the Dutch. The streets of lower Manhattan were more organic, and incorporated Native American trails, cow paths, and streets that followed the topography and hydrology of the swampy land. By the time of the passage of the federal Land Ordinance of 1785, the grid plan was firmly established in the US. The Ordinance required newly created states west of the original thirteen, to have rectilinear boundaries, rather than boundaries shaped by natural features, and within the new areas, beginning in the Northwest Territory, everything was to be divided into rectangles: townships were sixmiles by sixmiles , sections were onemile by onemile , and individual lots were .An example of the grid laid down according to the 1785 law can be found in Ballon, p.52 Cities such as Anchorage, Alaska; Erie, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; and Sacramento, California, all show the American preference for the grid. The effects of the Ordinance of 1785 have been called \\"The largest single act of national planning in [American] history.\\"Elazar, Daniel (1962) The American Partnership: Intergovernmental Co- operation in the Nineteenth-Century United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Quoted by Rose (2016), pp.89-90 There was significant variation in the size of the grids used. Carson City, Nevada, may have the smallest at square and streets, while Salt Lake City, Utah, is much larger at square blocks surrounded by streets. The most popular appears to be the square block with streets that are wide. This size grid can be found in Anchorage; Bismarck, North Dakota; Missoula, Montana; Mobile, Alabama; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. History of New York City A portion of a map of the city from 1776; De Lancey Square and the grid around it can be seen on the right The streets of lower Manhattan had, for the most part, developed organically as the colony of New Amsterdamwhich became New York when the British took it over from the Dutch without firing a shot in 1664grew. The roads were a mixture of country lanes, short streets and Native American and animal trails, all shaped by haphazard history,Grava, Sigurd \\"streets and highways\\" in , pp.1252–54 happenstance and property ownership without any overarching order, until around 1800 when the Common Council of New York began to assert authority over the streetscape, promulgating regulations to keep them clear and to require new streets be approved in advance. They also began to lay assessments on property owners to pay for the cost of keeping the streets in repair. Beginning in 1803, the Council started to condemn streets which served no public purpose, and, importantly, took responsibility for building streets, which heretofore had been done by individual property owners.Ballon, p.17 Private developments The first efforts at putting a grid onto Manhattan in some form came from private developers. In the early 1750s, Trinity Church laid out a small neighborhood around the new King's Collegewhich would later become Columbia Universityin rectangular blocks. However, because the plan required landfill in the Hudson River, which would not happen until much later, the streets were never laid down. However, in 1762 the church did have streets surveyed and laid down in a rectilinear grid in the \\"Church Farm\\"which ran from what is now Cortlandt Street to Christopher Streetand offered the plots to artisans and laborers at very affordable rents.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.187 The second instance came when the powerful De Lancey family decided to break up part of their vast estate in the 1760s, and laid out a grid of streets centered on \\"De Lancey Square\\". As royalists, their holdings were confiscated after the American Revolution, but the streets remainedalthough a new street, Grand Street, was laid through the central square. The north–south streets of the De Lancey grid become the core north–south streets of the Lower East Side: Chrystie, Forsyth, Eldridge, Allen, Orchard and Ludlow Streets, and the grid became the pattern for additional streets laid out in the area. The third instance of a privately developed grid in New York City came in 1788, when the long-established Bayard family, relatives of Peter Stuyvesant, hired surveyor Casimir Goerck to lay out streets in the portion of their estate west of Broadway, so the land could be sold in lots. About accommodated 7 east–west and 8 north–south streets, all wide, making up 35 whole or partial rectilinear blocks of width from east to west, and between and long north to southalthough near the edges of the estate the grid broke down in order to connect up with existing streets. The Bayard streets still exist as the core of SoHo and part of Greenwich Village: Mercer, Greene, and Wooster Streets, LaGuardia Place/West Broadway (originally Laurens Street), and Thompson, Sullivan, MacDougal, and Hancock Streets, although the last has been subsumed by the extension of Sixth Avenue. At about the same time as the Bayards, Petrus Stuyvesant, the great-grandson of Peter Stuyvesant, intended to lay out a small grid of streets, nine by four, to create a village on his estate. The orientation of the streets was to be true north–south and east–west, not shifted, as Manhattan Island is, 29 degrees east of true north. The only street to actually be laid was the grid's central east–west axis, Stuyvesant Street, which remains the one street in Manhattan oriented closely to true east and west.Koeppel (2015), p.47 The surveying of the CommonsGoerck's first survey= Despite the fact that the city's charters over the decadesthe Dongan Charter (1686), the Cornbury Charter (1708) and the Montgomerie Charter (1731)supported by specific laws passed by the province or state in 1741, 1751, 1754, 1764, 1774 and 1787, gave the city's Common Council full powers over the creation of new streets, the Council rarely did so, independent of the actions of the various landowners who developed their property and ran streets through their projects as they saw fit, which were approved after the fact by the Council. Its first effort to do so came in June 1785 as part of the Council's attempt to raise money by selling property. The Council owned a great deal of land, primarily in the middle of the island, away from the Hudson and East Rivers, as a result of grants by the Dutch provincial government to the colony of New Amsterdam. Although originally more extensive, by 1785 the council held approximately , or about 9% of the island. Unfortunately, the land was not only of such poor qualitybeing either rocky and elevated or swampy and low-lyingthat it was not suitable for farming or residential estates, it was also difficult to get to because of both the lack of roads and access to waterways. To divide the Common Lands, as they were called, into sellable lots, and to lay out roads to service them, the Council hired Goerck, one of a handful of officially approved \\"city surveyors\\", to survey them. Goerck, who was related to the Roosevelt family by marriage, was instructed to make lots of about eachprecision in such matters was not to be expected with the available surveying tools, given the topography and ground cover of the Common Landsand to lay out roads to access the lots. He completed his task in December, only six months later, creating 140 lots of varying sizes. Although not laid out in a gridiron patternGoerck was not instructed to do somost of the lots were organized into two columns of 45 lots with a road between the columns. The lots were oriented as the lots of the future Commissioners' Plan would be, with the east–west axis longer than the north–south axis; their five-acre size would become the template for the Commissioners' five acre blocks; and Goerck's middle road would eventually reappear on the Commissioners' Plan, without acknowledgment, as the wide Fifth Avenue.Koeppel (2015), pp.17–28 =Goerck's second survey= Unfortunately for the Common Council, the disadvantages of the plots in the Common Lands worked against their sale, and there was no run on the market to buy them. Still, sales continued at a steady, if not spectacular, pace. By 1794, with the city growing ever more populated and the inhabited area constantly moving north towards the Common Lands, the Council decided to try again, hiring Goerck once more to re-survey and map the area. He was instructed to make the lots more uniform and rectangular and to lay out roads to the west and east of the middle road, as well as to lay out east–west streets of each. Later, the Commissioners would use Goerck's East and West Roads for their Fourth and Sixth Avenues. Goerck's cross streets would become the numbered east–west streets of the later plan. Goerck took two years to survey the 212 lots which encompassed the entire Common Lands. Again, impeded by tools and topography, Goerck's work was somewhat less than precise. In 1808, John Hunn, the city's street commissioner would comment that \\"The Surveys made by Mr. Goerck upon the Commons were effected through thickets and swamps, and over rocks and hills where it was almost impossible to produce accuracy of mensuration.\\" Often the streets intended to intersect at right angles would not quite do so.A 19th-century reproduction of Goerck's 1796 map can be seen in Ballon, p.22. The 1785 map is not extant.Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.112 Still, Goerck's work in surveying the Common Lands was the basis for the Commissioners' Plan, as explained by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission: \\"The Commissioner's Plan borrowed heavily from Goerck's earlier surveys and essentially expanded his scheme beyond the common lands to encompass the entire island.\\"Brazee, Christopher D. and Most, Jennifer L. (March 23, 2010) Upper East Side Historic District Extension Designation Report New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, p.6 n.12 Historian Gerard Koeppel comments \\"In fact, the great grid is not much more than the Goerck plan writ large. The Goerck plan is modern Manhattan's Rosetta Stone...\\"Koeppel (2015), p.27A graphic indication of the overlap between Goerck's surveys and the Commissioners' Plan can be found in Ballon, pp.44–45 The Mangin–Goerck Plan The Mangin–Goerck Plan of 1801; the \\"warning label\\" can be seen at the bottom under \\"Plan of the City of New York\\" In 1797, the Council commissioned Goerck and Joseph-François Mangin, another city surveyor, to survey Manhattan's streets; Goerck and Mangin had each submitted individual proposals to the Council, but then decided to team up. Goerck died of yellow fever during the course of the project, but Mangin completed it and delivered the draft of the Mangin–Goerck Plan to the Council in 1799 for correction of street names; the final engraved versionmade by engraver Peter Maverick, who would also go on to engrave the published map of the Commissioners' Planwould be presented to the Council in 1803. However, Mangin had gone well beyond the terms of his commission, and the map not only showed the existing streets of the city, as instructed, but was also, in Mangin's words, \\"the Plan of the City ... such as it is to be...\\" In other words, the Mangin–Goerck Plan was a guide to where and how Mangin believed future streets should be laid out. It called for enlarging the tip of the island and using landfill to regularize its waterfront. He placed a number of street grids on land that was, at the time, agricultural or undeveloped. The grids, which had different baselines, met up, and there Mangin placed parks and public spaces. He extended the Bayard grid northward, and the De Lancey grid to the east and north, and created a new grid of true north–south/east–west streets, among other inventions. As Gerard Koppel comments: > In sum, Mangin's plan of the city \\"such as it is to be\\" was a synthesizing > of patterns already establishing themselves at the suburban fringes of the > city and, in the city proper, an orderly filling in east and west with > linear streets out to continuous roads along the waterfronts. The city > government hadn't asked for it, but it seemed to be just what it > wanted.Koeppel (2015), p.48 The Council apparently accepted the plan as \\"the new Map of the City\\" for four years, even publishing it by subscription, until political machinations perhaps engineered by Aaron Burr acting through the city's street commissioner, Joseph Browne Jr., brought it into disrepute. Burrthe political enemy of Mangin's mentor Alexander Hamiltonmay have been upset that the design of New York's City Hall had gone to Mangin and his partner John McComb Jr., and not to Burr's candidate, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, but for whatever reason, the plan was disavowed by the Council, and was no longer to be considered \\"the new Map of the City.\\" The Council ordered that copies which had already been sold be bought back if possible, and that a label warning of inaccuracies be placed on any additional copies sold. They stopped short at totally destroying the plan, but, still, neglect may have had the same effect: the original square engraved map has disappeared, and of the smaller versions only less than a dozen are extant, none in good condition.Koeppel (2015), pp.37–41, 51–56, 60Koeppel, Gerard (August 1, 2007) \\"Talking Point: Manhattan traffic congestion is a historic mistake\\" , The Villager. Accessed: May 19, 2011Szabla, Christopher (April 7, 2011) \\"An Alternate Map of Manhattan\\" Urbanphoto Nevertheless, despite the Council's official disavowal of Mangin's layout of future streets, as the city grew the Mangin–Goerck Plan became the de facto reference for where new streets were built, and when the Commissioners' Plan was revealed in 1811, the area of the plan which the public had been warned was inaccurate and speculative had been accepted wholesale by the Commission, their plan being almost identical to Mangin's in that area.Koeppel (2015), p.60 The Commissioners' Plan=Genesis Politics may have caused the Common Council to officially decertify Mangin's plan for the future expansion of the city, but the episode nonetheless was a step forward in the development of the city's future. In the \\"warning label\\" the Council caused to have placed on copies of Mangin's map was the statement that expansion of the city, such as shown on the map, was \\"subject to such future arrangements as the Corporation may deem best calculated to promote the health, introduce regularity, and conduce to the convenience of the City.\\" Here the Council was showing its willingness to consider actively planning for how the city would develop.Koeppel (2015), p.56 In 1806, they took a first step by hiring Ferdinand Hassler. Hassler, a Swiss mathematician and geodetic surveyor who was noted for his work on a topographic survey of Switzerland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1805, two years after the French invaded his country and made his work there impossible. Through the auspices of a merchant friend with friends in New York, in the spring of 1806, the Common Council commissioned Hassler to make an accurate map of Manhattan Island, which could be used as a basis for planning future development; it would be Hassler's first substantial contract in the U.S. He accepted the job, and the terms: $5 per day for Hassler (), $4 dollars a day for his assistant (), and $1 per day for expenses (), plus a budget sufficient to hire a surveying crew. He was scheduled to depart from Philadelphia in July, in time for at least part of the 1806 surveying season, but never appeared. Finally, in October, he sent his regrets: both he and his wife had taken ill on the day they intended to leave. Why they didn't send word earlier, why Hassler didn't press on at some point before October, and why the Common Council never thought to inquire of the whereabouts of their missing surveyor is not known. In any case, by October, the surveying season for 1806 was over, or close to it. Hassler soon received a federal appointmenthe would eventually head the first Coast Surveyso the Council was back at square one.Koeppel (2015), pp.70–71Holloway, p.50 So, in 1807, they acted again. Optimists at that time expected the city's population, then around 95,000 people, to expand to 400,000 by 1860, when, in fact, it reached 800,000 before the beginning of the Civil War.Kimmelman, Michael (January 2, 2012) \\"The Grid at 200: Lines That Shaped Manhattan\\", The New York Times Faced with opposition and conflict from various political factions, including property owners whose private deeds conflicted with the property lines of the Mangin–Goerck,Eldredge & Horemstein (2014), p.111 and the reality that any plan the Council came up with could be overturned by a subsequent Council,Ballon, p.25 the city asked the state legislature for help. The Council said its goal was \\"laying out Streets ... in such a manner as to unite regularity and order with the public convenience and benefit and in particular to promote the health of the City ... [by allowing] a free and abundant circulation of air\\" to stave off disease,Burrows and Wallace, pp.419–22 as at the time, foul air, or \\"miasma\\", was thought to be the cause of many diseases,Malouin, Paul-Jacques (2004) \\"Miasma\\" in The Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Assarian, Jaclyn (trans.). Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing and the city had lived through decades of epidemics of yellow fever. In March 1807, the state legislature responded by appointing as a Commission the three men suggested by the Common Council to establish a comprehensive street plan for Manhattan: Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father of the United States; the lawyer John Rutherfurd, a former United States Senator representing New Jersey and a relative to Morris by marriage; and the state Surveyor General, Simeon De Witt, a cousin of De Witt Clinton, who was the Mayor of New York City, a State Senator, and the most powerful politician in New York.Koeppel (2015), p.77–78 A month later, the legislature gave the Commissioners \\"exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, and public squares, of such width, extent, and direction, as to them shall seem most conducive to public good, and to shut up, or direct to be shut up, any streets or parts thereof which have been heretofore laid out ... [but] not accepted by the Common Council.\\" The jurisdiction of the Commission was all of Manhattan north of Houston Street, and into the Hudson and East Rivers 600 feet beyond the low water mark. They were given 4 years to have the island surveyed, and then to produce a map showing the placement of future streets. There were few specifications given to them about those streets, except that streets were to be at least wide, while \\"leading streets\\" and \\"great avenues\\" were to be at least wide.Koeppel (2015), pp.83–84The text of the April act can be read at Ballon, pp.30–32 The baseline of the Commissioner's remit was set at Houston Street\\"North Street\\" at the time\\"Art Street\\", which was located approximately where Washington Square North is today, and \\"Greenwich Lane\\", now Greenwich Street. Greenwich Village, then independent of New York City, and the current West Village were not part of the area the Commission was to deal with. Morris was not named the president of the Commission, but acted as such.Koeppel (2015), pp.82–83 A majority of Commissioners, i.e., two of them, was required to make decisions.Koeppel (2015), p.86 The Commissioners were authorized to be paid $4 a day for their work ()Koeppel (2015), p.83although Morris and Rutherfurd, both rich men, waived their feesKoeppel (2015), p.80and were empowered to enter onto private property in the daytime to undertake their duties; this was greeted with widespread hostility from property owners, but the Commission's authority was explicit. They held, for instance, the \\"exclusive power\\" to close streets that interfered with their plan, a plan which landowners as well as the mayor, the Common Council and all other citizens of the city had no choice but to accept.Koeppel (2015), p.84 At the meetings of the Commission, which were infrequent and usually not attended by all three men, their primary concern was what kind of layout the new area of the city should have, a rectilinear grid such as was used in Philadelphia; New Orleans; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina, or a more complex system utilizing circles, arcs or other patterns, such as the plan Pierre Charles L'Enfant had used in laying out Washington, D.C. In the end, the Commission decided on the gridiron as being the most practical and cost- effective, as \\"straight-sided and right-angled houses are the most cheap to build and the most convenient to live in.\\" Surveying the islandFalse start= In order for the Commissioners to determine what the future of New York City's streets would be, they needed to know the precise location of the current streets, which meant that most of the four years they were given for their task would be taken up with surveying Manhattan island. The Commission's first chief surveyor was Charles Frederick Loss, who, like Mangin and the deceased Goerck, was an officially recognized city surveyor, a position he received contingent on becoming a naturalized American citizen. Unfortunately Loss did not appear to be a very competent surveyor, as several of his ventures had serious errors, which eventually resulted in his being relieved of his position in 1811. Loss exhibited the same lack of ability as the chief surveyor for the Commission, and finally the Commission made an agreement with Loss that he would do only the first task that had been assigned to him: to make a map of Manhattan island, and get accurate measurements for the location of certain streets which would provide a framework for the plan of future streets. For this, Loss would receive no wages but a simple fee of $500. (). Loss was to deliver the map by May 1808.Koeppel (2015), pp.90–94 The only known imageKoeppel (2015), caption; images between pp.136 and 137 of John Randel Jr., the Commission's chief surveyor, by an unknown artist, probably Ezra Ames.Holloway, pp.96–97 =Randel joins the project= The Commissioners' replacement as chief engineer and surveyor, John Randel Jr., took over the position in June 1808;Koeppel (2015), p.98 the project would occupy him for most of the next 13 years. Randel had been apprenticed to De Witt, and when he became an assistant surveyor in De Witt's office, he interpreted the field reports of other surveyors to draft maps based on them of land in the Adirondack Mountains and on the Oneida Reservation, mapped the Albany Turnpike between Albany and Schenectady and the Great Western Turnpike from Albany to Cooperstown, and surveyed property lots in Albany and in Central New York, particularly Oneida County When he was hired by the commissionon De Witt's suggestion and with Morris' approvalhe was still a relatively inexperienced 20-year-old.Holloway, pp.19, 36, 44 Randel's surveying in 1808 had nothing to do with laying out the grid, which had not yet been determined as the final result of the Commission's work. Instead, he was determining the topography and ground cover of the land and the placement of natural features such as hills, rocks, swamps, marshes, streams, and ponds, as well as man-made features such as houses, barns, stables, fences, footpaths, cleared fields and gardens. He was also carefully noting the locations of the three north–south roads that Goerck had laid down as part of his survey of the Common Lands. Goerck had not placed the lots and roads in the Common Lands in the context of the overall island, and this Randel did, thus allowing the Commissioners to know where, exactly, Goerck's Common Lands grid was. This was important, because it could serve as a template for a grid for the entire island, should the Commission decide to go in that direction.Koeppel (2015), pp.100–02 Randel wrote afterwards that in the course of his work he \\"was arrested by the Sheriff, on numerous suits instituted ... for trespass and damage by ... workmen, in passing over grounds, cutting off branches of trees. &c.;, to make surveys under instructions from the Commissioners.\\" In August 1808, Randel was sued by a landowner for trespass and causing damage to the landowner's property, such as cutting down trees and trampling on crops; $5000 was requested in damages, but the landowner received only $109.63, just enough to cover his court costs. Nonetheless, the potential for future problems was real. Gouverneur Morris asked the Common Council for a means of protecting the necessary actions of the surveyors, but, for political reasons, the council could not agree on a solution, and passed the buck, again, to the state legislature. With the Commissioners threatening to resign if something wasn't done about the \\"vexatious interruptions\\", the legislature acted in 1809 with a law providing that if the needed actions to perform the survey could not be performed \\"without cutting trees or doing damages\\" and \\"reasonable notice\\" was to be provided by the Commission or the surveyors to the landowner, and they were to view the property together to assess the situation.Koeppel (2015), pp.105–06 The landowner was to present a bill for \\"reasonable damages\\", which the city was to pay within 30 days; any disagreement among the parties as to what was reasonable would, of course, end up in court. The new law did not completely stop lawsuits, but it cut down their number, and allowed Randel to go about his business with a degree of immunity from legal entanglements.Koeppel (2015), pp.102–06Steinberg, pp.60–61Holloway, pp.60–62 In 1809, Randel's surveying again seems to have been focused on positioning the Common Lands, and Goerck's lots and streets in it, to the rest of the island. Goerck had shown their relationship to the Bloomingdale Road to the west, much of which would become part of Broadway, and the East Post Road to the east, a road which would be demapped by the Commissioners Plan'. Little is known about Randel's surveying in 1810.Koeppel (2015), pp.106–08 And in the meantime, the Commissioners were, generally speaking, distracted by various other personal and political business; although they metinfrequentlythere is no record of what they discussed, or if they were getting closer to a decision about what their plan would entail. Finally, on November 29, 1810, with the surveying season for that season over and only four months left before they were to report out their plan, they seemed to have arrived at a decision. On that date, Morris informed the Common Council that although more work was left to be done \\"on the ground\\", the Commission itself had \\"completed their work\\" and would be able to make a report that would \\"compl[y] substantially, if not literally within the law, shewing all the streets which to be laid out...\\"Koeppel (2015), pp.108–10 Randel then spent a considerable amount of time in December meeting with Morris and perhaps the other Commissioners at Morris' estate in the Bronx, during which time it appears that the grid plan was born. At Morris' suggestion, the Common Council hired Randel to actually do the extensive work involved in making the grid a physical realityalthough city surveyor William Bridges (see below) also submitted a proposal to do the workHolloway, p.63and Randel began this work even before the Commissioners' Plan was announced publicly.Koeppel (2015), pp.112–14 A provisional contract between the Council and Randel was signed on December 31, the permanent contract being conditional on Randel delivering the final maps of the plan, which he did on March 22, 1811; the maps were filed by the Council's clerk on April 2, two days before the Commission's legal deadline.Holloway, pp.63–64 Randel's survey of the entire islandhad begun in 1808 and was completed in 1810, and he now prepared the drafts of the new grid without regard to the topography of the land. The three maps were large, almost nine feet in length when connected together. Commissioner Simeon De Witt said of Randel's work that it was made \\"with an accuracy not exceeded by any work of the kind in America.\\" Randel himself would later write that \\"The time within which the Commissioners were limited by the Statute to make their Plan of the streets, avenues, and public places on Manhattan [was] barely sufficient to enable them to comply with the letter, although not fully with the spirit, of the Statute.\\" (italics in original)Koeppel (2015), p.114 The plan The format chosen by the Commissioners was a rectilinear grid, or \\"gridiron\\": straight streets and avenues intersecting each other at right angles. Legal historian Hendrick Hartog writes that their choice was resonant with the political values of the country, which only recently gained independence from Great Britain. According to Hartog, the grid was: \\"...the antithesis of a utopian or futuristic plan.\\" It extolled ordinary everyday life, and emphasized that \\"government ought not to act in such a way as to create inequality of special privilege.\\" The Plan's \\"hidden agenda\\" was \\"[t]he reconstruction of the natural environment to fit the requirements of republican authority.\\" Even though \\"[t]he Commissioners wrote as if all they cared about was protecting the investments of land developers and maintaining government-on-the-cheap ... the plan ... however, served to transform space into an expression of public philosophy,\\" which emphasized equality and uniformity. \\"In a city shaped by rectangular blocks, all structures and activities would look roughly the same. Individual distinctions, whether cultural, charitable, economic, or whatever, would have to find their place within a fixed, republican spatial organization.\\"Holloway, p.152; quoting Hartog, Hendrick (1983) Public Property and Private Power: The Corporation of the City of New York in American Law, 1730–1870 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. pp.163, 165–66 =Streets and avenues= The Commissioners published their plan in March 1811 in the form of an mapredrawn by the otherwise little known William Bridges from Randel's original, and engraved by Peter Maverickwith an accompanying 54-page pamphlet.A fairly large-scale fold-out version of the map can be found at Ballon, pp.34–36, and a zoomable version is available online at \\"Map of the city of New York and island of Manhattan as laid out by the commissioners appointed by the Legislature, April 3, 1807\\" New York Public Library Digital Collections The grid had 12 primary north–south avenues and numerous cross streets arranged in a regular right-angled grid tilted 29 degrees east of true north to roughly replicate the angle of Manhattan island.Koeppel (2015), p.101 The Commission chose not to use circles and ovals such as Pierre L'Enfant had used in his design of Washington D.C., convinced that simple rectangles were best, the most convenient and easiest to build on, and therefore the most conducive to the orderly development of the city. The combination of north–south avenues and east–west streets at the specified dimensions was the creation of approximately 2000 long, narrow blocks. Except in the north and south ends of the island, the avenues would begin with First Avenue on the east side and run through Twelfth Avenue in the west. In addition, where the island was wider, there would be four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D. Some of the avenues, such as Twelfth Avenue, ran through land that did not as yet exist, but the state legislation which created the Commission also authorized the city to extend its boundaries into the Hudson and East Rivers, so the land required for these new streets would eventually be created.Steinberg, p.58 Broadway, an existing road, was not included in the 1811 plan, and was added to the grid later. The plan also called for 155 orthogonal cross streets. The location of the cross streets was fixed at the boundaries of parcels into which the land had previously been divided. The basepoint for the cross streets was First Street: this was a short and inconspicuous street, which still exists, and originally ran from the intersection of Avenue B and Houston Street to the intersection of the Bowery and Bleecker Street. Peretz Square, a small, narrow triangular park bounded by Houston Street, 1st Street, and First Avenue, is the grid's cornerstone.Peretz Square, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed July 12, 2007. \\"A sliver of Manhattan bounded by Houston Street, First Street and First Avenue, Peretz Square marks the spot where the tangled jumble of lower Manhattan meets the regularity of the Commissioners' Plan street grid.\\" The numbered streets running east–west are wide, with about between each pair of streets, resulting in a grid of approximately 2,000 long, narrow blocks. With each combined street and block adding up to about , there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile. Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as wide: 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, 57th, 72nd, 79th, 86th, 96th, 106th, 116th, 125th, 135th, 145th and 155th Streets.Morris, Gouverneur, De Witt, Simeon, and Rutherford, John (March 1811) \\"Remarks Of The Commissioners For Laying Out Streets And Roads In The City Of New York, Under The Act Of April 3, 1807\\". Accessed May 7, 2008. The width of the crosstown blocks was irregular. The distance between First and Second Avenues was , while the block between Second and Third Avenues was . The blocks between Third and Sixth Avenues were , while the blocks between the avenues from Sixth to Twelfth were . Lexington and Madison Avenues were added after the original plan. The shorter blocks near the Hudson and East River waterfronts was purposeful, as the Commissioners' expected that there would be more development there at a time when water-based transportation was still significant.Spann, Edward K. \\"grid plan\\" in , p.558 The Commission expected that street frontage near the piers would be more valuable than the landlocked interior, the waterfront being the location of commerce and industry of the time, and so it would be to everyone's benefit to place avenues closer together at the island's edges.Koeppel, p.122 Although varied, the width of all the avenues were sufficient to accommodate large numbers of horse-drawn mass transportation vehicles such as the omnibus, which would soon appear in Manhattan in the late 1820s, but the precursors to which had been operating in Paris as early as 1662, operated by philosopher Blaise Pascal. A curiosity about the grid plan the Commissioners chose for New York City is that while many other cities used a square grid, they did not. Perhaps influenced by the dimensions of the island, which is longer north–south than it is east–west, Manhattan's blocks are long rectangles, with the east–west dimension, while varied, larger than the big grid of Salt Lake City, while the north–south dimension, at , just longer than the small grid of Carson City. Historian Gerard Koeppel remarks that \\"while the grid brought order to the place, it also made it a place of extremes.\\"Koeppel (2015), p.7 In implementing the grid, existing buildings were allowed to remain where they were if at all possible, but if removal was necessary the owners would receive compensation from the city, although appeal was available to a special panel appointed by the state's highest court. (See \\"Opening\\" and \\"regulating\\" the streets below) In 2011, it was estimated that 39% of the buildings north of Houston Street which were standing in 1811 (721 out of 1,825) had to be moved.Ballon, p.39 citing Rose-Redwood, Reuben On the other hand, if the plan improved the accessibility of a property, the city was authorized to levy an assessment on the owner for the improvement, a method previously used by the city after building public amenities, such as wells.Koeppel (2015), pp.84–85 The Commissioners' Plan did not in any way specify what the size of individual lots within the blocks should be, although the size and rectangular nature of the blocks lent itself to rectangular lots of equal size to fit into the block. A standard lot was deep, which was half the depth of the block, and wide, depending on the location. By removing most of the topographical features which had once defined lot boundaries, the grid turned land into a commodity, which could be easily bought and sold in roughly equal-sized units, thus rationalizing the real estate market. Zoning requirements also contributed to the order brought by the grid: the city required buildings on avenues to be no more than three stories, and those on the streets no more than two. This, of course, changed over time.Ballon, p.87 The park-like grounds of the American Museum of Natural Historycalled \\"Theodore Roosevelt Park\\" since 1958, but officially part of Central Parkis the only one of the planned public spaces of the Commissioners' Plan which still exists; it was to be \\"Manhattan Square\\". =Public spaces= Conspicuous by their relative absence from the plan were amenities for the city's population, including parks and plazas. The legislature which had created the Commission called for it to provide public areas but, perhaps because they underestimated the growth potential of the city, they laid out very few of these. The primary one was the Grand Parade of between 23rd and 33rd Street and between Third and Seventh Avenues, which was to be an open space slated for military drilling and for use as an assembly point in the event the city was invaded. At the time, some thought that the Grand Parade might become a \\"central park\\" for the city, but the grounds were gradually reduced over the course of time, until what was left was the current Madison Square Park.Mendelsohn, Joyce (1998).

Observatory Place, intended for a reservoir, stood at 89th to 94th Streets between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and there was a large space in what became the Lower East Side, from 7th to 10th Streets and from First Avenue to the East River, intended as a wholesale market complex.Koeppel (2015), pp.123–24It is not possible to tell from the map whether the \\"Garden\\" listed between 47th and 51st Streets and Fifth and Sixth Avenues was an existing feature or a planned one; possibly the former as there is no break indicated in the planned streets.

See Koeppel (2015), p.124 Of the public spaces created by the Commission, only Manhattan Square has survivedsince 1958 called Theodore Roosevelt Park,Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.67 with part of it called Margaret Mead Green since 1979Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.77Theodore Roosevelt Park: Margaret Mead Green, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed July 31, 2016. \\"In 1979, the City Council enacted a law naming the northwest portion of Theodore Roosevelt Park 'Margaret Mead Green' in honor of the distinguished anthropologist.\\"as the grounds around the American Museum of Natural History. The park officially became a part of Central Park as of 1874. The Grand Parade was first reduced from to by 1815, and then demapped altogether, except for which survives as Madison Square Park. The market on the Lower East Side was whittled down from to , then finally became the Tompkins Square Park.Koeppel (2015), p.124 One of the reasons behind the lack of inland open spaces in the plan was the belief of the Commissioners that the public would always have access to the \\"large arms of the sea which embrace Manhattan Island\\", the Hudson and East Rivers, as well as New York Harbor. They considered that if New York was a city such as Paris or London, located along the relatively small Seine and Thames River, then more parkland \\"for the benefit of fresh air and consequent preservation of health\\" would have been necessary. The Commissioners did not consider the proliferation of roadways, docks, wharves, rail yards, quarries and commercial sites which would essentially block the public from access to the rivers until the late 20th century, when a combination of factors began to make the riversides once again accessible, at least in narrow strips of greenways. =Randel and William Bridges= There was a private controversy regarding the publication of the map of the Commissioners' Plan. Randel had begun to prepare a map to go to the engraver, using his original papers, when he found out that the council had given William Bridges, another of the handful of city-recognized surveyors, the right to do so. Bridges simply copied one of Randel's previously published maps, which were in the public domain, without access to the supporting material Randel had accumulated, introducing errors as he did so, some of them possibly intentional, since he was legally bound not to copy the map exactly. Bridges published and copyrighted the resulting map as a private venture, leaving Randel out in the cold: his name did not appear anywhere on Bridges' map.Holloway, p.104Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.117 The conflict between the two men did not come to a head until three years later, in 1814, when Randel starting advertising his own version of the Commissioners' Plan map, which he said was \\"more correct\\" than the previously published onehe did not mention Bridges by namenot only because of the errors he claimed had crept into the map when Bridges copied it, but because he, Randel, \\"has since completed the measurements and fixed monuments by contract with the [Common Council], [therefore] he alone is possessed of all the materials for this valuable work.\\" He published a letter from Gouverneur Morris, who called Randel's map \\"an excellent work ... indispensable to those who wish to make themselves acquainted with the Topography of that interesting space which is comprizes . It appears to me more accurate than anything of the kind which has yet appeared. ... I consider it highly deserving of public patronage.\\" Bridges shot back, commenting that Randel was \\"unprincipled\\", and \\"conceited\\", and lacking in \\"honorable conduct\\". Randel, of course, responded, listing many, but not all, of the errors in Bridges' map, including islands that were not the right length, width, or in the wrong place, rocks and hills misplaced and mis-sized, rivers and forts too close to each other, missing and misplaced buildings, and streets shown as closed which were not. Bridges, whose reputation both as a surveyor and as a man was far from clean, did not reply, perhaps because his wife was sick at the time, and died several months after Randel's second letter. In any case, Bridges himself died shortly after that, and Randel did not publish his map or have it engraved at that time, due to national security concerns connected with the War of 1812. He eventually published it in 1821.Holloway, pp.104–09Augustyn & Cohen, pp.106–09 Executing the planLaying out the grid= Marguerite Holloway, Randel's biographer, divides his work in New York into three periods. The first, from 1808 to 1810, resulted in the 1811 publication of the Commissioners' Plan. The final phase was from around 1818 to 1821, when Randel and his first wife Matilda became high-quality cartographers, makers of maps. In 1811, it was time for Randel to enter stage two, during which he completed the necessary geodetic surveying and inscribed the grid into the land. Even with the publication of the Commissioners' Plan, the work of gridironing Manhattan was far from done. Randel's map only showed 16 elevation points for the entirety of Manhattan island, and many more would be needed. In addition, very few of the streets were actually placed into the physical landscape of the island; 125th Street, for instance, was the northernmost street for which Randel had an actual physical position.Koeppel (2015), p.126 These tasks, that of completing the survey with elevations, along with marking the actual positions of the notional streets of the plan, would take Randel another six years, until about 1817,Holloway, p.51 supervised by a committee of five alderman, as the Commission had disbanded once it had discharged its legal responsibility.Holloway, pp.64–65 This one of John Randel's survey bolts marked the location of what would have been Sixth Avenue and 65th Street; the location later became part of Central Park To do this work, Randel was given an allocation of $1,000 for surveying instruments (), but he also spent his own moneybetween $2,400 () and $3,000 ()developing seven surveying instruments which, among other benefits, would not vary in size because of temperature changes, resulting in great precision. An expert in Colonial era surveying equipment has expressed the opinion, after closely examining images of Randel's new instrumentsthe pamphlet that explained them has been lostthat Randel was \\"Basically ... a mechanical genius.\\"Holloway, pp.77–85Koeppel (2015), p.136 To inscribe the grid onto the land, Randel and his staff erected almost 1,600 markersprimarily long, square marble monuments inscribed with the number of the street, placed at each intersection. Where rocks prevented the use of the marble markers, they blasted a hole with gunpowder, filled it with lead, then inserted long iron bolts that were square. In all, they positioned 1,549 marble markers and 98 iron bolts to define the pattern of the grid.Holloway, pp.9, 14 As Randel's work proceeded, and landowners could see for themselves, on the ground and not on a map, where the planned streets would be, some of them took action to fight against the plan, not only destroying temporary measurement pegs, but also digging up the marble markers. Randel simply replaced the pegs and the markers, and the Common Council covered the cost of doing so, allocating Randel $4,000 (), although they refused to pay him $11,479.31 () he asked for to cover the cost of re- measuring with his new instruments what he had previously measured. The Council reasoned that it was Randel's job to be accurate, so additional fees were not justified.Koeppel (2015), p.134Holloway, pp.87–88 After 1813, when they were married, Randel's wife Matilda joined him the Harlem house he rented, participating in his work by helping with drawing of maps, but not by going out on the surveying trips.Holloway, p.102 =Mapping the grid and the land= One of Randel's 92 detailed \\"Farm Maps\\", showing how the Manhattan grid would sit on the island's topography and extant farms and homesteads. This one is bounded by West 36th Street, Sixth Avenue, West 15th Street, and the Hudson River. As part of the third stage of his work, Randel intended to create an extremely large map of the city, at an unprecedented scale. This has been a part of the agreement between Randel and the Common Council in 1812, but had been forgotten by all except Randel. Somewhat peeved to be reminded of it six years later, the council nonetheless honored the contract, and officially commissioned Randel to make his map. This was done by way of by colored \\"Farm Maps\\" made at a scale of that overlaid Manhattan's natural topography with the intended grid. When put together, the Farm Maps made a map of the city about long. It took Randel and his wife Matilda two years, from 1819 to 1820, to finish the maps, working from their new home, having moved to Orange, New Jersey. He needed, asked for, and received an extension from the Common Council to complete the task, and even then he did not quite make the deadline, delivering the last maps in September 1820, about four months late.Holloway, pp.120–25Augustyn & Cohen, pp.110–11Koeppel (2015) pp.132–34 Randel's Farm Maps are justly praised for their accuracy and usefulness. Historian Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, in his The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498–1909 called them \\"the most complete and valuable topographical record of the period that exists. It is, in fact, the only early topographical record of the island.\\"Holloway, p.125; quoting Stokes, I. N. Phelps (1915–1928) The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498–1909 vol.1 New York: R. H. Dodd. p.564 The Farm Maps also make clear why so many property owners were distraught about the coming of the grid, and why some of them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work. The maps are replete with houses that are directly in the way of where streets were scheduled to run, and lots that would be bisected, trisected, or completely obliterated by the streets and avenues of the new grid. It is no wonder why people fought back against the Commissioners' Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.Holloway, p.145 As well as the Farm Maps, Randel produced an atlas of the city, filling in with \\"astounding precision\\" the details of street locations and elevations which had been left off the official map.Koeppel (2015), p.97 =\\"Opening\\" and \\"working\\" the streets= The process of creating one of the streets gridded on the Commissioners' map was two-fold. First, the city had to acquire the land, compensating the owner for doing so. This was called \\"opening\\" the street. This was followed by \\"working\\" the street, which consisted of regulating, grading, and paving it. Most of the cost of this was passed on to property owners by way of assessments.Renner, Andrea \\"The System of Street Openings\\" in Bonner, p.76 The process began when the Street Commissioner recommended to the Common Council that a certain street, or part of a street, be opened, and the Council would ask the New York State Supreme Court to appoint a Commission of Estimate and Assessment, as described below. Opening With the grid inscribed on the landscape with markers and pegs, the actual streets had to be \\"opened\\", and they also had to be paid for. The city had no great reserve of money, and no regular income stream, so they developed a mechanism to pay for the opening and building of the streets, and for compensating the landowners whose property would be used for them. The 1807 law had specified that the city would calculate damages to the landowners' property as well as assess the benefits the landowners would receive from the new streets. Any disagreement between the parties could then be appealed to the state supreme court. Unfortunately, such a system would not be sufficient for the number of streets and avenues called for by the Commissioners' Plan, so the Common Council approached the state legislature with a new one, which they approved in a new law in April 1813.Koeppel (2015), pp.138–43 In the new system, the state supreme court would appoint three \\"commissioners of appraisal and estimate\\" for the street to be openedgenerally local surveyors or other people familiar with the area the street would pass throughto evaluate the cost of the land being taken, and the beneficial value of the new street to the landowner. The appraisal commission could assess the city with as much as a third of the cost of the openingraised to 50% in 1869and the remainder of the cost would come from the difference between the beneficial value and the value of the property. The supreme court would then review the figures and ask for revisions or approve them. The result was \\"binding and conclusive.\\" Working Once the street was legally \\"opened\\" with the approval by the court of the commission's figures, the city collected the assessment from the landowners along the street, and once the assessment was totally collected, the streets could be built, or \\"worked\\". The land was cleared, hills were excavated or hollows filled in, the right of way was leveled and the street was paved. Many years could pass between when a street was \\"opened\\" and when it finally began to resemble a city street, having been cleared, leveled, graded and paved.Koeppel (2015), p.182 The grading was often difficult because of the rocky nature of the island, especially on the West Side. In 1843, Isaacher Cozzens described the ground as \\"a tough cement of clay, gravel, and boulders, very hard to dig. In digging through 42nd Street, the pickaxes had to be used for every shovelful of this clayey cement which formed what is called, a hard-pan, of about fourteen feet or more.\\"Yerkes, Carolyn. \\"Rocks on 81st Street\\" in Ballon, p.83; quoting Cozzens, Isacher (1843) A Geological History of Manhattan or New York Island ... New York: W. E. Dean The decision on what the elevation of the street would be fell to the Common Council, as the commission for each street was disbanded once the street had been opened. The Council was aggressive in administering the street plan, even causing John Jacob Astor to back down when he challenged their decisions. Of course, the new system did not stop landowners from appealing the assessments made by the streets commissionsgenerally speaking, landowners who had inherited their property were more inclined to appeal assessments than were land speculators, who simply paid the assessments and waited for the values of their properties to rise, as they inevitably did. The outcomes of the landowner appeals, together with those of the lawsuits against the plan which had been filed as early as 1810, created a body of precedents by which the state law was administered. Most of the appeals failed, in particular those that claimed that the Plan was an unlawful taking of property, since eminent domain was a well-established principle of law, although its use on such an extensive basis in New York City was new. William M. \\"Boss\\" Tweed (1870) \\"Boss\\" Tweed ups the ante Because of the inequities of the street opening and regulating system, in which property owners were assessed multiple times, and it could take years for just a few blocks to be completed, and because of increasing corruption once Tammany Hall came into power, the state legislature changed the system in 1869. In the new arrangement, the city could pay for 50% of the cost of building streets above 14th Street, and up to 100% below that line, through general tax revenues. This new system was very long-lived: it remained in effect until 1961, when a new city charter came into effect. Tammany Hall took the new system in its stride, as it pushed a new city charter through the Tammany-controlled legislature in 1870. The new charter invested most of the city's power in the Board of Apportionment, consisting of the mayor, the comptroller, the commissioner of parks and the commissioner of public works, who were, of course, all Tammany men loyal to William M. \\"Boss\\" Tweed. These same men, with slight variations, were also the Board of Supervisors, the Board of Audit, and the Board of Street Openings, creating vast new opportunities for graft and corruption. Tweed himself was the head of the Department of Public Works, and controlled when and where the grid would be activated. The pace of the expansion of the grid picked up tremendously, but so did the money going into Tweed's pockets, as Tweed invested in land and then increased its value by opening streets in the areas he had invested in. Tweed's investments were all over the city, but especially on the East Side. Tweed was eventually tried and jailed, but in his wake he left a city whose development had pushed ahead of its previous sluggish pace, as well as a city raked with debt, since rather than raise taxes for the public works he ordered, the city borrowed money on a massive scale, doubling its debt load in just two years, from $36 million in January 1869 to $73 million.Henry, Sarah. \\"Tweed's Grid\\" in Ballon, p.135 Overall, it took approximately 60 years for the grid to be implemented all the way to 155th Street.Ballon, p.73 =The topography of Manhattan= A frequent charge laid by the critics of the Commissioners' Plan is that the excavation and leveling necessary to implement it basically destroyed the topography of Manhattan. Recent studies, however, have shown that while the topography of the island certainly changed, what exists now is not so very different from the original topography as the critics would suggest.Rose-Redwood, Reuben \\"How Manhattan's Topography Changed and Stayed the Same\\" in Ballon, p.80 Reuben Rose-Redwood and Li Li compared Randel's elevation data to modern data and found that while there had been some levelingin general the West Side had been smoothed out and the East Side had been filled inthe overall average change was low. Rose-Redwood commented: \\"[T]he majority of the alterations were only on the order of a few meters or less, and the historical profiles of Manhattan's avenues are very similar to the contemporary transects of those same thoroughfares.\\"Holloway pp.158–59; quoting Rose-Redwood, Reuben & Li, Li (2011) \\"From Island of Hills to Cartesian Flatland? Using GPS to Assess Topographical Change in New York City, 1819–1999\\" The Professional Geographer vol.63 n.3 p.403 Infilling led to an average increase of and excavation to an average decrease of , but the West Side remains hillier than the East Side, just as was the case before the grid. Rose-Redwood writes that \\"Manhattan remains an 'island of hills' ...\\" Modifications and extensions Central Park is by far the largest interruption of the Commissioners' grid, running from Central Park South (59th Street, at the right) to 110th Street (on the left), and from Fifth Avenue (at the top) to Central Park West (Eighth Avenue, at the bottom), and at , taking up a little over 6% of the area of Manhattan island.Koeppel (2015), p.177 By 1865, Andrew Haswell Green reported, there had been 38 separate state laws passed which modified the original grid of 1811. Central Park and other alterations By far the largest alteration to the Commissioners' Plan was the creation of the Central Park between 59th and 110th Streets and Fifth and Eighth Avenues. The concept of the park first came up for public discussion in the 1840s. By and large its advocates were wealthy landowners and merchants, who argued that New York lacked the kind of parks that graced cities such as London and Paris, and that the creation of such a park would enhance New York's reputation as an international city.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.23, 25 With the population of the city growing, there was an intense need for public spaces, which the Commissioners' Plan had been notoriously short on providing for.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.18–19 In 1853, the state legislature authorized the city to use eminent domain to acquire the necessary land.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.51–53 Four years later it appointed a Central Park Commission, led by Andrew Haswell Green, to build the park.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.96–97 The commission held a design contest, which was won by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's \\"Greensward Plan\\".Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.117–120 Construction started in 1857,Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.161–162 and in 1863 the northern boundary was moved from 106th Street, where it had originally been set, to 110th Street.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), pp.193–195 In 1870 the park passed from state control to local control when a new city charter came into effect.Rosenzweig and Blackmar (1992), p.263 The park was completed by 1876. Significant to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 was the fact that Green was an outspoken critic of the grid. In 1867, he convinced the state legislature to give his Central Park Commission the power to make changes in the grid above 59th Street. However, even though few streets in that area had been laid out yet, property lines conformed to the grid, making sweeping changes to it difficult to achieve. Green was able to take advantage of a high ridge and create Morningside Park and Morningside Drive, and also created Riverside Park along the Hudson River; both parks were designed by Olmsted and Vaux.Koeppel (2015), pp.188–90 Green also laid out a broad Boulevardnow Broadwayup the center of the West Side.Renner, Andrea. \\"Improving the West Side\\" in Ballon, p.141 Because a formal planning commission in support of the Commissioners' Plan was not created, there was no authority outside of the Common Council to protect its integrity. Thus the elimination of the Grand Parade and the wholesale marketplace and the addition of Union, Tompkins, Stuyvesant and Madison Squares came about, as well as the already noted additions of Lexington and Madison Avenues. Fourth and Sixth Avenues were extended downtown, and Broadway uptown. Other interruptions of the 1811 plan include college campuses (Columbia University, City College of New York, Fordham University at Lincoln Center), parks (Marcus Garvey Park, St. Nicholas Park; Jackie Robinson Park), hospitals (Mount Sinai Hospital, Metropolitan Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center), churches (the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Trinity Cemetery and the Church of the Intercession), numerous New York City Housing Authority housing projects, as well as other housing complexes (Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village, Penn South, Lincoln Towers), cultural institutions (Lincoln Center), American Museum of Natural History, office complexes (Rockefeller Center), and transportation (Grand Central Terminal, Pennsylvania Station), convention (Jacob K. Javits Center), and sports (Madison Square Garden) facilities. Andrew Haswell Green, a critic of the Commissioners' Plan, headed the Central Park Commission, which created the street plan for Manhattan above 155th Street Above 155th Street The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 stopped at 155th Streetexcept for 10th Avenue which was extended to the northern tip of the island but as the city grew, and subsumed what had been independent villages such as Greenwich Village and Manhattanville, it became clear that a plan of action would be needed for the part of Manhattan above that line. The Common Council directed the city's street commissioner to develop a plan for Upper Manhattan in 1851, but no money was allocated for the task, so there was no result. In any case, any street plan for that area would have had a difficult time in extending the simple rectilinear grid created by the Commissioners for the area below 155th Street, because the topography of Upper Manhattan was significantly more difficult to tame, consisting as it does of extremely steep hills, high ridges made of hard Manhattan schist, and deep valleys caused by tectonic fault lines at what is now Dyckman Street, which transects the Fort Washington Ridge; 155th Street; and at 125th Street, which crosses the Manhattan Ridge to create the Manhattanville Valley.Garber, Steven D. \\"earthquakes and faults\\" in , p.389Koeppel (2015), pp.192–94\\"Geography of Disaster\\" (map) New York Concerning Manhattanville, even before the publication of the Commissioners' Plan, the Common Council had agreed with the founder of Manhattanville, Jacob Schieffelin, to grade and pave that community's main road, Manhattan Street, which was part of a grid which was rotated significantly farther to the east than the Commissioners' grid would be. When push came to shove, and the question of whether the street they had paid a contractor $600 to create should be demapped and uncreated, the Council decided instead to keep the street, and in 1849 it was officially connected to the western portion of 125th Street, where it remains today, explaining why that street has a bend in it. One other Manhattanville street was also kept, which became the western portion of 126th Street.Koeppel (2015), pp.185–87 With the need for a street plan for Upper Manhattan, in 1860 the state legislature created another commission, this one of seven residents of Upper Manhattan and called the Fort Washington Commissionwith Olmsted and Vaux as consulting landscape architectsto come up with a plan of action which would not be a copy of the grid plan promulgated by the original Commission. The new plan was to take into account \\"the elevated, irregular, and rocky formation of that district\\" because it would be \\"impracticable and ruinous to land owners, and injurious to the interests of the city, to grade and layout streets and avenues ... upon the present plan of the city.\\"Ballon, p.169 However, due to the influence of businesses, land speculators and railroad interests, the plan created by the new commission in 1863 essentially called for an extension of the original grid, and by 1865 the legislature had disbanded the commission, and turned over responsibility for an Upper Manhattan street plan to Andrew Haswell Green's Central Park Commission. The Knapp map of 1870 shows the progress made in laying out streets above 155th Street as called for in the Central Park Commission's 1868 plan The commission did extensive due diligence on the area, studying property ownership, population density, sanitation, the jobs of the residents, food and supplies distribution patterns, defensive needs, even the winds and weather of the region, and in 1868, a plan was published which called for grids in the valleys, but also streets, avenues and parks which conformed to the topography of the land. Green said about the results of his commission's plan that it created \\"the only portion of Manhattan Island where any trace of its pristine beauty remains undesecrated and unrased by the leveling march of so-called 'public improvements.'\\" Several other avenues were added to the grid when Upper Manhattan was developed, such as Riverside Drive, Claremont Avenue, and Saint Nicholas Avenue. The old Bloomingdale Road and Broadwaywhich are pictured on the original 1811 map, but which were not part of the original planned gridwere eventually combined together as Broadway was extended northward; it also took in part of the Kingsbridge Road in upper Manhattan.Koeppel (2015), pp.150–51 Upper Manhattan did not develop exactly as Green and the Central Park Commission envisioned, but its difference from the grid of the Commissioners' Plan is still clear.  The Bronx  As New York City grew north into the Bronx at the end of the 19th century, the numbering scheme was extended into the Bronx, albeit haphazardly. The development of the town of Morrisania in the 1850s saw the first instance of the gridiron spreading beyond the island of Manhattan, extending the grid through what is now Mott Haven to at least 147th Street. By 1879, the numbering had extended through the former towns of Morrisania and West Farms (having been absorbed into New York County), extending to 189th Street. By 1909, the grid had extended to the northern border of the Bronx, ending at 263rd Street in North Riverdale. However, the extension of the grid was not uniform. East of Riverdale, the grid was an expansion of Mott Haven's extension of the grid. This was done without conforming to Manhattan's spacing of streets, opting for greater space between them, and in the case of Morrisania and Wakefield, using existing street systems; thus the system terminates at the city's north line at 243rd Street. Meanwhile, the system in Riverdale was extended from Manhattan's extension of the grid north of 155th St, resulting in twenty street numbers more than the rest of the Bronx. The farthest east the numbering scheme goes is Eastchester, where 233rd St terminates. The only avenue to extend into the Bronx is Third Avenue, reaching into Belmont. Avenues and streets For the most part, with the exception of the streets which were displaced by Central Park, the east–west streets of the Commissioners' Planwhich did not, by design, include Greenwich Villagehave remained as they were originally drawn and numbered. As mentioned above, the western ends of 125th and 126th Streets are another exception, as are some streets around the parks which developed, such as Central Park South. Of course, various streets have been blocked from continuing straight through from one side of the island to the other by parks, apartment complexes, college campuses, and so on, but, in general, the east–west part of the grid is intact. One proposal for a change was made in 1915 by Thomas Kennard Thomson, an engineer from Buffalo, New York who settled in New York City after making a career in Canada and the United States as a bridge and railway engineer. Thompson opened an office in New York in 1893 which concentrated on the foundations of skyscrapers and underwater caissons used for building bridges. He was involved in the construction of the Singer Tower, the Manhattan Municipal Building and the Mutual Life Building. His 1915 plan was aimed at relieving congestion at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Thompson proposed to run 42nd Street under Fifth Avenue, and to add a mid-block street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 42nd to 43rd Streets to permit the turns that the tunneling would prevent. Why this plan would not simply shift the congestion to the new mid-block connector is not clear.Koeppel (2015), p.222–24 In modern actions to relieve congestion, changes are generally made within the existing right-of-way, therefore without the need to condemn and purchase very expensive Manhattan property. In 1945, Sixth Avenue was officially renamed \\"Avenue of the Americas\\", and was adorned with circular signs for each member country of the Organization of American States, such as this one for Venezuela. The name never caught on with New Yorkers, though, who still insist on calling it \\"Sixth Avenue\\". After decades of requiring only one official name, the city at last began to co-sign the avenue with both names. Currently, \\"Avenue of the Americas\\" is generally only seen on business stationery and official city documents, or heard from the mouths of tourists. As opposed to the east–west streets, the north–south avenues have undergone some significant changes. They have, for one thing, increased in number, and many of them have been re-named over the years. In the 1830s and 40s, two additional avenues were interpolated between the original avenues, largely due to the influence of real estate speculator Samuel B. Ruggles: Lexington Avenue, known south of 20th Street as Irving Place, was built between Fourth and Third Avenues to service Ruggles' Gramercy Park development, and Madison Avenue was built between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Another interpolated avenue, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 14th Street to Central Park, was proposed in 1910 by Mayor William Jay Gaynor, who put great effort into promoting it.An illustration of Gaynor's proposed avenue, published in The New York Times on May 29, 1910, can be seen in Ballon, p.125 The plan died, however, when Gaynor was shot by an outraged landowner whose property would be taken for the new road. Gaynor survived, but was not able to put the necessary energy into his proposal, and it faded away.Koeppel (2015), pp.219–20 These interpolations were felt necessary because, essentially, the Commissioners had left gaps between Third and Fourth, Fourth and Fifth, and Fifth and Sixth that were too large to allow sufficient real estate development.Koeppel (2015), pp.146–48 Of the Commissioners' original avenues, only First, Second, Third, and Fifth Avenues and Avenues C and D have never been renamed, though some of the named avenues, such as Avenue of the Americas (Sixth), are also known by their numbers. * Fourth Avenue: Union Square East (14th–17th Streets), Park Avenue South (17th–32nd Streets), Park Avenue (32nd–135th Streets; as of 1888Rose-Redwood, Reuben \\"Numbering and Naming Mnahattan's Streets\\" in Ballon, p.95) * Sixth Avenue: Avenue of the Americas (co-named, to Central Park South), Lenox Avenue/Malcolm X Boulevard (co-named, 110th–147th Street) * Seventh Avenue: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (110th–153rd Street) * Eighth Avenue: Central Park West (Columbus Circle to Frederick Douglass Circle; as of 1883), Frederick Douglass Boulevard (Frederick Douglass Circle to Harlem River Drive at 154th Street) * Ninth Avenue: Columbus Avenue (59th–110th Streets; as of 1890) * Tenth Avenue: Amsterdam Avenue (59th Street to Fort George Avenue at about 193rd Street; as of 1890) * Eleventh Avenue: West Side Highway (14th–22nd Streets); West End Avenue (59th–107th Streets; as of 1880) * Twelfth Avenue: West Side Highway (22nd–59th Streets) Over the years, portions of Avenue A were renamed Sutton Place in Midtown Manhattan,Malbin, Peter (November 16, 1997) \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Sutton Place; Secluded, but With a Neighborly Feel\\", The New York Times.

They aligned with their downtown counterparts.\\" Broadway Broadway, which was the main north–south artery of the colonial city, originally ended at 10th Street, where it merged with the Bloomingdale Road, which then wandered up to approximately 147th Street, where it turned into the Kingsbridge Road. The combined streets took a fairly haphazard path as they made their way uptown. The Commissioners' Plan retained Broadway and Bloomingdale Road up to 23rd Street, with the intention that the uptown sections would be demapped. However, Bloomingdale Road as far as 43rd Street was officially restored in 1838, up to 71st Street in 1847, then in 1851 to 86th Street, with each section being straightened, often in parallel to the grid, as it was restored. In 1865, it was restored all the way to Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the top of Manhattan. The section below 59th Street was called Broadway, but Andrew Haswell Green called the section from 59th to 108th Street \\"The Boulevard\\". Finally in 1899, the entire road was named Broadway, and the other names, not only Bloomingdale Road, The Boulevard, and Kingsbridge Road, but also Middle Road, Old Harlem Road and the East Post Road all disappeared.Ballon, p.155 In modern New York City, Broadway, along with the avenues and the major cross- streets, is considered to be one of the major arterial roads. The angled course of Broadway below 59th Street creates Herald, Times, Madison and Union Squares. Architect Rafael Viñoly refers to these unplanned intersections as \\"happy accidents\\". Reaction Frederick Law Olmsted, vociferous critic of the Commissioners' Plan (c.1860) Clement Clarke Moore objected to the Plan, but made a fortune developing his estate once the Plan's streets were laid down through it. (1897) Henry James (1910) Lewis Mumford, a vehement critic of the Commissioners' Plan Criticism The plan was also vociferously criticized from the start, not least because it did not take into account the natural topography of the island, but also because it took no notice of classical ideas about beauty, and was monotonous in its regularity. It was also lambasted for being made in service of monetary interests alone. Among the many critics of the plan were Edgar Allan PoeKoeppel (2015), pp.xix–xxi and Alexis de Tocqueville who believed that it fostered \\"relentless monotony\\". Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of The Brooklyn Eagle, said of it: \\"Our perpetual dead flat and streets cutting each other at right angles, are certainly the last thing in the world consistent with beauty of situation.\\" Frederick Law Olmsted, who would co-design Central Park,Steinberg, p.41 and has been called \\"the grid's most significant nineteenth-century critic\\", facetiously said of the grid's origin: > There seems to be good authority for the story that the system of 1807 was > hit upon by the chance occurrence of a mason's sieve near the map of the > ground to be laid out. It was taken up and placed upon the map, and the > question being asked \\"what do you want better than that?\\", no one was able > to answer. This may not be the whole story of the plan, but the result is > the same as if it were. Olmsted also said of it in 1858: > The time will come when New York will be built-up, when all the grading and > filling will be done, when the picturesquely varied rock formations of the > island will have been converted into the foundations for rows of monotonous > straight streets, and piles of erect angular buildings. There will be no > suggestion left of its present varied surface, with the single except of the > few acres contained in [Central] Park.Koeppel (2015), p.175 Olmsted was clearly no fan of the grid plan: \\"The great disadvantage under which New-York labors is one growing out of the senseless manner in which its streets have been laid out. No city is more unfortunately planned with reference to metropolitan attractiveness.\\" Still, by 1876, even Olmsted had to admit that the grid had prevailed.Koeppel (2015), pp.179–80 In 1818, Clement Clarke Moore, the author of A Visit from St. Nicholasprobably better known as \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\"whose estate \\"Chelsea\\" would be chopped up by the plan, wrote in \\"A Plain Statement, addressed to the Proprietors of Real Estate, in the City and County of New York\\" : > The great principle which governs these plans is, to reduce the surface of > the earth as nearly as possible to dead level. ... The natural inequities of > the ground are destroyed, and the existing water courses disregarded. ... > These are men who would have cut down the seven hills of Rome. We live under > a tyranny with respects to the rights of property, which ... no monarch in > Europe would dare to exercise ... it is a tyranny of the worst kind; for it > is under the sanction of laws which shield those who exercise it from being > called to legal account. It is time for all who are interested to arouse, > and to unite themselves for the maintenance and preservation of their > rights. Moore signed his pamphlet as \\"A Landowner\\", but it was not long before his identity was exposed. Despite these vehement objections and his call to arms, Moore later made a great deal of money by sub-dividing his estate and developing it section-by-section along the gridded streets.Burrows and Wallace, p.447 Ironically, it was the landowners like Moore, who fought the grid most insistently, who made the most money from exploiting it. Edith Wharton bemoaned \\"...rectangular New York ... this cramped horizontal gridiron of a town without towers, porticoes, fountains or perspectives, hide-bound in its deadly uniformity of mean ugliness,\\" while her friend Henry James wrote that: > New York pays the penalty of her primal topographic curse, her old > inconceivably bourgeois scheme of composition and distribution, the > uncollected labor of minds with no imagination of the future and blind > before the opportunity given them by their two magnificent water-fronts. > This original sin of the longitudinal avenues perpetually, yet meanly > intersected, and of the organized sacrifice of the indicated alternative, > the great perspectives from East to West, might still have earned > forgiveness by some occasional departure from its pettifogging consistency. > But, thanks to this consistence, the city is, of all great cities, the least > endowed with any blest item of stately square or goodly garden, with any > happy accident of surprise, any fortunate nook or casual corner, any > deviation, in fine, into the liberal or charming.

Dodd. pp.407–08 Noted architecture critic Lewis Mumford, a vehement protester against the plan, complained about the \\"blank imbecility\\" of this \\"civic folly\\" with its \\"long monotonous streets that terminated nowhere, filled by rows of monotonous houses.\\" He wrote in The City in History (1961): \\"Such plans fitted nothing but a quick parcelling of the land, a quick conversion of farmsteads into real estate, and a quick sale.\\"Koeppel (2015), p.117 Thirty years earlier, in \\"The Plan of the City\\", published in The New Republic in 1932, he called the grid plan \\"a straight-jacket from which [New York City] has not escaped, from which perhaps it can never escape.\\"Koeppel (2015), p.145; quoting Mumford, Lewis (June 22, 1932) \\"The Plan of New York: II\\" The New Republic Urban activist Jane Jacobs noted \\"street[s] that go on and on ... dribbling into endless amorphous repetitions ... and finally petering into the utter anonymity of distances,\\" and famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright wrote of its \\"deadly monotony,\\" calling it a \\"man trap of gigantic dimensions.\\" Thomas Janvier, an illustration from In Old New York (1894) Jean-Paul Sartre (c.1950) As seen from the vilification in Moore's and James' comments quoted above, the Commissioners came in for as much criticism as the grid itself. Mumford wrote that: \\"With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, could \\"plan\\" a metropolis...\\" and Montgomery Schuyler, another architecture critic, claimed that \\"We all agreedall of us, that is, who pay attention to such thingsthat the Commissioners were public malefactors of high degree.\\" Jean Schopfer, writing in The Architectural Record in 1902, said of them \\"Men of genius were needed ... Unhappily, they were ... men devoid of all imagination,\\"Koeppel (2015), p.73; quoting Schopfer, Jean (1902) \\"The Plan of a City\\" The Architectural Record while historian Thomas Janvier, in his book In Old New York (1894), wrote of the \\"deplorable results\\" of \\"the excellently dull gentlemen\\",Koeppel (2015), p.128; quoting Janvier, Thomas (1894) In Old New York New York: Harper and Brothers. pp.57–61 and criticized the plan as only \\"a grind of money-making.\\" He wrote about it that the Commissioners > decided that the forests should be cut away, the hills levelled , the > hollows filled in, the streams buried; and upon the flat surface thus > created they clamped down a ruler and completed their Bœotian ... programme > by creating a city in which all was right angles and straight > lines.Steinberg, p.154 Further, > Unfortunately, the promise of this far-sighted undertaking was far from > being fulfilled in its performance.

French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote about New York City in both French and English. He learned to love the city, but also wrote that \\"in this immense, malevolent space, in this desert of rock that brooks no vegetation\\" he felt lost. \\"Amid the numerical anonymity of streets and avenues, I am simply anyone, anywhere, since one place is so like another. I am never astray, but always lost.\\" His one essay on New York in English, originally published in Town & Country in May 1946, was republished as \\"New York, Colonial City,\\" but the original title was \\"Manhattan: The Great American Desert.\\"Koeppel (2015), p.236 Modern urban analysts often have negative comments about the grid, from Vincent Scully's calling it an \\"implacable gridiron\\" to the comment of Richard Pluz, an historian of housing, that \\"Even in 1811, the gridiron did not work well.\\" Urban planner Peter Marcuse wrote that it was \\"generally taken to be one of the worst city plans of any major city in the developed countries of the world.\\"Holloway, p.150; quoting Marcuse, Peter (1987) \\"The Grid as City Plan: New York City and Laissez-Faire Planning in the Nineteenth Century:\\" Planning Perspectives p,287 Urban historian John W.

(1965) The Making of Urban America: A History of City Planning in the United States Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, p.299. In his book, City on a Grid: How New York Became New York, historian Gerard Koeppel says of the Commissioners' Plan that it was \\"simply not something that had been deeply thought out,\\" and quotes a student of the plan as saying that it was \\"a quick solution to a difficult problem\\" made by \\"apathetic authors, who simply overlaid Manhattan with eight miles of uncompromising grid.\\"Koeppel (2015), p.128, quoting Shanor, Rebecca (1981) New York's Paper Streets: Proposals to Relieve the 1811 Gridiron Plan (master's thesis, Columbia University) p.51 Praise From its inception, there have been those who sang the praises of the Commissioners' gridiron plan. Writing in 1986, urban analyst David Schuyler said that \\"In 1811 the gridiron had been so widely accepted as the optimal street arrangement for a commercial city that the plan received only perfunctory treatment in the presseven though it had a dramatic effect on existing property lines.\\"Holloway, p.145; quoting Schuyler, David (1986) In the New Urban Landscape: The Redefinition of Urban Form in Nineteenth-Century America Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. p.23 The Citizens and Strangers Guide of 1814 said \\"The whole island has been surveyed and framed into extensive avenues and commodious streets, forming an important legacy to posterity, from which the most solid advantages may be anticipated,\\"Koeppel (2015), p.129 while another commentator from that year wrote \\"The arrangement of the original or lower part of the city ... is essentially defective. Beauty order and convenience seem to have been little valued by our ancestors.\\"Holloway, p.145; quoting Hartog, Kendrik (1983) Public Property and Private Power:The Corporation of the City of New York in American Law, 1730–1870 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. p.159 This comment is especially interesting, considering that so many of the critics of the plan would cite its lack of beauty as a reason for their displeasure with it. One critic recently pointed out that the wide avenues attract retail and commercial use, among other benefits. In 1836, an official in the city government wrote that the Plan \\"...laid out the highways on the island upon so magnificent a scale, and with so bold a hand, and with such prophetic views, in respect to the future growth and extension of the city, that it will form an everlasting monument to the stability and wisdom of the measure.\\"Holloway, p.146; quoting Hartog, Kendrik (1983) Public Property and Private Power:The Corporation of the City of New York in American Law, 1730–1870 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. p.162 Dutch artist Piet Mondrian drew inspiration from the vibrancy of the grid, displaying it in paintings such as Broadway Boogie Woogie (1942). James Kent, the eminent jurist and legal scholar, called the plan \\"brilliant\\", and wrote in 1896: > The map and plan of the Commissioners laid out the highways on the island > upon so magnificent a scale, and with so bold a hand, and with such > prophetic views, in respect of the future growth and extension of the city, > that it will form an everlasting monument of the stability and wisdom of the > measure. The lawyer and noted diarist George Templeton Strong enthusiastically embraced the grid and its resulting growth, writing in his diary in 1850: > How this city marches northward!

Architect Rem Koolhaas in his 1978 book Delirious New York comments that it created \\"undreamed-of freedom for three-dimensional anarchy,\\" and called it \\"the most courageous act of prediction on Western civilization.\\" Koolhaas celebrated the city's \\"poetic density\\" and sees the architecture of Manhattan as \\"a paradigm for the exploitation of congestion\\"; indeed he applauds the city's \\"culture of congestion.\\" Because of the \\"magic carpet of the Grid\\", \\"all blocks are the same, their equivalence invalidates, at once, all the systems of articulation and differentiation that have guided the design of traditional cities. ... [It] made the history of architecture and all previous lessons of urbanism irrelevant. It forces Manhattan's builders to develop a new system of formal values, to invest strategies for the distinction of one block from another.\\"Ballon, Hilary \\"Introduction\\" in Ballon, p.14 quoting Koolhaas, Rem (1978) Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan. Oxford University Press Modernist architect Le Corbusier gushed that \\"I insist on right-angled intersections\\", while Wendy Evans Joseph, another architect, extolled the grid as \\"embody[ing] something uniquely American, a democratic transparency, accessible and open to all ... a republican ideal, the synthesis of the rural order of the neatly laid out rows and furrows of the farm with the fiercely competitive, chaotic madness of the city.\\"Joseph, Wendy Evans. \\"Reflection\\" in Ballon, p.177 Rafael Viñoly, a Uruguayan-born architect, called the grid \\"the best manifestation of American pragmatism in the creation of urban form,\\" writing: > It is the unified formula that controls and organizes the forces that make > the city what it is, what it was, and what it will become ... In this > compact schema that concentrates prescriptions of scale, density, and > serviceability all in one, the play between public and private interests is > in the inevitable balance that transcends speculation without restricting > liberty.

Niels Gron, born in Denmark, but very familiar with New York, said in 1900: > Before I came to this country, and in all the time I have been here, it has > never occurred to me to think of New York as being beautiful.

It was designed that way. ... I would never say that what I love about New York is its \\"utility,\\" but I would say that the utilitarian street plan has made possible the helter-skelter, pell-mell life of the citywhich is what I do love.\\"Traub, James \\"Reflection\\" in Ballon, p.85 In 2013, Hilary Ballon, the curator of The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan 1811–2011, an exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York, wrote about the Commissioners' Plan: > [I]n our fast changing world where technology is outdated in a blink and > future-proofing is the gold standard, the grid has demonstrated remarkable > flexibility. Over two hundred years, the scale of architecture has changed > from three-story walk-ups to skyscrapers more than 1,000 feet tall. Parks > and avenues unanticipated by the plan have been created.

New York's street system creates such transparency and accessibility > that the grid serves as metaphor for the openness of New York itself! Journalist and author David Owen wrote in his book Green Metropolis (2009) that \\"Gridlike street plans may seem unimaginative, but they increase the mobility of pedestrians and are almost always self-explanatory; walking in much of Manhattan, even in areas where the distances between avenues is great, is like walking on a map.\\"Owen, David (2009) Green Metropolis: Why Living Smaller, Living Closer, and Driving Less Are the Keys to Sustainability. New York: Riverhead. p.177 Similarly, economist Edward Glaeser, author of Triumph of the City (2011), wrote that \\"Manhattan's grid imposes clarity on the island's burbling chaos and enables ordinary pedestrians to negotiate New York's complex ecosystem. While many city plans are more beautiful in the abstract, none has done more to facilitate the magnificent energy of the flowing human city. The grid makes manageable the messy humanity of millions. ... It may not be every urban planner's beau ideal, but as a machine for urban living, the grid is pretty perfect.\\"Glaeser, Edward. \\"Reflection\\" in Ballon, p.209 In The Shape of Green, architect Lance Hosey writes that the grid is well-adapted to its natural setting: > The plan of Manhattan is smarter than conventional wisdom concedes. Not a > square grid, most of the streets run river to river instead of uptown and > down, partly because the planners assumed that maritime commerce along the > riverfronts would create more crosstown traffic. The blocks are nearly five > times longer in the east–west dimension (avenue to avenue) than in the > north–south (street to street), so most buildings avoid the low morning and > afternoon sun, thereby ensuring plenty of light without too much heat. > Because the grid sits at a twenty-nine-degree angle off of true north, > potentially every building on every street can receive direct daylight every > day of the year.Hosey, Lance (2012) The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, > and Design. Washington, D.C.: Island Press, pp.150–51.

The first bones of the New Zealand birds to be discovered were similar enough to those of the Cape Barren goose to erroneously refer to them as \\"New Zealand Cape Barren goose\\" (\\"Cereopsis\\" novaezeelandiae). The smaller population of Cape Barren goose in Western Australia is described as a subspecies, Cereopsis novaehollandiae grisea, and named for the group of islands known as the Recherche Archipelago. Description Pair in Tasmania Two at Cleland Wildlife Park, South Australia Nesting Juvenile on Maria Island Cereopsis novaehollandiae - MHNT These are bulky geese and their almost uniformly grey plumage, bearing rounded black spots, is unique. The tail and flight feathers are blackish and the legs are pink with black feet. The short, decurved black bill and green cere gives it a very peculiar expression. The Cape Barren goose is long, weighs and has a wingspan; males are somewhat larger than females. This bird feeds by grazing and rarely swims. Behaviour Their ability to drink salt or brackish water allows numbers of geese to remain on offshore islands all year round. They are one of the rarest of the world's geese. They are gregarious outside the breeding season, when they wander more widely, forming small flocks. Range and habitat A previous decline in numbers appears to have been reversed as birds in the east at least have adapted to feeding on agricultural land. The breeding areas are grassy islands off the Australian coast, where this species nests on the ground in colonies. It bears captivity well, quite readily breeding in confinement if large enough paddocks are provided. In Australia, 19th-century explorers named a number of islands \\"Goose Island\\" due to the species' presence there. A few geese were introduced near Christchurch, New Zealand. They have persisted to this day. In 1968, a small number of geese were introduced to Maria Island.

Founded in 1776, the Bolshoi is among the world's oldest ballet companies. It only achieved worldwide acclaim, however, in the early 20th century when Moscow became the capital of Soviet Russia. Ever since, the Bolshoi is recognised as one of the foremost ballet companies in the world. It has one branch at the Bolshoi Ballet Theater School in Joinville, Brazil. History The earliest origins of the Bolshoi Ballet can be found in the creation of a dance school for a Moscow orphanage in 1773. In 1776, dancers from the school were employed by Prince Pyotr Vasilyevich Ouroussoff and the English theatrical entrepreneur Michael Maddox, to form part of their new theatre company. Originally performing in privately owned venues, they later acquired the Petrovsky Theatre, which, as a result of fires and erratic redevelopment, would later be rebuilt as today's Bolshoi Theatre. While some guest dancers come and go from other very prestigious ballet companies—like the Mariinsky and American Ballet Theatre—many company dancers are graduates of the academy. In 1989, Michael Shannon was the first American ballet dancer to graduate from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and join the Bolshoi Ballet company.\\"American Michael Shannon Joins the Bolshoi Ballet\\"- LATimes Article, November 18, 1989; Despite staging many famous ballets, it struggled to compete with the reputation of the Imperial Russian Ballet, today's Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg. It was not until the appointment of Alexander Gorsky as Ballet Master in 1900 that the company began to develop its own unique identity, with acclaimed productions of new or restaged ballets including, Don Quixote (1900), Coppélia (1901), Swan Lake (1901), La fille mal gardée (1903), Giselle (1911), Le Corsaire (1912) and La Bayadère (1917).Ballet Bag , August 12, 2010 The Soviet leadership's preference for uncomplicated moral themes in the arts was demonstrated in Yuri Grigorovich's appointment as director in 1964. Grigorovich held his position until 1995, at which point a series of directors, including Boris Akimov, Alexei Ratmansky, Yuri Burlaka and Sergei Filin, brought more modern dance performance ideas to the company.

She said: “It mainly happened with the corps du [sic] ballet but also with the soloists. [...] I repeatedly received such propositions to share the beds of oligarchs.\\" American dancer Joy Womack echoed this concern when she left the company after being told that, to secure solo roles she must either pay $10,000 or \\"start a relationship with a sponsor.\\" In January 2013, a sulfuric acid attack on art director Sergei Filin once again steeped the company in scandal. Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, was convicted of organizing the attack and sentenced to six years in prison. Reasons for the attack include corruption within the company. In July 2017, the Bolshoi Theatre cancelled the premiere of a ballet about openly gay Soviet dancer Rudolf Nureyev. The Director General claimed it was due to the bad quality of the dancing; however, principal dancer Maria Alexandrova claimed it was the first sign of a 'new era' of censorship. It was the first time a show has been pulled in such a way since the collapse of the Soviet Union, sparking rumours about the motivation behind it. In 2014, 25-year-old ballet dancer Olga Demina mysteriously went missing. In September 2020, Russian investigators announced that they believe Demina may have been killed in a blackmail plot by Mlkhaz Dzhavoev, who some say was her \\"manager.\\" Notable people=Former dancers *Galina Ulanova *Maria Semyonova *Olga Lepeshinskaya *Mikhail Mordkin *Vasily Tikhomirov *Yekaterina Geltzer *Asaf Messerer *Maya Plisetskaya *Pyotr Gusev *Aleksey Yermolayev *Nikolai Fadeyechev *Maris Liepa *Ekaterina Maximova *Vladimir Vasiliev *Natalia Bessmertnova *Ludmila Semenyaka *Nadezhda Pavlova *Joy Womack *Svetlana Adyrkhaeva *Marina Kondratyeva *Nina Timofeeva *Nina Semizorova *Irek Mukhamedov nadia titova *Alexander Godunov *Alla Mikhalchenko *Nina Ananiashvili *Dmitry Belogolovtsev *Natalia Osipova *Svetlana Lunkina *Dmitry Gudanov *Anna Antonicheva Directors *Alexander Gorsky *Vasily Tikhomirov Choreographers *Rostislav Zakharov *Leonid Lavrovsky *Fyodor Lopukhov *Yuri Grigorovich Composers *Dimitri Shostakovich *Aram Khachaturian Conductors Arrival of soloists of the Bolshoi Ballet at the Schiphol airport, 9 June 1960 *Andrei Anikhanov *Yuri Fayer *Algis Shuraitis Company structure Today the Bolshoi Ballet remains one of the world's foremost ballet companies, in addition to being one of the largest, with approximately 220 dancers. The word \\"bolshoi\\" means \\"big\\" or \\"grand\\" in Russian. The company operates on a hierarchical system, similar to those used by other leading European ballet companies, with senior dancers ranked as principals, and descending in order of importance through lead soloist, first soloist, soloist and finally, corps de ballet. Due to its size, the company operates two troupes of corps de ballet. In 2000, the Bolshoi Ballet opened its first Ballet Academy outside Russia, in Joinville, Brazil.http://www.escolabolshoi.com.br/bolshoi/Portugues/detIdioma.php?cod=1 Performance style The performance style of the Bolshoi Ballet is typically identified as being colourful and bold, combining technique and athleticism with expressiveness and dramatic intensity. This style is commonly attributed to Alexander Gorsky. Historically there has been a fierce rivalry with the St. Petersburg Heritage Ballet Company, the Mariinsky. Both have developed very different performing styles: the Bolshoi has a more colourful and bold approach, whereas the Mariinsky is associated with more pure and refined classicism.

He broadcast News and Comment on mornings and mid-days on weekdays and at noon on Saturdays and also his famous The Rest of the Story segments. From 1952 to 2008, his programs reached as many as 24 million people per week. Paul Harvey News was carried on 1,200 radio stations, on 400 American Forces Network stations, and in 300 newspapers. Early life Harvey was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was the son of a policeman who was killed by robbers in 1921. He made radio receivers as a young boy, and he attended Tulsa Central High School, where the teacher Isabelle Ronan was \\"impressed by his voice.\\" On her recommendation, he started working at KVOO in Tulsa in 1933 helping to clean up when he was 14. He eventually was allowed to fill in on the air by reading commercials and the news. He continued working at KVOO while he attended the University of Tulsa, first as an announcer and later as a program director. He spent three years as a station manager for KFBI AM, now known as KFDI, a radio station that once had studios in Salina, Kansas. From there, he moved to a newscasting job at KOMA in Oklahoma City, and then to KXOK in St. Louis in 1938\\"KXOK in St. Louis to Debut September 19,\\" Broadcasting, September 15, 1938, p. 26. where he was Director of Special Events and a roving reporter. World War II Harvey then moved to Hawaii to cover the US Navy as it concentrated its fleet in the Pacific. He was returning to the mainland from assignment after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He eventually enlisted in the US Army Air Forces but served only from December 1943 to March 1944. His critics claimed that he was given a psychiatric discharge for deliberately injuring himself in the heel. He angrily denied the accusation but was vague about the details: \\"I cannot tell you the exact wording on my discharge.\\" He then moved to Chicago, where in June 1944, he began broadcasting from the ABC affiliate WENR. Career in Chicago In 1945, he began hosting the postwar employment program Jobs for G.I. Joe on WENR. Harvey added The Rest of the Story as a tagline to in-depth feature stories in 1946. One of Harvey's regular topics was lax security, particularly at Argonne National Laboratory, a nuclear research facility west of Chicago. To demonstrate his concern, just after midnight on February 6, 1951, he entered the grounds by scaling a fence and was quickly apprehended by security guards. In 2010, The Washington Post, having obtained 1400 pages of the FBI file on Harvey, described it as an \\"act of participatory journalism.\\"Argonne passes a reporter's security test Harvey's 1951 attempt to test security at Argonne National Laboratory Harvey's \\"escapade\\" prompted the US attorney for Illinois to empanel a grand jury to consider an espionage indictment. Harvey \\"went on the air to suggest he was being set up,\\" and the grand jury subsequently declined to indict Harvey. Going national On April 1, 1951, the ABC Radio Network debuted Paul Harvey News and Comment, with a noon time slot on weekdays. Later Harvey began to host a separate program, The Rest of the Story, in which he provided backstories behind famous people and events. The Rest of the Story premiered on May 10, 1976 on ABC Radio. The series quickly grew to six broadcasts a week and continued until his death in 2009. It was written and produced by his son, Paul Harvey, Jr., from its outset and for its 33-year duration. Harvey and his radio network stated that the stories in that series, although entertaining, were completely true. That was contested by some critics, including urban legend expert Jan Harold Brunvand. In November 2000, Harvey signed a 10-year $100 million contract with ABC Radio Networks. A few months later, after damaging his vocal cords, he went off the air, but he returned in August 2001. His success with sponsors stemmed from the seamlessness with which he segued from his monologue into reading commercial messages. He explained his relationship with them: \\"I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.\\" Fill-in hosts Former US Senator Fred Thompson substituted for Harvey regularly from 2006 to 2007.

Harvey did not host the show full-time after April 2008, when he came down with pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, his wife died on May 3, which caused him to prolong his time away from broadcasting. He voiced commercials and new episodes of The Rest of the Story and News & Comment during middays a few times a week, with his son handling mornings. On-air persona Harvey's on-air persona was influenced by that of the sportscaster Bill Stern. In the 1940s, Stern's The Colgate Sports Reel and newsreel programs used many of the techniques later used by Harvey, including his emphatic style of delivery and the use of phrases such as Reel Two and Reel Three to denote segments of the broadcast, much like Harvey's Page Two and Page Three.Michael Carlson, \\"Paul Harvey: Influential conservative American radio host\\", The Guardian, March 3, 2009.John Dunning, The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio (Oxford University Press US, 1998), , p. 163. Excerpt available at Google Books. Harvey was also known for the catchphrases that he used at the beginning of his programs, such as \\"Hello Americans, this is Paul Harvey. Stand by for NEWS!\\" He always ended, \\"Paul Harvey ... Good day.\\" or \\"Paul Harvey ... Good night.\\" A story might be \\"This day's news of most lasting significance.\\" At the end of a report about someone who had done something ridiculous or offensive, Harvey would say, \\"He would want us to mention his name,\\" followed by silence, and he would then start the next item. The last item of a broadcast, which was often a funny story, would usually be preceded by \\"And now from the 'For-what-it's-worth' department....\\" Other phrases made famous by Harvey included \\"Here's a strange...\\" (a story with an unusual twist) and \\"Self-government won't work without self-discipline.\\" In addition to the inquiry into whether Harvey's Rest of the Story tales are true, Harvey's trademark ability of seamlessly migrating from content to commercial brought scrutiny. In that context, Salon magazine called him the \\"finest huckster ever to roam the airwaves.\\"Salon.com Some have argued that Harvey's fawning and lavish product endorsements may have been misleading or confusing to his audience. Harvey's endorsed products included EdenPure heaters, Bose radios, Select Comfort mattresses, and Hi- Health dietary supplements, including a supplement that was claimed to improve vision but was later the subject of a Federal Trade Commission enforcement action against the manufacturer (but not Harvey himself) for misleading claims made on his show.Craig Harris, \\"FTC fines Hi-Health $450,000 over Paul Harvey ads\\", Arizona Republic, August 24, 2005. In one of the tribute broadcasts, Gil Gross said that Harvey considered advertising just another type of news and that he endorsed only products that he believed in, often by interviewing someone from the company. Aviation Harvey was an avid pilot who had briefly served in the US Army Air Corps from December 1943 to March 1944. Harvey was an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years and would occasionally talk about flying to his radio audience. He was a member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), and he was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA's headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in aircraft manufacturing company Cirrus Aircraft, based in Duluth, Minnesota. According to the AOPA Pilot contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term skyjack and is credited with popularizing the terms Reaganomics and guesstimate. Personal tastes Beginning in 1952, Harvey was a friend of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Harvey would often submit \\"advance copies of his radio script for comment and approval.\\" It is believed that Harvey's friendship with Hoover helped Harvey escape criminal charges relating to his trespassing at Argonne National Laboratory. Nevertheless, Harvey was happy to defend Hoover and spoke of him on his show of April 25, 1963: \\"God help the United States without John Edgar Hoover.... (FBI) Director Hoover is not retiring. If you have heard otherwise, somebody's sinister wish was the father of that thought. It is not so.\\" Harvey was also a close friend of US Senator Joseph McCarthy and supported McCarthy's espoused campaign to expose and expel communists from American society and government. Harvey was also a close friend of George Vandeman and the Reverend Billy Graham. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Harvey attended Calvary Memorial Church in Oak Park. When the church moved from its original location on Madison Street to the former Presbyterian Church on Lake Street, Harvey asked Graham to preach at the dedication service. Harvey associated with various congregations of different denominations. He and his wife regularly attended the Camelback Adventist Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, during his winters there. He often quoted the Adventist pioneer Ellen G. White in his broadcasts and received the \\"Golden Microphone\\" Award for his professionalism and graciousness in dealing with the church.The Religious Affiliation of Radio Broadcaster Paul Harvey at Adherents.com.SDALink Paul Harvey Tribute . He was also active with a small Plymouth Brethren meeting in Maywood, Illinois, called Woodside Bible Chapel. Rhetorical style Robert D. McFadden, writing Harvey's obituary for the New York Times, examined his unique radio style and how it interacted with his political views: > [He] personalized the radio news with his right-wing opinions, but laced > them with his own trademarks: a hypnotic timbre, extended pauses for effect, > heart-warming tales of average Americans and folksy observations that evoked > the heartland, family values and the old-fashioned plain talk one heard > around the dinner table on Sunday. 'Hello, Americans,' he barked. 'This is > Paul Harvey! Stand byyy for Newwws!' He railed against welfare cheats and > defended the death penalty. He worried about the national debt, big > government, bureaucrats who lacked common sense, permissive parents, leftist > radicals and America succumbing to moral decay. He championed rugged > individualism, love of God and country, and the fundamental decency of > ordinary people.Also Cited in Garance Franke-Ruta, \\"Paul Harvey's 1978 'So > God Made a Farmer' Speech,\\" The Atlantic Feb 3, 2013 Awards Harvey was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters National Radio Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and appeared on the Gallup poll list of America's most admired men. In addition he received 11 Freedom Foundation Awards as well as the Horatio Alger Award. Harvey was named to the DeMolay Hall of Fame, a Masonic youth organization, on June 25, 1993. In 2005, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' most prestigious civilian award, by President George W. Bush. Bush's remarks summarized Harvey's career: \\"He first went on the air in 1933, and he's been heard nationwide for 54 years. Americans like the sound of his voice...over the decades we have come to recognize in that voice some of the finest qualities of our country: patriotism, the good humor, the kindness, and common sense of Americans.\\" On May 18, 2007, he received an honorary degree from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1992 he received the Paul White Award of the Radio Television Digital News Association Paul Harvey was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1987 in the area of Communication. Family Harvey was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Harry Harrison Aurandt (1873–1921) and Anna Dagmar (née Christensen) Aurandt (1883–1960). His father was born in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania; his mother was a native of Denmark. He had one sibling, an older sister Frances Harrietta (née Aurandt) Price (1908–1988). In late 1921, when Harvey was three years old, his father Harry was murdered. The elder Aurandt was a Tulsa police officer who served as secretary to Commissioner J.H. Adkinson. On the night of December 18, Officer Aurandt and a friend, Tulsa police detective Ike Wilkerson, were off-duty and rabbit hunting when they were approached by four masked and armed men who attempted to rob them. Mr. Aurandt was shot and died two days later of his wounds. A large-scale manhunt resulted in the arrest of four suspects the day after Aurandt died. A lynch mob of 1,000 people formed at the jail, but the suspects were smuggled out. Two of them would be convicted of murder and sentenced to life terms following identification by Detective Wilkerson, who said that he knew the men and was able to recognize them despite their masks. At Aurandt's funeral, twelve robed members of the Ku Klux Klan arrived late in the service and dropped roses on his casket, though there is no other indication that Aurandt was himself a Klansman In 1940, Harvey married Lynne Cooper of St. Louis. She was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa at Washington University in St. Louis and a former schoolteacher. They met when Harvey was working at KXOK and Cooper came to the station for a school news program. Harvey invited her to dinner, proposed to her after a few minutes of conversation and from then on called her \\"Angel,\\" even on his radio show. A year later she said yes. The couple moved to Chicago in 1944. On May 17, 2007, Harvey told his radio audience that Angel had developed leukemia. Her death, at the age of 92, was announced by ABC radio on May 3, 2008. When she died at their River Forest home, the Chicago Sun-Times described her as, \\"More than his astute business partner and producer, she also was a pioneer for women in radio and an influential figure in her own right for decades.\\" According to the founder of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, Bruce DuMont, \\"She was to Paul Harvey what Colonel Parker was to Elvis Presley. She really put him on track to have the phenomenal career that his career has been.\\" Lynne Harvey was the first producer ever inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, and had developed some of her husband's best-known features, such as \\"The Rest of the Story.\\" While working on her husband's radio show, she established 10 p.m. as the hour in which news is broadcast. She was the first woman to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Chicago chapter of American Women in Radio and Television. She worked in television also, and created a television show called Dilemma which is acknowledged as the prototype of the modern talk show genre. While working at CBS, she was among the first women to produce an entire newscast. In later years, she was best known as a philanthropist. They had one son, Paul Aurandt, Jr., who goes by the name Paul Harvey, Jr. He assisted his father at News and Comment and The Rest of the Story. Paul, Jr., whose voice announced the bumpers into and out of each News and Comment episode, filled in for his father during broadcasts and broadcast the morning editions after the passing of his mother. Death and tributes Harvey died on February 28, 2009, at the age of 90 at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, surrounded by family and friends. No cause of death was announced. In response to his father's death, his son, Paul Harvey Jr., said, \\"millions have lost a friend\\". At the time of his death, he had less than two years left on his ten-year contract. Former President George W. Bush issued a statement on Harvey's death, calling Harvey: \\"a friendly and familiar voice in the lives of millions of Americans.\\" On March 4, Gil Gross was chosen to become the next host of News & Comment. Gross lasted only one week before being taken off the air; Gross, who was based in San Francisco, would have had to record the show around 1:00 a.m. Pacific Time to finish in time for the East Coast broadcasts, in addition to his local show on KGO. News & Comment was replaced the next week by Mike Huckabee's existing commentary, The Huckabee Report. The Huckabee Report ceased radio distribution in 2015. Harvey's full-length biography, Good Day! The Paul Harvey Story, was published in May 2009 by Regnery Publishing. On February 3, 2013, a recording of Harvey's \\"So God Made a Farmer\\" commentary was used by Ram Trucks in a commercial titled \\"Farmer,\\" which aired during Super Bowl XLVII.

The southern end of the lake drains into the nascent Clutha close to Albert Town, where it is met by its first main tributary, the Hāwea River, the outflow of Lake Wanaka's twin, Lake Hāwea. It is also met here by the Cardrona River. From here the river flows swiftly through the Upper Clutha Valley between ancient glacial terraces, negotiating a long section called the 'Snake' before reaching a rare switchback feature called the Devil's Nook near the town of Luggate. The river soon narrows as it passes through the Maori Gorge at Queensberry. Shortly thereafter it is joined by another tributary, the Lindis, before widening as it enters Lake Dunstan, an artificial lake created behind the massive hydroelectric dam at Clyde. Fifty kilometres south of Lake Wanaka, the Clutha reaches the town of Cromwell, which was substantially altered when the Clyde Dam project was commissioned in 1992. Here the river is joined by the waters of the Kawarau, which flows from Lake Wakatipu. Prior to the construction of the Clyde Dam, this river junction, known as the Cromwell Junction, was renowned for the difference in colour between the two rivers’ waters.A pre-dam photograph of the junction, showing the brown Kawarau meeting the blue Clutha, can be seen at this site. The river then flows southeast through the inundated Cromwell Gorge to Clyde and nearby Alexandra, where it is joined by the waters of the Manuherikia River. South of Alexandra the river widens again to form Lake Roxburgh, another artificial lake, behind the Roxburgh Dam, which was commissioned in 1956. The hydroelectric reservoir flooded the Roxburgh Gorge and several large rapids including the Molyneux Falls and the Golden Falls. The town of Roxburgh sits close to the river, downstream from Lake Wanaka. From here the river continues southeast past the towns of Ettrick, Millers Flat, and Beaumont, before flowing through the Rongahere Gorge, which is admired for its native bush corridor and for the Birch Island native reserve. Beyond here, the river is met by the Tuapeka River at Tuapeka Mouth. At this point the river turns southward, before being met by its last major tributary, the Pomahaka River, which joins the Clutha from the coast. The river passes the town of Balclutha before widening into the Clutha delta which contains the large flat island of Inch Clutha. Here the river divides into two distributary branches, the Matau (northern), which flows past Kaitangata, and Koau (southern). Both branches flow into the Pacific Ocean at Molyneux Bay. The Clutha's average discharge is estimated at , comparable to many much larger rivers. This heavy flow, combined with the relatively small size of the river in global terms, makes the Clutha notoriously fast-flowing, and it is often listed as one of the world's most swiftly flowing rivers, alongside Australia's Macleay and Fitzroy Rivers, the Amazon and Atrato Rivers in South America, and the Teesta River in the Himalaya. The highest recorded flow on the Clutha was during heavy storms in June 2015, peaking at .Otago Regional Council report into the June 2015 storm, p. 10. Note that flow readings have only been recorded since 1954. It is possible that earlier floods, such as that in 1879, might have produced greater flows. The waters of the Upper Clutha are clear turquoise, the result of glacial and snow-melt filtering when the water flows through Lake Wanaka. This is a rare characteristic for a high volume river. Below Cromwell, where the silt-laden Kawarau enters, the waters are less turquoise. Beyond the river's mouth Such is the nature of the geology of the New Zealand region that the true river tells only half the story of the Clutha's course. Beyond its mouth, a submarine canyon system extends for over into the South Pacific Ocean, eventually becoming the Bounty Trough. The canyon system bears a remarkable resemblance to the pattern of river and tributaries visible on land, so much so that many of the rivers which empty into the sea along the Otago coast can virtually be considered tributaries of the Clutha's submarine system. These rivers include the Tokomairaro, Taieri, Waikouaiti, Shag, and even the Waitaki. The quartz and schist geology of much of the Clutha River catchment leads to the river transporting white quartz material downstream and depositing this on coastal beaches. The general northerly current in the Pacific Ocean leads to this sand being transported and eventually deposited on beaches north to the Otago Peninsula and beyond. The Roxburgh Hydro Scheme has blocked the supply of new sand from the river, causing erosion of beaches further north such as St. Kilda Beach and St. Clair Beach, Dunedin, and along the Coastal Road at Kakanui.  History  The river was known by the Māori as Mata-au, meaning current or eddy in an expanse of water. This name, now more frequently rendered as Matau, is still used for one of the two main channels of the Clutha delta. The river takes its European name from Cluaidh, the Scots Gaelic name for the River Clyde in Scotland which runs through Glasgow. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by Captain Cook. The upper reaches of the river once abounded in flightless moa, predated upon by the Haast's eagle. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 Māori close to the river's banks. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth at Port Molyneux, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy. Gold rush The river featured greatly in the Central Otago goldrush. The first major gold deposits in Otago were discovered around the Tuapeka River at Gabriel's Gully by Gabriel Read in 1861, and the following year large amounts of the precious metal were discovered close to the site of modern Cromwell. By Christmas 1861, 14,000 prospectors were on the Tuapeka and Waipori fields. The gold rush was short-lived, with most of the alluvial gold played out by 1863, but prospectors continued to arrive, swelling to a maximum of 18,000 miners in February 1864.McKinnon, M. (ed.), Bradley, B. & Kirkpatrick, R. (1997). New Zealand Historical Atlas: Ko Papatuanuku e Takoto Nei. Auckland: David Bateman Ltd. . Floods The Clutha passes under the third Balclutha Road Bridge. The first bridge at this site was destroyed during the flood of 1878. Several major floods have occurred on the Clutha, most notably the “Hundred year floods” of 14–16 October 1878 and 13–15 October 1978. The 1878 flood is regarded as New Zealand's greatest known flood. During this, a bridge at Clydevale was washed downstream, where it collided with the Balclutha Road Bridge, destroying the latter. The course of the river near its mouth was greatly affected, with the mouth moving north from its former outlet to create two new outlets at its current mouth. The thriving town of Port Molyneux, which was located at the river's (former) mouth, dwindled as a result and today no longer exists. The 1978 flood breached the banks of rivers from the Oreti in the south to the Tokomairaro. Over of land was inundated, with the loss of over 21,000 livestock. Towns and areas affected stretched from Makarora in the north to Invercargill in the south. The town of Wyndham was completely evacuated, and the towns of Balclutha, Milton and Mataura were seriously affected with many residents moved. The small settlement of Kelso on the banks of the Pomahaka River was completely abandoned and was not rebuilt once the waters subsided.Lloyd, K. (1978) Flood disaster 1978. Dunedin. At its peak, at 6.00 a.m. on the 15th, the Clutha's flow was measured at just over .Lind, C.A. (1978) The 100 year flood - 1978. Invercargill: Craig Printing Co. A major flood in 1999 seriously damaged river communities, especially Alexandra. The flooding in Alexandra was attributed to a rise in the riverbed, resulting from silt loading in the Roxburgh reservoir behind the Roxburgh Dam downriver from the town. The 1999 flood had significantly higher water levels in Alexandra than the 1878 flood, despite being only 80% of the volume of the latter.  Water usage  The Clyde Dam There are two hydroelectric power stations, the 464MW Clyde Dam and the 320MW Roxburgh Dam, located on the river providing electricity to the New Zealand power grid. Other dams had been proposed in the past but the projects were cancelled. Several Local Authorities along the Clutha River use it as a source for treatment plants to provide communities with potable water. The Clutha also provides irrigation for stone fruit orchards and vineyards around Cromwell, Alexandra, and Roxburgh, which grow apples, apricots, nectarines, cherries, peaches and grapes. There are more vineyards in the upper reaches of the river, at Bannockburn, Bendigo, Tarras and Wanaka. The spectacular scenery of Central Otago makes the upper Clutha a popular holiday destination, especially for adventure tourism. Jetboating, kayaking, rafting, riverboarding, and guided fishing occurs on the river, and waterskiing, tandem parachuting and parapenting operators are all to be found in the area. The upper Clutha is also used for multi-sports events, and Lake Dunstan is an important rowing venue. Major ski fields are in the mountains at the head of the Clutha's catchment. Curling is also played close to the Clutha in the harsh Central Otago winters.

It was a constitutional monarchy with a high level of self- government within the British Empire. New Zealand became a separate British Crown colony in 1841 and received responsible government with the Constitution Act in 1852. New Zealand chose not to take part in the Federation of Australia and became the Dominion of New Zealand on 26 September 1907, Dominion Day, by proclamation of King Edward VII. Dominion status was a public mark of the political independence that had evolved over half a century through responsible government. Just under one million people lived in New Zealand in 1907 and cities such as Auckland and Wellington were growing rapidly. The Dominion of New Zealand allowed the British Government to shape its foreign policy, and it followed Britain into the First World War. The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the New Zealand Government made its own decision to enter the war. In the post-war period, the term Dominion has fallen into disuse. Full independence was granted with the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and adopted by the New Zealand Parliament in 1947. However, the 1907 royal proclamation of Dominion status has never been revoked and remains in force today. Dominion status=Debate The alteration in status was stirred by a sentiment on the part of the prime ministers of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire that a new term was necessary to differentiate them from the non-self-governing colonies. At the 1907 Imperial Conference, it was argued that self-governing colonies that were not styled 'Dominion' (like Canada) or 'commonwealth' (like Australia) should be designated by some such title as 'state of the empire'. After much debate over lexicon, the term 'Dominion' was decided upon. Following the 1907 conference, the New Zealand House of Representatives passed a motion respectfully requesting that King Edward VII \\"take such steps as he may consider necessary\\" to change the designation of New Zealand from the Colony of New Zealand to the Dominion of New Zealand. The adoption of the designation of Dominion would, \\"raise the status of New Zealand\\" stated Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and \\"… have no other effect than that of doing the country good\\".Report on the Inquiry into New Zealand's Constitutional Arrangements Ward also had regional imperial ambitions. He hoped the new designation would remind the world that New Zealand was not part of Australia. It would dignify New Zealand, a country he thought was \\"the natural centre for the government of the South Pacific\\". Dominion status was strongly opposed by Leader of the Opposition Bill Massey, an ardent imperialist, who suspected that the change would lead to demands for increases in viceregal and ministerial salaries. Royal proclamation A royal proclamation granting New Zealand the designation of 'Dominion' was issued on 9 September 1907. On 26 September the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, read the proclamation from the steps of Parliament: Effect and reception rightthumbupright=1.5The New Zealand Observer (1907) shows Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward as a pretentious dwarf beneath a massive 'Dominion' top hat. The caption reads: The Surprise Packet: Canada: \\"Rather large for him, is it not?\\" Australia: \\"Oh his head is swelling rapidly. The hat will soon fit.\\" With the attaining of Dominion status, the colonial treasurer became the minister of finance and the Colonial Secretary's Office was renamed the Department of Internal Affairs. The proclamation of 10 September also designated members of the House of Representatives as \\"M.P.\\" (Member of Parliament). Previously they were designated \\"M.H.R.\\" (Member of the House of Representatives). Letters patent were issued to confirm New Zealand's change in status, declaring that: \\"there shall be a Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over Our Dominion of New Zealand\\". Dominion status allowed New Zealand to become virtually independent, while retaining the British monarch as head of state, represented by a governor appointed in consultation with the New Zealand Government. Control over defence, constitutional amendments, and (partially) foreign affairs remained with the British Government. Joseph Ward had thought that New Zealanders would be \\"much gratified\\" with the new title. However, Dominion status was received with limited enthusiasm or indifference from the general public, who were unable to discern any practical difference. Dominion status symbolised New Zealand's shift to self-governance, but this change had been practically accomplished with the first responsible government in the 1850s. Historian Keith Sinclair later remarked: According to Dame Silvia Cartwright, 18th Governor-General of New Zealand, in a 2001 speech: In 1917, letters patent were issued again re-designating the Governor as 'Governor-General'. The changes in the viceroy's title were intended to reflect more fully New Zealand's self-governing status. The 1917 letters patent constituted the office 'Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in and over Our Dominion of New Zealand'. The national flag, depicting the British Union Flag, remained the same. Until 1911 New Zealand used the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom on all official documents and public buildings, however following its new status a new coat of arms for New Zealand was designed. A royal warrant granting armorial ensigns and supports was issued on 26 August 1911 and published in the New Zealand Gazette on 11 January 1912. Despite the new status, there was some apprehension in 1919 when Prime Minister Bill Massey signed the Treaty of Versailles (giving New Zealand membership of the League of Nations). This act was a turning point in New Zealand's diplomatic history, indicating that the Dominion had a degree of control over its foreign affairs. Massey himself did not view it as a symbolic act and would have preferred New Zealand to maintain a deferential role within the empire. Dominion Day To mark the granting of Dominion status, 26 September was declared Dominion Day. The first Dominion Day was celebrated on 25 September 1907, when one politician said it would be remembered as New Zealand's Fourth of July. Today, it is observed only as a Provincial Anniversary Day holiday in South Canterbury. There is support in some quarters for the day to be revived as an alternative New Zealand Day, instead of renaming Waitangi Day, New Zealand's current national day. Territorial expansion The Antarctic territory of the Ross Dependency, previously under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, is today regarded by New Zealand as having become part of the Dominion of New Zealand on 16 August 1923.http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/imperial/1923/0974/latest/DLM1195.html Order in Council Under the British Settlements Act, 1887 (50 & 51 Vict c 54), Providing for the Government of the Ross Dependency. The legality of that contemporary assertion has been questionedSee \\"New Zealand's Claims in the Antarctic\\" by Ivor L. M. Richardson, New Zealand Law Journal, Vol. 33, No. 9, p. 133 but is nonetheless the position of New Zealand. The Cook Islands and Niue each already formed part of the Dominion of New Zealand on the date it was proclaimed. Both had become part of the Colony of New Zealand on 11 June 1901.\\"Commonwealth and Colonial Law\\" by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 891 and 897 Western Samoa was never part of New Zealand, having instead been the subject of a League of Nations Mandate and subsequently a United Nations Trusteeship Agreement. However, in 1982 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council allowed Samoans born under New Zealand administration (i.e. prior to 1962) to claim New Zealand citizenship. Changes to Dominion status=Balfour Declaration King George V with the prime ministers of the British Dominions at the 1926 Imperial Conference.Standing (left to right): Monroe (Newfoundland), Coates (New Zealand), Bruce (Australia), Hertzog (Union of South Africa), Cosgrave (Irish Free State). Seated: Baldwin (United Kingdom), King George V, William Lyon Mackenzie King (Canada) The 1926 Imperial Conference devised the 'Balfour formula' of Dominion status, stating that: The Balfour Report further resolved that each respective governor-general occupied \\"the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion\\" as was held by the monarch in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the only advisers to the governor-general (and the monarch in New Zealand) were his New Zealand ministers. Prime Minister Gordon Coates, who led the New Zealand delegation to the conference, called the Balfour Declaration a \\"poisonous document\\" that would weaken the British Empire as a whole. Statute of Westminster In 1931, the British (Imperial) Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which gave effect to resolutions passed by the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930. It essentially gave legal recognition to the \\"de facto independence\\" of the Dominions by removing Britain's ability to make laws for the Dominions without their consent: New Zealand initially viewed the Statute of Westminster as an \\"unnecessary legal complication that it perceived would weaken imperial relations.\\"Harshan Kumarasingham, 'The \\"New Commonwealth\\" 1947–49: A New Zealand Perspective on India Joining the Commonwealth', The Round Table, Vol. 95(385), July 2006, pp. 441–454. The New Zealand Government only allowed the Dominion of New Zealand to be cited in the statute provided that the operative sections did not apply unless adopted by the New Zealand Parliament. Preferring the British Government to handle most of its foreign affairs and defence, New Zealand held back from adopting the Statute of Westminster Act. The Labour government of Peter Fraser adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947. The First Labour Government (1935–1949) pursued a more independent path in foreign affairs, in spite of the statute remaining unadopted. In 1938 Deputy Prime Minister Peter Fraser told Parliament, \\"this country has to make up its own mind on international problems as a sovereign country – because under the Statute of Westminster ours is a sovereign country\\". In the 1944 Speech from the Throne the Governor-General announced the government's intention to adopt the Statute of Westminster. It was forced to abandon the proposal when the opposition accused the government of being disloyal to Britain at a time of need. Ironically, the National opposition prompted the adoption of the statute in 1947 when its leader, and future prime minister, Sidney Holland introduced a member's bill to abolish the Legislative Council. Because New Zealand required the consent of the British Parliament to make the necessary amendments to the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, Peter Fraser, now Prime Minister, had a reason to finally adopt the statute. It was formally adopted on 25 November 1947 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, along with consenting legislation from the British Parliament. New Zealand was the last Dominion listed in the statute to adopt it. Dominion in disuse After the Second World War, the country joined the United Nations as simply \\"New Zealand\\". A year later in 1946, Prime Minister Peter Fraser instructed government departments not to use the term Dominion any longer. One of the first marks of New Zealand's sovereignty was the alteration of the monarch's title by the Royal Titles Act 1953. For the first time, the monarch's official New Zealand title mentioned New Zealand separately from the United Kingdom and the other Dominions, now called Realms: The name of the state in official usage was also changed to the Realm of New Zealand.In 1952 the Realm comprised New Zealand and its dependent territories, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the Ross Dependency in Antarctica. The Cook Islands and Niue later became self-governing states associated with New Zealand, in 1965 and 1974 respectively. The term Dominion largely fell into disuse over the next decade. The term persisted the longest in the names of institutions (for instance, the Dominion Museum was not renamed the National Museum until as late as 1972), businesses and in the constitutions of clubs and societies. One rare surviving usage is in the title of a newspaper, The Dominion Post (formerly The Dominion). The change in style did not otherwise affect the legal status of New Zealand or its Government; the 1907 royal proclamation of Dominion status has never been revoked and remains in force today. Nevertheless, the opinion of the New Zealand Government is that New Zealand became a sovereign state in 1947: \\"…both in terms of gaining formal legal control over the conduct of its foreign policy and the attainment of constitutional and plenary powers by its legislature\\". In passing the Constitution Act 1986 (effective 1 January 1987), New Zealand \\"unilaterally revoked all residual United Kingdom legislative power\\".Philip A. Joseph, Constitutional and Administrative Law in New Zealand, Brookers Ltd., Wellington, 2001, p. 459.

The original Māori name Oanaka means 'The place of Anaka', a local tribal chief.Wanaka, Lake (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, The 1966 New Zealand Encyclopaedia) The town near the foot of the lake is named Wanaka. Geography=Geography Lake Wānaka lies at the heart of the Otago Lakes in the lower South Island of New Zealand. The township, which sits in a glacier-carved basin on the shores of the lake, is the gateway to Mt Aspiring National Park. Lake Hāwea is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of Makarora, the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic Cardrona Valley, a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring Queenstown. Geology At its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north–south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower. Lake Wānaka lies in a u-shaped valley formed by glacial erosion during the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the Matukituki and Makarora Rivers, and is the source of the Clutha River. Nearby Lake Hāwea lies in a parallel valley carved by a neighbouring glacier eight kilometres to the east. At their closest point (a rocky ridge called The Neck), the lakes are only 1,000 metres apart.Lakes: Laka Wanaka and Hawea (from the Tourism New Zealand website) Small islands towards the foot of the lake include Ruby Island, Stevensons Island and Harwich Island. Some host ecological sanctuaries, such as one for buff weka on Stevensons Island. The towns of Wanaka and Albert Town are near the lake's outflow into the Clutha River. Climate=Human history=Exploration and settlement For Māori, the Wānaka area was a natural crossroads. The Haast Pass gave access to the West Coast and its pounamu; the Cardrona Valley led to the natural rock bridge \\"Whatatorere\\", which was the only place that the Kawarau River and Clutha River / Mata-Au could be crossed without boats. Native reeds were used to build boats that enabled a swift return downriver to the east coast. The Cromwell basin supported a large population of moa, which were hunted to extinction about 500 years ago. Until the early nineteenth century, Wānaka was visited annually by Ngāi Tahu who sought pounamu in the mountains above the Haast River and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending the Clutha River / Mata-Au in reed boats. According to the Ngāi Tahu, Lake Wānaka was dug by the Waitaha explorer Rākaihautū with his kō named Tūwhakaroria. After Waitaha arrived in the Uruao waka at Whakatū (Nelson), Rākaihautū divided his people into two groups. Rākaihautū led his group down the middle of the island, digging the freshwater lakes of Te Waipounamu. Numerous kāinga mahinga kai (food-gathering places) and kāinga nohoanga (settlements) were located around the lake. The Kāti Māmoe settlement as the site of modern Wanaka was named Para karehu. The area was invaded by the Ngāi Tahu in the early 18th century. Ngāi Tahu use of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In 1836, the Ngati Tama chief Te Puoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass: they fell on the Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and Lake Hāwea, capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children. Although Te Puoho was later killed by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Tuhawaiki, Māori seasonal visits to the area ceased. The first known map of Lake Wānaka was drawn in 1844 by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Te Huruhuru. The first European to see the lake was Nathaniel Chalmers in 1853. Guided by Reko and Kaikoura, he walked from Tuturau (Southland) to the lake via the Kawarau River. However he was stricken by dysentery, so his guides returned him down the Clutha in a reed boat. By 1861, several sheep stations had been established in around the south end of the lake, and in 1862, the lake itself was surveyed in a whaleboat. The early European name was Lake Pembroke. Current use and tourism Lake Wānaka on an overcast day. In addition to ongoing sheep farming, the lake is now a popular resort, and is much used in the summer for fishing, boating and swimming. The nearby mountains and fast- flowing rivers allow for adventure tourism year-round, with jetboating and skiing facilities located nearby. With Queenstown airport close by, tourism mirrors that of the surrounding areas. Conservation As one of the few lakes in the South Island with an unmodified shoreline, the lake is protected by special legislation, the Lake Wanaka Preservation Act of 1973. The Act established a 'Guardians of Lake Wanaka' group, appointed by the Minister of Conservation, which advises on measures to protect the lake.Briefing to the incoming Minister of Conservation 2011 – containing information about Statutory bodies, including the Guardians (from the Department of Conservation website, Friday 14 December 2012) Oxygen weed (Lagarosiphon major), an aquarium plant and invasive species native to Southern Africa, has been a problem in the lake's ecosystem for some time. Attempts to eradicate the weed have not been successful. Substantial suction dredging operations have shown promise, but tend to miss isolated spots which then regrow into larger weed beds. (NIWA report, June 2006, from the Land Information New Zealand website) In popular culture \\"That Wanaka Tree\\" – a willow growing just inside the lake – is a tourist attraction in its own right, featuring on many tourists' Instagram feeds. The tree had its lower branches cut by vandals in 2020. That Wanaka Tree The lake is referenced in the title of the song Lake Wanaka by Israeli singer-songwriter Keren Peles. In film The region has been the setting for many international films, including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, the Legend of S, and A Wrinkle in Time. Lake Wānaka was mentioned several times in the movie Mission: Impossible III as a location the lead couple visited and as the answer to Ethan Hunt's question on the phone to verify the identity of his wife. The New Zealand cook and author Annabel Langbein, who owns a small estate at the side of the lake, filmed her series The Free Range Cook and Simple Pleasures here. As a reported refuge New Zealand has been reported to be a favoured refuge for the 'super rich' in the event of a cataclysm. One such high net worth individual is Peter Thiel, who purchased of lakeside land in 2015, although he had not developed it as of 2020.

(2005). \\"Bungo\\" in . It was sometimes called , with Buzen Province. Bungo bordered Buzen, Hyūga, Higo, Chikugo, and Chikuzen Provinces. History At the end of the 7th century, Toyo Province was split into Buzen (literally, \\"the front of Toyo\\") and Bungo (\\"the back of Toyo\\"). Until the Heian period, Bungo was read as Toyokuni no Michi no Shiri. It is believed that the capital of Bungo was located in Furugō (古国府), literally \\"old capital,\\" section of the city of Ōita, but as of 2016 no archaeological evidence has been found. The honor of the holiest Shinto shrine of Bungo Province (豊前一宮, Buzen ichinomiya) was given to Usa Shrine known as Usa Hachimangu or Usa Jingu in Usa district (today Usa, Ōita). Usa shrine had not only religious authority but also political influence to local governance, but their influence was reduced until the Sengoku period. During the Sengoku period, in the middle of the 16th century, Bungo was a stronghold of the Ōtomo clan. The Ōuchi clan in the western Chūgoku Region was influenced to Buzen politics. In the middle of the period, both clans declined. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi also took the power in Kyūshū, 120 thousand koku of Buzen province was given to Kuroda Yoshitaka since 1587, who made Kokura, currently part of Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, his site and built the castle. Other parts of the province were divided into pieces and given to other daimyōs. In the year 1600 the Dutch ship piloted by the Englishman Will Adams foundered on Bungo's coast. When Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu interviewed Adams, his suspicions were confirmed that the Jesuits, who had been allowed to operate in Japan since the 1540s, were intent on gaining control of the country. When the time was right, in 1614, Ieyasu banished all Christian activity. Thus, Adams' landing in Bungo proved significant to the nation's subsequent history. Hearn, Lafcadio.

She is the only daughter of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, and a niece of Queen Elizabeth II. She is the youngest granddaughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. At the time of her birth she was seventh in line of succession to the British throne and is currently 24th. Early life and education Sarah Armstrong-Jones was born on 1 May 1964 at Kensington Palace in London. She was christened in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 13 July 1964. Her godmothers were Prudence, Lady Penn (née Stewart-Wilson), stepsister of Jocelyn Stevens; Jane Stevens, the wife of Jocelyn Stevens and one of Princess Margaret's ladies-in-waiting; and Marigold Bridgeman. Her godfathers were David Fane, 15th Earl of Westmorland, and her father's friend Antony Barton. Lady Sarah is herself a godmother to Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Lady Rose Gilman, and Lady Louise Windsor. Lady Sarah and her brother, David, then Viscount Linley, grew up in the nursery of Kensington Palace, Apartment 1a. They were raised with a nanny called Verona Sumner, although their parents, most especially their father, were comparatively hands-on (for the time), with their father teaching them to build things and be creative. They spent weekends, depending on with which parent, at either Nymans or Royal Lodge. Holidays were given to the royal estates at Sandringham and Balmoral, where Lady Sarah did a lot of landscape painting. Lady Sarah was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. She accompanied her mother and brother on an official visit to China and Hong Kong in May 1987. She attended Bedales School, which she left with a single A level in Art. She enrolled at the Camberwell School of Art. After her studies there, she took a two-year sabbatical to travel with her father to India, where he was employed to photograph the production of A Passage to India. The film's producer, John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne, gave her a job as an intern, assisting the wardrobe department (without credit) and studying wood gilding under her father's cousin Thomas Messel. Returning to England, she enrolled at Middlesex Polytechnic (renamed as Middlesex University since 1992). Professional life From 9 December 2015 to 23 April 2016, the Redfern Gallery exhibited \\"recent paintings and drawings\\" by \\"Sarah Armstrong-Jones.\\" She has been exhibiting her work, always under the name Sarah Armstrong-Jones, at the Redfern Gallery since 1995. Her work has won awards: The Windsor & Newton Prize in 1988 and The Creswick Landscape Prize in 1990. She is vice-president of The Royal Ballet, an appointment she accepted in 2004, following the example of her late mother, who was also a patron of the Royal Ballet until her death two years before. Marriage and issue The arms of Lady Sarah, being her father's borne on a lozenge. Lady Sarah met Daniel Chatto during her sabbatical in India with her father in the 1980s. He was also working on a film, albeit a different film—Heat and Dust. Chatto proposed to her with a \\"vintage cluster ring.\\" She married Chatto on 14 July 1994, the marriage being officiated by the Reverend Chad Varah at St Stephen's, Walbrook, in the City of London. The bride's wedding gown was designed by Jasper Conran. The Snowdon Floral Tiara which is made out of three brooches secured her veil. Her bridesmaids were Lady Frances Armstrong-Jones, Zara Phillips (daughter of her cousin Anne, Princess Royal), and Tara Noble. The couple have two sons: *Samuel David Benedict Chatto (born 28 July 1996) who is 25th in the line of succession to the British throne . *Arthur Robert Nathaniel Chatto (born 5 February 1999) who is 26th in the line of succession to the British throne and a former page of honour to Queen Elizabeth II (his grand-aunt) from 2009 to 2015. Both children attended Eton College. In 2018, Samuel graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in the History of Art and now works as a potter. Arthur is currently enrolled at the University of Edinburgh.

She was baptized on 19 February 1978 at Barnwell Parish Church. She grew up in Kensington Palace. Lady Davina was educated at Kensington Preparatory School in Notting Hill, followed by St George's School, Ascot. She is a graduate of the University of the West of England, with a degree in media studies. Marriage and children On 31 July 2004, she married Gary Christie Lewis (born in 1970), a New Zealander. Lewis is a carpenter who runs a property renovation business and is a surfing enthusiast. He has a son, Ari (born 1992), from a previous relationship. The couple had known each other for four years, having met on holiday in Bali, but they kept their relationship secret for several years. Lewis is the son of Larry Lewis, a Māori builder who was runner-up in the Golden Shears sheep-shearing competition in 1982. His uncle is the prominent Maori author Witi Ihimaera who wrote The Whale Rider which became a film of the same name. Gary Lewis is also the first person of known Māori descent to marry a relative of the royal family, or to marry the daughter of a British prince. As she is a legitimate descendant in the male line of King George V and in line to the British throne, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required that Royal Assent to the wedding be obtained in advance for the marriage to be legal and the descendants thereof to inherit rights of succession to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, including that of New Zealand. On 20 July 2004, the Queen-in-Council formally declared her consent to the marriage.Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society. Royal Marriages Act, 1772. Retrieved 29 January 2016. The wedding took place at the private chapel of Kensington Palace, Lady Davina's childhood home. Apart from the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the bride's siblings, no other members of the royal family were present at the wedding; only close friends and family were involved. The couple divorced in 2018. Lady Davina and her former husband have a daughter, Senna Kowhai, who was born on 22 June 2010 and a son, Tane Mahuta, who was born 25 May 2012. Her son was named after a giant kauri tree in New Zealand. Until 26 March 2015, Tane was ahead of Senna in the line of succession to the British throne, as common law sons had priority over daughters. When the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 took effect in all Commonwealth realms in 2015, Senna became the nearest relative of the reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, to be affected by the change in lawMales born after 28 October 2011 no longer precede their elder sisters in the line of succession., which advanced her proximity to the Crown by reversing her place in the order of succession with that of her younger brother. Senna and Tane became 28th and 29th in line (now 32nd and 33rd), respectively. Her children were the first members of the family to be affected by this change. Lady Davina does not carry out official functions but does attend family events including royal weddings. Lady Davina and Gary Lewis were invited to attend the Queen's reception for members of the New Zealand All Blacks at Buckingham Palace in 2005.

Its name is from the Greek meaning \\"shining robe\\" in reference to the male's plumage. Description Female in California, USA Male in flight showing white wing patches The phainopepla is a striking bird, long with a noticeable crest and a long tail; it is slender, and has an upright posture when it perches. Its bill is short and slender. The male is glossy black, and has a white wing patch that is visible when it flies; the female is plain gray and has a lighter gray wing patch. Both sexes have red eyes, but these are more noticeable in the female than the male. Range and habitat The phainopepla ranges as far north as central California with the San Joaquin Valley and southern Utah, and south to central Mexico, the interior Mexican Plateau region; the southern edge of the plateau, the transverse mountains is its non-breeding home. It is found in hot areas, including desert oases, and is readily seen in the deserts of Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California; also the Baja Peninsula, both Baja California-(north), and Baja California Sur where they are only breeding resident birds. Extreme individuals have travelled as far as Canada, with one bird in 2009 reaching as far north as Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Diet Their diet consists of berries, any small insects, fruits, vegetables. Phainopepla have a specialized mechanism in their gizzard that shucks berry skins off the fruit and packs the skins separately from the rest of the fruit into the intestines for more efficient digestion. So far this is the only known bird able to do this. They appear to relish the fruit of Phoradendron californicum, the desert mistletoe. Reproduction It nests in the spring. The eggs are gray or pink and speckled, and the incubation, done by both the male and female, takes fifteen days. The young will be reared by the parents for up to nineteen more days. Song Phainopeplas have been found to imitate the calls of twelve other species, such as the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus).

ASPM is located on chromosome 1, band q31 (1q31). The ASPM gene contains 28 exons and codes for a 3477 amino‐acid‐long protein. The ASPM protein is conserved across species including human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans. Defective forms of the ASPM gene are associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. \\"ASPM\\" is an acronym for \\"Abnormal Spindle- like, Microcephaly-associated\\", which reflects its being an ortholog to the Drosophila melanogaster \\"abnormal spindle\\" (asp) gene. The expressed protein product of the asp gene is essential for normal mitotic spindle function in embryonic neuroblasts and regulation of neurogenesis. A new allele of ASPM arose sometime in the past 14,000 years (mean estimate 5,800 years), during the Holocene, it seems to have swept through much of the European and Middle- Eastern population. Although the new allele is evidently beneficial, researchers do not know what it does.  Animal studies  The mouse gene, Aspm, is expressed in the primary sites of prenatal cerebral cortical neurogenesis. The difference between Aspm and ASPM is a single, large insertion coding for so-called IQ domains. Studies in mice also suggest a role of the expressed Aspm gene product in mitotic spindle regulation. The function is conserved, the C. elegans protein ASPM-1 was shown to be localized to spindle asters, where it regulates spindle organization and rotation by interacting with calmodulin, dynein and NuMA-related LIN-5. One mouse study looking at medulloblastoma growth in mice to study the Aspm gene, an ortholog to human ASPM, suggests that Aspm expression may drive postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis. This process occurs late in embryogenesis and immediately after birth over a time span of about 2 weeks in mice and 12 months in humans, and is regulated by the expression of the Shh gene. In proliferating cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs), Shh expression in mouse models showed four times the amount of Aspm expression than those deprived of Shh expression in- vivo. This induction of Aspm and up-regulation during cerebellar neurogenesis was also seen in real-time PCR, where its expression was relatively high at the peak of neurogenesis and much lower at the end of neurogenesis. Additionally, the study indicates that Aspm is necessary for cerebellar neurogenesis. In the presence of Aspm KO mutations and deletions, experimental mice models show decreased cerebellar volume under MRI, compared to the controls. In addition to mutated Aspm’s effects on neurogenesis, these mutations may also play a role in neural differentiation. When looking at adult brains in Aspm KO mice, there was a trend in overall size reduction, and variations in cortical thickness between mutant and wild type models. In the somatosensory cortex, KO mice had a significantly thicker layer I cortex, thinner layer VI cortex, and an overall decrease in cortical thickness in the cortical plate. Certain transcription factors expressions were also abnormal in the KO mice. For example, Tbr1 and Satb2 had an increased presence in the cortical sub-plate, the first of which is important for differentiation and neuronal migration, and the second of which is a regulator of transcription and chromosomal remodeling. While mouse studies have established the role of Aspm mutations in microcephaly, several have linked this mutation to other significant defects. One study showed nerve fiber impairments in which the shape and form of cortex and white matter tissue was altered. This was shown postnatally comparing KO mice and controls, where both cell number and cortical thickness was decreased in KO mice. Using a cell staining methodology for histological analysis, the study also showed shorter distances between adjacent neurons in KO mice, indicating abnormalities in cell alignment in the absence of normal Aspm. Another significant impact of mutated Aspm is seen in germline abnormalities within mouse models. Mutations in Aspm were shown to reduce fertility in both female and male mice, indicated by a decrease in the rate of pregnancy and consequently the number of offspring, as well as a decrease in female ovarian size, as well as male sperm count and testicular size. The focus on severe germline mutations (as opposed to only mild microcephaly) in these mouse models raises the question as to whether or not human ASPM selection may be more significantly linked to reproduction than brain size. In addition to mouse models, a study using ferrets reveals more about ASPM and its role in determining cortical size and thickness. The researchers from this study chose ferrets over mouse models due to incongruencies between Aspm effects in mice versus ASPM effects in humans - humans with microcephaly due to this gene mutation tend to have significantly reduced brain sizes (about 50% reduction), whereas the analogous mutation in mice only results in mild brain size reduction. Ferrets also show more similarities to humans in terms of brain structure; ferrets' brains have gyrification in high amounts similar to humans, different from the relatively smooth brains of mice. As a result, there is less cortical surface area in mice compared to that of ferrets and humans. In this 2018 study, researchers targeted Aspm exon 15, where a mutation in humans is linked to severe cases of microcephaly. With a loss of function in Aspm, ferrets with Aspm mutations saw a 40% decrease in overall brain size coupled with no reduction in body size, similar to the effects of loss of ASPM in humans. The study also looked at the neurodevelopmental pathways and mechanisms leading to neurogenesis in the KO ferrets compared to the WT controls, specifically studying three different neuron progenitor cell (NPC) types, all of which express the mitotic marker Ki-67 and undergo radial glial migration to the cortical plate. They found that outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) NPCs were largely displaced, especially frontally and dorsally which mirrors the effects seen in cortical volume reductions due to ASPM KO.  Human studies  Human primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a distinct subtype that is genetically inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. MCPH is characterized by a smaller cerebral cortex associated with mild to moderate mental retardation and no other neurological deficits. Additionally, MCPH is associated with the absence of environmental causes such as intrauterine infections, exposure to prenatal radiation or drugs, maternal phenylketonuria, and birth asphyxia. MCPH has an incidence rate of 1/30,000 to 1/250,000 in western populations. To date, mutations in six loci and four genes associated with microcephaly have been discovered in humans. ASPM, one of these genes, is found at the MCPH5 locus. The most common cause of MCPH in humans is homozygous genetic mutation of the ASPM gene, orthologous to the Drosophila abnormal spindle gene (asp). In humans, the ASPM gene may play a strong role in the growth of the cerebral cortex. A total of 22 mutations have been discovered in the ASPM gene in individuals from Pakistan, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Netherlands. A study completed in Karnataka, South India by Kumar et al. analyzed the genetics of MCPH due to mutations in the ASPM gene. The study included nine families with blood relatives across many familial generations. Kumar et al. performed High‐resolution G‐banding chromosome analysis and haplotype analysis of individuals and families of those affected by MCPH. Kumar et al. found that the South Indian families affected by mutations in the MCPH5 locus did not share a common disease haplotype; thus the authors proposed that different mutations in the ASPM gene are responsible for MCPH. A similar genetic study of MCPH in Pakistani families was done by Gul et al. in order to evaluate the relationship between ASPM gene mutations and microcephaly. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan, and involved extraction of DNA and PCR techniques in order to genetically map the ASPM gene. Genotyping using microsatellite regions in the gene revealed that MCPH5 locus mutations were the most common cause of MCPH. Genotyping further linked mutations in the MCPH2 locus, MCPH4 locus, and the MCPH6 locus to microcephaly. Sequence analysis of ASPM in humans revealed four novel mutations; these four types of mutations are an insertion of four nucleotides (9118insCATT), a nonsense mutation (L3080X), a deletion of seven nucleotides (1260delTCAAGTC), and a missense mutation (Q3180P). Gul et al. found that parents who were heterozygous carriers for ASPM had normal cerebral circumferences and normal intelligence levels. The scientists were unable to identify mutations at the MCPH5 locus in nine families who had members affected by MCPH. They concluded that the mutations could be located in the regulatory sequences of ASPM, or that a gene other than ASPM located in the same region could be mutated. The types of mutations causing MCPH in humans was expanded by a study done by Pichon et al. on an individual with primary microcephaly, as the study revealed a translocation breakpoint in the ASPM gene. Pichon et al. obtained BAC clones with BamHI digestion fragments of the \\"RP11-32D17\\" insert and used Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) in order to label the clones with fluorescein-12-dUTP. In order to precisely locate the translocation breakpoint, the BamHI digestion fragments of \\"RP11-32D17\\" were analyzed. The translocation breakpoint was located to be within intron 17 of the ASPM gene. The translocation resulted in a truncated ASPM protein, which is most likely a non-functioning protein also seen in truncating point mutations reported in MCPH patients.  Evolution  A new allele (version) of ASPM appeared sometime within the last 14,100 years, with a mean estimate of 5,800 years ago. The new allele has a frequency of about 50% in populations of the Middle East and Europe, it is less frequent in East Asia, and has low frequencies among Sub-Saharan African populations. It is also found with an unusually high percentage among the people of Papua New Guinea, with a 59.4% occurrence. The mean estimated age of the ASPM allele of 5,800 years ago, roughly correlates with the development of written language, spread of agriculture and development of cities.Per the 2006 Discovery Channel/Channel 4 documentary series What Makes Us Human? Currently, two alleles of this gene exist: the older (pre-5,800 years ago) and the newer (post-5,800 years ago). About 10% of humans have two copies of the new ASPM allele, while about 50% have two copies of the old allele. The other 40% of humans have one copy of each. Of those with an instance of the new allele, 50% of them are an identical copy. The allele affects genotype over a large (62 kbp) region, a so called selective sweep which signals a rapid spread of a mutation (such as the new ASPM) through the population; this indicates that the mutation is somehow advantageous to the individual. Testing the IQ of those with and without new ASPM allele has shown no difference in average IQ, providing no evidence to support the notion that the gene increases intelligence. However statistical analysis has shown that the older forms of the gene are found more heavily in populations that speak tonal languages like Chinese or many Sub-Saharan African languages. Other genes related to brain development appear to have come under selective pressure in different populations. The DAB1 gene, involved in organizing cell layers in the cerebral cortex, shows evidence of a selective sweep in the Chinese. The SV2B gene, which encodes a synaptic vesicle protein, likewise shows evidence of a selective sweep in African- Americans.

His most recent book,The Capitalism Papers argues against capitalism as a sustainable and viable system on which to base an economy. Biography Mander was born in the Bronx, New York City to Harry and Eva Mander, an immigrant Jewish couple who struggled to achieve success in America. In his Four Arguments he wrote: > My parents carried the immigrants' fears. Security was their primary value: > all else was secondary. Both of them had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe. > My father's career had followed the path familiar to so many New York > immigrants. Lower East Side. Scant schooling. Street hustling. Hard work at > anything to keep life together. Early marriage. Struggling out of poverty. > Curiously, success came to him during the Depression. He founded what later > became Harry Mander and Company, a small service business to the garment > industry, manufacturing pipings, waist bands, pocketing and collar canvas. > One of the reasons for my father's success during hard times was World War > II. He was beyond draft age and so was free to do a successful trade in > servicing the manufacture of military uniforms. After the war, the business > grew in new directions as the economy spurted forward into an era of rapid > growth. At an early age, Jerry Mander moved with his family from the Bronx to a semi- rural area of Yonkers, New York. He grew up there, and says: \\"I was a golf star throughout my youth and that was what I wanted to be, a professional golfer when I was very young.\\" Mander earned a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, then an M.S. in International Economics from Columbia University's Business School. After receiving his M.S., Mander worked in advertising for 15 years, including five as partner and president of Freeman, Mander & Gossage in San Francisco. Mander worked with the noted environmentalist, David Brower, managing the Sierra Club's advertising campaigns to prevent the construction of dams in the Grand Canyon, to establish Redwood National Park, and to stop the U.S. Supersonic Transport (SST) project. In 1971 he founded the first non-profit advertising agency in the United States, Public Interest Communications. Mander served as the executive director of the International Forum on Globalization, which he founded in 1994, until 2009 and continues on its staff as a Distinguished Fellow. He is also the program director for Megatechnology and Globalization at the Foundation for Deep Ecology. In 2007 Jerry Mander appeared in the full- length documentary film, What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire. In an interview with Nancho.net's W. David Kubiak, Mander describes how he got into advertising and how he turned it to the service of social causes: > Well, I wasn't a rebel when I got into advertising. I became a rebel through > advertising. It was by being in advertising and realizing what advertising > does in the system. I mean I can't explain why I, unlike other advertising > men, saw that as a big problem. But I became involved using those techniques > to help, you know, environmental groups and anti-war groups and civil rights > groups, using advertising as a technique to help them. Advertising and also > public relations work. So using that medium is what awoke me in many ways to > the power of the medium and the power to use it in the reverse, against the > system as well. Although the main problem is that those who are in power > have so much more power and more money than those who are trying to resist > it. And so we're always up against a heavy ratio, and the fact the opposite > side has more power than we do. In 1965, Mander married feminist author Anica Vesel Mander (b. 1934, d. 2002-06-19). They had two sons, Kai Maxim Mander and Yari David Mander. Although the Manders divorced in 1982, they remained close friends for the rest of Anica's life.

The aggregate demographic and geographic data for the hamlet is also included in the data for the Town of Huntington. The population was 18,406 at the 2010 census. The central business district, called Huntington Village locally, is old and well developed, but it is not incorporated and does not have a village form of government. The hamlet of Huntington is located 37 miles (59 km) northeast of Midtown Manhattan. Geography Huntington is located at (40.877798, -73.413687). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.7 square miles (19.9 km), of which, 7.5 square miles (19.5 km) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.4 km) of it (1.82%) is water. Demographics At the 2000 census there were 18,403 people, 7,052 households, and 4,992 families in the CDP. The population density was 2,442.5 per square mile (943.6/km).

He was the first Anglican in a position of authority to seriously challenge the Church's position on slavery. Early life Porteus was born in York on 8 May 1731, the youngest of the 19 children of Sarah Jennings and Robert Porteus (d. 1758/9), a planter. Although the family was of Scottish ancestry, his parents were Virginian planters who had returned to England in 1720 as a result of the economic difficulties in the province and for the sake of his father's health. Educated at York and at Ripon Grammar School, he was a classics scholar at Christ's College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow in 1752. In 1759 he won the Seatonian Prize for his poem Death: A Poetical Essay, a work for which he is still remembered. He was ordained as a priest in 1757, and in 1762 was appointed as domestic chaplain to Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, acting as his personal assistant at Lambeth Palace for six years. It was during these years that it is thought he became more aware of the conditions of the enslaved Africans in the American colonies and the British West Indies. He corresponded with clergy and missionaries, receiving reports on the appalling conditions facing the slaves from Revd James Ramsay in the West Indies and from Granville Sharp, the English lawyer who had supported the cases of freed slaves in England. In 1769 Beilby Porteus was appointed as chaplain to King George III. He is listed as one of the lenten preachers at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall in 1771, 1773 and 1774. He was also Rector of Lambeth (a living shared between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Crown) from 1767–77, and later Master of St Cross, Winchester (1776–77). He was concerned about trends within the Church of England towards what he regarded as the watering-down of the truth of Scripture and stood for doctrinal purity and opposed the anti-subscription movement, composed of theologians and scholars who, as he saw it, would have watered down cardinal Christian doctrines and beliefs and were also in favour of allowing clergy the option of subscribing to the Thirty-Nine Articles. At the same time he was prepared to suggest a compromise of a revision to some of the Articles. Always a Church of England man, he was, however, happy to work with Methodists and dissenters and recognised their major contributions in evangelism and education. He was married to Margaret Hodgson.[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40272236/margaret-porteus Findagrave.com Bishop of Chester In 1776, Porteus was nominated as Bishop of Chester, taking up the appointment in 1777. He lost no time in getting to grips with the problems of a diocese which had a vastly growing population within the many new centres of the Industrial Revolution, most of which were in the north-west of England, but where there were the fewest parishes. The appalling poverty and deprivation amongst the immigrant workers in new manufacturing industries represented a huge challenge to the church, resulting in vast pressure upon the parish resources. He continued to take a deep interest in the plight of West Indian slaves, preaching and campaigning actively against the slave trade and taking part in many debates in the House of Lords, becoming known as a noted abolitionist. He took a particular interest in the affairs of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, especially regarding the Church of England's role in the administration of the Codrington Plantations in Barbados, where around 300 slaves were owned by the Society. Renowned as a scholar and a popular preacher, it was in 1783 that the young bishop was to first come to national attention by preaching his most famous and influential sermon. Anniversary sermon Porteus used the opportunity afforded by the invitation to preach the 1783 Anniversary Sermon of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to criticise the Church of England's role in ignoring the plight of the 350 slaves on its Codrington Plantations in Barbados and to recommend means by which the lot of slaves there could be improved. It was an impassioned and well-reasoned plea for The Civilisation, Improvement and Conversion of the Negroe Slaves in the British West-India Islands Recommended and was preached at the church of St Mary-le-Bow before forty members of the society, including eleven bishops of the Church of England. When this largely fell upon deaf ears, Porteus next began work on his Plan for the Effectual Conversion of the Slaves of the Codrington Estate, which he presented to the SPG committee in 1784 and, when it was turned down, again in 1789. His dismay at the rejection of his plan by the other bishops is palpable. His diary entry for the day reveals his moral outrage at the decision and at what he saw as the apparent complacency of the bishops and the committee of the society at its responsibility for the welfare of its own slaves. These were the first challenges to the establishment in an eventual 26-year campaign to eradicate slavery in the British West Indian colonies. Porteus made a huge contribution and eventually turned to other means of achieving his aims, including writing, encouraging political initiatives, and supporting the sending of mission workers to Barbados and Jamaica. Deeply concerned about the lot of the slaves as a result of the reports he received, Porteus became a committed and passionate abolitionist, the most senior cleric of his day to take an active part in the campaign against slavery. He became involved with the group of abolitionists at Teston in Kent, led by Sir Charles Middleton, and soon became acquainted with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Henry Thornton, Zachary Macaulay and other committed activists. Many of this group were members of the so-called Clapham Sect of evangelical social reformers and Porteus willingly lent his support to them and their campaigns. As Wilberforce's bill for the abolition of the slave trade was brought before the British parliament time and time again over 18 years from 1789, Porteus campaigned vigorously and energetically supported the campaign from within the Church of England and the bench of bishops in the House of Lords. Bishop of London In 1787, Porteus was translated to the bishopric of London on the advice of Prime Minister William Pitt, a position he held until his death in 1809. As is customary, he was also appointed to the Privy Council, and Dean of the Chapel Royal. In 1788, he supported Sir William Dolben’s Slave Trade Bill from the bench of bishops, and over the next quarter century he became the leading advocate within the Church of England for the abolition of slavery, lending support to such men as Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, Henry Thornton and Zachary Macaulay to secure the eventual passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807. In view of his passionate involvement in the anti-slavery movement and his friendship with other leading abolitionists, it was especially appropriate that, as Bishop of London, he should now find himself with official responsibility for the spiritual welfare of the British colonies overseas. He was responsible for missions to the West Indies, as well as to India, and towards the end of his life personally funded the sending of scriptures in the language of many peoples as far apart as Greenland and India. A man of strong moral principle, Porteus was also passionately concerned about what he saw as the moral decay in the nation during the 18th century, and campaigned against trends which he saw as contributory factors, such as pleasure gardens, theatres and the non- observance of the Lord's Day. He enlisted the support of his friend Hannah More, former dramatist and bluestocking, to write tracts against the wickedness of the immorality and licentious behaviour which were common at these events. He vigorously opposed the spread of the principles of the French Revolution as well as what he regarded as the ungodly and dangerous doctrines of Thomas Paine’s The Age of Reason. In 1793, at Porteus' suggestion, Hannah More published Village Politics, a short pamphlet designed to counter the arguments of Paine, the first in a whole series of popular tracts designed to oppose what they saw as the prevailing immorality of the day. Other reforms Memorial plaque, All Saints Church, Fulham, London During much of the following 20 years – a time of national and international political upheaval, Porteus was in a position to influence opinion in the influential circles of the Court, the government, the City of London and the highest echelons of Georgian society. Porteus did this, partly by encouraging debate on subjects as diverse as the slave trade, Catholic emancipation, the pay and conditions of low-paid clergy, the perceived excesses of entertainment taking place on Sundays—and by becoming a vocal supporter of William Wilberforce, Hannah More and the Clapham Sect of evangelical social reformers. He was also appointed as one of the members of the Board for Encouragement of Agriculture and internal Improvement in 1793. He was active in the establishment of Sunday Schools in every parish, an early patron of the Church Missionary Society and one of the founder members of the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he became vice-president. He was a well-known and passionate advocate of personal Bible-reading and even gave his name to a system of daily devotions using the Porteusian Bible, published after his death, highlighting the most important and useful passages; and was responsible for the new innovation of the use of tracts by church organisations. Always a Church of England man, Porteus was, however, happy to work with Methodists and dissenters and recognised their major contributions in evangelism and education. In 1788, George III had again lapsed into one of his periods of mental derangement (now diagnosed as Porphyria), to national concern. The following year, a Service of Thanksgiving for his recovery was held in St Paul's Cathedral, at which Porteus himself preached. The war against Napoleon began in 1794 and was to drag on for another 20 years. Porteus' tenure as Bishop of London saw not only services of thanksgiving for British victories at the Battles of Cape St. Vincent, the Nile and Copenhagen, but the great national outpouring of sorrow at the death of Nelson in 1805, and his state funeral service in St Paul's Cathedral in 1806. As Bishop of London, Porteus may have officiated at some of these services, although it is unlikely that he did so at Nelson's funeral, because of the Admiral's reputation as an adulterer. After a gradual decline in his health over the previous three years, Bishop Porteus died at Fulham Palace in 1809 and, according to his wishes, was buried at St Mary's church, Sundridge in Kent – a stone's throw from his country retreat in the village – a place to which he had loved to retire every autumn. Legacy Rembrandt Peale, The Court of Death was based on the poem, Death: A Poetical Essay by Beilby Porteus. The figures in the monumental painting were life-size. Death is surrounded by personifications including Despair, Fever, Consumption, Hypochondria, Apoplexy, Gout, Dropsy, Suicide, Delirium Tremens, Intemperance, Remorse, Pleasure, Pestilence, Famine, War, and Conflagration. To the right, a warrior, an orphaned infant, and a widow show some of the people afflicted. In the foreground, Old Age is supported by Faith. Beilby Porteus was one of the most significant, albeit under-rated church figures of the 18th century. His sermons continued to be read by many, and his legacy as a foremost abolitionist was such that his name was almost as well known in the early 19th century as those of Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson – but a 100 years later he had become one of the 'forgotten abolitionists', and today his role has largely been ignored and his name has been consigned to the footnotes of history. His primary claim to fame in the 21st century is for his poem on Death and, possibly unfairly, as the supposed prototype for the pompous Mr Collins in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. But it is ironic that Porteus' most lasting contribution was one for which he is little-known, the Sunday Observance Act of 1781 (a response to what he saw as the moral decay of England), which legislated the ways in which the public were allowed to spend their recreation time at weekends for the following 200 years, until the passage of the Sunday Trading Act of 1994. His legacy lives on, though, in the fact that the campaign which he helped to set in motion eventually led to the transformation of the Church of England into an international movement with mission and social justice at its heart, appointing African, Indian and Afro- Caribbean bishops and archbishops and others from many diverse ethnic groups as its leaders.

There are 41 members of the ECB: * The Chairs of the 18 First-Class Counties * The Chairs of the 21 County Boards in National Counties (formerly the Minor Counties) * The Chair of MCC * The Chair of the National Counties Cricket Association One of the main responsibilities of the ECB is the preparation and development of the teams that represent England at the highest level in Test and ODI play. The National Selector, head coach and other coaches are ECB employees. The ECB also employs the English Test match captain and other centrally contracted players, as well as being responsible for the National Cricket Performance Centre, currently based at Loughborough University in Leicestershire. The long-term strategy to deliver world championships in the men's and women's games had a successful conclusion in the summer of 2019. England won the ICC Cricket World Cup for the first time, emulating the feat of their female counterparts, who had become world champions for the fourth time in 2017. The ECB is responsible for the financial direction and commercial exploitation of England cricket. It raises revenue from the proceeds of sales for tickets at One Day International and Test matches in England and Wales. The ECB is also responsible for the generation of income from the sale of sponsorship and broadcasting rights, primarily in relation to the English team. Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the UK. More than 1.1 million adults attend cricket matches each year, while 2.5 million people play the game at all levels in England and Wales. Almost 10 million people – about 20% of the adult population – follow the sport. Since 2009, 4 million schoolchildren have been introduced to cricket by the Chance To Shine programme. In 2017 the ECB signed a new media rights deal valued at £1.1billion to cover the five years between 2020 and 2024. This deal will be used to fund a broad range of initiatives across the sport at all levels, including a guaranteed and unprecedented £475million to fund the county network – First-Class Counties, National Counties and County Boards. While the ECB administers all aspects of English cricket, the laws of the game remain in the control of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). In April 2017 the Articles of Association were changed to allow a new T20 competition to be run from 2020, comprising 8 teams, it will be run during school summer holidays. The T20 event has become The Hundred. In May 2018 ECB launched an action plan for engaging South Asian audiences in England and Wales.https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/683457 In January 2019 ECB launched its Inspiring Generations strategy for cricket across 2020–2024.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/14/ecb-plans-cricket-tom- harrison. The strategy aims to Inspire a generation to say Cricket is a game for me.https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/1365931: Alongside its five-year plan, in October 2019 ECB launched plans to transform women's and girls' cricket.https://www.ecb.co.uk/about-us/media-room#/pressreleases/ecb-launches- new-plan-to-transform-womens-and-girls-cricket-2928835 The ECB also leads the sport's efforts with regard to the integrity of cricket, including anti-doping and anti-corruption initiatives, and safeguarding of all who play and administer the game. In the 2017-2018 financial year, the ECB's turnover was £125.5 million.  National teams  Men's Test team: England played in the first Test match, against Australia in 1877, and has been one of the world's leading exponents of the five-day form of cricket ever since. England has been a full member of the International Cricket Council since 1909. The team's captain, as of July 2020, was Joe Root Men's one-day team: England featured in the first One-Day International, against Australia in 1971. England won the men's Cricket World Cup for the first time in a thrilling final against New Zealand at Lord's in July 2019. England's only previous limited-overs global title came in the T20 World Cup in 2010. As of July 2020, the team's captain was Eoin Morgan. Women's team: England featured in the first Women's Test series, against Australia in 1934–35, where they won 2-0 despite the enduring rancour from the Bodyline series of two winters before. They have won the World Cup four times, most recently in 2017. The team is captained, as of July 2020, by Heather Knight. Disability teams: The ECB is committed to facilitating access to the sport for people with disabilities. It aims to have 300 clubs offering disabled provision by 2024. The four teams administered by the ECB are Physical Disability, Learning Disability, Visually Impaired and Deaf.  County Cricket  First-Class Counties: There are 18 First-Class Counties, 17 in England and one, Glamorgan, in Wales. County cricket developed in the 1740s and the first County Championship was played in 1890. From 2020 onwards there are 10 teams in Division One and eight in Division Two. The ECB plays a part in the administration of a county through the County Partnership Agreement, a structure set up in late 2019 designed to improve two-way communication between the ECB and the counties and to ensure the successful implementation of the inspiring Generations strategy between 2020 and 2024. National Counties: Formerly known as the Minor Counties, these are the 21 areas where cricket is played on a county-wide basis but without first-class status. The Minor Counties Championship was first staged in 1895. From 2020 onwards, the counties’ Western and Eastern divisions are split into two five- team groups between which sides are relegated and promoted. Each county also has a County Partnership Agreement with the ECB. County Boards: Recreational cricket at all levels in each county is administered by a county board. There are more than 6,500 recreational cricket clubs and 40 county boards in total, including boards for Wales and the Isle of Wight. Each board has a County Partnership Agreement with the ECB. The intention is for the whole of cricket to think collectively about how to work together for the present and future stability and growth of the game. The ECB also works at grassroots level with organisations such as Chance To Shine that are dedicated to encouraging talented and enthusiastic youngsters to play as much cricket as possible and maximise their potential. Cricket in Wales: Historically, there have been claims that Wales should break away from the ECB and have its own international team, like Ireland and Scotland. However, Cricket Wales and Glamorgan have consistently supported the ECB and the concept that Welsh players of international standard will continue to represent England. Domestic competitions: First-class counties compete in the following: * Specsavers County Championship * The Royal London Cup * The Vitality Blast T20  The County Boards  Subject to certain exceptions, each historic county in England has either an ECB County Cricket Club or Cricket Board as below. The first-class counties are represented directly at the ECB, whereas the minor counties retain a Cricket Board. * Bedfordshire Cricket Board * Berkshire Cricket Board * Buckinghamshire Cricket Board * Cambridgeshire Cricket Board * Cheshire Cricket Board * Cornwall Cricket Board * Cumbria Cricket Board * Derbyshire County Cricket Club * Devon Cricket Board * Dorset Cricket Board * Durham County Cricket Club * Essex County Cricket Club * Glamorgan County Cricket Club * Gloucestershire County Cricket Club * Hampshire County Cricket Club * Herefordshire Cricket Board * Hertfordshire Cricket Board * Huntingdonshire Cricket Board * Isle of Wight Cricket Board * Kent County Cricket Club * Lancashire County Cricket Club * Leicestershire County Cricket Club * Lincolnshire Cricket Board * Middlesex County Cricket Club * Norfolk Cricket Board * Northamptonshire County Cricket Club * Northumberland Cricket Board * Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club * Oxfordshire Cricket Board * Shropshire Cricket Board * Somerset County Cricket Club * Staffordshire Cricket Board * Suffolk Cricket Board * Surrey County Cricket Club * Sussex County Cricket Club * Cricket Wales * Warwickshire County Cricket Club * Wiltshire Cricket Board * Worcestershire County Cricket Club * Yorkshire County Cricket Club Rutland shares a board with neighbouring Leicestershire, an echo of the 18th century Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket Club. Hampshire as such has two boards given that the Isle of Wight has its own. Westmorland and Cumberland are replaced by Cumbria, a ceremonial county created in 1974. An additional board exists for the whole country of Wales and is incorporated within the ECB. Most counties have clubs which are members of either the County Championship or the Minor Counties Cricket Championship. Rutland and the Isle of Wight do not have county clubs and are wholly integrated for that purpose with Leicestershire and Hampshire respectively. Huntingdonshire County Cricket Club has a chequered history and now plays informal matches only. Cumberland and Westmorland originally shared Cumberland County Cricket Club as a joint county club. It is now representative of Cumbria as a whole and plays matches in both of the two traditional counties; there has never been a club called Westmorland.ECB County Cricket Boards, List ofCricket Wales  Status of Wales  Historically, the England team represented the whole of Great Britain in international cricket, with Scottish or Welsh national teams playing sporadically and players from both countries occasionally representing England. Following Ireland's membership in 1993, Scotland became an independent member of the ICC the next year. With Welsh players pursuing international careers exclusively with an England team, there have been a number of calls for Wales to become an independent member of the ICC, or for the ECB to provide more fixtures for a Welsh national team. However, both Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have continually supported the ECB, with Glamorgan arguing for the financial benefits of the Welsh county within the English structure, and Cricket Wales stating they are \\"committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB\\" The absence of a Welsh cricket team has seen a number of debates within the Welsh Assembly. In 2013 a debate saw both Conservative and Labour members lend their support to the establishment of an independent Welsh team. In 2015, a report produced by the Welsh National Assembly's petitions committee, reflected the passionate debate around the issue. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru’s spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the ECB. Jenkins noted that Ireland (with a population of 6.4 million) was an ICC member with 6,000 club players whereas Wales (with 3.2 million) had 7,500. Jenkins said: \\"Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is ‘an emotive subject’, of course having a national team is emotive, you only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.\\" In 2017, the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones called for the reintroduction of the Welsh one day team stating: \\"[It] is odd that we see Ireland and Scotland playing in international tournaments and not Wales.\\" In 2019, Plaid Cymru member Jonathan Edwards called for Wales to separate from the England and Wales Cricket Board by 2020 and to establish itself as an independent national team, Mr. Edwards said; “We have a Welsh rugby team, football team, basketball team, even a national lacrosse team. In cricket, however, we are still incorporated into England. That surely can’t be right.”https://www.partyof.wales/plaid_cymru_calls_for_welsh_national_cricket_team_by_2020  Inspiring Generations  In 2019 the ECB launched a game-wide strategy to grow interest in, and engagement with, cricket over the five years between 2020 and 2024. Its vision is that by the latter date a new generation of fans will have been inspired to say: “Cricket is a game for me.” Inspiring Generations has been made possible by the signing of a media rights deal worth about £1.1billion, the vast majority of which will be paid by Sky television. As a result, the ECB has identified 26 activities that will made up the overarching Inspiring Generations strategy. The key focus is on six areas, in which the ECB has pledged to: * Grow and nurture cricket's core, the county network * Inspire through the exploits of elite teams * Make cricket accessible to as many people as possible * Engage children and young people * Transform women's and girls’ cricket * Support its communities  Women’s and Girls’ Strategy  One of the most important elements of the Inspiring Generations strategy is the delivery of a plan to make cricket a truly gender- balanced sport and to build on the significant progress in the women's game in the first two decades of the 21st century. The ECB has promised by 2021 to invest £20million specifically into the transformation of women's and girls’ cricket. This process is built around the following five targets: * Participation – bringing girls’ cricket to more schools and clubs * Pathway – raising standards in local girls’ cricket * Performance – unveiling a new regional elite domestic structure for the women's game * Profile – promoting awareness of elite female players * People – increasing the number of women in the cricket workforce and leadership roles More than 850 clubs now offer women's and girls’ cricket, a total that was fewer than 100 in 2009.  The Hundred  2020 sees the launch of a new competition by the ECB which the board says is designed to appeal to families and younger cricket fans. The Hundred, as its name suggests, is only 100 balls per side. The new competition is designed to be fast moving and is aimed at a young, digitally-savvy, urban audience who want a game that is simple to understand, packed with action and completed in less than three hours. Eight new teams have been created by the ECB and based in cities across England and Wales. New branding and identities will see players who are familiar to existing cricket fans playing for sides who no longer bear the names of traditional counties. The team names are: * Birmingham Phoenix * London Spirit * Manchester Originals * Northern Superchargers * Oval Invincibles * Southern Brave * Trent Rockets * Welsh Fire The best players in England, and many of the biggest stars in the world, have signed up for The Hundred. Men's and women's teams will represent each of the new outfits – it is claimed that it is unprecedented to run a national competition in a major sport in which the men's and women's teams are so closely aligned. The men's squads were finalised in October 2019 at an NFL- style draft, the first time such a system had been applied to a major UK competition. The competition also sees the return after 15 years of live cricket to free-to-air television. The BBC will be screening at least ten matches live from the men's competition, including the final. Some traditional supporters of cricket have questioned the ECB's motivation for launching a new format of the sport, but the ECB's response is that The Hundred will attract a new audience who will, in turn, become fans of more established forms of the sport. The launch of The Hundred competition has officially been delayed by one year, to 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The South Asian Action Plan  In 2018, the ECB launched an initiative designed to increase engagement in cricket in England and Wales among people who trace their ancestry to nations in south Asia – such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka – where cricket has historically been hugely popular. The decision was taken to engage with this community in particular because more than 30% of active cricketers in England and Wales at the time identified as being of South Asian extraction. The SAAP was driven by research and community-led in an attempt to break down barriers to playing and watching cricket. The 11 principal action points included installing non-traditional playing facilities in urban areas and delivering cricket at schools with a higher than national average representation of BAME pupils. One significant early success was the opening in 2019 of the Leyton Cricket Hub in east London, the first urban cricket centre of its kind in the country. The SAAP also led to the installation of 110 non-turf pitches in urban areas and the recruitment of 600 female volunteers to boost the initiative.  All Stars Cricket  All Stars Cricket is the ECB's entry-level participation programme for boys and girls aged between five and eight. It consists of eight one-hour sessions over eight weeks and the emphasis is on fun and activity. The programme is designed for all children who are new cricket and focuses on the sport's specific skills as well as activity and teamwork in general. In 2019, more than 67,000 children took part in sessions at more than 2,200 clubs.

Background Born in Daegu, he was the son of the provincial governor. He was a newspaper delivery boy when he was a youngster, helping a family that depended almost solely on him during a brief period. He graduated from the prestigious Kyunggi High School, then finished with an Economics Degree at Yonsei University in Seoul. His father was the teacher or mentor of future President, Park Chung Hee, who in turn supported Kim to a great degree both financially and business-wise. Daewoo After graduating from Yonsei, he entered into a small trading corporation, later specialising in textiles and clothing. He broke off and created Daewoo Industries with five other associates. Using his connections in the alumni of the Yonsei and with political backing, he managed to do well, and consecutively bought many different companies. Daewoo Group was originally built on companies that were bought, often distressed companies. Kim was successful in transforming near- bankrupt companies into successful enterprises. By the 1990s, with a history of some 30 years, Daewoo Group was listed as second in asserts and third in revenues in Korea. This rapid growth was remarkable in comparison to how the other two of the Big 3 Korean companies, (Hyundai, LG, Samsung), made their mark. However, due to its rather hollow financial structure, even though it had the most overseas branch offices, when the Asian Financial Crisis hit in 1997, the unstable Daewoo Group plummeted. It had to sell off nearly 50 division corporations, only focusing on the major companies. Kim was on the list of Interpol when he was in exile, partly because of how he left Daewoo with the insurmountable debt, to his employees. He was arrested soon after he returned to South Korea on June 14, 2005, and apologized \\"for hurting the nation\\" and accepted full responsibility for the collapse of the group, adding that he was \\"ready to accept whatever the authorities have in store for him,\\" according to the Chosun Ilbo. Criminal charges In May 2006 he was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement and accounting fraud. 21 trillion won ($22bn) of his fortune was seized and he was fined an additional 10m won. Citing health concerns, his sentence was reduced to 8 and 1/2 years; then on 30 December 2007, he was granted amnesty by President Roh Moo-hyun. South Korean presidents traditionally hand out pardons for the new year.

Typically, a water cannon can deliver a large volume of water, often over dozens of meters. They are used in firefighting, large vehicle washing, riot control, and mining. Most water cannons fall under the category of a fire monitor. Firefighting Water cannons were first devised for use on fireboats. Extinguishing fires on boats and buildings near the water was much more difficult and dangerous before fireboats were invented. The first fireboat deployed in Los Angeles was commissioned on 1 August 1919. The first fireboat in New York City was Marine 1, deployed 1 February 1891. There may have been other fireboats elsewhere even earlier. Fire trucks deliver water with much the same force and volume as water cannons, and have even been used in riot control situations, but are rarely referred to as water cannons outside this context. Riot control First German Police water cannon The first truck-mounted water cannon was used for riot control in Germany in the beginning of the 1930s. The most modern versions do not expose the operator to the riot, and are controlled remotely from within the vehicle by a joystick. The German-built WaWe 10.000 can carry of water, which can deploy water in all directions via three cannons, all of which are remotely controlled from inside the vehicle by a joystick. The vehicle has two forward cannons with a delivery rate of , and one rear cannon with a delivery rate of Water cannons designed for riot control are still made in the United States and the United Kingdom, but most products are exported, particularly to Africa and parts of Asia such as Indonesia. Safety Use of water cannon in riot control contexts can lead to injury or death, with fatalities recorded in Indonesia (in 1996, when the cannon's payload contained ammonia), Zimbabwe (in 2007, when the use of cannons on a peaceful crowd caused panic), Turkey (in 2013, when the payload was laced with \\"liquid teargas\\"), Ukraine (in 2014, with the death of activist and businessman Bogdan Kalynyak, reportedly catching pneumonia after being sprayed by a water cannon in freezing temperatures) and South Korea (in 2016, when a 68 year old farmer died after injuries sustained by a water cannon the previous year). Water cannons in use during the 1960s, which were generally adapted fire trucks, would knock protesters down and on occasion, tear their clothes. On 30 September 2010, during a protest demonstration against the Stuttgart 21 project in Germany, a demonstrator was hit in the face by a water cannon. Dietrich Wagner, a retired engineer, suffered damage to his eyelids and retinas\\"Injured Stuttgart 21 protestor could stay blind.\\" The Local. 6 October 2010. Retrieved on 22 March 2014., resulting in near-complete loss of his eyesight. Graphic imagery was recorded of the event, sparking a national debate about police brutality and proportionality in the use of state force. According to a report issued in the United Kingdom, using plastic bullets instead of water cannons was justified because the latter \\"are inflexible and indiscriminate\\", although several people had previously been killed or seriously injured by plastic bullets. Media effect The presence of the media at riots has had a significant impact on water cannon use. There is much pressure on police departments to avoid bad publicity, and water cannons often play badly in the press. It is considered that this is a likely reason that they are not used more often in certain countries. Confrontations that took place in the era of the American Civil Rights Movement, where water cannons were used by authorities to disperse crowds of protesting African Americans, has led to the demise of water cannons in the United States. Alternative payload=Dye In 1997, pink dye was reportedly added to the water used by South Korean and Indonesian police to disperse a riot.Indonesia and East Timor: Arms and security transfers undermine human rights. 3 June 1997. Amnesty International The implication is that they might use this mark to make it easier to arrest rioters later. The United Kingdom, which had sold the water cannon to Indonesia, condemned this practice (although the Royal Ulster Constabulary had used a water cannon with purple dye during The Troubles in Northern Ireland) but later approved the sale of further water cannons to them. Most modern water cannons are also capable of adding tear gas to the stream. Electrified water cannon In 2004, Jaycor Tactical Systems was experimenting with additives (salt and additives to reduce the breakup of the stream into droplets) that would allow electricity to be conducted through water. They have demonstrated delivery from a distance of up to twenty feet (6 m), but have not yet tested the device on people. Although referred to as an electrified water cannon, this experiment involved a water jet much less powerful than a water cannon. Other types Water cannon differ from other similar devices in the volume of water delivered in a given time, the nozzle speed, the pressure that it is delivered at, and to a lesser extent the total volume that can be delivered. They are also generally portable. The method of employment is also important in labeling a device a water cannon. Nevertheless, the distinction between a water cannon and other similar devices is fuzzy. For example:- *Pressure washers generally produce an extremely high pressure stream where the power of the stream drops off significantly over a very short distance. *Water pistols and other toys deliver much lower volumes of water at a much lower pressure. *Ultra high pressure water jet cutters are used to cut a wide variety of materials including granite, concrete (see hydrodemolition), ceramics, fabric and even Kevlar. One such cutter delivers through a nozzle 0.003 inch (76 micrometres) in diameter at 1 kilometre per second. This can cut a person in half at close range. There are reports of accidental deaths involving the industrial use of high-pressure water. Usage Water cannon are still in use on a large scale in Chile, Belgium, the Netherlands and other parts of the world. Australia The State of New South Wales in Australia purchased a water cannon in 2007, with a view to using it during an APEC meeting in Sydney that year.http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0020/4196/bp3_16police_n.rtf It was not used. It was the first purchase of a water cannon in Australia. Germany WaWe 10.000 of Hamburg Riot Police The annual riots on 1 May in Berlin, the Schanzenfest fair in Hamburg, which regularly ends in riots, or other demonstrations, are usually accompanied by water cannon, which support riot police. German communities use their water cannon in hot summers to water public parks. The most commonly used water cannon in Germany, which has more than 60 water cannons in total, is the Wasserwerfer 9000. Hong Kong Specialised crowd management vehicle, the water cannon of Hong Kong Police Force was shooting with blue-dyed water during Hong Kong protests. Three truck-mounted water cannon, officially known as 'Specialised Crowd Management Vehicles', were purchased by Hong Kong Police in mid-2018, for HK$27 million - a sum that was criticised as excessive for the goods. The vehicles were frequently used by police on participants and bystanders during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Blue dye was often added to the water to allow police to identify protesters. Pepper spray solution was also an ingredient.LCQ9: Specialised crowd management vehicles, Legislative Council question by Claudia Mo, June 13, 2018 On 20 October 2019, police used a water cannon to target and shoot a small group of pedestrians standing outside Kowloon Mosque, in Tsim Sha Tsui, using blue-dyed water mixed with a pepper solution. A large number of Hong Kong residents spontaneously went to the scene to clean up, with the whole incident serendipitously resulting in an increased sense of inclusiveness among mainstream society toward Hong Kong's Muslim and other minorities.Police say water cannon vehicle deployed to protect mosque, EJ Insight, October 22, 2019Amid protests for democracy, Hong Kong’s ethnic minorities strive to be heard, SCMP by Raquel Carvalho, 26 Oct, 2019  Thailand  During the 2020 Thai protests, on 16 October 2020, the police used water cannon with chemical-laced water to disperse a peaceful rally in Bangkok. Turkey The Turkish police water cannon TOMA has been used against protestors many times, including the 2013 protests in Turkey, and are often present at protests of all sizes. United Kingdom Until 2014, although manufactured there, there were only six water cannons in the United Kingdom, all held by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Water cannon use outside Northern Ireland is not approved, and would require the statutory authorisation of Parliament in England, or of the devolved assemblies in Wales and the parliament of Scotland. In June 2014, London's Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Stephen Greenhalgh authorised the Metropolitan Police to buy three second-hand water cannons from the German Federal Police. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the purchase had been authorised before Parliamentary approval, as the three cannons cost £218,000 to purchase and would require a further £125,000 of work before being deemed suitable for service, as opposed to £870,000 for a single new machine. But after a study of their safety and effectiveness, Home Secretary Theresa May said in Parliament in July 2015 that she had decided not to license them for use. They were sold in November 2018 with the intention that they were to be broken up for spare parts. United States Truck-based water cannon, and fire hoses used as improvised water cannons, were used widely in the United States during the 1960s for both riot control and suppressing peaceful civil rights marches, including the infamous use ordered by Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963.1963: The Defining Year of the Civil Rights Movement [https://www.nps.gov/bicr/learn/proclamation.htm \\"Presidential Proclamation Establishment of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument By The President Of The United States Of America\\"] The newsreel footage of police turning water cannons and police dogs on civilians—both student protesters and bystanders alike, including children as young as six—widely viewed as shocking and inappropriate and helped turn public sympathies towards civil rights.

Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 549. He was the author of Commentaries on American Law. Life and career Kent was the son of Moss Kent, a lawyer from Dutchess County, New York and the first Surrogate of Rensselaer County, New York. Court History He graduated from Yale College in 1781, having helped establish the Phi Beta Kappa Society there in 1780, and began to practice law at Poughkeepsie, New York in 1785 as an attorney, and in 1787 at the bar. In 1791 and 1792-93 Kent was a member from Dutchess County of the New York State Assembly. In 1793, he removed to New York City, where he was appointed a master in chancery for the city. Kent was the first professor of law in Columbia College in 1793-98 and again served in the Assembly in 1796-97. In 1797, he was appointed Recorder of New York City and in 1798, a justice of the New York Supreme Court, in 1804 Chief Justice, and in 1814 Chancellor of New York. Kent was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1821 he was a member of the New York State Constitutional Convention where he unsuccessfully opposed the raising of the property qualification for African American voters. Two years later, Chancellor Kent reached the constitutional age limit and retired from his office, but was re-elected to his former chair. He lived in retirement in Summit, New Jersey between 1837 and 1847 in a simple four-roomed cottage (the original cottage today has been incorporated into a large mansion at 50 Kent Place Boulevard in Summit NJ) which he referred to as 'my Summit Lodge', a name that has been offered as the derivation for the city's name.Cheslow, Jerry. \\"A Transit Hub With a Thriving Downtown\\", The New York Times, July 13, 1997.

Chancery, or equity law, had been very unpopular during the colonial period, and had received little development, and no decisions had been published. His judgments of this class cover a wide range of topics, and are so thoroughly considered and developed as unquestionably to form the basis of American equity jurisprudence. Family Daniel Huntington Kent married Elizabeth Bailey, and they had four children: Elizabeth (died in infancy), Elizabeth, Mary, and William Kent (1802–1861) who was a circuit judge and ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Washington Hunt in 1852.

This common waterbird is found in northern Australia and southern New Guinea. As the species is prone to wandering, especially when not breeding, it is sometimes recorded outside its core range. The species was once also widespread in southern Australia, but disappeared from there largely due to the drainage of the wetlands where the birds once bred. Due to their importance to the local aboriginals as a seasonal food source,Whitehead, P. J., M. Storrs, M. McKaige, R. Kennett, and M. Douglas. 2000. Wise use of wetlands in northern Australia: indigenous use. Centre for Tropical Wetlands Management and Centre for Indigenous Natural and Cultural Resource Management. Northern Territory University, Darwin. as subjects of recreational hunting, and as a tourist attraction, their expansive and stable presence in northern Australia has been \\"ensured protective management\\". Description Magpie geese are unmistakable birds with their black and white plumage and yellowish legs. The feet are only partially webbed, and the magpie goose feeds on vegetable matter in the water, as well as on land. Males are larger than females. Unlike true geese, their moult is gradual, so no flightless period results. Their voice is a loud honking. Magpie Goose youngster stands proud with his parents in the background Systematics and evolution This species is placed in the order Anseriformes, having the characteristic bill structure, but is considered to be distinct from the other species in this taxon. The related and extant families, Anhimidae (screamers) and Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans), contain all the other taxa. The magpie goose is contained in the genus Anseranas and family Anseranatidae, which are monotypic now. left A cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese, and swans. This family is quite old, a living fossil, having apparently diverged before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event — the relative Vegavis iaai lived some 68-67 million years ago. The fossil record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus Anatalavis (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene of New Jersey, USA - London Clay Early Eocene of Walton-on-the-Naze, England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known anseranatid. Other Paleogene birds sometimes considered magpie-geese are the genera Geranopsis from the Hordwell Formation Late Eocene to the Early Oligocene of England and Anserpica from the Late Oligocene of Billy-Créchy (France). The earliest known member of the group in Australia is Eoanseranas represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland. Additional fossils from North America and Europe suggest that the family was spread across the globe during the late Paleogene period. The Australian distribution of the living species ties in well with the presumed Gondwanan origin of Anseriformes, but Northern Hemisphere fossils are puzzling. Perhaps the magpie geese were one of the dominant groups of Paleogene waterfowl, only to become largely extinct later. Ecology and status Magpie goose colony at Serendip Sanctuary Magpie Goose on nest Anseranas semipalmata - MHNT The magpie goose is found in a variety of open wetland areas such as floodplains and swamps, where they wade and swim. They eat mostly vegetation such as dry grass blades, grass seeds, spike rush bulbs and wild rice. It is fairly sedentary apart from some movement during the dry season. They are colonial breeders and are gregarious outside of the breeding season when they can form large and noisy flocks of up to a few thousand individuals. Its nest is on the ground (also in trees 5 m or more high), and a typical clutch is 5-14 eggs. Some males mate with two females, all of which raise the young, unlike some other polygamous birds. This may be beneficial when predation of young is high as chicks raised by trios are more likely to survive. This species is plentiful across its range, although this is significantly reduced in comparison to the range at time of European settlement. The range once extended as far south as the Coorong and the wetlands of the southeast of South Australia and Western Victoria. For Australia as a whole, it is not threatened and has a controlled hunting season when numbers are large. However, most of the southern populations were extirpated in the mid-20th century by overhunting and habitat destruction. The species has been subject to reintroduction projects such as Bool Lagoon between Penola and Naracoorte. Populations in more northern areas have again reached a level where it can be regularly utilized by hunters, although not in the example provided. The magpie goose was listed as near threatened on the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria. In the December 2007 Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act list of threatened fauna, it is also listed.The FFGA list does not distinguish different threat categories. As of early 2008, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species had not been prepared. With the advent of climate change, and more frequent seawater inundations of the current extensive freshwater floodplains, CSIRO scientists argue that magpie geese populations may be at risk.ECOS: Indigenous icon at risk from sea level rise. Blogs, CSIRO. Retrieved 30 November 2011. In Aboriginal languages The Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land know this bird as manimunak. It became an important food item with the formation of wetlands about 1500 ya, and is depicted in rock art from this period. Mimi figures are often shown holding goose-feather fans.Goodfellow, D.L. & M. Stott (2001, 2005).

Grant worked as a bookkeeper and a cashier, then was called to be an LDS apostle on October 16, 1882, at age 25. After the death of Joseph F. Smith in late 1918, Grant served as LDS church president until his death. The first president born after the exodus to Utah, Grant was also the last LDS Church president to have practiced plural marriage. He had three wives, though by the time he became church president in 1918 only his second wife, Augusta Winters, was still living. In business, Grant helped develop the Avenues neighborhood of Salt Lake City. In 1884, he served a term as a representative to the Utah Territorial Legislature. Early life Young Heber J. Grant with his mother Rachel Ivins Grant Grant was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, the son of Rachel Ridgeway Ivins and Jedediah Morgan Grant. His father was a counselor in the First Presidency to Brigham Young. Rachel Grant was a native of New Jersey, where she had converted to the LDS Church at about 20. Her cousin and later brother-in-law (he married her older sister Anna), Israel Ivins, was the first person baptized a Latter-day Saint in New Jersey. Jedediah Grant died when Heber J. Grant was nine days old. After Jedediah's death, Rachel married Jedediah's brother, George Grant, but he fell into alcoholism so she divorced him. Rachel became the dominant influence in Heber's life. She served for many years as president of the 13th Ward Relief Society in downtown Salt Lake City. He was known for his determination to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond his reach. As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically awkward to be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship. In similar fashion, Grant expressed a desire to be a successful bookkeeper although many of his associates criticized his penmanship. He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach penmanship at one of the local academies. There were no free public schools in Salt Lake City when Grant was a child, but his mother kept him enrolled in various schools while he was growing up. Business activities After working as a bookkeeper in the insurance business in 1877, Grant became an assistant cashier with Zion's Savings Bank and afterwards opened an insurance business with Nephi Clayton. Later, Grant became a partner with D. W. Jennings. He later founded an additional insurance agency in Ogden and, for a time, owned the Ogden Vinegar Works. In the late 1890s, Grant served as the business manager for the newly-formed official LDS magazine, the Improvement Era. Grant's insurance company advertised in the publication. Grant continued to be involved in business activities after his call as an apostle. He founded many new businesses, including a bank. He was a founder of the Utah Sugar Company and the main founder of the Salt Lake Theatre. Grant lost a large amount of money in the Panic of 1893 and never recovered from its adverse financial effects. He was also the main person to negotiate new financing to the LDS Church in New York at the time. His efforts kept the church going until Lorenzo Snow's late-1890s call for tithing placed the church in a better financial situation. Early LDS Church service Grant was made a block teacher (similar to the modern position of home teacher) when he was still a youth, which was rare at the time. He was ordained a seventy at 15, which was also rare at the time.Seventies were then a local priesthood office considered between that of elder and high priest. There are virtually no cases of the LDS Church ordaining men to the Melchizedek priesthood before 18. In June 1875, when the first Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA) was organized in the Salt Lake 13th Ward, Grant, then 19, was called to serve as a counselor to Junius F. Wells in its presidency. At 26, he served a mission to the Native Americans from 1883 to 1884. Grant's early church assignments included service on the Church Salary Committee and the Sunday School General Board. Grant was made Second Assistant in the Superintendency of the General YMMIA in 1898. When Joseph F. Smith became president of the church and head of the YMMIA, Grant was made First Assistant, where he served until he became church president.LDS Church Almanac, 2010 Edition, p. 144 In 1880, Grant became president of the Tooele Utah Stake, moving there with his wife, Lucy, and their children. Around then, Lucy began to develop health problems. apostle, c. 1880–89 In 1882, Grant was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Early in his service in the quorum, he made many trips to Arizona, earning the title \\"The Arizona Apostle.\\" Grant twice served missions among the Yaqui in Mexico. In 1901, Grant was sent to Japan to open the church's Japanese Mission. He served as the mission president until 1903, when he returned home but was almost immediately sent to preside over the British and other European missions of the church. He returned from the British mission in 1906. During the ensuing decade and later, Grant oversaw church education programs, the Genealogical Society of Utah and the Improvement Era. Church president Grant succeeded Joseph F. Smith as church president in November 1918. He was not sustained in the position by the general church membership, however, until June 1919 because of the influenza pandemic of 1918, which forced a delay of the church's traditional springtime general conference. Grant upon becoming church president (late 1918 or early 1919) During his tenure as church president, Grant enforced the 1890 Manifesto outlawing plural marriage and gave guidance as the church's social structure evolved away from its early days of plural marriage. In 1927, he authorized the implementation of the church's \\"Good Neighbor\\" policy, which was intended to reduce antagonism between Latter-day Saints and the US government. Grant dedicated the first temples outside of Utah since Kirtland. The first was the Hawaii Temple, followed by the Alberta Temple, the first outside the United States, and the Arizona Temple. The church also began the Idaho Falls Temple, which was not completed until after his death. Also under Grant, the first stakes outside the Intermountain West were organized. The first stake in Los Angeles was organized in the 1920s. Grant still operated on old methods, such as personally asking LeGrand Richards to move to California with the intention of calling him as a stake president there. He also personally negotiated the purchase of the land on which the Los Angeles Temple would be built. In the 1930s, stakes were organized in New York and Chicago and in the 1940s in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC. Grant presided at the dedication of an LDS chapel in Washington, DC, in 1933, which was seen to mark a new phase of nationwide expansion in the church. In 1935, Grant excommunicated members of the church in Short Creek, Arizona, who refused to sign the loyalty pledge to the church that included a renunciation of plural marriage. That signaled the formal beginning of the Mormon fundamentalist movement, and some of the excommunicated members went on to found the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. One of Grant's greatest legacies as president is the church's welfare program, which he instituted in 1936: \\"our primary purpose was to set up, insofar as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves.\\" Grant also placed strong emphasis on the importance of sacrament meeting attendance and oversaw expansion of the seminary program and the creation of the institute of religion. His administration also emphasized the practice of the LDS health code known as the Word of Wisdom. During the early 1900s, general authorities differed in their observance of the proscription against beer, wine, tobacco, coffee and tea, but among the apostles, Grant was one of the most vocal in opposing such substances. In 1921, Grant's administration made adherence to the health code compulsory for advancement in the priesthood or for entrance to temples.Allen and Leonard, p. 524 Grant also spoke out in favor of Utah's Prohibition movement, which occurred around the same time. Despite being a Democrat,Heber J. Grant, Conference Report, October 1919, p. 19. Grant was opposed to the election of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and wrote a front-page editorial for the Deseret News urging church members not to vote for him during the 1936 election. Grant shared the view of J. Reuben Clark and David O. McKay that the New Deal was socialism, which they all despised. Roosevelt greatly alienated Grant also for opposing Prohibition, another subject. Roosevelt still won Utah in each of his four presidential elections. Grant regarded that as \\"one of the most serious conditions that has confronted me since I became President of the Church.\\" Later, when Utah voters agreed by plebiscite to become the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, thus completing the process of ratification and repealing prohibition, Grant was devastated. In a general conference, he told the Latter-day Saints, \\"I have never felt so humiliated in my life over anything as that the State of Utah voted for the repeal of Prohibition.\\" Under Grant's administration, the position of Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve was created. Death Grant died in Salt Lake City, Utah, from cardiac failure as a result of arteriosclerosis. As the final surviving member of the church's Council of Fifty, his death marked the formal end of the organization. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. Legacy Grant's teachings as an apostle were the 2004 course of study in the LDS Church's Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes. Wives Grant was the last LDS Church president to practice plural marriage. He married a first time in 1877 and then twice more in 1884. However, by the time he became church president, only one of his wives, Augusta, was still alive.  Lucy Stringham  Grant married Lucy Stringham (1858–1893) on November 1, 1877. She was a daughter of Briant Stringham, who came to the Salt Lake Valley with Brigham Young in 1847. Lucy had been closely associated with Grant essentially from her birth, and they attended Mary Cook's school together. Like Grant, she was a member of the 13th Ward. It was not until Grant broke off his courtship with Emily H. Wells (see below) that he started actively courting Lucy. Lucy was initially reticent to fully accept Grant's advances, seeing herself as just a temporary replacement for Emily, but after he regularly walked her home from church services for several weeks without being invited into the Stringham home, she gave up and invited him in. They married a few months later. For a time, Lucy was a school teacher. Grant felt very close to Lucy. On an early assignment as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve in Arizona, he surprised his traveling companion, Brigham Young Jr., with how many letters he wrote to Lucy. Lucy and Grant would become the parents of six children. He praised her \\"business foresight and judgment\\" and credited her with much of his business success. She died in 1893, after a long illness during which he gave constant, tender devotion to her, as he had throughout their marriage.  Augusta Winters  Grant married Hulda Augusta Winters (1856–1952) on May 26, 1884. She was a school teacher for a time and was described as the ablest school teacher in Utah Territory. In the late 1880s, Augusta took up residence in New York City to try and prevent Grant's arrest on polygamy charges. Augusta bore one daughter. She accompanied Grant to Japan when he was sent to open the Japanese mission in 1901. She would often travel with him when he was president of the church, especially when he went to address non-Mormon audiences. She died in 1952.  Emily H. Wells  Grant married Emily Harris Wells (1857–1908) on May 27, 1884. She was a daughter of Daniel H. Wells. Emily and Grant were five months apart in age and from Emily's birth she had been Grant's next-door neighbor. They were among the most prominent young orators in Salt Lake society in the 1870s, both connected with the Wasatch Literary Association and Grant was a counselor to Emily's brother in the 13th Ward YMMIA presidency. The marriage of Grant and Emily was expected by all who knew them. However, Emily then announced publicly her opposition to polygamy, which caused a falling out between Grant and Emily. Emily was a full sister of Briant H. Wells, who was a Major General in the United States Army. Another of her brothers, Heber M. Wells, later the first governor of the state of Utah, stayed with her for part of the time of her exile in Manassa. Emily attended the University of Deseret. For a time, she was a school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that was in many ways a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then had a change of heart and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far worse than it had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant having to go to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture. In 1889, to avoid being forced to testify in pending unlawful cohabitation charges against her husband, Emily went to Manassa, Colorado, where she stayed for a year and a half. Grant accompanied her on the train-ride from Pueblo, Colorado, to Manassa, having been on a different train on the previous part of the journey to avoid arrest. Grant stayed two weeks, setting up for Emily the most comfortable house in the town, and leaving his mother to help Emily. She remained in Manassa until March 1891, when she returned to Salt Lake City. Emily and Grant were the parents of four daughters and a son. The son, Daniel Wells Grant, died while he was still a child. Emily's last child was born in 1899, when she was 42, the same year Grant pleaded guilty to unlawful cohabitation and paid a $100 fine.Salt Lake Daily Tribune, 1899-09-09. Emily accompanied Grant when he served as mission president in England, bringing her four daughters and two of Lucy's daughters. Because of their daughters' presence, the Grants relocated the mission home to a more respectable part of Liverpool. Emily developed stomach cancer in 1907, which caused her death in 1908.Millennial Star article on the death of Emily Wells Grant At the time of her death, she was considered one of the most prominent women in Salt Lake City.Salt Lake Telegram article on Emily's death Image:HeberJGrantLower.jpgGrave monument of Heber J.

I: The little owl George Edwards (3 April 1694 – 23 July 1773) was an English naturalist and ornithologist, known as the \\"father of British ornithology\\". Edwards was born at Stratford, Essex. In his early years he travelled extensively through mainland Europe, studying natural history, and gained some reputation for his coloured drawings of animals, especially birds. Librarian for the Royal College of Physicians In 1733, on the recommendation of Hans Sloane, he was appointed librarian to the Royal College of Physicians in London. Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum, had employed George Edwards as a natural history painter for many years, and Edwards drew miniature figures of animals for him. Edwards visited Sloane once a week to share news and a coffee. Sloane kept track of Edwards's expenses and reimbursed him annually. Edwards served as College librarian for thirty-six years. He was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society and of the London Society of Antiquaries and was rewarded with the Copley Medal. Ornithology In 1743 Edwards published the first volume of his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds, the fourth volume of which appeared in 1751; three supplementary volumes, under the title Gleanings of Natural History, were issued in 1758, 1760 and 1764. The two works contain engravings and descriptions of more than 600 subjects in natural history not before described or delineated. He likewise added a general index in French and English, which was afterwards supplied with Linnaean names by Linnaeus himself, with whom he frequently corresponded. About 1764 he retired to Plaistow, Essex, still a rural village, where he later died at the age of 77. He also wrote Essays of Natural History (1770), Elements of Fossilogy (1776) Edwards's plates appeared in Johann Seligmann's Sammlung verschiedener ausländischer und seltener Vögel, 1749. Some of the colour plates in his Natural History of Birds were painted by Peter Paillou. The puffadder shyshark, first described by Edwards in 1760, is now named Haploblepharus edwardsii. Eponyms Diadophis punctatus edwardsii, a subspecies of North American snake, is named in honor of George Edwards.

Like many others of the Renaissance period, he studied and wrote on a range of topics including ichthyology, ornithology, botany, comparative anatomy, architecture and Egyptology. He is sometimes known as Pierre Belon du Mans, or, in the Latin in which his works appeared, as Petrus Bellonius Cenomanus. Ivan Pavlov called him the \\"prophet of comparative anatomy\\". Life Belon was born in 1517 at the hamlet of Souletière near Cérans- Foulletourte. His family was not wealthy and as a boy, he worked as an apprentice at an apothecary at Foulletourte. He later (c. 1535) worked as an apothecary to the bishop of Clermont, Guillaume Duprat. He then travelled through Flanders and England, taking a keen interest in zoology. When he returned to Auvergne, he was supported by René du Bellay, bishop of Le Mans, to study at the University of Wittenberg with the botanist Valerius Cordus (1515—1544). He travelled around Germany with Cordus and on his arrival at Thionville, was arrested on suspicions that he was a Lutheran. He was released by the interventions of a certain Dehamme who was an admirer of his friend from Paris, the poet Pierre Ronsard. Around 1542 he studied medicine at Paris, and obtained a licentiate in medicine although he never took the degree of doctor. With the recommendation of Duprat, he became an apothecary to Cardinal François de Tournon. Under this patronage, he was able to undertake extensive scientific voyages. Starting in 1546, he travelled through Greece, Crete, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia and Palestine, and returned in 1549. He hoped to find the remains of Homer's Troy in the Levant. A full account of his Observations on this journey, with illustrations, was published in Paris, 1553. Returning to the household of Cardinal de Tournon at Rome for the Papal conclave, 1549-1550, Belon encountered the naturalists Guillaume Rondelet and Hippolyte Salviani. He returned to Paris with his copious notes and began to publish. In 1557 he travelled again, this time in northern Italy, Savoy, the Dauphiné and Auvergne. Belon was highly favored both by Henry II and by Charles IX, who accorded him lodging in the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne; there he undertook the translations of Dioscurides and Theophrastus. He was assassinated by thieves one evening in April 1564, when coming through the Bois on his return from Paris. Works comparison of the skeleton of birds and man in Natural History of Birds, 1555 Belon was typical of the renaissance scholar and took an interest in \\"all kinds of good disciplines\\" in his lifetime. He was interested in zoology, botany and classical Antiquity. Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value. His first book was Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons (1551) and despite its title was a work mainly on the dolphin; it did have woodcuts of some fishes, possibly the first among printed books in the West. His second book, De aquatilibus (in Latin, 1553) greatly expanded on the first and included a description of 110 species of fish, with illustrations; it was a work that laid the foundation of modern ichthyology. Its French translation La nature et diversite des poissons Paris, 1555, was followed by an edition of 1560 and the volume was reprinted in Frankfurt and Zurich. His works were translated by Carolus Clusius, and he was held in high authority by Ulisse Aldrovandi. In his L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux (1555) he included two figures of the skeletons of humans and birds marking the homologous bones. This is widely used as one of the earliest ideas on comparative anatomy.

In the case of helium-4, it has been conjectured since the 1960s that it might be possible to create a supersolid. Starting from 2017, a definitive proof for the existence of this state was provided by several experiments using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. The general conditions required for supersolidity to emerge in a certain substance are a topic of ongoing research. Background A supersolid is a special quantum state of matter where particles form a rigid, spatially ordered structure, but also flow with zero viscosity. This is in contradiction to the intuition that flow, and in particular superfluid flow with zero viscosity, is a property exclusive to the fluid state, e.g. superconducting electron and neutron fluids, gases with Bose–Einstein condensates, or unconventional liquids such as helium-4 or helium-3 at sufficiently low temperature. For more than 50 years it was thus unclear whether the supersolid state can exist. Experiments using helium While several experiments yielded negative results, in the 1980s, John Goodkind discovered the first anomaly in a solid by using ultrasound. Inspired by his observation, in 2004 Eun-Seong Kim and Moses Chan at Pennsylvania State University saw phenomena which were interpreted as supersolid behavior. Specifically, they observed a non- classical rotational moment of inertia of a torsional oscillator. This observation could not be explained by classical models but was consistent with superfluid-like behavior of a small percentage of the helium atoms contained within the oscillator. This observation triggered a large number of follow up studies to reveal the role played by crystal defects or helium-3 impurities. Further experimentation, however, has cast some doubt on the existence of a true supersolid in helium. Most importantly, it was shown that the observed phenomena could be largely explained due to changes in the elastic properties of the helium. In 2012, Chan repeated his original experiments with a new apparatus that was designed to eliminate any such contributions. In this experiment, Chan and his coauthors found no evidence of supersolidity.  Experiments using ultracold quantum gases  In 2017, two research groups from ETH Zurich and from MIT reported on the creation of an ultracold quantum gas with supersolid properties. The Zurich group placed a Bose-Einstein condensate inside two optical resonators, which enhanced the atomic interactions until they started to spontaneously crystallize and form a solid that maintains the inherent superfluidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. This setting realises a special form of a supersolid, the so-called lattice supersolid, where atoms are pinned to the sites of an externally imposed lattice structure. The MIT group exposed a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential to light beams that created an effective spin-orbit coupling. The interference between the atoms on the two spin-orbit coupled lattice sites gave rise to a characteristic density modulation. In 2019, three groups from Stuttgart, Florence, and Innsbruck observed supersolid properties in dipolar Bose- Einstein condensates formed from lanthanide atoms. In these systems, supersolidity emerges directly from the atomic interactions, without the need for an external optical lattice. This facilitated also the direct observation of superfluid flow and hence the definitive proof for the existence of the supersolid state of matter.  Theory  In most theories of this state, it is supposed that vacancies - empty sites normally occupied by particles in an ideal crystal - lead to supersolidity. These vacancies are caused by zero- point energy, which also causes them to move from site to site as waves. Because vacancies are bosons, if such clouds of vacancies can exist at very low temperatures, then a Bose–Einstein condensation of vacancies could occur at temperatures less than a few tenths of a kelvin. A coherent flow of vacancies is equivalent to a \\"superflow\\" (frictionless flow) of particles in the opposite direction. Despite the presence of the gas of vacancies, the ordered structure of a crystal is maintained, although with less than one particle on each lattice site on average. Alternatively, a supersolid can also emerge from a superfluid. In this situation, which is realised in the experiments with atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, the spatially ordered structure is a modulation on top of the superfluid density distribution.

Murder by Decree is a 1979 British-Canadian mystery thriller film directed by Bob Clark. It features the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who are embroiled in the investigation surrounding the real-life 1888 Whitechapel murders committed by \\"Jack the Ripper\\". Christopher Plummer plays Holmes and James Mason plays Watson. Though it features a similar premise, it is somewhat different in tone and result to A Study in Terror. It is loosely based on The Ripper File by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd. The film's premise of the plot behind the murders is influenced by the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution (1976), by Stephen Knight, who presumed that the killings were part of a Masonic plot. The original script contained the names of the historical suspects, Sir William Gull and John Netley. In the actual film, they are represented by fictional analogues: Thomas Spivy (Gull) and William Slade (Netley). This plot device was later used in other Jack the Ripper-themed fiction, including the graphic novel From Hell. Plot After the Metropolitan Police fail to apprehend the serial killer Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes is approached to investigate the recent murders of prostitutes that happened in the Whitechapel district of London. Helped by Dr. Watson and the medium Robert Lees, Holmes discovers that all the victims were companions of Annie Crook, a woman locked in a mental institution. Things get complicated as members of the police hierarchy and also several politicians, all Freemasons, seem to be protecting one of their own. Furthermore, Inspector Foxborough, the policeman who is in charge of the case, is in fact the secret leader of the radicals, a political movement waiting for the British government to fall because of its incapability to solve the Whitechapel murders. Holmes must rely on his skills to find and confront the murderer. Cast * Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes * James Mason as Dr. John Watson * David Hemmings as Inspector Foxborough * Susan Clark as Mary Kelly * Frank Finlay as Inspector Lestrade * Anthony Quayle as Sir Charles Warren * Donald Sutherland as Robert Lees * Geneviève Bujold as Annie Crook * John Gielgud as Lord Salisbury * Peter Jonfield as William Slade * Roy Lansford as Sir Thomas Spivey Production The film was directed by Bob Clark and written by playwright John Hopkins, who scripted the Bond film Thunderball (1965). The script partially was inspired by Elwyn Jones's book The Ripper File. Hopkins referenced Conan Doyle's work, particularly Holmes' deduction and science skills but downplayed other aspects of the characters, such as Holmes' drug use in favour of making them more likable and human. The film stars Christopher Plummer and James Mason as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, and presents a largely different version of Holmes from the Basil Rathbone movies of the 1940s, with the aesthete still prevailing, yet tinged with humanity and emotional empathy. Plummer stated that he tried to make Holmes more human and caring, saying \\"This is a passionate and caring Holmes.\\" James Mason's Watson is also a departure from previous incarnations; although he may appear at first to resemble the bumbling Nigel Bruce version of the character, he soon shows his level head and scientific and medical training to be as valuable assets as they were in the original stories. Like Plummer, Mason wanted to play up Watson's skills and avoid the buffoonish way the character had been portrayed before. Mason received especially good reviews for his performance. Plummer had earlier portrayed Holmes in 1977's Silver Blaze. The supporting cast includes Donald Sutherland, Susan Clark, John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, David Hemmings and Geneviève Bujold. Frank Finlay plays Inspector Lestrade, a part he had portrayed in the similar film A Study in Terror (1965), in which Quayle also played a supporting role. Finlay continued his association with Holmes by appearing in an episode of Granada TV's Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett. The film was shot on location in London in 1978. The interior sets, including a vast Victorian era street, were created at Elstree Studios. The docks set was built at Shepperton Studios. $3 million of the budget came from Canada, $2 million from the UK. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"a good deal of uncomplicated fun, not in a class with Nicholas Meyer's The Seven Percent Solution, but certainly miles ahead of many other current movies that masquerade as popular entertainment\\".Canby, Vincent (9 February 1979). \\"Film: 'Murder by Decree' in Foggy Old London\\". The New York Times. C1. A review in Variety called it \\"probably the best Sherlock Holmes film since the inimitable pairing of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the 1940s series at Universal. Unfortunately, it also shares some of the defects of those films, i.e. slow pacing, an improbable story line, and an undue emphasis on odd characters.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Murder By Decree\\". Variety. 24 January 1979. 22. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that its \\"biggest problem is its script, which runs on for a full 120 minutes with no place to go. We see a couple of murders, meet a psychic (Donald Sutherland) and a long-suffering woman trapped in a psychiatric prison (Genevieve Bujold), then the story doubles back with recapitulation after recapitulation. The film has at least two false endings. I mistakenly put on my coat with one reel to go. All of this is a shame, because the cast is excellent.\\"Siskel, Gene (20 March 1979). \\"Holmes film: The violence is 'Murder'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 7. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Unfortunately, under Bob Clark's uninspired, plodding direction, Hopkins' elaborations make for a slow and ponderous film, despite a starry cast and some scary moments. Not helping matters is Christopher Plummer's rather colorless Sherlock Holmes.

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post stated, \\"While never as playful or ingenious as Nicholas Meyer's screenplay for 'The Seven Per-Cent Solution,' Hopkins' mystery is crisp and chilling right up to the denouement.

He died following complications from pneumonia. Biography Yitchak Kolker (later Itzik Kol) was born in Petach Tikva, Mandatory Palestine, the only child of Tova Rosset, a Polish immigrant, and Shalom Kolker, a Ukrainian immigrant who worked as a union organizer and fought for Palestinian-Israeli rights. As a child, Kol trained to be a classical violinist at the urging of his mother. Despite noticeable talent, his interests shifted to politics and socialism during his adolescence and young adulthood when he became a prominent leader in the Israeli youth movement, Hashomer Hatzair. He was one of the founders Kibbutz Nachshon. There he married Noemi Glass and officially changed his last name from Kolker to Kol. They had two children: Ayelet Kol Engelman (born 1953) and Shahar Kol (born 1956). Kol left Kibbutz Nachshon in 1960. In 1982, he divorced Noemi and married his second wife, Hadassa Degani, in 1991. They adopted a daughter two years later, Gabriella Kol (born 1993). In 1991–1994, Kol lived in Mount Olympus, Los Angeles, California. In 2002, he divorced Hadassa and married his third wife, a Colombian interior designer, Sarita Shalev in 2004. In the last three years of his life, he was involved in the production of herbal remedies for Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD), one of which he actively promoted in the media.

All these shows were awarded the \\"David's Harp\\" awards, the Israeli equivalent of the \\"Emmy\\". 1978-1983 President of United Studios where he initiated and planned the merging of Herzliya Studios with Berke-Pathe-Humphries Studios into one company. Under his leadership the company became the industry leader in film and TV production in Israel as well as satellite broadcasting throughout the world. 1983-1991 President of G.G. Israel Studios where he devised and developed the foundation of the Neve Ilan Communications Center near Jerusalem. The complex includes vast stages and various other studios for film TV and video production. In 1997, he made \\"Hachaverim Shel Barney\\" (החברים של ברני, \\"Barney's Friends\\"), an Israeli co-production based on Barney and Friends. Kol's daughter loved the character of the purple dinosaur, which inspired him to pursue the rights to produce an Israeli adaptation of the show. He approached Lyrick Studios in 1995, but was initially turned down, told that he was only allowed to air a Hebrew dubbed version of the original series. He felt that \\"putting Hebrew words in American kids' mouths\\" wouldn't work. Realizing that Sheryl Leach and her father-in-law, Richard Leach, were devout Christians, he asked \\"Why not have Barney speak in the language of the Bible?\\" This sealed the deal and, under strict guidelines, the show could be produced. One of these guidelines was that the episodes could only be adapted from those of the American show, with very few script changes. When the agreement went through, the show cost Roll Communications $41,000 per episode to produce (Only $500 per episode went to Lyrick), making it one of the most expensive children's shows produced in Israel. Kol supervised and executed live satellite broadcasts from Israel (1973–1983) and directed the following live shows: Face The Nation (CBS) Meet The Press (NBC) Issues and Answers (ABC) Awards and honors *1971: Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film - nomination: The Policemen *1971: Golden Globes: Best Foreign Language Film - winner: The Policemen *1972: Monte-Carlo Television Festival: Prix Cino Del Duca - winner: The Policemen *1975: Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film - nomination: I Love You Rosa Kol was an honorary member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.

I owe Itzik a lot for my career. Without his confidence in me as a young producer in the movie Halehaka, none of my later doings would not have happened. I was a young, frightened 24-year-old director, and he was the executive director of Herzliya Studios, who produced many of Uri Zohar's films and TV shows. Today, being a producer myself, I can say that his decision to work with a young director such as myself was very courageous. Undoubtedly he is the one who made the film possible. His contribution in this respect was huge.\\" In a memorial evening held for Itzik Kol in Tel Aviv's Cinemateque on August 2008 Nesher added that cinema students do not always realize Kol's huge contribution to contemporary Israeli film industry: “All those quality movies that win prestigious international prizes in late years, could not have been made at all if it wasn’t for Itzik Kol's contribution and the immortal path he paved in the Israeli qualitative cinematography.” Nesher described Kol as the “ultimate true producer” who is constantly involved in any and every aspect of the film, from casting, through directing and taking care of the needs of the cast, to paying attention to every detail in editing and beyond. “Prass Israel” winner, actress and director Gila Almagor (Sallah Shabati, Hachayim al pi Agfa, Hakayitz shel Avia, Spielberg's Munich), who hosted Itzik Kol’s memorial evening and worked with him since his days as general manager of the Cameri Theater, said at the occasion that aside for Kol's huge contribution to Israeli culture, he will be remembered for his unique persona. She described him as being a true friend who cares about people he works with, and as having a special sense of wit and humor. \\"Kol was a great man, literally and figuratively, in girth and in spirit” said producer Shlomo Paz, who first met Itzik Kol when they both belonged to Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. “He knew how to take things and do them. He had daring; he had incredible reserves of energy, but mostly he was smart and did the right things.\\" \\"There is no part of the industry he didn't touch. He made films and television shows, worked with the greatest artists and even helped found international commercial television station during the 1970s and 1980s.\\" Television host and actor Dudu Topaz describes Kol as his mentor and his spiritual father: “He was the first to give me a chance as a TV host on the show Sachek Ota, which brought us winning the Kinor David prize. He was the one to give Uri Zohar, Tuvia Tafir, myself and many others first chance in show biz. Along the years we have done many TV hit shows together such as Sachek Ota, Tze Mize, Ze Ma Yesh and Ten Kav. He was one of a kind!” Producer and television host Meni Peer who worked with Kol both in Israeli Television’s Arutz 1 and Arutz 2, on shows like Mimeni Meni, Besha’a Tova and Siba LeMesiba said: “The word producer is too dull to describe Itzik Kol's doings. He was the real creator of cinema and television in Israel. He was always involved with every aspect of the production. This man just knew and loved the stage!”.

One of his first acts was to oversee the passage of the Migration Act 1958, which replaced the earlier Immigration Restriction Act 1901 that had formed the basis of the White Australia policy. During his term in office, reforms to migration laws led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly from Britain and Europe, where new recruitment posts had been created. Many refugees were also accepted. As a result of his experience as a prisoner of war, he arranged for non-criminal deportees to be held in detention centres instead of being sent to jail.

It tells the story of a teenage journalist writing for Rolling Stone in the early 1970s, his touring with the fictitious rock band Stillwater, and his efforts to get his first cover story published. The film is semi-autobiographical, as Crowe himself was a teenage writer for Rolling Stone. It is based on his experiences touring with rock bands Poco, the Allman Brothers Band, Led Zeppelin, Eagles, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Crowe has discussed how during this period he lost his virginity, fell in love, and met his musical heroes—these events represented in the film as happening to William Miller (Fugit), the boyish main character.\\"Biography,\\" The Uncool: The Official Website for Everything Cameron Crowe. Accessed Dec. 14, 2014. The film received widespread acclaim from critics and received four Academy Awards nominations, including a win for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Roger Ebert hailed it the best film of the year as well as the ninth-best film of the 2000s. It also won two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Hudson). In a 2016 international poll conducted by BBC, Almost Famous was ranked the 79th greatest film since 2000. In a Hollywood Reporter 2014 list voted on by \\"studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty\\", Almost Famous was ranked the 71st greatest film of all time.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/100-best-films-ever-hollywood- favorites-818512/item/almost-famous-hollywoods-100-favorite-818448 Plot In 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed college-professor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strong-willed Elaine's strict ban on rock music and pop culture influences that she fears have a negative effect on her children finally drives William's eighteen-year-old sister Anita to move to San Francisco and become a flight attendant. In 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anita's secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego. Rock journalist Lester Bangs, impressed with William's writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran groupie Penny Lane, who has taken William under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny Lane insists she and her friends are \\"band aids\\", a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves. Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong- Torres, believing William is older, hires him sight unseen to write an article about Stillwater and sends William on the road with the band. William interviews the members, but Russell repeatedly puts him off. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe soon become evident and not helped at all by the band's first tee shirt, a full band shot that pictures Russell in full view while the rest of the band is virtually in shadows. William is jokingly called \\"the enemy\\" by the band because he is a journalist, but all the same begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle. The band's record company hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell's girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three protégée band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalant but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs. Penny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where the band is celebrating the news that they are to be featured on the cover of Rolling Stone. Penny is asked to leave after Leslie notices her attempts to get Russell's attention. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on quaaludes. While flying to another gig the following day, the band's plane encounters severe weather. Believing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russell's long-simmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in Tupelo, leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere. William arrives at the Rolling Stone office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says William's perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to \\"be honest...and unmerciful.\\" Rolling Stones editors rave over William's completed article, but when the magazine's fact checker calls the band, Russell lies to protect Stillwater's image and claims 90% is false. Rolling Stone kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters a dejected William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to their home in San Diego. Groupie Sapphire chastises Russell for betraying William. Russell calls Penny at her home and wants to meet with her, but she tricks him by giving him William's address. He arrives and finds himself face-to-face with William's mother, who scolds him for his behavior. Russell apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell has verified William's article to Rolling Stone, which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to go to Morocco while Stillwater tours again by bus. CastProduction Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to create Stillwater, the emerging group that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. \\"Stillwater\\" was the name of a real band signed to Macon, Georgia's Capricorn Records label, which required the film's producers to obtain permission to use the name. In an interview, real Stillwater guitarist Bobby Golden said, \\"They could have probably done it without permission but they probably would have had a bunch of different lawsuits. Our lawyer got in touch with them. They wanted us to do it for free and I said, 'No we're not doing it for free.' So we got a little bit of change out of it.\\"Golden, Bobby. \\"Stillwater Interview,\\" Phantom Photography. Retrieved July 14, 2018. Seventies rocker Peter Frampton served as a technical consultant on the film. Crowe and his then-wife, musician Nancy Wilson of Heart, co-wrote three of the five Stillwater songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs. Crowe based the character of Penny Lane on the real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull and her group of female promoters who called themselves the \\"Flying Garter Girls Group\\". Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe's inspiration, for instance Pamela Des Barres and Bebe Buell. The character of William Miller's mother (played by Frances McDormand) was based on Crowe's own mother, who even showed up on the set to keep an eye on him while he worked. Though he asked his mother not to bother McDormand, the two women ended up getting along well.Goldstein, Patrick. \\"This Time, It's Personal A '70s rock film co-starring...Mom? It's Cameron Crowe's life story, and he's tried to tell it for years,\\" Los Angeles Times (August 27, 2000). Archie on The Uncool.com. Alice in Chains' guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell was Crowe's first choice for the role of Stillwater bass player Larry Fellows. Cantrell is friends with Crowe and had previously appeared in two films directed by him, Singles (1992) and Jerry Maguire (1996). Cantrell was busy writing the songs for his solo album Degradation Trip and had to turn the role down. Mark Kozelek was cast instead. Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use \\"Kashmir\\" in Fast Times at Ridgemont High—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" for an intended scene (on the special \\"Bootleg\\" edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra, sans the song, where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it). In his 2012 memoir My Cross to Bear, Gregg Allman confirms that several aspects of the movie are directly based on Crowe's time spent with the Allman Brothers Band. The scene in which Russell jumps from the top of the Topeka party house into a pool was based on something Duane Allman did: \\"the jumping off the roof into the pool, that was Duane—from the third floor of a place called the Travelodge in San Francisco. My brother wanted to do it again, but the cat who owned the place came out shaking his fist, yelling at him. We told that story all the time, and I have no doubt that Cameron was around for it.\\" He also confirms that he and Dickey Betts played a joke on Crowe by claiming clauses in their contract did not allow his story to be published—just before he was to deliver it to Rolling Stone. The airplane malfunction \\"near Tupelo, Mississippi\\" that occurred in the film is a thinly veiled reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd airplane crash on October 20, 1977.

It entered its second generation in 2008, being produced by Fiat in Tychy, Poland.Automobile Revue, catalogue edition 2005, p. 232-33. A third generation was introduced in 2016. The first two generations have a three-door hatchback body style, with the first generation also having a two-door convertible version that was marketed as the StreetKA, alongside a sporty hatch version, known as the SportKA. The third generation is produced as a five-door hatchback and as a four-door sedan. It was initially only available in Brazil, later being introduced in India, Mexico, South Africa (where it is marketed as the Ford Figo), Argentina and Europe. Pronunciation The name Ka has a number of possible pronunciations. For example, with a long or short \\"a\\", or with the letters pronounced separately. Ford's press office has used all three. According to Auto Trader, Ford \\"top brass\\" have given the correct pronunciation as Ka' like 'Cat'.\\" First generation (1996–2008) Ghia Saetta show car (1996) Ford Ka rear The car was introduced on September 11, 1996 as a small and low-cost addition to the Ford range. It was based on the Mark IV Ford Fiesta platform, but with a completely different exterior design. The design borrowed a lot from Ghia's \\"Saetta\\" show car, a roadster designed by Filippo Sapino. The Ka evolved from concept vehicles to production with minor changes. The large, one piece, moulded bumpers and wheel arches made the vehicle more durable and easier to repair. The vehicle was manufactured on the existing Fiesta production line in Almussafes, Valencia, minimising new model investment costs. The Chief Program Engineer was Kevin O’Neill. The designer of the car was Chris Svensson of Sunderland, who had designed a similar-shaped car when at the Royal College of Art in 1992. When the Ka was first introduced to the public it provoked mixed reactions, due to its original and striking New Edge design, overseen by Jack Telnack and executed by Claude Lobo. Besides the styling, the Ka, like its sister cars Fiesta and Puma; was lauded in the motoring press for its handling. Under Richard Parry-Jones' supervision, the suspension and steering settings allowed for hard cornering and high levels of grip, providing strong handling characteristics. At launch, the Ka was produced as a single model, with a number of production options including: air conditioning, power steering, height-adjustable driver's seat, adjustable position rear seat with head restraints, passenger airbag, central locking and power windows. An anti-lock braking system option was added in January 1997. Aside from corrosion, the main drawback was the 1,300 cc OHV four-cylinder Endura-E engine, a design dating to the 1950s Kent engine used in the Ford Anglia. Although not very modern, it provided enough torque to allow relaxed if not spirited driving. In 2002, the Endura-E was replaced by the overhead cam Duratec engine, with claims of improved fuel efficiency and increased refinement, mostly caused by taller gearing on the non-air conditioned models.  Endura-E engine specs (Ka)  998 cc (Brazil): * Power output - 53HP (5250 rpm) * Torque - 77.2 N/m (4000 rpm) * Bore - 68.68mm * Stroke - 67.40mm * Redline - 5450 rpm * RPM Limit - 5675 rpm 1297 cc: * Power output - 60HP (5000 rpm) * Torque - 104.0 N/m (3500 rpm) * Bore - 74mm * Stroke - 75.5mm * Redline - 5450 rpm * RPM Limit - 5675 rpm For the first three years of production, all models had black plastic bumpers to minimise parking damage to paintwork in city environments. These bumpers contained a stabiliser to prevent UV degradation which made them unsuitable for painting because the paint would not adhere properly. However, it became clear that many owners wanted body-coloured bumpers, so they were introduced in 1999 using different bumper mouldings (without the stabiliser). The Ka has proved highly profitable for Ford despite its low selling price, largely due to low development costs. In 2006, Ford sold 17,000 examples of the Ka model per year in the United Kingdom. As with other Ford models, insufficient anti-corrosion treatment during manufacture and the use of non-galvanised steel results in premature surface and structural corrosion becoming established on cars used in more northern, damp climates. In Australia, the Ka was introduced in October 1999 and was on the market there until 2002. It was unsuccessful – fewer than 2,000 were sold per year. This was partly due to the lack of an automatic transmission, which is preferred by a large proportion of Australian car buyers. The Ka was also sold in New Zealand between 1999–2004, and was replaced by the newer Fiesta. United Kingdom The Ka has been the best- selling car in its class in the United Kingdom for a number of years and commands around a fifth of the city car market. The UK model range originally consisted of the base version, the Ka, and the higher specification Ka² which standardised a number of the options listed above. The Ka² badge was fitted by dealers. Ka³ was introduced later. Power steering was added to the specification of the basic Ka after the first year. Concurrent with the introduction of body-coloured bumpers Ka² and Ka³ were replaced by Ka Collection and the LuxuryKa (later Ka Luxury). The Luxury version came with a Quickclear heated windscreen, leather seats and interior trim as well as standard air conditioning. A \\"Ka Blue\\" special edition was also launched in the UK with dark blue bumpers and a silvery-blue dashboard insert, rather than the standard models' silver. The Ka Sun Collection with a full-length fabric folding roof was also added to the range during the summer months. Unique to the UK was the Ford Ka Van variant, produced for BT Group and featuring a bespoke flat plywood floor with rubber over-mat and white ply covers instead of rear windows. A further line-up revision gave Ka the following trim levels in the United Kingdom: Studio, Style, Style Climate and Zetec Climate. In 2005, the Sublime model was introduced. This featured special leather interior & features not found on other models. This was only produced in very small numbers and is now one of the most sought after Kas. SportKa was also added to the range (see below). With the car's impending replacement, in May 2008 a Finale special edition with distinguishing features such as roof decal and black wing mirrors was made available.  StreetKa and SportKa In 2003, the Ka brand was diversified, with the addition of a new SportKa featuring a sporty body kit, wider track with stiffened suspension and redesigned 16\\" (40 cm) alloy wheels. Both models came with slightly widened bumpers front and rear with integral fog lamps. A convertible model called StreetKa also appeared, launched with the help of singer Kylie Minogue at the Paris Motor Show. It featured a manually folding soft top or an optional detachable hardtop (on the Winter Edition). StreetKa was a Ford inhouse design built by Pininfarina (the 2000 motor show concept was designed by Ghia, Turin) in Italy and all StreetKas have sill plates inscribed \\"Pininfarina\\". Pininfarina produced 37,076 StreetKas between 2002–2005. StreetKa came in two equipment levels, basic and luxury. Basic had cloth seats and air conditioning was an option. Luxury featured leather seats with matching leather door card inserts, heated seats, a Thatcham approved alarm along with Ford's PATS immobiliser, air conditioning and heated door mirrors. Options included upgrading the single CD/radio to an in-dash 6 disc CD/radio and additional rear speakers beneath the roll over bars and a heated windscreen, standard on winter models. All models featured remote control central locking with remote boot release, driver and passenger air bags with passengers air bag deactivation, electric windows and door mirrors, electric headlight aim adjustment, anti-lock brakes, power steering, front fog lights, racing Puma aluminium gear knob, electric hood cover release and a rev counter. The engine used in StreetKa (and SportKa) is called a Duratec but it is of South African origin where it is known as the Zetec Rocam. StreetKa features MacPherson struts front and rear and uses unique wider front lower arms (wishbones) giving it exceptional handling. The only exterior panel shared with Ka is the bonnet. The front headlights are also shared with Ka but appear different due to the front bumper covering them partly to change their shape. The interior shares most parts with Ka except StreetKa has its facia painted blue rather than silver. Its seats are mounted lower than Ka's and it has aluminium effect detailing.http://www.carenthusiast.com/pressrelease.html?include=20020911_fordstreetka Both StreetKa and SportKa received a new 1.6-litre 8-valve Duratec petrol engine, whereas Ka, Ka Collection, and LuxuryKa retained the 1.3-litre Duratec petrol engine. The SportKa was noted for its surprising advertising campaign, \\"The Ka's Evil Twin\\", denouncing the Ka's traditionally perceived \\"cute\\" design. The StreetKa ceased to be officially on sale in late 2006. In 2005, all Ka models including SportKa and StreetKa received a slightly updated interior, bringing the cabin back up to date, while still retaining the look and feel of the original. The SportKa continued to be available until 2008. A pink version was produced to promote the new Thunderbirds film, and supplied by Ford to the movie producer. The Thunderbird movie cars were unveiled at the Birmingham Motor Show. Only eight Pink StreetKas were produced by Ford for the film, 5 RHD and 3 LHD. All were signed by Sophia Myles (Miss Lady Penelope). The matching StreetKa dress designed by Bruce Oldfield of Ford was later sold in an auction during London Fashion Week to raise money for Barnados. Motorsport A Ford KA rally championship was created in 1998. It has proved to be one of the most popular junior rally championships (Ford Ka Rally Cup) in the UK and Ireland. In 2007, Luke Pinder won the BRC Silverstone Tyre 1400 Championship in a Chris Birkbeck Ford KA. =Ka Rally Car= Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) works at Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was designed as an entry-level vehicle to compete in a one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 with just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998, fifteen competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford's Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine mounts and suspension bushes are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium sump and fuel tank guards, OZ Rally wheels and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion gone are all but the essentials: the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply dished rally steering wheel, competition seats and harnesses are all supplied from the kit and replacements are not allowed. Second generation (2008–2016) Ford Ka second generation, rear view Ford Ka Individual Grand Prix In 2008, the European Ka was replaced with a model developed and produced for Ford by Fiat S.p.A in conjunction with Fiat's own 500 vehicle. The car is built in Fiat's Tychy, Poland, factory alongside the Fiat 500, Fiat Panda and Lancia Ypsilon. Based on the Fiat 500 architecture, its interior offers optional Bluetooth phone connection, wireless voice control, a USB port, a CD Radio, MP3, an AUX connector, steering wheel audio controls and a speaker system consisting of six speakers, a subwoofer and an amplifier. The new Ka comes with a choice of two engines, a 1.2-litre petrol with of power and of torque and a 1.3-litre TDCi diesel engine with of power and of torque. Both engines come with sub-120 g/km CO2 emissions (119 for the petrol and 112 for the diesel). Both engines are supplied from Fiat. The Ka featured shock absorption revised from the Fiat 500 along with a rear anti-roll bar enabling 30 percent softer springs and accordingly retuned dampers to improve ride performance over uneven road surfaces. Some of these improvements were subsequently adopted on Fiat 500 Abarth and Fiat 500C models. The Ka uses an electrically assisted steering system, which makes the steering much lighter and more energy efficient than its predecessor. The new Ka has an overall Euro NCAP safety rating of 4 stars, with standard driver and passenger single-stage front airbags, ABS, immobiliser, hazard warning lights and remote central locking (except Studio version in UK). In addition, there are front side airbags and curtain airbags and ESP (Electronic Stability Program) with HBA (Hydraulic Brake Assist) and HLA (Hill Launch Assist) that come at an extra cost. The new Ka made its debut in the 22nd James Bond film Quantum of Solace and was unveiled in October 2008's Paris Motor Show. In 2008, there was some speculation that the Ka might be introduced to the North American market. It has since been confirmed however that Ford consider the Ka too small for American tastes and will not be introducing the vehicle to this market. Ka Individual There are also three \\"Ford Individual packs\\" with special characteristics each (in both the interior and exterior design), called Tattoo, Grand Prix and Digital. Tattoo was replaced in 2011 by Metal. All Individual models are based on the Zetec. Third generation (2016–present) Ford Ka+ Developed by Ford Brazil, the Ford Ka Concept was unveiled in Brazil in November 2013. The production version of this new Ford Ka appeared in July 2014, in hatchback and sedan body styles, with the first units arriving in Brazil in September and October 2014 respectively. The next market where it was launched was India, where the sedan made its debut as the new Ford Figo Aspire in August 2015, with the hatchback arriving (as the new Ford Figo) a month later. It was launched in Europe (as the Ka+) in June 2016, with deliveries starting later that year. The '+' in the name shows the fact how Ford sees this as a budget B-segment car (such as the MG 3 or the Dacia Sandero), rather than an A-segment car (like the Volkswagen Up or the Hyundai i10). The new model is based on Ford's global B platform, sharing its underpinnings with the Fiesta supermini, and embodies Ford's Kinetic 2.0 design theme. The hatchback is a five-door only model and it is now longer than the previous model, with the wheelbase increased by . The four-door sedan has the same wheelbase as the hatchback, but two length variants: a longer one in Brazil (dubbed Ka+), measuring , and a shorter one exclusively in India (dubbed Aspire), measuring . In Brazil, it is offered with a choice of two petrol engines: a 1.0-litre three-cylinder, developing and , or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder, developing and . In India, the range consists of either a 1.2-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing and , a 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel, developing and , or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing and . The latter is paired with Ford's six-speed automatic PowerShift transmission, while for the rest a five-speed manual option is available. In Europe, the Ka+ comes with only one engine, a 1.2-litre unit, that comes with either , in the Studio or the Zetec trim levels, or , exclusively in the Zetec model.https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/KA%2B/FordKA%2B_TechSpec_EU.pdf It features equipment such as the Ford's MyKey, MyDock and SYNC systems, steering mounted controls, automatic climate control, power-fold mirrors, keyless entry, electronic stability control, cruise control (in Europe),http://www.ford.co.uk/Cars/ka-plus/features up to six airbags and high-strength steel body structure. In November 2015, a Ka+ model with two standard front airbags and standard ABS with EBD was tested by Latin NCAP and was awarded four stars out of five. It was considered that in the frontal impact the driver's head and chest received adequate protection, the passenger's head and chest received good protection, while the driver's and passenger's knee areas received marginal protection. The bodyshell was rated as stable and was capable of withstanding further loading. In March 2017, Euro NCAP released the results of the tests performed on the Ka+ and it scored three out of five stars.http://www.euroncap.com/en/press-media/press- releases/fiat-and-ford-fall-short-of-rivals-safety-ratings/ For the adult occupants it received a 73% rating, for the child occupant a 61% rating, for the pedestrian occupant a 57% rating and for the safety assist category a 29% rating.http://www.euroncap.com/en/results/ford/ka+/26314 The car's performance in the tests was rated as \\"mediocre\\", being criticized for lacking rear seatbelt pretensioners and load-limiters, poor chest protection in the full- width frontal crash test and the lack of autonomous braking technology. It was subsequently launched in Mexico in September 2015, and in South Africa one month later. In March 2016, it was also introduced in Argentina. The new Ka is produced at Ford's factories in Camaçari, Brazil (from where it is exported to Argentina) and in Sanand, Gujarat, India (from where it is exported to Mexico, South Africa and Europe). The Ka+ was discontinued in Europe in September 2019. Marketing in the Americas Over the years the Latin American Ka has become progressively different from the European Ka. The first divergence was in 2003, when the rear of the Latin American made Ka was significantly redesigned. This was followed by a more complete divergence from the European Ka in 2007, when the Latin American made Ka was relaunched with a completely new body over the original platform. With the launch of the second generation European Ka, with a new body and the new Fiat platform, the separation of the European and Latin American Kas was complete. They are now completely different cars. From the year 2000 to the present, the Latin American Ka has been powered by either a Zetec Rocam 1.6-litre petrol engine or a Zetec Rocam 1.0-litre petrol engine. Both are four-cylinder units. A total of 63,766 units were sold in Brazil in 2011, making it the 14th most sold car in Brazil that year. South America 2005 Ford Ka (Brazil) 2008 Ford Ka (Brazil) =1997–2001= From the 1997 launch, and until 2001, the Latin American Ka was substantially similar to the European Ka, differing only in levels of equipment and trim. The main differences from the European model were the very short gearing for the manual gearbox (the only transmission available) and the lack of soundproofing, which had been gradually removed annually since 2000 as a way to cut down costs, following the practice of other Brazilian car makers at the time. =2001–2007= In 2001, the Latin American Ka received a mid- cycle facelift which left it slightly different, externally, to the European model. The most noticeable difference was at the rear, where the number plate was moved from the bumper to the boot (trunk) lid, and the rear lights were made much taller. =2008–2014= Ford presented the new Brazilian Ka on December 14, 2007. Sales started in Brazil on January 2, 2008. The car was exported to other markets in Latin America. In comparison to the original Ka, this model has a longer rear overhang and a redesigned rear seat to accommodate a fifth passenger. With a length of 3835 mmm, it now fits in the subcompact car class. In 2011, Ford presented a mid-cycle facelifted version following the Kinect concept car. In Brazil, only the Sport version offers a 1.6-litre engine. In 2008, with the launch of the new European Ka based on the Fiat platform, the two lines of the Ka finally became completely separate. =2014–present= Ford Figo Aspire The new Ford Ka was introduced in the 2014 São Paulo Motor Show, becoming available on the market in August of that year and presented at the 2015 Buenos Aires Motor Show. The Ford Ka adopts the \\"Kinetic\\" design, presenting a more aggressive style and it is slightly bigger than the previous model, adopting a 5-door body, occupying the site of the former Ford Ka and Ford Fiesta One. Also adds a new body variant 4-door sedan, called Ka+. The new Ford Ka offers two engines: a 1.0-liter, in-line 3-cylinder, 12-valve with TiVCT technology (producing up to 85 advertised HP) and the 1.5-liter in-line 4-cylinder 16-valve featured in the more basic versions of the Fiesta (producing up to 110 advertised HP); gearbox options are limited to the well known 5-speed IB5+ for both the 1000cc and the 1500cc variants. According to local press, the current 1.0 L version of the new 2014 Ka is the most economical compact car without a turbocharged engine (which title would be help by the VW up! 1.0 L TSI), achieving up to 12 kilometres inside the city of São Paulo with only one litre of E100 (ethanol fuel). E33 fuel (Brazilian standard gasoline spec) economy facts have not been publicized as of yet, although owners claim it does about 1 km/L to 2.5 km/L more than with E100. Its Sigma 1.5 L-equipped version has been well received by the Brazilian market due to its relatively vigorous launches and good torque in low and mid-range revs. Mexico In January 2008, it was announced that the new Brazilian Ka would not be offered in the Mexican market. This meant it was officially discontinued. In 2015, Brazilian Ka third generation was introduced as Ford Figo. Controversy In 2004, two commercials advertising the Ford SportKa in the UK proved controversial when they received complaints for their content. The first commercial included a parked SportKa as a pigeon flies toward it, presumably to befoul it. When the pigeon is within range the SportKa violently pops its hood, bashing the bird to its death. The second advertisement saw the SportKa opening its sunroof as if enticing a nearby cat to peer in. When the cat climbed on the roof and peeked inside, the sunroof closed and beheaded the cat. Both commercials concluded with the graphic, \\"Ford SportKa. The Ka's evil twin.\\" After many complaints, these advertisements were removed from air and not shown again.

It included the snake, the demon and the dragon which represented the challenges that Jesus Christ had to defeat. Gigantes Gigantes of Pamplona, Spain The Giants of Lleida, Spain The giants are usually hollow figures several meters tall, with a painted paper maché head and arms, the rest of the body being covered in cloth and other clothing. Their frame is usually made of wood or aluminum, with carton-pierre—a mixture of papier-mâché and plaster of paris— used to make the head and hands. The frame of the body is hidden by cloth, and the arms typically have no structural element to allow them to swing in the air when the giant is turned. Within the frame is an individual controlling the giant. He carries a harness on his shoulder that is linked to the internal structure, and will move and shake the giant in a dance, usually accompanied by a local marching band. Typically, these dances will include at least two giants, the male gigante and the female giantess, called giganta or gigantona, though some towns have multiple couples. The figures usually depict archetypes of the town, such as the bourgeois and the peasant woman, or historical figures of local relevance, such as a founding king and queen, or pairs of Moorish and Christian nobles.

He did not win, but placed third behind incumbent Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, with roughly 14% of the vote nation-wide. Lebed later served as the Secretary of the Security Council in the Yeltsin administration, and eventually became the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, the second largest Russian region. He served four years in the latter position, until his death following a Mi-8 helicopter crash. He participated in most of Russia's military conflicts in the final decade of the Soviet Union, including the Soviet–Afghan War. From 1988 until 1991, General Lebed served as the commander of the 106th Guards Airborne Division, and later became the deputy head of the Russian Airborne Troops. The general also played a key role in ending the military phase of the conflict in Moldova between Transnistrian separatists and the Moldovan government in 1992, as the commander of the Russian 14th Army. Popular among the army, when he resigned his commission in 1995 to enter politics. Lebed was also regarded as being charismatic by the public, in contrast to other Russian politicians in the 1990s, with polls showing his popularity being ahead of Yeltsin's for some time. As the Secretary of the Security Council in the president's administration after the 1996 election he also led the negotiations that ended the First Chechen War. Although Lebed was compared by some Western and Russian analysts to Augusto Pinochet and Napoleon Bonaparte, he was considered to be the most popular candidate for the presidential election of 2000 during the second term of President Yeltsin. After getting elected as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai in 1998, however, he decided to stay in that position and did not run for president, despite calls for him to do so. General Lebed held the position until his death in the 2002 helicopter crash. Early life and service Alexander Lebed was born in the Cossack town of Novocherkassk, in the Rostov Oblast, in 1950. In his youth he was not a bad student but preferred boxing and chess.Specter, Michael (13 October 1996). THE WARS OF ALEKSANDR IVANOVICH LEBED. The New York Times. Retrieved 2 September 2017. He grew up in poverty. His father was a carpenter who was sentenced to seven years in a Gulag labor camp for arriving late to work twice, and witnessed the Novocherkassk massacre in 1962. During that time he worked at a factory.Traynor, Ian (28 April 2002). General Alexander Lebed. The Guardian. Retrieved 2 September 2017. He was determined to become a paratrooper and joined the Ryazan Guards Higher Airborne Command School in 1969, becoming a cadet platoon and company commander while he was there. In 1982, as an officer of the Soviet Airborne Troops, Lebed became a battalion commander in Afghanistan during the Soviet war there. During his time in Afghanistan, Lebed became popular with the troops under his command. He held this position until 1982 at which point he attended the Frunze Military Academy.Alexander Lebed.

Among his duties was being a member of the funeral department during the period of many deaths among the Soviet gerontocracy, including three Soviet rulers. In 1988, Lebed became the commander of the 106th Guards Airborne Division. He and his troops took part in the suppression of uprisings throughout the Soviet Caucasus, in Georgia (1989) and Azerbaijan (1990), in which he refused to use brutality to put down the protestors. By 1991, Lebed held the rank of major general and became second in command of the Airborne Troops. During the 1991 coup d'état attempt by Soviet hardliners against the new Russian government, he gained fame by refusing to follow orders to lead his forces against Boris Yeltsin at the Russian White House, contributing to the coup's collapse.Biography of Alexander Lebed. Central Connecticut State University. Retrieved 2 September 2017. It was also during that time that Lebed became a rival of General Pavel Grachev, Airborne Troops commander and future Russian Minister of Defense, due to what Lebed viewed to be his misguided military reforms. Grachev would thus become his main rival.Cornwall, Rupert (25 September 2012). Pavel Grachev: General and politician who came unstuck in Chechnya. The Independent. Retrieved 2 September 2017.

There, in the conflict between Russian and Romanian factions, he intervened and used his position to broker a peace agreement, also providing protection to ethnic Russians. Despite this, Lebed remained hostile to the separatist leadership, which he perceived as corrupt and stated that he was \\"sick and tired of guarding the sleep and safety of crooks.\\" Nonetheless, he remained against President Boris Yeltsin's decision to withdraw most of the 14th Army from Moldova, as he feared it would bring back chaos to the region.Barber, Tony (16 August 1994).

Entry into politics After catching public attention with his actions in Moldova in 1992, the general came to be perceived as being an honest, antiestablishment patriot who stood against government corruption and wanted to restore order. Lebed was not necessarily in favor of democracy and had a mixed opinion of it, but did praise both Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet—saying that Pinochet was able to revive Chile by \\"putting the army in first place\\" because \\"preserving the army is the basis for preserving the government\\"—and the French leader Charles de Gaulle.

Lebed's style and personal charisma were considered to have been more important to his campaign than his political message itself. Up through May, Lebed flirted with the possibility of forming third force coalition with other candidates, however negotiations for this failed.

They signed agreements in the town of Khasavyurt in Dagestan which ended the First Chechen War in late August 1996.

Yeltsin stated that he was \\"acting without proper authority\\" and Chernomyrdin accused General Lebed of \\"Bonapartism\\", while Kulikov even claimed Lebed was plotting a coup.Lebed Dismissed But Not Tamed.

Chubais was also worried about the potential of Lebed becoming Yeltsin's successor, as he was the most popular member of the administration, especially after ending the Chechen war. After Chernomyrdin and Kulikov made their accusations, it caused a scandal that led to the President firing Lebed as national security chief. The general nonetheless decided to remain in politics. After his firing, there was some indication that General Lebed intended to run for the presidency again in the 2000 Russian presidential election. His visit to the United States in January 1997 was viewed as an effort to win over American business interests as the best successor to Yeltsin, and included a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower. Reportedly, he discussed potential construction projects in Moscow that Trump could be involved in. \\"He invited me to Russia and I accepted, I thought he was terrific,\\" Trump said after the meeting. One Western analyst stated about Lebed, \\"He may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Bill Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages.\\" He also visited President Clinton's inauguration while he was there, at the invitation of Senator William Roth, who made the request at the behest of an unknown businessman.

In a book published in 1925, Hohmann demonstrated a fuel-efficient path to move a spacecraft between two different orbits, now called a Hohmann transfer orbit. He received his Ph.D. from the RWTH Aachen University in 1920.  Biography  Hohmann was born in Hardheim, the son of a doctor. As a boy, he lived with his family in Port Elizabeth, South Africa for a time, before returning to Germany. He studied civil engineering at the Technical University of Munich, graduating in 1904. He then worked for the municipal councils of Vienna, Hanover and Breslau (now Wrocław) before settling in Essen, where he eventually held the post of chief architect. Hohmann became interested in space as a young boy when his father would show him the southern constellations. As soon as he read the science fiction works of French author Jules Verne and German author Kurd Lasswitz, he started to wonder, \\"How do you get up there?\\" Between 1911 and 1912, while Hohmann was working as an engineer in Breslau, his older cousin sent him some astronomy textbooks. Hohmann soon began to fill up most of his free time with the study of astronomy, and started seriously considering the problem of interplanetary spaceflight. Eventually, Hohmann realized that minimizing the amount of fuel that the spacecraft had to carry would be an important consideration, and he plotted a variety of orbits until he found the one that now bears his name. He published his findings in Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper (The Attainability of the Celestial Bodies).Walter Hohmann, Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper (München, Germany: R. Oldenbourg, 1925). The importance of this work saw Hohmann become a leading figure in Germany's amateur rocketry movement in the late 1920s, the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR — \\"Spaceflight Society\\"). Writer Willy Ley asked Hohmann to contribute to an anthology of papers on spaceflight, \\"Die Möglichkeit der Weltraumfahrt\\" (The Possibility of Space Travel), published in 1928. Hohmann contributed a post about \\"Fahrtrouten, Fahrzeiten und Landungsmöglichkeiten\\" (Routes, Timetables, and Landing Options) where he proposed using a separable landing module to travel to the Moon, an idea that was later utilized in the Apollo lunar missions. Following the rise to power of the Nazi party, Hohmann distanced himself as much as possible from rocketry, wishing to play no part in the development of the rocket as a weapon. He died in an Essen hospital shortly before the end of World War II as a result of stress experienced during the intense Allied bombing of the city.  Walter-Hohmann-Observatory  Commemorative plaque at the Walter-Hohmann-Observatory In 2009 the Walter-Hohmann-Observatory in Essen, Germany installed a Commemorative plaque at their ground: Walter Hohmann was born as the son of a doctor and visited the high-school in Würzburg (Germany), where he graduated In 1900. He studied engineering at the technical university in Munich (Germany) and worked from 1904 as an engineer for structural analysis in Vienna (Austria), Berlin (Germany), Hanover (Germany) and Wroclaw (Germany). From 1912 he worked as a city planner and director of the static building office and the department of materials testing of the city of Essen (Germany). Here he died in a hospital on 11.03.1945, shortly before the war ended. His honorary grave is located at the cemetery at \\"Meisenburgstraße\\" in the city of Essen (Germany). In his spare time he devoted himself to celestial mechanics calculations, and in 1920 he published his book \\"Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper\\" (The Attainability of the Celestial Bodies). He developed basic principles and created advanced tools necessary for the conquest of space. His ideas were taken up for the Apollo program and the Voyager spacecraft (for example). Today he is considered a pioneer of space travel. In recognition of his scientific achievements, a lunar crater was named after him in 1970. The Astronomical Association of Essen (Germany) gave itself the name \\"Walter-Hohmann-Observatory\\" in 1971. Also asteroid 9661 Hohmann is named after him.

This compatibility layer enables many Windows-based applications to run on Linux operating systems, macOS, or Chrome OS. CrossOver is developed by CodeWeavers and based on Wine, an open-source Windows compatibility layer. CodeWeavers modifies the Wine source code, applies compatibility patches, adds configuration tools that are more user-friendly, automated installation scripts, and provides technical support. All changes made to the Wine source code are covered by the LGPL and publicly available. CodeWeavers maintains an online database listing how well various Windows applications perform under CrossOver. Versions=CrossOver Linux CrossOver Linux is the original version of CrossOver. It aims to properly integrate with the GNOME and KDE desktop environments so that Windows applications will run seamlessly on Linux distributions. Prior to version 6 it was called CrossOver Office. CrossOver Linux was originally offered in Standard and Professional editions. CrossOver Linux Standard was designed for a single user account on a single machine. CrossOver Linux Professional provided enhanced deployment and management features for corporate users, as well as multiple user accounts per machine. With the release of CrossOver Linux 11 in 2012 these different editions have all merged into a single CrossOver Linux product. CrossOver Mac In 2005 Apple announced a transition from PowerPC to Intel processors in their computers, which allowed CodeWeavers to develop a Mac OS X version of CrossOver Office called 'CrossOver Mac' CrossOver Mac was released on January 10, 2007. With the release of CrossOver Mac 7 on June 17, 2008, CrossOver Mac was divided into Standard and Pro editions like CrossOver Linux. The Standard version included six months of support and upgrades, while the Pro version included one year of support and upgrades, along with a free copy of CrossOver Games. With the release of CrossOver Mac 11 in 2012 these different editions were all merged into a single CrossOver Mac product. In 2019, macOS went 64-bit only and eliminated 32-bit compatible libraries. In December 2019 Codeweavers released CrossOver 19, providing support for 32 bit Windows applications on an operating system with no 32 bit libraries solving this problem. Discontinued products A standard copy of CrossOver now includes the functionality of CrossOver Games, CrossOver Standard, and CrossOver Professional editions. These older individual versions of Crossover have since been retired. CrossOver Games, announced on 10 March 2008, was a product intended to let users play a broad range of games by providing current Wine patches. The expectation was that it would update on a weekly to monthly schedule in order to incorporate the latest Wine programming work being accepted. In contrast the general CrossOver Office product focused more on stability and productivity software, and had a much slower beta and release schedule. CrossOver Games wasn't able to release updates with enough frequency to justify its separate production track and was discontinued in 2012. It was merged back into a unified CrossOver product. CrossOver Server was a specialized version of CrossOver Linux which allowed Windows applications to run on thin-client systems. It was discontinued in 2007 as many of its features were present in the CrossOver Linux Pro edition. Software giveaway On October 28, 2008 as the result of the Lame Duck Challenge, Codeweavers gave all of their products away for free.

Originally developed in 1959 for the Ford Anglia, it is an in-line four-cylinder pushrod engine with a cast-iron cylinder head and block. The Kent family can be divided into three basic sub-families; the original pre-Crossflow Kent, the Crossflow (the most prolific of all versions of the Kent), and the transverse mounted Valencia variants. The arrival of the Duratec-E engine in the fifth generation Fiesta range in 2002 signalled the end of the engine's use in production vehicles after a 44-year career, although the Valencia derivative remained in limited production in Brazil, as an industrial use engine by Ford's Power Products division, where it is known as the VSG-411 and VSG-413. Since 2010, it has been actively produced in the United States factories for Formula Ford globally because of its popularity in motorsport. The name This series of engines became known as the Kent engine because Alan Worters, the company's Executive Engineer (Power Units), lived across the river from Ford's Dagenham plant in the English county of Kent. Originally within Ford, it is said that the Kent name was actually born with the A711 and A711M blocks (commonly called the 711M block) with square main bearing caps for the Crossflow series, which represented a vast improvement in the durability of the engines. However, the name caught on to be used outside the company to include pre-711M engines as well. Pre-Crossflow The original OHV three main bearing Kent engine appeared in the 1959 Anglia with a capacity of developing at 5,000 rpm – unusually high for the time. With a bore and stroke, combined with independent (non-siamesed) four intake and four exhaust ports, it was a departure from traditional undersquare English engine design. The same engine, with its bore unchanged, but with longer stroke and thus larger capacities were subsequently used in the Ford Consul Classic () and Consul Capri ( - the latter with five main bearings), the Mk1 and early Mk2 Cortinas ( stroke stroke five main bearing ), and the early Corsairs. In addition to its 'over-square' cylinder dimensions, a further unusual feature of the Kent engine at its introduction was an externally mounted combined oil filter/pump unit designed to facilitate low-cost production and easy maintenance. The engine is now referred to as the pre-crossflow Kent, in reverse-flow cylinder head configuration with both the inlet and exhaust being on the same side of the head. Applications: * Ford Anglia * Ford Cortina * Ford Consul Classic and Consul Capri. * Ford Corsair * 107E Ford Prefect * Autocars Sussita * Marcos 1500 GT * Otosan Anadol 1.2 L – 1.3 L (1966–1984) * TVR Grantura The Pre- Crossflow Kent engine was also used by Lotus on Lotus Mk.VII. Crossflow A 1.6 litre Kent Crossflow (711M block) in an Anadol FW11 prototype A 1967 redesign gave it a cross-flow type cylinder head, hence the Kent's alternative name Ford Crossflow. It would go on to power the smaller-engined versions of the Ford Cortina and Ford Capri, the first and second editions of the European Escort as well as the North American Ford Pinto (1971, 1972 and 1973 only). In South Africa it also powered the 1.6 L Mk II, Mk III, Mk IV, & Mk V Ford Cortina and 1.6 L Ford Sierra. The Crossflow featured a change in combustion chamber design, using a Heron type combustion chamber in the top of the piston rather than in the head. The head itself was flat with each engine capacity () featuring different pistons with different sized bowls in 681F and 711M blocks. The 691M block had the stronger 'square' bearing caps later used in the 711M, and small combustion chambers in the near-flat head (the bulk of the volume being in the piston bowl). In 1970, the new A711 block for and A711M block for were introduced with thicker block wall, square main bearing caps, large diameter cam followers and wider cam lobes, with the latter block having a 7/16\\" taller deck height, together with a return to the flat head. These changes represented a significant improvement in the reliability of the engines, and the blocks are commonly referred to as '711M' blocks. The Ford Crossflow engine () also powered the Reliant Anadol (1968–1984). Other makes such as Morgan used the Crossflow on Morgan 4/4, Caterham on Caterham 7, and TVR used the engine in the Grantura, Vixen, and 1600M. It has been fitted in countless other applications as well, being a favourite of kit-car builders not only in Great Britain. Destined for the American market, beginning with the 1977 model year, the Valencia plant began manufacturing a 1.6L, , five- main bearing version that included a low emission bowl-in-pistons combustion chamber design based on the Crossflow head, and was equipped with a Dura-Spark electronic ignition. This version was used in the short-lived (1977–1980) USA- market Mk1 Fiesta. This engine would be later used in the XR2 version of the Mk.1 Fiesta, using the US 1600 bottom end and GT spec head and cam. 1.3L versions of the Mk I Fiesta also used the Crossflow, as opposed to the Valencia (see below). Valencia A redesigned version of the Kent engine was conceived to suit transverse installation in 1976, primarily for the Mk1 Ford Fiesta, although entry level versions of the Escort Mk3 also used the engine. This derivative would go through two major revamps in 1988 and 1995 and would be a mainstay of Ford's entry level compact range for nearly 25 years. Original Valencia (1976–1988) Mk1 Fiesta The Valencia was initially available in (in both high compression and low compression versions ) and a high compression version. For adapting the Kent Crossflow for front wheel drive the ancillaries were repositioned, and the cylinder block shortened by . This decision was taken in order for the engine to fit transversely across the Fiesta engine bay, whilst still allowing the transmission unit to be comfortably removed for clutch replacement. This difference however means that very few parts of the Valencia engine are interchangeable with a Crossflow. However, Ford ended up installing the Crossflow engine into the Fiesta anyway, when the market demanded a 1.3L capacity, and later a 1.6L version for the North American market models – ultimately the 1.6L Crossflow also was used in the Mk1 Fiesta XR2 when the North American market Fiesta ceased production in 1980. In addition to these changes, the Valencia featured a new transmission flange to suit the BC4/5 transaxle and the cylinder head redesigned using flat-top pistons and the traditional combustion chamber in the head. Ford officially regarded the Valencia as a completely new engine despite being derived from the existing Kent/Crossflow family and initially dubbed it as the \\"L-Series\\" engine, however it became better known as the Valencia to the wider world, after the new Spanish factory built for its manufacture, but eventually the name was officially adopted by Ford as well – although in sales literature it was always called simply OHV. It was available in versions. A five bearing version of the Valencia became available in 1986 for the facelift \\"Erika-86\\" version of the Escort and Orion, replacing the similarly sized CVH unit, which increased to for higher specification models. The cylinder heads and pistons were modified in 1986 for unleaded fuel and the cams changed to meet the new European emissions standards along with the addition of electronic ignition. HCS (1988–1996) In 1988 the second generation of the Valencia unit was launched to meet with tightening European emissions legislation. The redesign included an all-new cylinder head with reshaped combustion chambers and inlet ports, and a fully electronic distributorless ignition system. The engine was renamed the Ford HCS (standing for High Compression Swirl), although some internal Ford service publications call it the Valencia-HCS in reference to its heritage. This engine used a much leaner fuel-to-air mix than a typical engine, at a 1:19 ratio.Mastrostefano (Ed.), p. 203 In addition to lowered emissions, Ford claimed that fuel economy increased by 11 to 18 percent while power was up from 5 to 8 percent, depending on the model. It first appeared in guises on the Ford Escort and Orion for the 1989 model year, and on the then- new Ford Fiesta Mark III the same year, which also offered a smaller version to replace the older Valencia. The HCS is distinguishable from the original Valencia by the \\"mirrored\\" arrangement of the spark plugs (they appear to \\"point inward\\" towards each other), the block, head and rocker cover being painted gray (the original Valencia was painted black), the presence of a crankshaft position sensor just above the starter motor, and the absence of a distributor drive on the rear face of the cylinder block. Endura-E (1995–2002) The final redesign came in 1995, with the launch of the fourth- generation Ford Fiesta. This edition was effectively another redesign of the Valencia/HCS derivative, known as the Endura-E, and featured many revisions to combat noise and harshness, including a thickened cylinder block. This engine would also be used in the Ka until 2002 where it was replaced by the Duratec and the 1.3 Escort until 2002. This type of engine still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said to come from the cams due to incorrect valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled. Despite Ford's engines being well regarded for their ease of service, the Endura-E has a very awkward placing for its oil filter, at the back of the engine and facing from left to right rather than pointing downwards or out, this being a leftover from the original Kent which was normally mounted longitudinally for rear- wheel drive. This mounting position makes it very difficult to access from underneath the car (without a mechanic's ramp), and despite being very short, the can-type oil filter still manages to protrude past the tip of the adjacent starter motor, meaning it is very difficult to remove using chain-type grips. Endura-E engine specs (Ka): 998CC: Power output - 53HP (5250RPM) Torque - 77.2 N/m (4000RPM) Bore - 68.68mm Stroke - 67.40mm Redline - 5450RPM RPM Limit - 5675RPM Compression Ratio: 9.2:1 \\\\---------------------------------- 1297CC: Power output - 60HP (5000RPM) Torque - 104.0 N/m (3500RPM) Bore - 73.94mm Stroke - 75.5mm Redline - 5450RPM RPM Limit - 5675RPM Compression Ratio: 8.8:1 Motorsport Ford Kent engines had a profound influence on motorsport, possibly more so than any other mass-produced engines did in the history of motorsport. The Satta/Hruska designed Alfa Romeo 750/101 DOHC engine, and the Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau designed SOHC BMW M118 engine may have had similar influence on the motorsport scenes in Italy and Germany respectively, but not internationally. Lotus used Ford Kent engines on Lotus Mk.VII to establish its corporate foundation, and subsequently used most of the Cosworth early racing engines for the legendary success in motorsport. Lotus also built the successful Lotus TwinCam engine for Lotus Elan on the Kent block, crank and conrods. Cosworth's initial products were all Ford Kent based, and the later SCA, FVA and the BD series used Kent blocks to dominate many FIA categories including Formula 2 and Formula 3. In addition, many respected racing engine builder/tuners, such as Holbay, Vegantune, Novamotor, Brian Hart, Richardson and Wilcox owe their foundations to the Ford Kent-based engines. Furthermore, the Kent Crossflow engine was used as the regulation engine in Formula Ford, although it was originally proposed to be the pre- crossflow 1498 cc Cortina GT unit in 1967 (before the establishment of the series). In Europe, Formula Ford switched to the Zetec, but American Formula Ford continued to be Kent-powered until 2010; the SCCA having approved the use of the Honda L15A i-VTEC for Formula F. As it was nearly impossible to succeed in motorsport without some activities in Formula 2, 3 or Formula Ford, most of the well-known racing drivers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s owe their careers to Ford Kent to some extent, and the current historic motor racing depends heavily on the Kent-based engines. On 16 October 2009, Ford announced that it would be putting the Kent block back into production in order to supply the historic racing community and active Formula Ford series that use the Kent engine with spares. According to a Ford press-release, engineering work began at Ford Racing's Performance Parts division in the US, with sales scheduled to start in 2010. This coincided with a Sports Car Club of America rule change allowing the Honda L15A7 engine to be used in Formula Ford events in that country, which uses the Ford Kent engine (SCCA does not sanction Duratec or Ecoboost classes). Link to Kent block in Ford Motorsports Parts online catalog The 1300 cc was the engine of choice for BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars until a rule change about carburettors pushed people towards the 2000 cc Ford Pinto engine. Harry Mundy designed the Lotus TwinCam engine for Colin Chapman, who needed the replacement for the Coventry Climax FWE engine used in Lotus Elite. As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam was carried out by Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE. Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same valve clearance adjustment shims with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production.

Although many small edible bivalves are loosely called cockles, true cockles are species in the family Cardiidae. True cockles live in sandy, sheltered beaches throughout the world. The distinctive rounded shells are bilaterally symmetrical, and are heart- shaped when viewed from the end. Numerous radial, evenly spaced ribs are a feature of the shell in most but not all genera (for an exception, see the genus Laevicardium, the egg cockles, which have very smooth shells). The shell of a cockle is able to close completely (i.e., there is no \\"gape\\" at any point around the edge). Though the shell of a cockle may superficially resemble that of a scallop because of the ribs, cockles can be distinguished from scallops morphologically in that cockle shells lack \\"auricles\\" (triangular ear-shaped protrusions near the hinge line) and scallop shells lack a pallial sinus. Behaviorally, cockles live buried in sediment, whereas scallops either are free-living and will swim into the water column to avoid a predator, or in some cases live attached by a byssus to a substrate. The mantle has three apertures (inhalant, exhalant, and pedal) for siphoning water and for the foot to protrude. Cockles typically burrow using the foot, and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water. Cockles are capable of \\"jumping\\" by bending and straightening the foot. As is the case in many bivalves, cockles display gonochorism (the sex of an individual varies according to conditions), and some species reach maturity rapidly. The common name \\"cockle\\" is also given by seafood sellers to a number of other small, edible marine bivalves which have a somewhat similar shape and sculpture, but are in other families such as the Veneridae (Venus clams) and the ark clams (Arcidae). Cockles in the family Cardiidae are sometimes referred to as \\"true cockles\\" to distinguish them from these other species. Species There are more than 205 living species of cockles, with many more fossil forms. The common cockle, Cerastoderma edule, is widely distributed around the coastlines of Northern Europe, with a range extending west to Ireland, the Barents Sea in the north, Norway in the east, and as far south as Senegal. The dog cockle, Glycymeris glycymeris, has a similar range and habitat to the common cockle, but is not at all closely related, being in the family Glycymerididae. The dog cockle is edible, but due to its toughness when cooked it is generally not eaten, although a process is being developed to solve this problem. The blood cockle, Tegillarca granosa (not related to the true cockles, instead in the ark clam family, Arcidae) is extensively cultured from southern Korea to Malaysia. Genera Genera within the family Cardiidae include: * Acanthocardia * Acrosterigma Dall, 1900 * Americardia * Cardium * Cerastoderma * Clinocardium * Corculum * Ctenocardia * Dinocardium * Discors * Fragum * Fulvia * Hypanis Pander in Menetries, 1832 * Laevicardium * Lophocardiium * Lunulicardia * Lyrocardium * Microcardium * Nemocardium * Papyridea * Parvicardium * Plagiocardium * Pratulum * Ringicardium * Serripes * Trachycardium * Tridacna, the \\"giant clams\\" * Trigoniocardia * Vasticardium Iredale, 1927 File:Acrosterigma cignorum 003.jpg File:Ctenocardia fornicata 002.jpg File:Ctenocardia virgo 003.jpg File:Trachycardium maculosum 002.jpg File:Fossil Shells in Cardium Formation.jpgFossil Cardiidae shells (Late Cretaceous, Alberta, Canada). File:Vasticardium berschaueri 001.jpgVasticardium berschaueri In cuisine and culture Cockles are a popular type of edible shellfish in both Eastern and Western cooking. They are collected by raking them from the sands at low tide. However, collecting cockles is hard work and, as seen from the Morecambe Bay disaster, in which 23 people died, can be dangerous if local tidal conditions are not carefully watched. In England and Wales, people are permitted to collect 5 kg of cockles for personal use. However, pickers wishing to collect more than this are deemed to be engaging in commercial fishing and are required to obtain a permit from the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority. Cockles are a street food in Cambodia. Cockles are sold freshly cooked as a snack in the United Kingdom, particularly in those parts of the British coastline where cockles are abundant. Boiled, then seasoned with malt vinegar and white pepper, they can be bought from seafood stalls, which also often have for sale mussels, whelks, jellied eels, crabs and shrimp. Cockles are also available pickled in jars, and more recently, have been sold in sealed packets (with vinegar) containing a plastic two-pronged fork. A meal of cockles fried with bacon, served with laverbread, is known as a traditional Welsh breakfast. Boiled cockles (sometimes grilled) are sold at many hawker centers in Southeast Asia, and are used in laksa, char kway teow and steamboat. They are called kerang in Malay and see hum in Cantonese. In Japan, the Japanese egg cockle (Laevicardium laevigatum) is used to create torigai sushi. A study conducted in England in the early 1980s showed a correlation between the consumption of cockles, presumed to be incorrectly processed, and an elevated local occurrence of hepatitis. Cockles are an effective bait for a wide variety of sea fishes. The folk song \\"Molly Malone\\" is also known as \\"Cockles and Mussels\\" because the title character's sale of the two foods is referred to in the song's refrain. The shells of cockles are mentioned in the English nursery rhyme \\"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\\". Cockles are also eaten by the indigenous peoples of North America.Great Blue Heron - Robert William Butler, Robert Butler - Google Books File:cockle.jpgEmpty cockle shell on the beach File:morecambe-bay-cockle-picking.jpgBags of cockles picked from Morecambe Bay File:Cockles.JPGThese boiled \\"cockles\\" in Tanjong Pagar, Singapore, are actually ark clams in the family Arcidae Alternative meanings The common English phrase \\"it warms the cockles of my heart\\", is used to mean that a feeling of deep-seated contentment has been generated. Differing derivations of this phrase have been proposed, either directly from the perceived heart- shape of a cockleshell, or indirectly (the scientific name for the type genus of the family is Cardium, from the Latin for heart), or from the Latin diminutive of the word heart, corculum. Another proposed derivation is from the Latin for the ventricles of the heart, cochleae cordis, where the second word is an inflected form of cor, heart, while cochlea is the Latin for snail.

Brian William Bransom Griffiths (20 August 1948 – 13 September 2007), known as Bill Griffiths, was a poet and Anglo-Saxon scholar associated with the British Poetry Revival. Overview Griffiths was born in Kingsbury, Middlesex, England. As a teenager, he became a Hells Angel; his experiences with bikers provided material for many early poems. From 1971, these poems were published in Poetry Review, under the editorship of Eric Mottram, and by Bob Cobbing's Writers Forum. He also collaborated on a number of performance poetry pieces with Cobbing and others. Griffiths soon started his own imprint, Pirate Press, which published work by himself and other like-minded poets. In addition to Cobbing and other Writers Forum poets, Griffiths listed his early influences as Michael McClure, Muriel Rukeyser, John Keats, George Crabbe, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Old English poetry. In 1987, he obtained a Ph.D. in Old English from King's College London. He published a number of editions and translations of Old English texts and authored Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic. Griffiths was a prolific poet who published widely in Britain and the United States. In later years he lived in Seaham, County Durham, and ran Amra Press, which published his poetry and books of local studies. Griffiths' books of poetry from other publishers include Rousseau and the Wicked (Invisible Books, London, 1996), Etruscan Reader 5 (with Tom Raworth and Tom Leonard) (Etruscan Books, Buckfastleigh, 1997), Nomad Sense (Talus Editions, London, 1998), A Book of Spilt Cities (Etruscan Books, 1999), Ushabtis (Talus, 2001) and Durham and other sequences (West House Books, 2002). A substantial collection of his work was also published in Future Exiles (Paladin 1992). In 2010, Reality Street released Collected Earlier Poems (1966 – 80). Life, work, and scholarship Beginning 1996 and up until his death, Griffiths worked with Bill Lancaster at the Centre for Northern Studies at Northumbria University, Newcastle. He became a highly active assistant editor to Lancaster's Northern Review, a Journal of Regional and Cultural Affairs, which lasted ten years. This was a remarkably productive period for Griffiths which saw the publishing of a series of books on north east dialect, beginning with North East Dialect, Survey and Word list and \\"North East Dialect, the Texts\\" in 1998. Published by the Centre for Northern Studies, these ran to several editions before culminating with A Dictionary of North East Dialect by Northumbria University Press in 2004. The Dictionary attracted national attention and was hailed as a landmark in the history of English dialects. Griffiths was able to draw upon his vast scholarship of Saxon literature and Old English, providing sophisticated etymologies that drew upon sources as far back as the eighth century. The centre was awarded a major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2005 to continue dialect research which facilitated the publication by Northumbria University Press of three more volumes of dialect studies: Stotties and Spicecake, the Story of North East Cooking, Pitmatic: the talk of the North East Coalfield (a volume that was featured heavily in the media and is credited with capturing for posterity the rapidly disappearing yet distinctive dialect of the northern coalfields), and 'Fishing and Folk: Life and Dialect on the North Sea Coast', this last published posthumously in 2008. Griffiths was working with Bill Lancaster at the time of his death to secure funding for another dialect project on children's games and pastimes. In 2003, the centre was commissioned by Sage/Music North to catalogue the archive of Northern Sinfonia and produce a history of the orchestra for the opening of the Sage music centre. A highly skilled archivist and talented classical musician, Griffiths was considered the ideal person to do this work which was completed ahead of schedule. Subsequently, Northern Sinfonia, a Magic of its Own, was published in 2004. His last work at the centre was the cataloguing of the T. Dan Smith archive of taped recordings. Of tangential interest to these projects, it could be noted that Griffiths organised an exhibition in his adopted home of Seaham which was seen by the Queen on her Golden Jubilee Tour and he published numerous small books and pamphlets dealing with his adopted community.

Early life An infant at the death of his father, Edmund, as a ward of the crown, was placed by Edward III of England under the care of William of Wykeham and Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The position of the young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary influence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important by his marriage on 24 August 1369 at the age of 17 to the 14-year-old Philippa, the only child of the late Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the second son of Edward III. Lionel's late wife, Elizabeth, had been daughter and heiress of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and Lionel had himself been created Earl of Ulster before his marriage. Edmund inherited the title Earl of Ulster on Lionel's death. Therefore, the Earl of March not only represented one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in right of his wife Philippa, but Philippa's line was also the second most senior line of descent in the succession to the crown, after Edward, the Black Prince and his son, King Richard II of England. John of Gaunt, younger brother of Prince Edward, had become the 1st Duke of Lancaster and thus the source of the House of Lancaster's claim to the throne. This marriage had, therefore, far-reaching consequences in English history, ultimately giving rise to the claim of the House of York to the crown of England contested in the Wars of the Roses between the Yorks and the Lancasters; Edward IV being descended from the second adult son of Edward III as great-great-grandson of Philippa, countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund of Langley, the first Duke of York and the fourth adult son of Edward III. Edmund Mortimer's son Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March would become heir presumptive to the English crown during the reign of Richard II. Political advancement Mortimer, now styled Earl of March and Ulster, became Marshal of England in 1369, and was employed in various diplomatic missions during the next following years. He was a member of the committee appointed by the Peers to confer with the Commons in 1373the first instance of such a joint conference since the institution of representative parliaments on the question of granting supplies for John of Gaunt's war in France. He participated in the opposition to Edward III and the court party, which grew in strength towards the end of the reign, taking the popular side and being prominent in the Good Parliament of 1376 among the lords who supported the Prince of Wales and opposed the Court Party and John of Gaunt. The Speaker of the House of Commons in this parliament was March's steward, Peter de la Mare, (1294-1387 of Little Hereford, Hereford), who firmly withstood John of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting the impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring the banishment of the king's mistress, Alice Perrers. March was a member of the administrative council appointed by the same parliament after the death of Edward, the Black Prince to attend the king and advise him in all public affairs. Following the end of the Good Parliament its acts were reversed by John of Gaunt, March's steward was jailed, and March himself was ordered to inspect Calais and other remote royal castles as part of his duty as Marshal of England. March chose instead to resign the post.Tout Sent to govern Ireland On the accession of Richard II, a minor, in 1377, the Earl became a member of the standing council of government; though as husband of the heir- presumptive to the crown he wisely refrained from claiming any actual administrative office. The richest and most powerful person in the realm was, however, the king's uncle John of Gaunt, whose jealousy led March to accept the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1379. March succeeded in asserting his authority in eastern Ulster, but failed to subdue the O'Neills farther west. Proceeding to Munster to put down the turbulent southern chieftains, March was killed at Cork on 27 December 1381. He was buried in Wigmore Abbey, of which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa was also interred. Children The earl had two sons and two daughters: *Elizabeth (1371–1417), married Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, and had issue. She may have later married Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys and had issue.Douglas Richardson, Plantagenet Ancestry, pg 577–578. *Roger (1374–1398), succeeded him as 4th Earl of March and Ulster; married Alianore Holland and had issue. *Edmund (1376–1409), married Catrin ferch Owain Glyndŵr and had issue. *Philippa (1375–1401), married firstly John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke; after his death in 1389 she became the second wife of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel; she married thirdly Sir Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing.Douglas Richardson, Plantagenet Ancestry, pg 320, 570.

Developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures, and published by Nintendo, it was initially released in Japan on December 18, 1998, with an English version appearing in North America on April 10, 2000, and in Europe the following December. The title features digital versions of cards from the first three sets of the trading card game originally released in English by Wizards of the Coast between 1998 and 1999, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. A second Game Boy Color game, was released in Japan on March 28, 2001. Although the sequel was not released in North America or Europe, several enthusiasts have released English translations. Gameplay Seaking card against the opponent's Machop card, and has to select an attack. Pokémon Trading Card Game is a video game simulation of the original tabletop collectible card game with role-playing elements similar to the main Pokémon RPG-series. Players control a young boy and must travel around the game world interacting with non-player characters and challenging them to card battles using 60-card decks. During gameplay, the player must defeat eight Club Masters, each with a different deck representing one of the game's elemental card types. Finally, the player faces four Grand Masters, and defeating them earns the player the right to inherit four powerful Legendary Cards. A total of 226 cards exist within the game, which include cards from the first three sets of the real-life game, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. The player is given the opportunity to choose one of three starter decks at the start of their journey, each containing Pokémon cards revolving around the three possible starting creatures from Pokémon Red and Blue. As players defeat opponents, they are rewarded with booster packs containing a random assortment of additional cards they may use in their deck, with up to four separate decks able to be saved at a time. Up to two players may interact with each other using the Game Boy's infrared and/or Link Cable to battle or trade cards. As players trade with one another, they are given access to a special feature called \\"Card Pop!\\", which allows them to obtain cards that would otherwise be inaccessible in the main game. This feature is not accessible in the 3DS version. Development and release Pokémon Trading Card Game was co- developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures. Creatures' official website describes their work on the game as \\"planning and game design, card design\\". Tsunekazu Ishihara, founder of Creatures and designer of the card game, is credited as one of the game's producers. Curiously, Hudson is not credited anywhere on the game's package, cartridge, or title screen. However, the ending credits list them as the game's developer. The game was released in Japan on December 18, 1998 under the title one month before the tabletop version debuted in English. In September 1999, Nintendo of America announced that they would be releasing an English version in North America with the proposed title of simply Pokémon Card. Though initially planned for release the following winter, the game, now known under its finalized title of Pokémon Trading Card Game, was pushed back to April 2000, which IGN attributed to the company wanting to focus their efforts on the upcoming Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64. The following February, the game made an appearance at the 2000 Toy Fair in New York City as part of Nintendo's \\"Pokémon 2000\\" interactive line-up along with Pokémon Gold and Silver. An exclusive tabletop version promotional card from Wizards of the Coast featuring Meowth was included with the game. Although Pokémon Trading Card Game features most cards from the first three sets of the collectible card game, two real-life cards are absent from the Game Boy Color version: Electrode from the base set, and Ditto from the Fossil. The cards were excluded as it was difficult to translate their tabletop effects to the video game engine, but they are replaced by game-exclusive cards of the same Pokémon (the Electrode card was later made available in Japan via an online card shop). The game features cameos from President and CEO of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara as \\"Mr. Ishihara\\", and musician Tomoaki Imakuni under his stage name Imakuni?. Reception Pokémon Trading Card Game sold 607,193 copies in Japan by the end of 1999, becoming the 20th most-bought console game of that year in the region. It would go on to sell an additional 1.51 million copies during its first year in North America, and received mostly positive reception from critics, earning an 81.25% average score from aggregate review website GameRankings. GameSpot referred to the game as \\"a faithful and amusing adaptation of the collectible card game\\" calling the gameplay \\"addictive\\", but found it to be overall less satisfying than the original Pokémon role-playing games, stating that its goal of 'collecting all 226 pieces of paper' just doesn't satisfy like 'catching 'em all' can and does.\\" Others, such as IGN called the game \\"a blast to play\\" and that it offered mostly the same experience as the tabletop version \\"without the clutter or cost\\", yet acknowledged that the video game adaption could not fully replicate the original given the finite number of cards available. Though the website found its main story to be \\"simple and basic\\", and gameplay to be largely luck- based, it ultimately declared that \\"whether you like or hate those darn Pokémon... if Nintendo keeps making Pokémon videogames of this quality, those creatures aren't going away anytime soon.\\" GamesRadar ranked it the 50th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it an \\"excellent addition to Pokemons Game Boy catalog.\\" In a 2009 retrospective of Pokémon spin-offs, IGN retained their high praise for the game, stating \\"It was really kind of ridiculous how awesome this game turned out to be...if there was one spin-off [we] could ask Nintendo to reintroduce, it'd be the TCG game.\\" Censorship The game was banned in Saudi Arabia because it supposedly promoted Zionism. According to Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the Pokémon video game and cards have symbols that are \\"the star of David, which everyone knows is connected to international Zionism and is Israel's national emblem\\". Sequel released March 28, 2001, is the Japanese-exclusive sequel to the original Pokémon Trading Card Game, also for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures, but unlike its predecessor, it was only published by The Pokémon Company, which also marks the first time a Pokémon game was ever published by The Pokémon Company. It was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445. Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed \\"likely\\" by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan. Pokémon Card GB2 earned a 29 out of 40 score from Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine.

It follows the British rock band Radiohead on their world tour following the success of their 1997 album OK Computer. The film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Film at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. Summary Meeting People Is Easy covers the promotion and tour for Radiohead's third album, OK Computer. The tour began on 22 May 1997 in Barcelona, Spain, and ended 104 performances later in New York's Radio City Music Hall. Most of the film comprises footage of the band working on music and performing (including a performance of \\"Karma Police\\" on Late Show with David Letterman) filming promotional material, and giving interviews. It includes footage of the filming of the \\"No Surprises\\" music video, the failed studio session for the song \\"Man of War\\", and performances of unreleased songs including \\"Follow Me Around\\". Journalist Alex Ross described the film as \\"a kind of counterstrike against the music press, recording scores of pointless interviews with dead-tired members of the band\\". Production According to director Grant Gee, Radiohead sat in hotel suites for days giving interviews. To film each interview, Gee \\"[ran] around, leaving a microphone in one room, going and filming something in another\\". He placed surveillance cameras in the band's dressing room, which Gee said foreshadowed the rise of reality television: \\"We were doing it in a slightly more arty way, but it's the same as Big Brother, what we were doing with that band, seeing them locked in their bubble. Radiohead Big Brother is what I think of that film in a way.\\" Release Meeting People Is Easy was released on VHS on 30 November 1998 in the United Kingdom. It was released on DVD on 12 June 2000. It was released in both formats on 18 May 1999 in the United States. In subsequent years EMI and other record labels had released countless DVDs to promote pop and rock acts, as the format has become dominant over VHS in most parts of the world. In 1999, the film became the first DVD ever released by Radiohead's record label EMI/Parlophone/Capitol Records. Several television channels broadcast Meeting People Is Easy after its release. In the UK, Channel 4 broadcast the film on 6 May 1999. In the US, MTV broadcast a premiere of the film on 16 May 1999, and The Sundance Channel broadcast the documentary nine times during May 2000. Reception Reception for Meeting People Is Easy was positive. The film received an average rating of 6.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, giving it 71% freshness. Reviewer Jessica Brandt of theshrubbery.com gave 5 out of 5 stars. Film critic Daniel Fletcher named Meeting People is Easy one of his ten favourite films. Troy Patterson, a critic for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a B+, calling it \\"an expressive mood piece creepy with cosmopolitan paranoia and bracingly somber bombast\\". Bart Blasengame gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating: \\"Instead of taking the usual tour documentary approach and dwelling on individual concerts or behind-the-scenes banter between the band, Gee's film focuses on the absurdity of being an important rock band in the current musical landscape—the shallow marketing of the band, the endless stream of redundant interviews, the blinding photo shoots and awkward television appearances.\\" Kevin Archibald of IGN gave the film a rating of 8/10. The film has sold over half a million copies on DVD/VHS. Awards and nominations The film was nominated for the \\"Best Music Film\\" category at the 2000 Grammy Awards.

The present institution dates from August 2007, following the merger of the University of Paisley with Bell College, Hamilton. It can trace its roots to the late 19th century, and has undergone numerous name changes and mergers over the last century, reflecting its gradual expansion throughout the west of Scotland region. Holding a regional reputation for vocational undergraduate and post-graduate courses the university currently has students, with approximately 1300 staff, spread across six schools of learning. The Crichton Campus in Dumfries is maintained in partnership with a number of other institutions, including the University of Glasgow. History Although classified as a new university, the University of the West of Scotland has a rich, diverse history inherited from the various institutions that preceded it, including the Paisley School of Art (1836–1897), University of Paisley, Bell College of Technology, Craigie College of Education and Dumfries and Galloway College of Nursing. Paisley Campus John Witherspoon statue, a Founding Father of the United States At the time of the Industrial Revolution, Paisley was renowned for thread weaving. The Coats mill was run by two brothers, Peter and Thomas Coats. These men, children of the Scottish Enlightenment had liberal ideals and became noted philanthropists. As members of the Philosophical Institution, founded in 1808 the Coats donated a museum and library to the town, funded the building of the Coats observatory and promoted education throughout Paisley. The Philosophical Institution, helped establish the School of Arts in 1836, which become a Government School of Design in 1846, one of twenty similar institutions established in UK manufacturing centres from 1837-1851. They were set up to improve the quality of the country's product design through training in design for industry. Peter Coats was director of both Paisley Philosophical Institution and the Government School of Design. Later, the Design schools were renamed Schools of Art, and once again as Schools of Art and Science. In 1897 Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll laid the foundation stone of a grand new building for the College. The design was the winner of an architectural competition and partially funded by local industrialists (Peter Brough, and Thomas Coats both contributed). By the start of the twentieth century, Paisley Technical College and School of Art, (as it was known from 1904) was a centre for teaching the University of London External Programme. Perhaps the most famous principal of the College was Lewis Fry Richardson, FRS principal from 1922 to 1940. A mathematician, physicist, meteorologist, psychologist and pacifist who pioneered modern mathematical techniques of weather forecasting, as well as the application of similar techniques to studying war. He also carried out ground breaking work on fractals. Throughout the first half of the century the institution had a financial struggle. After the second world war Central Institution status provided a regular Government income but unfortunately also meant closing the school of Art, and ceding students to Glasgow School of Art. The new entity thus became Paisley College of Technology; a Government funded Central Institution in 1950. In the 1960s a large physical expansion took place alongside the Neo-Classical original building on the main 20 acre (81,000 m2) Paisley town centre site. At the time Paisley, in common with other Central Institutions and the former Polytechnics, already offered a range of degrees under the Council for National Academic Awards. With the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the Paisley College of Technology was granted the title University of Paisley and was established as a University with a Royal Charter and degree awarding powers. Today, this institution forms Paisley Campus of the University. UWS, 2007 – Present  On 1 August 2007, the University of Paisley merged with Bell College, Hamilton. On 30 November 2007, the Privy Council approved the name University of the West of Scotland for the merged institution. The name change was resisted by many in Paisley, seeing it as a break with tradition and the connections binding the previous university to the town. The 'Keep It Paisley' campaign attracted a number of supporters, amongst them local MP and then Secretary of State for Scotland, Douglas Alexander. Between 2008 and 2010, UWS opened offices in Glasgow with a focus on the creative industries. The School of Business and Creative Industries has offices in Film City Glasgow and the Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA). This forms a metropolitan base for research, performance, events and exhibitions, work with industry, and knowledge exchange activities, connecting the university's four campuses with the city where the media and arts sector is most concentrated in the west of Scotland. The merged institution served over 18,000 students and remains the largest 'new university' in Scotland. The Principal and Vice- Chancellor is Craig Mahoney. Ayr Campus UWS Ayr Campus The establishment of the University of Paisley prompted a merger with Craigie College of Education in Ayr in 1993, and led to the incorporation of nursing colleges in the town. The Ayr Campus was operated by the University of Paisley before the merger that established UWS. Set in of the old parkland of Craigie House bordering the River Ayr, the campus also houses the West of Scotland Management Centre, the Business School's management training and development facility. In August 2011, a new campus for the university in Ayr opened on a riverside site adjacent to the previous campus. It is shared with the Scottish Agricultural College. Lanarkshire Campus The Lanarkshire campus was originally founded in 1972 based at Almada Street, Hamilton, South Lanarkshire as the Bell College of Technology. A \\"Memorandum of Understanding\\" between the College and the University of Strathclyde was signed in 1993 to allow the College to offer degree level courses. In 1995, the Lanarkshire and Dumfries & Galloway Colleges of Nursing & Midwifery were amalgamated into Bell College, which then merged with the University of Paisley to create UWS in 2007. Following extensive consultation with the local authority, stakeholders, students and staff about the future of the Hamilton campus, UWS announced plans to relocate to the new UWS Lanarkshire Campus at Hamilton International Technology Park (HITP), actually within the neighbouring town of Blantyre, off the A725 bypass road near to West Craigs. The Almada Street campus closed and the HITP campus opened in September 2018.UWS – A look inside, The Blantyre Project, 13 August 2018UWS Lanarkshire campus opens to students after £110m project, ITV News, 3 September 2018 Dumfries Campus Crichton University Campus in Dumfries Dumfries is UWS's smallest campus, but it is a unique multi-institution facility located within the beautiful Crichton estate – a historic 85-acre parkland estate just two miles from the centre of Dumfries. The campus has state-of-the-art learning facilities and currently operates across five distinct, historic buildings. A range of flexible full and part-time study opportunities are available and an enthusiastic team of experienced teaching staff are waiting to welcome you. Students benefit from small class sizes, low staff: student ratios and a supportive study environment. The Crichton University Campus in Dumfries is the result of a joint project between the University of the West of Scotland, the University of Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway College and the Open University. The campus mainly offers business, computing and, since the merger with Bell College, nursing courses. Established in 1999 to provide a hub for higher education in the south-west of Scotland, the Crichton Campus has helped the regeneration of the Dumfries and Galloway economy. London The London Campus is located near London Bridge underground and Borough Market. It was launched in March 2016 and provides UWS degree and postgraduate programmes to the international student population in London. Organisation The University of the West of Scotland is organised into four schools: * School of Business and Creative Industries * School of Computing, Engineering and Physical Sciences * School of Education and Social Sciences * School of Health and Life Sciences The university offers over 100-degree courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level, and has a rapidly growing number of doctoral students. It also carries out research and consultancy work for industry, and is ranked second in Scotland for the number of Knowledge Transfer Partnerships with businesses. The University attained Skillset Media Academy status in August 2010. Many courses at the University of the West of Scotland have an emphasis on vocational skills and offer students the option of spending a year working in industry at home or abroad. The University has also worked with NHS Ayrshire and Arran resulting in a partnership in 2012 in the renaming of Ayr Hospital to University Hospital Ayr and Crosshouse Hospital to University Hospital Crosshouse. Its partnership with the Gaiety Theatre, Ayr has established Scotland's first 'Learning Theatre'. Rankings and Reputation University of the West of Scotland (UWS) has been named the top young higher education institution in Scotland in the prestigious THE World University Rankings 2020 league table. The University retains its place with in the 101-150 division of the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings. UWS is Scotland's leading university for widening access to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. UWS is also a sector leader in articulation, and is committed to articulating over 1,200 students with advanced standing each year. The university has the 4th highest level of student satisfaction in Scotland in the 2020 Complete University Guide The university is ranked second in the United Kingdom for Education in the 2020 Complete University Guide. Student life=Student accommodation The university has a number of halls of residence, ranging from modern en-suite/studio flats at Ayr Campus to furnished flats within Paisley. Students at Dumfries may apply for a place within the University of Glasgow managed accommodation at the Crichton. In September 2012, the new £13.2 million on-campus Paisley student residence opened situated next to the library. Student Associations Students' Association of the University of the West of Scotland (SAUWS) = The Students' Association of the University of the West of Scotland is officially the recognised student organisation across the university. The organisation exists to campaign on students' issues, to improve learning and teaching at UWS, to offer advice and support to students, to organise events and activities, and to enable societies across all campuses. The majority of the Student Groups and Societies are available to Scottish-based UWS campuses and are run by students for students. These include religious, political and social societies as well as course-based groups. There are also a collection of liberation groups and peer support groups, which exist to counter under- represented and oppressed sections of the student body. SAUWS operates Union bars at their Paisley and Ayr locations, where they host various events and activities including quiz nights and karaoke. In 2016 SAUWS won the NUS Scotland award \\"Higher Education Student Association of the Year\\". This was awarded due to the organisations work and campaigns such as Keep UWS in Hamilton, the Summer Safety Net campaign, and its work developing services for students. SAUWS was awarded \\"University Students' Association of the Year\\" by NUS Scotland once again in 2020. = Crichton University Campus Student Association (CUCSA) = Crichton University Campus Student Association also serves students at the Dumfries Campus. For students at Dumfries, CUCSA has a more limited range of sports and societies on offer and CUCSA is currently working with students to produce a new Netball club, both Boys and Girls Football clubs and an improved Riding Club.  Radio  The Ayr Campus is also home to the university's student radio station UWS Radio. It broadcasts on DAB, 87.7FM to the campus and online. The station has interviewed greats such as Brian May from Queen and Jesse Rae. Sports Sporting affairs are regulated by TeamUWS, the Sports and Societies branch of the main Students Association headed by the Sports President. There are a large number of varied clubs, including Aikido, Basketball, Curling and Snowsports who regularly compete in BUCS and Scottish Student Sport competitions. Students who join one of the sports clubs affiliated with the university must also join the Sports Union. However, there are also regular classes and drop-in sessions for various sports which are non-competitive and available to all university gym members. The University operates two sports centres across the west of Scotland, Robertson Trust Sports Centre at Thornly Park Campus in Paisley and Hamilton Leisure Centre on site on Hamilton Campus. The university, as the University of Paisley, has also had a number of previous clubs including Ice Hockey, Shinty, Gaelic Football and Ice Sports. There have been attempts in recent years to resurrect these teams, most notably the Paisley IcePanthers, the university's former ice hockey team in 2008 by Finnish and German students, but due to lack of interest the club never happened. The most successful of all the resurrections was the American Football team. The Paisley College of Technology/University of Paisley Panthers American Football played between the 1989–90 British Collegiate American Football League and the 1996–97 British Collegiate American Football League seasons until the club rejoined as the University of Paisley Pyros at the start of the 2004–05 British Collegiate American Football League season. TeamUWS competes in the East vs West varsity competition against Edinburgh Napier University in the sports of American Flag Football, Badminton, Basketball, Football, Hockey, Netball, Rugby and Volleyball which is at the moment the biggest sport club (2017). In the 2013/2014 competition the hockey games were cancelled due to location and weather difficulties. According to the Scottish Daily Record, it is rumoured that South Ayrshire Council is considering giving the dated Dam Park Stadium, the venue for UWS-SRUC-Ayrshire College Varsity, to the University saving nearly £70,000. As part of the transfer, the facility will continue to be used by Ayr Seaforth AC and the local community.

Along with Laurent Clerc and Mason Cogswell, he co-founded the first permanent institution for the education of the deaf in North America, and he became its first principal. When opened on April 15, 1817, it was called the \\"Connecticut Asylum (at Hartford) for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons,\\" but it is now known as the American School for the Deaf. Biography He attended Yale University, earning his bachelor's degree in 1805, graduating at the age of seventeen, with highest honors, and then earned a master's degree at Yale in 1808.Dexter's volume on early Yale graduates He engaged in many things such as studying law, trade, and theology. In 1814, Gallaudet graduated from Andover Theological Seminary after a two-year course of study. However, he declined several offers of pastorates, due to ongoing concerns about his health. His path in life was altered when he met Alice Cogswell, on May 25, 1814, the nine-year-old deaf daughter of a neighbor, Dr. Mason Cogswell. Gallaudet had returned to his parents' home in Hartford to recuperate from his seminary studies. On that day, as he observed Alice playing apart from other children, he wanted to teach her. Gallaudet started to teach Alice what different objects were called by writing their names and drawing pictures of them with a stick in the dirt. Dr. Cogswell was impressed and invited Gallaudet to continue teaching Alice through the summer. While many of his friends became pastors or found mission fields overseas, Gallaudet found his mission field at home. The next year Cogswell, with several businessmen and clergy, asked Gallaudet to travel to Europe to study methods for teaching deaf students, especially those of the Braidwood family in England. Gallaudet found the Braidwoods unwilling to share knowledge of their oral communication method and himself financially limited. At the same time, he also was not satisfied that the oral method produced desirable results. While still in Great Britain, he met Abbé Sicard, head of the Institution Nationale des Sourds-Muets à Paris, and two of its deaf faculty members, Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu. Sicard invited Gallaudet to Paris to study the school's method of teaching the deaf using manual communication. Impressed with the manual method, Gallaudet studied teaching methodology under Sicard, learning sign language from Massieu and Clerc, who were both highly educated graduates of the school. Having persuaded Clerc to accompany him, Gallaudet sailed back to America. The two men, with the help of Dr. Cogswell, toured New England and successfully raised private and public funds to fund a school for deaf students in Hartford, which later became known as the American School for the Deaf (ASD), in 1817. Young Alice was one of the first seven students at ASD. In 1821, he married one of his former students, Sophia Fowler. They had 8 children as well. After resigning directorship of his school for the deaf in 1830, Gallaudet wrote educational and religious texts, became the chaplain to the Connecticut Retreat for the Insane in 1838, and taught in Hartford; the young Frederic Edwin Church was a notable pupil during this period. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet died in Hartford on September 10, 1851, aged 63, and was buried in Hartford's Cedar Hill Cemetery.Cedar Hill Cemetery Foundation There is a residence hall named in his honor at nearby Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. There is also a residence hall named in his honor at the University of Hartford in West Hartford. Family His youngest child Edward Miner Gallaudet (1837–1917) founded in 1864 the first college for the deaf, which, in 1986, became Gallaudet University. He was president for 46 years. The university also offers education for those in elementary, middle, and high school. The elementary school on the Gallaudet University Campus is named the Kendall Demonstration Elementary School (KDES); the middle and high school is the Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD). he went to France with Dr Mason Cogwell. Gallaudet had another son, Thomas Gallaudet, who became an Episcopal priest and also worked for the deaf. Gallaudet's father, Peter Wallace Gallaudet, was a personal secretary to US President George Washington, when the office of the President was located in Philadelphia. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was the eldest of 13 children. His younger siblings' names were: Edgar (1789–90), Charles (1792–1830), (unnamed twins, 1793), Catherine (1793–1856), James (1796–1878), William Edgar (1797–1821), Ann Watts (1800–50), Jane (1801–35), Theodore (1805–85), Edward (1808–47) , and Wallace (1811–16).

It had a population in 2002 of 6,613. Local landmarks include the Moylish campus of the Limerick Institute of Technology, a third level college and research centre, the Jetland Shopping Centre which opened in 2005, Caherdavin Church, built in 1985, with adjoining primary boys' and girls' schools (Scoil Chríost Rí and Mary Queen of Ireland respectively) and there is also St Nessan's Community College in the nearby Woodview estate. Both the Gaelic Grounds and Thomond Park are nearby. History Caherdavin was originally part of the \\"Northern Liberties\\" granted to Limerick Corporation in 1216 by King John. It remained part of Limerick City until 1840 when it became part of the new Limerick County Council; it returned to Limerick City in 2008. It was part of the parish of St. Munchin, which originally extended to Cratloe in County Clare, until Christ the King parish was formed after the 1960s housing boom in the area. The site of Caherdavin was developed for housing in the 1960s and has grown rapidly since then. Industry is confined to the Clondrinagh Industrial Estate which houses mainly traditional style workshop units. The other form of employment in the area is the services industry e.g. hotel, shops, doctors surgery. In 2005 the large Jetland Shopping Centre opened, providing new retail space and an 18-hour Dunnes Stores supermarket, which has recently become 8am-10pm. Ivan's shop is at Caherdavin Cross. The Bank of Ireland recently moved its branch from beside Melvin Grove to the Jetland Shopping Centre. The Caherdavin Credit Union is at Redgate. There is a 23-hour Tesco located in the Coonagh Cross shopping centre at the Coonagh roundabout. Organisation The district includes the townlands of Ballygrennan, Clonmacken, Caherdavin, Clonconane, Clondrinagh, Coonagh, Knock and Shannabummy. As of 11 November 2016, this area is part of Limerick city. To the south and west is the River Shannon whilst to the east is the old Limerick city boundary Borough and to the north is the boundary with County Clare. An important feature of the area is that it is broken up into four sub-districts by the Clonmacken road, the Ennis road and the Cratloe road. There is Caherdavin Lawn, Caherdavin Park, and Caherdavin Heights. Caherdavin is approximately 1.5 miles north from Limerick city centre. Clubs The 23rd Limerick Scout Group has its hall beside the primary schools and has been active for over 30 years. The Community Centre houses a branch of the LCC library. The Irish Girl Guides are active. The Na Piarsaigh GAA clubhouse and grounds is at Caherdavin Lawn. Along with Crowley School of Ballet and tap The Caherdavin & District Credit Union is at Redgate. The local church hosts three choirs- The Senior Choir (Which performs at 10:30 Sunday Mass), the Folk Choir (Which performs at 12 Noon Sunday mass, and many other functions) And the Taize Choir (Performs at 18:30 Saturday Mass). The Caherdavin Youth Club, which is one of Limerick's longest running, operates from the Community Centre. A group of former youth club members went on to form the Caherdavin massive crew (CMC) which is made up of clean living men and women in their twenties who strive to make Caherdavin a better place for young and old alike. There is a playing field in Caherdavin Park, near the Greenhills hotel, which is used by the youth soccer teams of Caherdavin Celtic FC and for other community sports. Transport Roads run over the three Shannon bridges from the city centre through Caherdavin in the direction of Shannon Airport, Ennis, and Galway. Many of the district's residents are employed on the industrial estates at Raheen and Castletroy, adding to traffic problems at rush hour. Several bus routes are provided by Bus Éireann, Ireland's national bus operator, but as there are very few bus lanes the buses must compete with private traffic. Bus Éireann officials have complained that the round trip on the LIT-UL route (about 14 km) can take up to 2 hours. Bus lanes were introduced on the Ennis Road during the summer of 2007, though the effects of these remain to be seen. A new tunnel project west of the city is hoped to relieve the situation. The Coonagh Aerodrome, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, provides access for small aircraft. Larger commercial aircraft use Shannon Airport, which lies 20 km west in County Clare.

He was the older brother of two other rock vocalists: current Lynyrd Skynyrd lead vocalist Johnny Van Zant and Donnie Van Zant, the founder and vocalist of 38 Special. He was the father of Tammy Van Zant and Melody Van Zant. Early life He was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida, to Lacy Austin (1915–2004) and Marion Virginia (Hicks) Van Zant (1929–2000). Ronnie aspired to be many things before finding his love for music. Idolizing boxer Muhammad Ali, he considered a career in the ring, and while playing American Legion baseball dreamed of Minor League success. Lynyrd Skynyrd Van Zant formed a band called My Backyard late in the summer of 1964 with friends and schoolmates Allen Collins (guitar), Gary Rossington (guitar), Larry Junstrom (bass), and Bob Burns (drums). The quintet went through several names before deciding on Lynyrd Skynyrd, a mock tribute to gym teacher Leonard Skinner (who disapproved of male students with long hair) that all but Collins had at Robert E. Lee High School. The band's national exposure began in 1973 with the release of their debut album, (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd), which had a string of hits that included \\"I Ain't the One\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"Simple Man,\\" and what became their signature, \\"Free Bird\\", later dedicated to the late Duane Allman of The Allman Brothers Band. Lynyrd Skynyrd's biggest hit single was \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" from their follow-up album Second Helping, an answer to Neil Young's \\"Alabama\\" and \\"Southern Man.\\" Young's song \\"Powderfinger\\" on the 1979 album Rust Never Sleeps was reportedly written for Skynyrd, and Van Zant is pictured on the cover of Street Survivors wearing a T-shirt of Young's Tonight's the Night and in the 2 July 1977 Oakland Coliseum concert (excerpted in Freebird... The Movie). Death On October 20, 1977, a plane carrying the band between shows from Greenville, South Carolina, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ran out of fuel outside Gillsburg, Mississippi. The passengers had been informed about potential problems with the Convair CV-240 and were told to brace for a crash.US National Transportation Safety Board 1978, p6. Van Zant died on impact from head injuries suffered after the aircraft struck a tree. Bandmates Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines, along with assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray, were also killed. The rest of the band was seriously injured.Check-Six 2007. Van Zant was 29 years old. According to former bandmate Artimus Pyle and family members, Van Zant frequently discussed his mortality. Pyle recalls a moment when Lynyrd Skynyrd was in Japan: \\"Ronnie and I were in Tokyo, Japan, and Ronnie told me that he would never live to see thirty and that he would go out with his boots on, in other words, on the road. I said, 'Ronnie, don't talk like that,' but the man knew his destiny.\\" Van Zant's father, Lacy, said, \\"He said to me many times, 'Daddy, I'll never be 30 years old.' I said, 'Why are you talking this junk? You will never be 30 years old?’ and he said, 'Daddy, that's my limit.'\\" Van Zant's father later noted that, \\"God was a jealous god. Taking him for reasons I don't know.\\" Ex-bandmate Ed King also reported hearing Van Zant saying he would never live to be 30 years old, saying Van Zant said it so often that he \\"had gotten sick of hearing it\\".The Ray Shasho Show, BBS Radio 1 Network, 2016 Lynyrd Skynyrd backup singer JoJo Billingsley recalled that Van Zant had begun referring to himself as \\"The Mississippi Kid\\" in the months before his death despite being born and raised in Florida. She noted that, eerily, Van Zant's only connection to Mississippi was the fact that he would ultimately die there.If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, Passion Pictures, Directed by Stephen Kijak, 2018 Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer when the band reunited in 1987. Ex-Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King recalls the intense sadness of Van Zant's funeral, noting that people in attendance were so overcome with grief that they were literally falling down. Van Zant was buried in Orange Park, Florida, in 1977. His body was relocated after vandals broke into his tomb and that of bandmate Steve Gaines on June 29, 2000. Van Zant's casket was pulled out and dropped on the ground. The bag containing Gaines' remains was torn open and some scattered onto the grass.Anderson 2000. Their mausoleums at Orange Park remain as memorials for fans to visit. 10 years later, the new location of their interment was accidentally revealed by a Craigslist ad. A family selling two plots they decided not to retain, ran a Craigslist ad and stated the plots were in the Jacksonville Memory Gardens Cemetery in Orange Park, Florida, adjacent to Ronnie Van Zant's tomb. Craigslist posting reveals Ronnie Van Zant's burial site WKMG, April 19, 2012 According to the cemetery listing website Find-a-Grave, Van Zant was reburied at Riverside Memorial Park in Jacksonville, near the grave of his father Lacy and mother Marion. Both his current resting place and the empty mausoleum in Orange Park are listed, with the statement: \\"Due to the June 29th, 2000 vandalization of his original grave site, his casket was moved to this new location and buried in a massive underground concrete burial vault. To open the vault would require a tractor with a lift capacity of several tons. It is also patrolled by security.\\"Soorus 2002. Personal life Van Zant married Nadine Inscoe on January 2, 1967. Around this time, Van Zant also worked at his brother-in-law's auto parts store, Morris Auto Parts in Jacksonville. It was said that Van Zant was a virtual catalog of automotive parts, he had a near photographic memory for them. The couple had a daughter named Tammy, before divorcing in 1969; Tammy would become a musician. He married Judy Seymour in 1972 after meeting her at The Comic Book Club through Gary Rossington in 1969. (The club closed in 1975 and is now a parking garage.) They remained married up until his death in 1977. They had one daughter, Melody, born in 1976. Judy Van Zant-Jenness founded the Freebird Live in 1999, a music venue located in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. It featured Lynyrd Skynyrd memorabilia and was co-owned by Melody Van Zant. Judy married Jim Jenness and founded and ran The Freebird Foundation until its dissolution in 2001. Van Zant was an avid fisherman. He enjoyed baseball, and was a fan of the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. As a child, he played American Legion baseball and aspired to play professional baseball, as he recalled in a 1975 interview. Van Zant had several run-ins with the law, most notably in 1975, when he was arrested for hurling a table out of a second-story hotel room window.  Legacy  The Ronnie Van Zant Memorial Park, funded by fans and family of the band, was built on Sandridge Road in Lake Asbury, Florida, nearby his hometown of Jacksonville. Several members of his family have memorialized Ronnie in their music. His brothers Johnny and Donnie co-wrote the title track of John's 1990 album \\"Brickyard Road\\" with family friend and album producer Robert White Johnson. In the reformed Lynyrd Skynyrd's music video for the posthumously-released track \\"What's Your Name\\" closes with a white hat similar to Ronnie's sitting atop a microphone. Ronnie's daughter Tammy, who was only 10 years old when he died, dedicated the album title track, \\"Freebird Child\\" as well as the music video to her father in 2009. Van Zant's cousin Jimmie Van Zant recorded the tribute track \\"Ronnie's Song\\" on the album Southern Comfort (2000). Alt country band Drive-By Truckers also paid tribute to Ronnie and members of the original band on their Southern Rock Opera album. \\"The All-Night Bus Ride\\", the 8th episode of Season 1 of the Showtime series Roadies, was made in honor of Van Zant and the band. In the 1978 song \\"Reflections\\" on the Charlie Daniels Band album Million Mile Reflections, the third verse talks about Van Zant saying \\"And Ronnie, my buddy above all the rest. I miss you the most and loved you the best.\\". With a dedication on the back of the original record case with a poem the last line reading \\"Fly on proud bird, you're free at last.\\" Signed Charlie Daniels 1978.

He is a founder member of the progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator. Best known as a singer/songwriter, he also plays guitar and piano and acts as a record producer for his own recordings and occasionally for other artists. In 2012, he was recognised with the Visionary award at the first Progressive Music Awards. Biography=Early life Peter Hammill was born in Ealing, west London, and moved with his family to Derby when he was 12. He attended Beaumont College and Manchester University, where he studied Liberal Studies in Science.Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: Van der Graaf Generator – The Book, p. 5. Phil and Jim publishers, 2005. Hammill has stated that his grandfather was originally from Pakistan. Early career Hammill's solo career has coexisted with Van der Graaf Generator's activities. The band was offered a contract by Mercury Records in 1968, that only Hammill signed. When Van der Graaf Generator broke up in 1969 he wanted to record his first solo album. In the summer of 1969 Hammill had a residency at The Lyceum and played weekly solo concerts there.Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: Van der Graaf Generator – The Book, p. 37. Phil and Jim publishers, 2005. Eventually the intended solo album was released under the Van der Graaf Generator banner as their first album (The Aerosol Grey Machine).Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: Van der Graaf Generator – The Book, pp. 32–44, 58. Phil and Jim publishers, 2005. Hammill's first real solo album was Fool's Mate (1971), containing songs from the early (1967/68) Van der Graaf Generator days. Van der Graaf Generator and after When Van der Graaf Generator broke up again in August 1972, Hammill resumed his solo career. Songs that were intended for Van der Graaf Generator now ended up on his solo albums, notably \\"Black Room\\" (on Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night) and \\"A Louse Is Not a Home\\" (on The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage). For the majority of both his solo songs and the band's songs he is credited as the sole songwriter, and some of his solo albums feature all the members of Van der Graaf Generator. In general, Hammill's solo work is thematically concerned with more personal matters, while the band's songs deal with broader themes. Nadir's Big Chance (1975) was a major change from the preceding In Camera. Whilst In Camera is characterised by extremely intense and complex songs and even has some musique concrète on it, Nadir's Big Chance contains anticipations of punk rock. In a 1977 radio interview, John Lydon of the Sex Pistols played two tracks from the album and expressed his admiration for Hammill in glowing terms: \\"Peter Hammill's great. A true original. I've just liked him for years. If you listen to him, his solo albums, I'm damn sure Bowie copied a lot out of that geezer. The credit he deserves, just has not been given to him. I love all his stuff\\". Over (1977) contains very personal songs about the break-up of a long-term relationship. Hammill's first solo album after the 1978 break-up of Van der Graaf was The Future Now. He provided vocals on several tracks for Robert Fripp's solo debut Exposure, released in June of 1979. With the next solo albums, pH7 and A Black Box, the sound became more compact, more new wave. On those albums, Hammill played the drums himself. What followed was the \\"K group\\". In later years Hammill would sometimes refer to the band as a \\"beat group\\".Album notes by Peter Hammill for The Margin +, expanded reissue of CD The Margin (2001). Fie! The K group consisted of Hammill himself on guitars and piano, with John Ellis on lead guitar, Nic Potter on bass, and Guy Evans on drums and percussion. This group recorded the albums Enter K and Patience. Live performances Live concerts by Peter Hammill are characterised by a degree of unpredictability, in terms of the songs played, the arrangements and the players involved. Hammill generally does not undertake live tours to promote albums. Whenever he plays with a certain predominant line-up, almost always there will also be concerts interspersed with different permutations of musicians, so the word \\"tour\\" is not always very applicable. From September 1981 until September 1985 Hammill played with the K group, playing raw, energetic, new-wave rock. A live recording of a number of these concerts was released as The Margin. In March and April 1983, Hammill with John Ellis was the support act for Marillion on their UK tour in support of their debut album Script for a Jester's Tear. From February until October 1990 he played with Nic Potter on bass and Stuart Gordon on violin. A live recording of these shows was released as Room Temperature. From April 1993 until August 1996 they were joined by Manny Elias on drums. A live recording of these shows was released as There Goes The Daylight. From October 1994 until August 1996 Hammill played with David Jackson on flutes and saxophones, Stuart Gordon on violin and Manny Elias on drums (this line-up is sometimes informally referred to as the Peter Hammill Quartet). From January 1998 until November 2006 Hammill played with just Stuart Gordon on violin. Of these shows the live recording Veracious was released. From 1969 on, Hammill has also performed solo concerts, with just guitar and keyboards. Fie! Records Hammill's early records, like the Van der Graaf Generator albums, were released on Charisma Records. He parted company with them after pH7 (1979), and then released albums on a number of small labels. A Black Box came out on S-Type, a label run by Hammill and his manager Gail Colson. Enter K and Patience appeared on Naive, Skin and The Margin on Foundry and In A Foreign Town, Out of Water and Room Temperature on Enigma Records. In 1992 he formed his own label, Fie! Records, on which all his albums since Fireships have been released. The label's logo is the Greek letter phi (Φ), a pun on PH-I. Ever since the 1970s he has also had his own home recording studio, called Sofa Sound. His website was later named after the studio. Later years In 1991, Hammill released the long-awaited opera The Fall of the House of Usher. He had written the music and Van der Graaf Generator co-founder Judge Smith the libretto, and the two of them had been working on it since 1973. In 1999 he released a reworked version, The Fall Of The House Of Usher (Deconstructed & Rebuilt). Hammill survived a heart attack in December 2003, less than 48 hours after having finished the recording of Incoherence. He was awarded the Italian 'Tenco Prize' for songwriting at the end of 2004. In 2005, Hammill announced the reformation of Van der Graaf Generator. In 2004 they had recorded a new album, Present, which was released in April 2005, and from May until November 2005 played a series of well received concerts. Between 2005 and 2007 Hammill oversaw the remastering of almost all of his pre-Fie! releases, and also carried out similar work on his more recent catalogue. The last of the Charisma remasters was released in September 2007. Hammill's solo career did not end because of the Van der Graaf Generator reunion. He released an album Singularity in December 2006. It was the first solo album he completed after his heart attack, and for a large part it deals with matters of life and (sudden) death. In 2007 several gigs by Van der Graaf Generator as a trio (minus David Jackson) took place in Britain and Europe; their new album Trisector was released in March 2008. In the summer and autumn of 2008, Hammill did a tour of solo dates in the U.S. and Canada which included a performance at the progressive rock festival NEARfest. He also played his only ever professional \\"parlour gig\\" at a private residence in Holland, Michigan. In the summer of 2009 Van der Graaf Generator toured the U.S. and Canada, which occasioned Hammill's triumphant return to NEARfest. Thin Air was released on 8 June 2009. This was followed in October 2011 by a live double CD Pno, Gtr, Vox, recorded at performances in Japan and the UK in 2010. An extended 7-CD box set, Pno, Gtr, Vox Box was released in a limited edition of 2000 in February 2012. Consequences, a solo studio album was released in May 2012. Again Hammill played all the instruments. The lyrics deal with conflicted characters in various scenarios. Other World, a collaborative album with guitarist Gary Lucas, was released in February 2014. The album features Hammill's vocals, Hammill and Lucas on guitars, and Hammill's sound treatments, and is a mixture of conventional songs with extended avant-garde instrumentals. In 2019 In Amazonia was released, a collaboration album with progressive rock group Isildurs Bane. Music Musically, Hammill's work ranges from short simple riff-based songs to highly complex lengthy pieces. Mainly because of the diversity of his compositions there is much debate amongst his admirers whether Hammill is to be considered a part of the progressive rock scene. In many interviews, however, Hammill has stated that he does not want to be put in the progressive rock music label, or any music label at all. Despite this, he has received recognition as a visionary artist from the progressive music world. Hammill's output is prolific. Many different styles of music appear in his work, among them artful complexity (for instance Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night), avant garde electronic experiments (Loops and Reels, Unsung), opera (The Fall of the House of Usher), solo keyboard accompaniment (And Close As This), solo guitar accompaniment (Clutch), improvisation (Spur of the Moment), film music (Sonix), band recordings (Enter K), and slow, melancholic balladry (None of the Above). Voice Hammill's voice is a very distinctive element of his music. He sings in an emotional, often even dramatic way. As a former Jesuit chorister, his delivery is usually Received Pronunciation British English — notable exceptions are his Afrikaner accent on \\"A Motor-bike in Afrika\\" and his Cockney accent on \\"Polaroid\\" — and ranges in tone from peacefully celestial to screaming rants (which are nevertheless highly controlled). Singing in registers from baritone to high falsetto, he growls, croons, shrieks and shouts in ways that have drawn comparison with the guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix.Album notes for Sometimes God Smiles – The Young Person's Guide To Discipline, compilation CD (1998). Discipline Global Mobile. Lyrics Hammill's lyrics are another distinctive feature of his work. He has visited a number of recurring themes including love and human relationships, ageing and death, human folly, self-awareness and introspection, politics, and religion. His lyrics often include scientific, literary or historical references. For example, the Norse names mentioned in the song \\"Viking\\" on Fool's Mate (co- written with Judge Smith) are characters in the Icelandic Saga of Eric the Red. The science fiction themes of Van der Graaf Generator's lyrics are mostly absent in his later work, but there still are many science references, especially to physics (for instance in the song \\"Patient\\"). In 1974 Hammill published a book, Killers, Angels, Refugees (Charisma Books, London), a collection of lyrics, poems and short stories. This was later reissued by Hammill himself (Sofa Sound, Bath) and was followed by a sequel Mirrors, Dreams, Miracles (1982). In 2000 Dagmar Klein published Shouting down the passage of time: The Spaces & Times of Peter Hammill, an analysis and interpretation of Hammill's lyrics along the lines of his dealings with \\"Space\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Journeys\\".Dagmar Klein: Shouting down the passage of time: The Spaces & Times of Peter Hammill. Libri Books on Demand 2000. Personal life Hammill is fluent in Italian. He has been married since 1978 to Hilary, who is credited with taking the picture for the cover of In a Foreign Town.

The Omni Group was informally founded as a NEXTSTEP consulting company in 1989 by Wil Shipley, who immediately brought on Ken Case and Tim Wood. The three incorporated together under the name Omni Development, Inc. in 1993, because the name \\"Omni Group\\" was taken by another Seattle firm. Omni initially produced custom database software for the NEXTSTEP platform for clients such as the William Morris Agency and McCaw Cellular Communications (then Cingular Wireless; now AT&T; Inc.). During this period they also ported a number of games to NEXTSTEP, then later to Mac OS X (after Apple acquired NeXT in 1997). Around 2000 the company decided to start focusing on their own consumer applications for the Mac, and as of 2004 the vast majority of their revenue came from their consumer products. In 2003, Ken Case took over as the chief officer of Omni, and in March 2004 Wil Shipley left with another Omni employee, interface designer Mike Matas, to form Delicious Monster. Matas later left for Apple. The Omni Group also administers several mailing lists related to macOS and software development. They also provide several frameworks for Cocoa software development under an open source license. OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner have won Macworld Editors' Choice Awards. At the Macintosh Worldwide Developers Conference in 2001, OmniWeb 4.0 won two Apple Design Awards: \\"Best Mac OS X User Experience\\" and \\"Best New Mac OS X Product.\\" In 2002, OmniGraffle 2.0 won two more Apple Design Awards.

The plot incorporates elements from Indian religions, centrally the concept of the wheel of time - every 4000 years the world is destroyed and recreated by a Rudra - the name taken from an aspect of the Hindu god of destruction, Shiva. With several races of beings already eradicated and replaced, the story takes place during the final 15 days before humans are scheduled to be wiped out as well. Gameplay Riza using a Dark mantra against a Future. The gameplay is divided into three main areas: the overworld map, the towns and dungeons, and battles. When in the overworld map, the player directs their characters to different locations in the game. Towns contain the prerequisite shops and villagers who offer information, while dungeons are mazelike affairs where random enemy encounters may occur. These battles may also strike on the overworld map and follow a typical RPG pattern: the player makes choices for their characters (such as whether to fight, cast a magic spell, or run away), and then the enemy takes a turn. This pattern repeats until the characters on one side all run out of hit points and die. There are 15 turns, accounting for each of the 15 days. Magic system The game features a magic system where the player can create magic spells by entering words up to six katakana characters. Whereas most console RPGs give the player access to a limited number of precreated spells, it allows the player nearly total creative freedom. The player can enter various magic words (called kotodama (言霊,ことだま) in the original) into their grimoire. Every one will have some effect, although most are not useful. There is an underlying framework to the system, however, which is based on the gameworld's elements. A complete mantra generally consists of a prefix, elemental core, and suffix, although the core alone is enough to produce an effect. There are eight elements (plus healing), and of these, six are arranged in mutually antagonistic pairings: fire vs. water, wind vs. electricity, and light vs dark. The remaining two offensive elements, earth and void, have no strengths or weaknesses. Since spells are formed from letters, there are specific patterns corresponding to each element. Certain spells that use the root word tou for example, will produce lightning-based attacks, while those containing aqu will create water-based effects. Additionally, there are prefixes and suffixes that can be added onto the base elements to change their attributes. Most of these influence the base power and cost to use the spell, but others add abnormal status effects (for example, poisoning the target) or change the mantra's range so that it only targets a single enemy instead of multiple ones or vice versa. Prefixes and suffixes with similar effects can be used in tandem to produce amplified effects. Other mantras consist of unique words, many of them in English, that create certain effects and skip the naming system entirely. Many of these strange words are learned from in-game characters or by reading books. For example, geo is an earth-related mantra, and kingcoast is a water spell. Adding prefixes or suffixes to these usually makes something completely different (and often useless). This use of spelled-out mantras allows the player to learn magic from even their enemies. When an enemy uses magic, the player has but to write down the spells used and then to enter them into his or her own grimoire after the battle in order to have access to them. Some of these enemy spells are extremely powerful, although many are not as cost- efficient as the basic spells described above. Some are more space-efficient versions of regular spells. Plot=Setting and characters The story is divided into three major scenarios, each with a different main character: the soldier Sion, the priestess Riza, and the archaeologist Surlent. As the player enters new areas and accomplishes different tasks, the human race's final 15 days slowly ebb away in a predetermined day/night cycle. The player is free to play the scenarios in any order, and may even leave one storyline to follow that of another character for a time. The actions of the characters in one location and time may have an effect on the others, as well, both in the general story and in gameplay. For example, if one group of characters leaves a sacred relic somewhere, another character may come and find it on a later day in their own part of the game. After successfully completing all three scenarios, players must take on a fourth, featuring the roving thief Dune and the heroes from the previous three chapters in their final confrontation with the game's major villains. Story Before the events of the game, the Majestic Four created the world, the most powerful of them being Mitra who was also the creator of the Earth and the moon. They then gave life to an entity known as a Rudra with power from the Guardian of Evolution, Gomorrah, who uses his Eternal Engine to facilitate new beings. Every 4,000 years, a Rudra appears with a race of its own and the race that came before it is destroyed or driven to near extinction. Former Rudras have since become fossils that archaeologists refer to as Lago Stones. During the Great Cycle, the Danans were succeeded by the Merfolk, the Reptiles, the Giants and finally by the Humans. At the start of the game, fifteen days remain before the coming of a new Rudra and the end of humanity begins. The characters Sion, Surlent, Riza and Dune each come into possession of a Jade, a treasure discovered in the Lago Stones. It is later revealed that Gomorrah requires the Jades in addition to other treasures to create a perfect Rudra, and that a weapon known as Sodom destroys every successive race from its lair on the moon. After both Gomorrah and Sodom have been thwarted by the Jadebearers, they unite and board a Danan flying vessel known as the Ark to travel to the moon and confront Mitra. Upon defeating her, Mitra praises the Jadebearers for their strength and reveals that long ago the Majestic Four once fought a force known as the Destroyers who were a threat to the world. When the Majestic Four won, Mitra knew the Destroyers would one day return and resolved to defeat them by creating a perfect race through evolution while using the 4,000 year cycle to replace weak races with stronger ones. In an instant, Mitra passes on her knowledge of the Eternal Engine to Dune and also leaves the task of fighting the Destroyers to the human race. During the ending, the party return home and experience a vision of a world brought to ruin by the Destroyers, which Dune interprets as a warning from Mitra. He considers using the Eternal Engine to evolve humanity, but the Jadebearers decide against it so they do not repeat Mitra's actions, and instead choose to let the human race evolve naturally. Development The character designer for the game was Keita Amemiya. Treasure of the Rudras was released for the Super Famicom on April 5, 1996, and was published by Squaresoft. It was the last Square-developed release for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During the time it was released, most games had already moved onto 3D graphics, while this game still used 2D pixel art. It was never localized outside Japan; it was released late in the life of the Super Famicom. A fan translation was first released. The game's unique magic system was also considered to be a major obstacle for translators. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 7, 2011 and the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on December 2, 2015. Music The soundtrack was scored by Ryuji Sasai. A CD of the music was released shortly after the game on April 25, 1996. A CD of Square Enix music was released in Japan on July 4, 2012 and included a track of the game's music called \\"The Spirit Chaser (SURLENT)\\" by the Stealth Boys. A sheet music edition subtitled \\"Original sound version\\" was released by Doremi in 1998, featuring every track of the game transcribed in simple arrangements for solo piano. Reception Brazilian magazine VideoGame commented that the title is an example of how the Super Nintendo was the best console for role playing games, and this is just another example. They also praised the graphics and gameplay as being as high quality as Square's other series Final Fantasy. The game has received praise in retrospective reviews as well. Games Radar praised the game's unique battle system of learning spells through words and combining them to make new ones, but noted that there were games from the mid-1990s that were more beatifically drawn and “narratively ambitious”. Retro Gamer also praised the game's magic system and also the unique approach of having three branching stories that players could exit and enter at will, and called the title a “hidden gem”. Destructoid compared the plot and its many shifting perspectives to Game of Thrones, but noted that the game did not appear to have been made with the same large budget as contemporary titles, and noted the difficulty of using the linguistic magic system. Jeaux Video enjoyed the title's humorous cutscenes, but were critical of the game's lack of polish. Hobby Consolas called the title one of the best games ever released for the Super Nintendo, praising the graphical detail and the innovative magic system.

Unlike most club dancing and rave dancing, there are specific synchronized movements for each song much like line dancing. Para Para is said to have existed since the early 1980s when European countries started selling Italo disco and Euro disco, and in the mid-to late 1970s, new wave and synthpop music in Japan. However, it did not achieve much popularity outside Japan until the late 1990s. Para Para is strongly associated with Eurobeat. Dave Rodgers, a Eurobeat artist, has described Para Para as the only way to dance to Eurobeat, which is usually \\"so fast.\\"The World of Italo Disco Interviews, Interview with Aleph  Description  Para Para dancing consists of mostly upper body movements in synchronization with a four-on-the-floor rhythm. Dancing involves choreographed motions with the arms and hands while stepping to the right and left, similar to the movements of traditional festival dances such as Bon Odori and cheering squads called Ōendan. Para Para is generally danced to eurobeat and Eurodance music, with each track having its own dance routine. ParaPara involves very little lower body movement, with the exception of moving one's hips, stepping in place, and jumping or hopping. Some routines feature more complex leg movements. Routines are generally choreographed by groups affiliated with popular clubs in Japan (see below). Fans of Para Para often refer to themselves as \\"Paralists\\" and include official and unofficial teams of dancers in Japan, Chile, Brazil, Spain, The United States, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Finland, and several other countries. Some teams are recognized by major Japanese music labels such as Avex and have been featured in Japanese media such as the magazine Egg. Para Para dancing's history is largely described by the community and historians in terms of \\"booms\\", during which Para Para's popularity was increased. Times of decreased popularity are referred to as \\"glacial\\" periods. To date, there have been four distinct \\"booms\\", each with a distinct cultural and historical context. Origin There are several theories about the origin of ParaPara dancing. One view is that it started in the early 1980s when men working in the VIP room in clubs would choreograph dances to impress women clientele. Another view is that it developed from the Takenoko-zoku subculture that would gather in the pedestrian plaza of Yoyogi Park in Harajuku to dance choreographed routines to popular music and disco.Web Japan, Let's Do The Para-Para!!YouTube, Youth of 1980s Tokyo, Japan Etymology It is thought that the term \\"ParaPara\\" is derived from the onomatopoeic expression of one's hand movements along with the music, where the beat of the music was described similarly to \\"Pa-pa pa- pa-ra ra-ra\\", similar to \\"boop-boop-bee-doop\\" in English.  History = 1st Boom (1987–1992)  ParaPara is thought to have started in the late 1980s at high-class discos during Japan's bubble era. Men dressed in black suits would teach routines at clubs such as Aoyama King & Queen and Maharaja Azabu- jūban. It is difficult to learn some of the dances due to the fact that no recordings exist of the routines. It is also largely unknown which clubs made specific routines during this era because of this.  Wangan  The term mainly describes the choreography that came from the clubs around Tokyo Bay around 1993. Some of these clubs include Eden Roc and Maharaja Azabu-jūban. The choreography is very hard to find, like 1st Boom videos, but it is slightly easier due to the availability of recording devices at the time. Routines of songs from the latter half of the Eurobeat Fantasy, That's Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat volumes 1 through 49, and Maharaja Night Hi-NRG Revolution volumes 1 through 9 music series are usually categorized as wangan. Some wangan ParaPara videos include Venus Cafe Special and Kyoto Gingerman One Gun. Unfortunately, many of the wangan dancers have retired from dancing ParaPara. There are currently very few club events in Japan that play wangan songs.  2nd Boom (1993–1995)  Many ParaPara routines originate from this era. Clubs like Xenon, Twinstar, King & Queen, and Maharaja were very popular during this period. It was also during this period when Avex Trax, an independent music label in Japan that produces Super Eurobeat, released one of the first officially licensed ParaPara videos to clubs on March 21, 1994, entitled \\"ParaPara Kyouten 0\\" (パラパラ教典 0). The video features 40 songs from the 2nd boom era and most of the featured routines are still danced today. The beginning of this boom can be marked by the release of Super Eurobeat volume 40 and lasted until as late as Super Eurobeat volume 80. During the latter half of this boom, some clubs created \\"unofficial\\" routines, referred to as \\"maniac\\", which were featured in Hibiya Radio City, Yokohama Maharaja, and Tottori Eleven.  3rd Boom (1999–2001)  The cause of this boom has largely been credited to the appearance of Takuya Kimura on SMAPxSMAP, a television program, dancing to \\"Night of Fire\\" / Niko and \\"Mickey Mouse March\\" (Eurobeat Version) / Domino. During this period, with Xenon closed, Twinstar continued to make routines. 9LoveJ and Velfarre started making their own routines. The popularity of this period early on was amplified by gal-culture as well. In commercial videos, Avex and other competitors like Victor and Digibeat began releasing regular commercial parapara videos that featured routines for songs from their respective Eurobeat CDs. Some of these series include ParaPara Paradise, ParaPara Panic!, and Euroパラパラ How. ParaPara Paradise was the most popular series in sales and featured an idol group called ParaPara Allstars (PPA). The group originally consisted of Richie, Maki, Miho, Satoko, Tomomi, and Ryoko. At the time, Richie had been in many Twinstar videos and Satoko was featured in many 9LoveJ videos. Some people regard them as idols today. During this period, maniac dances also were choreographed. Some of the more popular club events were Medusa and Joy.  4th Boom (2005–2010)  Although it is widely disputed that there was a 4th boom, even among Japanese historians, there was a noticeable change in the parapara scene in 2005. Avex became aggressive in selling parapara DVDs like the Gazen ParaPara!! series and We Love TechPara series in 2005, which began in this boom. Its height could be considered to be 2007 when Farm Records was releasing ParaPara DVDs or circa 2009 when the ani-para boom reached its height. Circa 2008, many ParaPara routines were being choreographed to eurobeat remixes of anime songs. The dances were mainly choreographed by 9LoveJ. When the ani-para boom ended in 2010, Avex stopped releasing videos and 9LoveJ removed ParaPara from their event altogether. At the time of writing, there have been no major commercially released ParaPara videos since then. As for maniac events, Joy and TMD choreographed until around 2008, when they stopped altogether.  4th Boom Glacial Period (2010–)  With Avex Trax halting all commercial ParaPara videos, the marketing that was associated with it dwindled as well. As a result, there has been a noticeable decline in newer paralists. This decline has deeply affected the ParaPara scene and has resulted in a decline of club event attendance. As a response to the attendance decline, many events such as StarFire, Ravenous, and others have moved to smaller venues to save costs rather than stopping. The Internet has changed the ParaPara scene, even in Japan as well. Currently, the community learns routines from people who film the choreographers teaching the dances at club events. However, many of the lessons can now be found on YouTube, with even some events posting their own lessons as opposed to third parties.ParaPara Lovers What Is ParaPara? In addition, the only official club events that are active are SEF and Starfire. 9LoveJ stopped playing eurobeat and hyper techno around the end of 2010.  Variants  Some variants of Para Para dancing are TechPara (danced to hyper techno) and TraPara (danced to trance). This is also known as Torapara due to the word trance being written as in Japanese. There are people who make their own parapara routines to their favorite Eurobeat songs. These Parapara routines are called Oripara. Oripara is typically a reserved word for routines that are not made by famous parapara choreographers or taught at parapara club events.  Official vs. maniac  The term \\"official\\" in the parapara world describes routines made by certain clubs/choreography groups in Japan. A non-exhaustive list of official club events are Starfire, SEF, 9LoveJ, and Twinstar. These routines are danced and learned by most people in the community. In a response to official routines, people have made their own in Japan called \\"maniac\\" routines. This movement started in the late 1990s with clubs like Hibiya Radio City and Tottori Eleven choreographing their own routines. In addition to the club events mentioned, other famous maniac club events that existed were Medusa, Area, Joy, AXOS, Bless, and TMD. , club events in Japan have not choreographed many maniac routines and this movement has basically stopped. However, some official club events like Starfire and SEF still go on today. Some paralists prefer maniac to official routines, though, and continue to have small events like Ravenous that play songs that have maniac dances to them.  Choreographer groups  There are a few choreographer groups that have stood out in the history of ParaPara. is a long-running group of choreographers that has had many members. It is unclear when the group first began, but it is assumed to be in the early 1990s. The team had the most impact in Twinstar where they choreographed most of the ParaPara routines. There were many members in the 1990s, but the most famous members were , , , , and . Their real names in that order, with the exception of because his real name is unknown, are Keita Fukaya, Takashi Arai, Taisuke Hotta, and Haruki Takahashi. All of these members listed appear in Twinstar club videos at least once. , however, the only members of are , , and , who are all currently choreographers of Starfire.ParaPara Lovers Shishou Gundan Their real names are Yoshihiro Yamada, Ryohei Yamaoka, and Katsuyoshi Inomata. T-RREX is also a long-running official choreographer group. The initials stand for Twinstar, Rie, Richie, Xenon which refers to when T-RREX was started. The most famous and long-running members are , , and . They mainly choreograph for the club event StarFire these days because Twinstar closed in 2003. As of 2010, has not been active in the ParaPara community and does not dance ParaPara much anymore. It is unclear if is still in T-RREX. Team SEF is another long-running official choreographer group. They strictly choreograph for the club event SEF. The name \\"Team SEF\\" wasn't popular until the SEF Gold club videos were first released around 2004. The members around that time were Ichi, Omami, Rena, Yano, Shingo, Kahori, and possibly Satoko. After Velfarre closed in 2006, almost all of the members were replaced when the SEF event changed names to SEF Deluxe. The members as of 2015 are Manami, Rumine, Kaihei, Kei, Mai, Shiori and Sakiko.SEF DX, SEF DX Team & Staff  Typical ParaPara club event  In any given week, there are multiple ParaPara events in Japan. A typical ParaPara club event begins the first 30 minutes by playing either Italo disco, dance, or other genres besides Eurobeat. Usually there are not many people during the first 30 minutes, so this is why it is done. After the first 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the number of people in the club, danceable music starts. Depending on the event, the first danceable songs played are different. For example, if one was at an event where the DJs played only Eurobeat songs from the 1990s, then the first songs would be from 1990-1991. If one were at a more official/modern event like SEF or StarFire, the songs would probably start around 1998-1999, when the 3rd ParaPara boom began. In most events, the songs have some sort of progression by year released, continuing until the end of the club event. Some events play whatever they feel like and may start playing songs from 2006, for example. There are some events that play Techno as well as Eurobeat. In these events, there are rarely people who dance both ParaPara and TechPara. Most people sit out one or the other, depending on what routines they know. At most club events, there is a where new ParaPara routines are taught. This is a very important part of a club event because, without club lessons, there might not be new ParaPara routines. A lesson is usually taught in 15 or 20 minutes. During a lesson, the new routine is danced first with music. After that, with the help of a commentator to give counts, the dancer slowly dances each part of the routine to help people learn it without music. After this is done, the routine is danced for a final time with music. After the lesson, there are two or three more sets of songs played until the event ends.  Club videos  Club videos are an important part of ParaPara, but their importance has changed over the years. The first-known ParaPara club video to be released was released by Avex Trax as a promotional VHS on March 21, 1994 called .Discogs Para Para Video (ParaPara Kyouten 0) After that, many club videos were released as people were not able to film lessons in the 1990s. They became highly desirable commodities to some people because lessons were almost impossible to find before 2004-2005 and many dancers perform routines. These videos are not sold commercially and are generally only distributed at only one event, which makes them extremely rare and impossible for foreigners to see. Because of these reasons, random people began to sell club videos, mainly DVD copies, online on auction websites like Yahoo! Auctions Japan and Mobaku.jp. A full series of SEF Gold for example would usually sell for about 5,000 yen while a much longer series like Xenon would sell for 9,000 yen or more. As of 2010, with the decline of ParaPara, this has basically stopped. However, a project that began on March 9, 2013 on YouTube called ParaPara Open Source Project has attempted to solve the problem of the rarity of club videos by uploading them to the public.YouTube paraparaopensource Club videos released since 2009 have become less and less important as some people have begun to upload lessons mainly to video-sharing websites like YouTube. Because of this, club events like StarFire have at least one routine on a club video that has never been taught as a lesson. In the 2010s, club videos are not released as much anymore with new DVDs only being distributed by StarFire and SEF every 5–6 months. This is a sharp difference from 1994-1995 when there over 100 club videos released across Japan in only two years.  Refilms  A refilm is a home-made, usually non-profit video in which dancers film themselves dancing parapara routines. The routines usually come from commercial or club videos, but some have been known to film their own routines, which is a phenomenon called \\"oripara.\\" These videos have not played a big part in the Japanese parapara community, possibly for copyright reasons, but they are very big part of the international parapara community since there are no large parapara events outside Japan. The two general purposes of a refilm are to highlight a rare routine or to show the public ones' skills. With the advent of YouTube, refilms have become more visible internationally to even non-paralists.

In popular culture  * Para Para experienced a huge boom in Japan in 1998–1999 when pop idol Takuya Kimura of SMAP performed it on television. It had such a large impact that even Mickey Mouse danced it in Tokyo Disneyland.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rlhdRaIVU People in Mickey Mouse and other Tokyo Disneyland costumes appeared on television dancing it with Takuya Kimura.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KvIep9qtKc * The Japanese video game company Konami has released a series of video games called ParaParaParadise as part of its Bemani series of music-based games. The games feature an octagonal platform with motion detecting sensors above it. Players must trigger the sensors by moving their arms (or other body parts) under the sensors when the corresponding arrow reaches the top of the screen placed at the front of the platform. * Para Para Sakura, a film starring Aaron Kwok, features some Para Para dancing. The theme song for the film, \\"Para Para Sakura\\", is not related to any form of Para Para-based music. * In one episode of the anime Dragon Ball GT, Goku, his granddaughter Pan, their friend Trunks, and even the robot Giru are put under a Para Para-type dance by the three Para Para Brothers. * In the manga Gals!, Para Para dancing is a popular pastime for the main character Kotobuki Ran. * In the video game Rumble Roses XX, one of the penalty games of Queen's Match is Para Para dancing. The girl who loses is forced to perform the dance and depending on the costume the player chose, the girl may have a positive, neutral, or negative reaction. * Para Para dancing is featured heavily in the 2006 Japanese dorama Gal Circle. Many of the episodes revolve around it and nearly all of the major characters belong to a gal circle that is dedicated to it. * K-pop girl group Kara created a rendition of the Para Para dance (also known as the \\"KARApara\\") for their fourth Japanese single \\"Go Go Summer!\\". * The eighth opening to the anime Detective Conan, \\"Koi wa Thrill, Shock, Suspence\\" by Rina Aiuchi, features the main character, Edogawa Conan, performing a Para Para dance to the song.  Outside Japan  The United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Finland, France, Taiwan, Spain, Chile, Scandinavia, Brazil, Argentina and other countries outside Japan have an active fanbase doing refilms on the Internet. These dancers have circles and groups that host panels at anime conventions where they teach parapara routines. The only western parapara team ever to have been paid to perform ParaPara in Japan is American Dream which performed a special performance at Avex Rave 2005.Veoh Avex Rave 2005 ParaPara Clip [American Dream] In the United States Geneon Entertainment released the Para Para MAX US Mix series of CDs, which contain remixes of anime theme music from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Pokémon, Magic Knight Rayearth, and many other anime productions. Volumes 1, 2, and 3 were released in 2005. Geneon held contests to promote the CD and its anime series. 2005's contest was held at Otakon on 20 August 2005. Geneon's efforts failed to expand the reach of Para Para in the United States. Regardless of this, Geneon released a Para Para instructional DVD called ParaPara MAX: The Moves 101, featuring several United States paralists. The DVD did not sell well due to an exclusive sales agreement with Media Play, Sam Goody and Suncoast Motion Picture Company, which soon went out of business. After the Anime Fusion Tour's conclusion in the summer of 2006, Yoko Ishida's management changed, which led to the end of Geneon's promotion of Para Para in the United States. Between the years of 2006 and 2007 parapara briefly went mainstream in Germany and Austria due to the artist Shanadoo who danced parapara in some of their music video clips. In the rest of Asia some editions of the ParaPara Paradise series were released in Hong Kong. It is widely known and accepted among the members of the international parapara community that parapara's popularity outside Japan is very low.

Donaldson. The series began as a trilogy, entitled The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever. This was followed by another trilogy, The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, and finally a tetralogy, The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. The main character of the stories surround Thomas Covenant, an embittered and cynical writer, afflicted with leprosy and shunned by society, is fated to become the heroic savior of the Land, an alternate world. In ten novels, published between 1977 and 2013, he struggles against Lord Foul, \\"the Despiser\\", who intends to escape the bondage of the physical universe and wreak revenge upon his arch-enemy, \\"the Creator\\".  The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever  # Lord Foul's Bane (1977) # The Illearth War (1978; \\"Gilden- Fire\\" - first published 1981)Gilden-Fire . Gilden-Fire Manuscripts (held by KSU Special Collections and Archives). # The Power that Preserves (1979) The story \\"Gilden-Fire\\" first appeared as an independent novella, but is most widely available as a part of most versions of the Donaldson short story collection, Daughter of Regals, 1985.Interview It was set during the action of The Illearth War, and covers an episode from the doomed mission to contact the Giants. Gilden-Fire is told from the point of view of Korik, the senior Bloodguard on the mission. It describes Korik's selection of the mission's Bloodguard, then narrates the mission's passage through Grimmerdhore forest, where they defeat an ambush of ur-viles and kresh (wolves). The narrative ends as the mission leaves the forest. As per the author's foreword. Gilden-Fire was originally part of a larger, planned section of The Illearth War that followed the mission to the Giants in \\"real time\\", but was cut due to space restrictions as well as point-of-view inconsistency with the rest of the Chronicles. The events during the trek through Grimmerdhore are not mentioned in the published narrative of The Illearth War, and some information shared here on the origin and motivation of the Bloodguard does appear in other contexts in the published Chronicles. The rest of the mission after the Grimmerdhore passage was included in the Chronicles, via the narrative device of Bloodguard messengers.  The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant  # The Wounded Land (1980) # The One Tree (1982) # White Gold Wielder (1983)  The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant  # The Runes of the Earth (2004) # Fatal Revenant (2007) # Against All Things Ending (2010) # The Last Dark (2013)  Peoples and creatures of the Land  Cavewights are dimly intelligent subterranean creatures skilled in metal working and mining. They are weak willed, and are easily intimidated by Lord Foul into serving him (though they once traded openly with the humans of the Land). They are described as having \\"long, scrawny limbs, hands as huge and heavy as shovels,\\" plus \\"a thin, hunched torso, and a head shaped like a battering ram.\\" Drool Rockworm is a cavewight. The Creator is the mysterious being who created the Land and the universe in which it exists. This universe is referred to as \\"the Land\\" but is clearly a different reality than Covenant's world. The fundamental structure of the universe, the Arch of Time, prevents the Creator from intervening directly in events in the world of his creation, and he never appears in physical form within that world. He can, however, manifest himself in the \\"real\\" world—he appears to Covenant and Linden as an old man in an ochre robe—and guides those who attempt to make contact between the universes. Demondim are a now-extinct race spawned by the Viles. They had a semi- corporeal nature, and could only achieve physical presence by animating dead bodies. (They are somewhat like dybbuks in this respect.) They were not originally wholly evil, but their inherent self-loathing was used by Lord Foul to gain their allegiance. They spawned two other races, the Waynhim and the ur-viles. Elohim are a race of spirits who possess god-like powers. To mortal perceptions, they appear as beautiful men and women in a remote, sealed-off region of the Earth, and spend their time in dazzling physical transformations. In their own perspective, they constitute the animating principle of the Earth, and the history of the Land is the manifestation of events in their own consciousness. As they regard their own domain as the only \\"real\\" place in the Earth, they rarely dabble in outside events. However, if they perceive a grave threat to the Earth, one of their number is \\"Appointed\\" to attempt to avert the threat – and to bear the cost of failing. Forestals are beings who serve the forests of the Land, the remnants of the One Forest, the great sentient wood which once covered the Land. They are human in appearance, but according to the Elohim they were created by the One Forest itself using knowledge from another Elohim imprisoned within the Colossus. The Forestals actively protected the remaining forest from destruction by encroaching mortals. They were more numerous in the distant past but few survived into the era of the New Lords. By the time of the Second Chronicles, when the remnants of the ancient forest (with the exception of Giant Woods in the Lower Land) were long dead, the last remaining Forestal lived in Andelain. His name was Caer-Caveral, though he was originally Hile Troy, a man from Covenant's world who had once been Warmark (commander-in-chief) of the Lords' army. Giants are a race of extremely long-lived (but nevertheless mortal) humanoids of unusual height and strength. Giants are known for their stone lore (similar to but not identical with that of the Stonedownors), their skill at seamanship, and their love of story-telling. A common Giantish interjection is, \\"Stone and Sea!\\" Giants are resistant to cold and cannot be harmed by ordinary fire. Fire does, however, cause them intense pain, which they use to cure themselves of grief in a ritual known as caamora. In return for a favor performed for the mysterious Elohim long ago, the entire race of Giants are endowed with an innate ability to speak and understand all languages. The Giants' own language is very florid and verbose, and they find human speech to be rather curt and inexpressive. The Giants of the Land are sometimes called the Unhomed since they were separated from their homeland long ago. Although the Giants love children, they are not fertile as a people, and their numbers in the Land in the time of the First Chronicles have dwindled. Kevin Landwaster entrusted them with the first of his Seven Wards before the Ritual of Desecration. They sometimes refer to humans as Rockbrothers and Rocksisters, in honor of the ancient alliance they made with High Lord Damelon Giantfriend. Saltheart Foamfollower is a Giant. Griffins are winged lions. They are sometimes ridden by ur-viles. Haruchai are a hardy race of warriors living in the Westron Mountains, west of the Land. The Haruchai shun the use of weapons or magic, taking pride in their own physical prowess and the purity of their service, which is never given lightly. They have the ability to communicate amongst themselves via telepathy, and each can access the combined memories of their entire race. Outwardly stoic, even seemingly emotionless, they could also be considered arrogant in their beliefs. It is revealed on several occasions that the Haruchai are a deeply passionate race, capable of swearing a lifetime's worth of service if sufficiently moved. The Insequent are a mysterious race of people who dwell to the west of the Land. Each Insequent has a unique and very focused skill that can seem magical or superhuman. These skills range from invisibility, virtual invulnerability or even time travel. They have an almost dismissive disdain for the Haruchai and a bitter and long-standing rivalry with The Elohim, which has not yet been fully explained. They rarely reveal their true names, but prefer to be identified by their titles. So far only four Insequent have appeared in the stories: The Mahdoubt, the Harrow, the Theomach and the Ardent. A fifth, the Vizard, is referenced by several other characters, and a sixth—the Auriference—is mentioned briefly by the Ardent, although both the Vizard and the Auriference are believed to be deceased. Lords are the leaders and stewards of the Land, also known as Earthfriends. The standards for Lordship are high, so they are generally few in number. In order to become a Lord, a person must master the martial arts and the use and application of magic. These skills are called the Sword and the Staff respectively, and together form the First Ward of Kevin's Lore, an ancient repository of knowledge. A student who masters both parts of the Lore – and does not opt to become Unfettered in order to pursue a private vision – is invited to join the Council of Lords at Revelstone, also known as Lord's Keep. The Lords carry special staffs that allow them to channel their power, and are easily identified by their sky blue robes. ' is the most commonly used name for the ancient enemy of the Land, given to him by the Council of Lords. He is also called 'The Despiser', the 'Gray Slayer' (his name in The Plains), 'Fangthane the Render' by the Ramen and 'a-Jeroth of the Seven Hells' by The Clave. According to Roger Covenant, he also called himself 'a-Jeroth' during the time he served on Kevin's council. He is described as \\"the wicked son or brother of the Creator's heart\\" and is the source of all evil in the Land. He is a being of pure spirit, although capable of taking on human form, and is apparently immortal: he cannot be killed, but his power can be reduced to near insignificance. On occasions when this has happened he has always been able to restore and regenerate his power. His desire to bring suffering to the earth and the Land in particular is manifested by his extremely well orchestrated and even cautious long-term plans throughout the chronicles. Ramen are the tenders of the Ranyhyn (see below). The Ramen's life-work is to serve the Ranyhyn, whom they hold in very high esteem. Traditionally they do not ride or otherwise subjugate the great horses, and can grow resentful of those who do. The fact that the Lords of Revelstone and the Bloodguard often ride the great horses is a major point of contention, but the Ramen tolerate this in deference to the Ranyhyn, who choose to give their service. When defending the Ranyhyn from Kresh (large wolves in service to the Despiser) or other predators, the Ramen frequently use ropes as garottes to break the attackers' necks. Ramen are organised into three \\"ranks\\": Manethralls who are the leaders, Cords who assist the Manethralls while training to become Manethralls themselves, and Winhomes who perform domestic supporting duties. Two other ranks are mentioned in The Runes of the Earth, Keepers and Curriers, but their placement within the Ramen hierarchy is not known. Ranyhyn are the great horses of the Land. These horses live on the Plains of Ra, and are tended by the Ramen. The Ranyhyn are akin to normal horses, but are larger, always have a star and are in some indefinable sense enhanced by the Earthpower of the Land, so that their speed and endurance, as well as their intelligence, far outstrip those of a standard horse. The Ranyhyn can be ridden by individuals they deem worthy, but a person who seeks such a mount must travel to the Plains of Ra and offer himself to the horses for consideration. If a Ranyhyn accepts a rider, it is loyal to that rider until death. All of the Bloodguard (apparently) are accepted by the Ranyhyn, but not all Lords have been deemed worthy. The Ranyhyn also have a limited ability to perceive the future; these horses can \\"hear\\" when their rider will need them, hearing their calling days or weeks before the rider makes the call. Thus, when the rider summons his Ranyhyn, it appears shortly thereafter, regardless of the distance between them. Ravers are bodiless evil spirits with the ability to possess and control some lesser creatures, and most humans as well. Giants and Bloodguard are typically immune to this power, and there are no known instances of a Raver possessing a Ranyhyn. There are only three Ravers, ancient brothers who each have many names but are commonly called turiya Herem, samādhi Sheol, and moksha Jehannum. Their greatest hatred is reserved for the trees of the One Forest of old, and their loathing of the Earthpower and all good things has led them to become Lord Foul's willing servants. The Despiser is somehow able to enhance their abilities when he pleases, but can prevent them from possessing individuals he deems too powerful. (They were not allowed to possess Thomas Covenant, for instance, because his ring would make them too powerful for Lord Foul to control.) This possession can be, and in some cases needs to be, facilitated by some external power. In the 'Illearth War' the Ravers were only able to possess their giant 'hosts' when they worked in harmony with the power of the Illearth Stone. They often serve as leaders in Lord Foul's armies, or as spies among his enemies. Stonedownors are humans descended from the Land's original inhabitants. They are known for their knowledge of stone lore and live in stone huts. A master of stone lore is called a \\"Gravelingas\\", or a Rhadhamaerl which also refers to the craft of stone lore. Stonedownors are typically dark-skinned, squat and muscular, though this is not always the case. Trell and Triock are both unusually tall for Stonedownors. During the Second Chronicles, their leaders are known as Gravellers, and sacrifice members of their village to use the blood to call forth the power of the Sunbane. Sunder, the Graveller of Mithil Stonedown, manages to use the power of Loric's Krill to summon forth the power of the Sunbane without shedding blood, and learns to manipulate the Sunbane for his own purposes. Ur-viles are creatures of jet black color and are constructions of an extinct race named the Demondim. They are highly magical, possessing a number of supernatural abilities, including shooting acid, creating bolts of pure energy and the like. They are blind, lacking any form of visual organ, but possess a preternatural sense of smell. One of their most distinctive features is that when assembled in a wedge formation, the leader (or loremaster) at the apex wields the combined power of the entire group, without weakening any of their kin in the rest of the wedge. The ur-viles initially served Lord Foul, but later turned against him by creating the creature Vain (from which the new Staff of Law was created). In The Runes of the Earth, the ur-viles have actively joined the side of \\"good\\", though their motivation remains unclear. Because they were made rather than born, the ur-viles loathe their own bodies and often redirect this rage towards other targets. They also do not die, except when killed, or reproduce naturally, although they do retain the lore required to construct more of their own kind and the Waynhim—however, their motivations for doing so are unlike those of natural creatures. Viles are an extinct race who spawned the Demondim. They were non- corporeal, but nonetheless very powerful. Initially a proud and gifted race, they were led into self-hatred and despair by the Ravers. They were eventually destroyed by the Council of Lords, under High Lord Loric \\"Vilesilencer\\". Waynhim are another race of creatures spawned by the Demondim (often referred to as the \\"accidental\\" or \\"lesser\\" creations, in contrast with the ur-viles). They closely resemble the Ur-viles (having no eyes, super-sensitive smell and hearing, and magical abilities), though they are smaller and lighter in color. Like the Ur-viles (who are their long-standing nemeses), the Waynhim were made rather than born. However, they do not share their cousins' self-hatred, and have dedicated themselves to serving the Land and the Earthpower according to their own peculiar ethical system, the Weird of the Waynhim. Like the Ur- viles, they fight in a wedge formation with a loremaster at the apex. Woodhelvennin are humans descended from the Land's original inhabitants. They are known for their use of wood lore and living in tree-top villages. The village elders are called Heers. A master of wood lore is called a Hirebrand, or a lillianrill. (Lillianrill usually refers to the craft of wood lore.) They are typically fair-skinned, tall and slender.  Main concepts  Map drawn by Lynn K. Plagge to illustrate the books. In Donaldson's fiction, Andelain is a focal region of the Land, where the Earthpower is especially strong. In the Second Chronicles it is the one place immune from the Sunbane, as it is protected by the Forestal Caer Caveral. Languages: Human inhabitants of the Land (together with Giants, Cavewights, and the human inhabitants of other regions of the Earth) all appear to speak modern English, though their style of speech is usually rather formal and archaic. The strange commonality of language between Covenant and the Land's inhabitants is never addressed in the books. There are, however, other languages extant: for example, in Lord Foul's Bane, Atiaran tells Thomas Covenant that a different language was spoken in the age of the Old Lords. (However, this appears to be contradicted in Fatal Revenant, when Linden Avery and Berek Halfhand converse together in English.) Non-humans also have their own languages, for example the barking speech of ur-viles and Waynhim, the Giants' florid and ornate language, and the native tongue of the Haruchai. In the Second Chronicles it is explained that the Giants received \\"the gift of tongues\\" from the Elohim as a reward for the telling of a simple tale, and the Bhrathair, a people who live on the edge of the Great Desert, also speak their own language, which is described only as sounding \\"brackish\\". Worm/Word/Weird. In the cosmology of the Land, the Earth's core consists of a coiled-up serpent called the \\"Worm of the World's End\\". When Covenant attempts to sever a branch of the One Tree by using the power of the white gold, he risks rousing the Worm (which is not fully asleep, but merely resting) and thus destroying the Earth. The Waynhim and Ur-viles believe in a principle of ethics or destiny called the \\"Weird\\". The Elohim have a concept which appears to do duty for both these beliefs: it is impossible to determine whether the sound used for this is \\"Worm\\", \\"Word\\" or \\"Weird\\", as it comes out in a blurred form sounding something like \\"Würd\\".  Law  Law is the natural order; a body of principles which defines and governs the way in which the world works. Some parts of the Law conform to the scientific laws of the real world: gravity and motion, for example operate as the reader expects them to. Other aspects of Law are unlike the real world. Chief among these is the accessibility of Earthpower. Another important difference is that Law is not inherently inviolable. Acts of thaumaturgy can create phenomena which do not conform to Law. In some instances, the violation of a Law can cause that law to stop operating altogether, which results in a major shift in the nature of the world. The novels have discussed three Laws in detail: the Law of Time, the Law of Death, and the Law of Life. The Law of Time is the most basic and fundamental aspect of Law: it defines the nature and structure of time, and provides a \\"place\\" in which the Earth can exist. It requires that instants and events proceed in an orderly fashion from cause to effect. The consequences of all actions must be borne. Although a later action might reverse the effects of an earlier one, those effects (and the earlier action itself) cannot be made to have not been. Any attempt to alter past events risks creating a paradox, which would destroy the structure of time, taking the entire Earth with it.  Terminology  In the Thomas Covenant stories, Donaldson takes several terms from Sanskrit that are significant in Hinduism and Buddhism and reassigns them meanings in the Land. For example, the term moksha, which in Sanskrit refers to liberation from the cycle of sorrow, is given as the original name for a creature of depravity and evil called a Raver. Another Raver, Satansfist, is called samādhi, which in Sanskrit refers to a state of mind in which one achieves oneness with the object of one's concentration. The third Raver, Kinslaughterer, is called turiya, Sanskrit for a state of pure consciousness. Donaldson has commented on his website that moksha, samadhi, and turiya are ways the Ravers describe themselves, while their other names are given by others. Donaldson repeats this application of Sanskrit terms to seemingly unrelated aspects of the Land to other terms, including: dukkha, dharmakshetra, ahamkara, and yajna. The Chronicles also contain names of Semitic origin. For instance, samadhi/Satansfist is also called \\"Sheol\\", (Hebrew for the grave, the abode of the dead), moksha/Fleshharrower is also known as \\"Jehannum\\" (similar to the Hebrew \\"Gehinnom\\" and the Arabic \\"Jahannum\\", for Hell or Purgatory), and turiya/Kinslaughterer is also \\"Herem\\" (Hebrew for banned, excluded, excommunicated and Arabic for sinful or forbidden [Haram]). The name of the fairy race of Elohim is the Hebrew for God.  Critical response  The first volume in the series was included in David Pringle's book Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels. Conversely, in 1986, David Langford published an essay by Nick Lowe, in which Lowe suggested \\"a way to derive pleasure from Stephen Donaldson books. (Needless to say, it doesn't involve reading them.)\\" This proposal involved a game he called \\"Clench Racing\\", wherein players each open a volume of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant to a random page; the winner is the first to find the word \\"clench\\". Lowe describes it as a \\"fast\\" game – \\"sixty seconds is unusually drawn out\\". In 1995, scholar W. A. Senior published a full-length study published by Kent State University Press entitled Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant: Variations on the Fantasy of Tradition. It situates the Chronicles in the context of the fantasy tradition and argues that \\"Donaldson has created an important contribution to the canon because of his serious intent and adult concerns, his powerful mythopoesis, and his manipulation of the conventions of epic fantasy.\\" In 2009, James Nicoll said that Thomas Covenant would win a \\"special lifetime achievement award\\" for the \\"most unlikeable supposedly sympathetic protagonist\\".Inspired by previous discussions by James Nicoll, December 28, 2009, at Livejournal.

There are two main titles: Syndicate (1993) and Syndicate Wars (1996), both of which are isometric real- time tactics games. An additional first-person shooter Syndicate title was released in 2012, and a spiritual successor to the series (returning to the real-time tactics format), entitled Satellite Reign, was released in 2015. Games= Syndicate (1993)  Syndicate, the first game in the series, was first released for PC and Amiga in June 1993, with later releases on other platforms including Sega Genesis, SNES, and PlayStation Portable. In 2015, the game was made available for free on Electronic Arts' Origin platform. however it now costs £4.25 (As of 20JUN19) https://www.origin.com/gbr/en- us/store/syndicate/syndicate-1993 An expansion pack, titled Syndicate: American Revolt, was also released for PC and Amiga in 1993.  Syndicate Wars  The second game in the series, Syndicate Wars, was released for PC in October 1996 and PlayStation in July 1997. Syndicate Wars utilized a more demanding graphics engine, including a 3-dimensional environment, compared with the 2-dimensional layout of Syndicate). In 2008, a digital distribution version of the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network.  Syndicate (2012)  Reports of a new Syndicate game, developed for EA by Starbreeze Studios, first surfaced in March 2009 and were officially confirmed in September 2011. The game, also entitled Syndicate, was released on 21 February 2012; however, it used a first-person shooter format, which differed significantly from the isometric real-time tactics format of the series' original games.  Future and cancelled games  According to a former Bullfrog Productions employee, a follow-up Syndicate title for PC began development shortly after the release of Dungeon Keeper 2 in 1999; however, this development effort was never completed. This was followed by several further development efforts which did not progress. Alt URL The same employee states that a Syndicate title on PlayStation 2 was under development for approximately one year; however, this title was also never released. It was intended to feature featuring a \\"free-roaming multi-tiered city\\" and two new factions, known as the Freemen and the Hybrid. Several pieces of concept art from this project were released by another former Bullfrog employee, Mike Man. In a 2006 interview at the Leipzig Games Convention for GameSpot, Peter Molyneux (co-founder of Bullfrog Productions) said that he would like to revisit some of his old efforts, but adds that it is very unlikely that will happen; however, Molyneux made one possible exception: > \\"Aside from the licensing complications, some sort of next-gen online > version of Syndicate would certainly be popular with gamers.\\" = Creation = A Bullfrog project named Creation was intended to take place on an alien world set in the Syndicate universe. The game's plot was to have EuroCorp as the antagonists, while the player, representing a third-party biologist, utilized semi-sentient dolphins to fight them. Following development for MS-DOS, Amiga CD32, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn, the game was cancelled in 1997.  Related games  Satellite Reign = On 15 May 2013, Mike Diskett (who was the producer and lead programmer for Syndicate Wars) posted a video on YouTube that revealed an imminent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a new spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars, called Satellite Reign, which returned to the series' original real-time tactics format. When it closed on 28 July 2013, the campaign had raised £461,333 ($720,832), compared to its £350,000 ($546,875) goal. Satellite Reign was subsequently released on August 28, 2015. Plot= Syndicate (1993) and Syndicate Wars  The original Syndicate is set in the year 2096. As outlined in the game's instruction manual, multinational megacorporations, have replaced global governments and one such corporation, named EuroCorp, have established the \\"CHIP\\": a device inserted into a person's neck which alters their perception (\\"numbing their senses to the misery and squalor around them\\") and allows them to be directly manipulated. The megacorporations have subsequently been infiltrated and overtaken by corrupt crime Syndicates, fighting for global control. The player is placed in charge one such corporation, for which they choose a name and logo. During the course of the game, as missions for the player's corporation are completed by teams of cyborg enforcers (known as \\"agents\\"), it gains global dominance over its competitors. Syndicate Wars is set 95 years after the original game (in the year 2191), when EuroCorp holds full global control, using CHIP technology to influence the population. At this point, the release of a virus into the global communications network leads to CHIP failures, resulting in the emergence of armed insurrectionists, referred to as \\"unguided citizens\\". The group responsible for the viral attack is a militant religious organisation, named the Church of the New Epoch. The game's instruction manual specifically addresses the player as a newly hired EuroCorp executive; however, they can choose to control agents from either EuroCorp (to suppress uprisings resulting from the virus outbreak) or the Church of the New Epoch (to seize power from EuroCorp). The game ends with a battle for control of ionosphere calibration equipment on the moon, which the Church's leaders intend to use in eliminating life on Earth; however (regardless of which faction the player chooses to play as), the leaders are eliminated before this plan can be executed.  Syndicate (2012)  The plot of the later Syndicate game renames the CHIP technology to the \\"DART chip\\", and introduces the concept of the \\"unchipped\\", a proportion of the world's population who declined the use of this technology. The game is set in the year 2069 (prior to the original games), at which point, EuroCorp is already an established global mecorporation. The main story focuses on a specific agent, named Miles Kilo. Kilo uncovers a plot from a rival corporation, Aspari, to begin a war against EuroCorp, before discovering that EuroCorp killed his family, abducted him as a baby and modified his memory. The game ends with the apparent downfall of EuroCorp.  Gameplay  Gameplay for the original Syndicate games involved ordering a team of four cyborg agents around gritty cyberpunk-themed cities, in pursuit of mission goals, such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, \\"persuading\\" civilians and scientists to join the corporation/church, demolishing buildings, or killing enemy agents. Unlike some games, which either punish the player for civilian deaths or reward them for violent actions committed, Syndicate remains indifferent. The player must collect funds to finance the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades, such as by taxing conquered territories (in the original game) or robbing banks (in Syndicate Wars). Notable features of both original games are the use of context-sensitive background music, which changes to suit the mood of the on-screen action, and a high degree of interactivity: many objects in the first game, and nearly every object in the second game, can be destroyed. The visual aesthetic of these games borrows heavily from films such as Blade Runner. The gameplay of the 2012 Syndicate game did not include the same real-time tactics and strategy elements as the previous games, instead following a typical first-person shooter format.

Ecology Jassa falcata constructs tubes of debris. It is a fouling organism, growing on the bottoms of ships and slowing them down. J. falcata forms dense mats or nests. The male and the female live in different tubes. J. falcata feeds generally on hydroid growth on the bottom of rafts and ships. It is generally a suspension feeder normally found on sediment areas. Description Amphipods have two pairs of antennae. In J. falcata the first antennae have two-segmented flagella and are shorter and more slender than the second antennae. Males are 7–13 mm long and females are 6–12 mm. Colours vary but are usually yellow-grey with brown, red or black patches depending on the colour of the habitat. Distribution Jassa falcata is found on all British coasts. It has also been reported in several sites around the coast of Ireland.

It was founded in 1764 by what is now Columbia University in order to properly prepare incoming freshmen in the fields of English, Greek, and Latin grammar.Sullivan, McDonald and Dixon, Ross, Columbia Grammar School 1764–1964: A Historical Log. 1965, p. 1. By 1865, the school had grown substantially and was no longer connected to the university.Sullivan, McDonald and Dixon, Ross, Columbia Grammar School 1764–1964: A Historical Log. 1965, p. 31. The school was originally known as The Grammar School of King's College (King's College was the original name of Columbia University). The school changed its name concurrently with the university during the American Revolution to Columbia Grammar School, and added the word \\"preparatory\\" in 1969. While \\"grammar\\" and \\"preparatory\\" have differing connotations, the entire school is known by its full name. The school has existed in several locations over the centuries. In 1907, the school moved to its current location on 93rd Street, off Central Park West. It originally consisted of one building, and expanded by adding five brownstones through the merger of the adjacent Leonard School for Girls in 1956. A building across the street was built in 1984, followed by two more in 1997 and 2001. An administration building was added to the school in 2009. In the past 20 years, the size of the graduating class has more than doubled from approximately 45 to approximately 125. History Columbia Grammar School was founded in 1764, just ten years after the founding of King's College (later Columbia University). Originally established as a boys' preparatory school for the college, it functioned for one hundred years under the direct auspices of the college. One of the most illustrious headmasters during that period was Dr. Charles Anthon, one of America's earliest and most distinguished classical scholars. During his tenure the Grammar School provided over half the students to Columbia College's freshman class. In 1864, when Dr. Anthon retired as headmaster, the trustees of Columbia College terminated their relationship with the Grammar School and the school became a proprietary institution, only achieving its nonprofit status in 1941.Sullivan, McDonald and Dixon, Ross, \\"Columbia Grammar School 1764–1964, A Historical Log\\". 1965, p. 52 In 1937, the Leonard School for Girls was founded, using several interconnected brownstones on West 94th Street (now part of the lower school). The school joined with the Grammar School in 1956 to become a coed institution. As the 13th headmaster in the school's long history, Dr. Richard J. Soghoian (1981-2017) guided the physical expansion of the school from its 1906 home at 5 West 93rd Street to the present complex, which totals with 14 buildings between 92nd and 94th streets. In 2017, Dr. Richard Soghoian, who had held the position of headmaster since 1981, retired.Goldman, Victoria, \\"The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools, 6th Edition\\", Soho Press, 2010, p. 187 As of the 2017 school year, the new headmaster is Dr. William Donohue. Dr. Stanley Seidman was the Grammar School director until his retirement in 2010; the current Grammar School director is Sarah McLean. Joanie Dean is the current Prep School director. The school serves grades Pre-kindergarten to 12 and offers a college preparatory curriculum. Accreditation Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School is a fully independent, non-sectarian school governed by a board of trustees composed of alumni and parents. The school is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and the New York State Board of Regents. The school is a member of the Independent School Admissions Association of Greater New York (ISAAGNY). Campus 5 West 93rd Street 94th Street Brownstones The school began its expansion in 1984 with the construction of a new Preparatory School at 4 West 93rd, containing a full-sized gymnasium, three science labs, state-of-the art computer lab, library, three music studios, and nine classrooms. Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School greatly expanded its physical plant after 1985. Three new buildings and a fully renovated brownstone have, together with the existing buildings, added academic facilities as well as two new theaters, several computer labs, a variety of art studios and space for a growing music program. The Grammar School is located in a series of five interconnecting brownstones on 94th Street just off Central Park, and the 1905 Columbia Grammar School building at 5 West 93rd Street. In addition to classrooms, these house two libraries, two art studios, a gymnasium, swimming pool, two music studios, a science lab, a computer lab, and the Grammar School cafeteria. In 1996, 36 West 93rd Street was completed, adding of space to the physical plant. This building, which goes through from 93rd to 92nd Street, has two computer labs, five art studios, library, science labs, and classrooms for grades 5 and 6, a fully equipped theater, and a large cafeteria. In September 2001 a major addition was added onto the high school containing yet another full-sized gym, a state- of-the-art theater, and three floors of classrooms and science labs. Five new classrooms were also added.\\"Our Campus\\" – Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School website Since then, many brownstones have been added, one entirely for offices, and one building dedicated to the arts. A walkway has been built behind the multiple brownstones to make them easier to navigate. In 2009, CGPS purchased several new brownstones, one entirely for the kindergarten, another for a science building, and one for administrative offices. The Prep School also added a new level to its library. The new CGPS Middle School opened its doors to students in grades 5, 6 and 7 on Thursday, September 8, 2016. Two floors were added to the existing 36 West 93rd Street building to create a 6th and 7th floor solely for these grades, while the remainder of the building has been renovated. The ground floor now features an expansive yoga and dance studio; the existing Prep School cafeteria has been renovated and a second floor cafeteria was added specifically for Middle School students. New art studios as well as a new library, three science labs, a rooftop play yard and twelve classrooms have been added to the building. The HVAC system has been updated and the building is fully handicap-accessible.

Early life Cobbing was born in Enfield and grew up within the Plymouth Brethren. He attended Enfield Grammar School and then trained as an accountant. He later went to Bognor Training College to become a teacher. During the Second World War, he was a conscientious objector. Early involvement with poetry and performance His involvement with performance began with the Hendon Experimental Art Club and the Hendon-based magazine And in 1951. This led to his setting up Writers Forum, which began publishing in 1963. In 1964 he published ABC in Sound, a book that combined his interest in sound and concrete poetry in an exploration of the visual and auditory possibilities of the English alphabet. Better Books He left teaching around this time and managed Better Books on Charing Cross Road, London. Better Books was more than a mere bookshop. Once described as a ‘mini Arts Lab’ it served as stage, cinema and gallery. Its cross-disciplinary approach welcomed new art forms like assemblage, performance art, and radical poetry. Together with other alternative galleries such as 26 Kingly Street and Indica Bookshop, Better Books was one of the hot spots of the London underground scene. This shop was the venue for a number of events and happenings associated with what Cobbing's friend Jeff Nuttall termed the Bomb Culture, the British version of the 1960s counterculture. As an evolution of the earlier Hendon Film Society he began avant-garde film screenings under the title Cinema 65 which led to the formation of the London Film-Makers' Co-opThe pre-history of the London Co-op: from HAT Film Club to Cinema 65 1970s During the first half of the 1970s, Cobbing was able to use the facilities of the Poetry Society to produce Writers Forum books. In all, the press published over 1,000 titles between 1963 and 2002. As well as fostering the younger poets of the British Poetry Revival, Writers Forum also published works by John Cage, Allen Ginsberg and Ian Hamilton Finlay. Writers Forum also ran a regular Saturday afternoon writers' workshop at which poets read and discussed each other's work. In the early 1970s the Poetry Society did not have any printing facilities. Cobbing had his own equipment elsewhere throughout the 40 years of his (largely solo) operation of Writers Forum. In the mid-1970s, against tremendous opposition of the rump of the old guard on the Poetry Society General Council, Cobbing and others opened a public print shop on the society's premises. Cobbing brought in his own equipment and allowed it to be used by anyone wishing to print their own book of poetry. Later the society provided a desktop litho, plate-maker and golfball typewriter with a diversion of the funds allocated to Poetry Review which was henceforth, for some years, printed in house. Cobbing also explored his interest in performance works for multiple voices and musical instruments in groups like Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle, which included poets Paula Claire and Bill Griffiths and musician Michael Chant. He was also co-founder of the Association of Little Presses, an organisation that promoted the work of small publishers in Britain and Ireland. Later life and work Cobbing was a prolific writer and performer and continued to work right up to his death. In 2000, he performed with Lawrence Upton and Derek Shiel at The Klinker, Islington, London.\\"List of Performances\\", Sculpted Sound website He also used his teacher training to work on performances with schoolchildren. Much of his later work consists of visual texts, artist's books and markings that were used as notations or, more strictly speaking, jumping off points for performance. He also worked on more directly collaborative works with other poets, such as the Domestic Ambient Noise project, a series of 300 booklets created with his friend and fellow Writers Forum editor Lawrence Upton. Since Cobbing's death, Upton has carried on the work of running Writers Forum.  Legacy  In 2005, the British Library acquired The Papers of Bob Cobbing consisting of personal material, correspondence, his works, and papers relating to Writers Forum, to the Association of Little Presses (ALP), and to the New River Project.The Papers of Bob Cobbing, archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library. Retrieved 14 May 2020 Publication \\"Boooook: The Life and Work of Bob Cobbing\\" \\"Boooook \\", Cobbing publication (published by Occasional Papers, 2015) is the first comprehensive overview of the life and work of Cobbing. It addresses all aspects of Cobbing's rich career, with new essays detailing his key roles in London Film-makers’ Co-op, Better Books, abAna, as well as his involvement in the Destruction in Art Symposium, Fylkingen, and his publishing imprint Writers Forum.

The work is a response to common criticisms of Israel. The Case for Israel was a New York Times bestseller. Summary The book is divided into several chapters, each of which addresses what Dershowitz identifies as being particularly strong accusations and myths about Israel, such as \\"Israel is the 'prime' human rights violator in the world\\" and \\"Israel is the cause of the Arab–Israeli conflict.\\" Each chapter is divided into several sections. \\"The Accusation\\" states a common criticism of Israel, \\"The Accusers\\" lists several quotations from critics supporting the accusation, \\"The Reality\\" contains a short statement contradicting the accusation, and \\"The Proof\\" contains Dershowitz's explanation of his viewpoint. Edward Said and Noam Chomsky are among the critics that he quotes the most heavily. The research assistants mentioned in the book's acknowledgements include Natalie Hershlag, the birthname of the actress Natalie Portman.Dershowitz (2003), p. 11\\"Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson at DNC\\" by Yair Rosenberg, Tablet Magazine, 5 September 2012\\"What Natalie knows\\" by Evgenia Peretz, Vanity Fair, April 2006 Dershowitz has released a sequel in 2005 championing the two-state solution. The book, The Case for Peace, explains what he believes is needed to be done in order to achieve peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Norman Finkelstein's allegations of fraud The political scientist and author Norman Finkelstein has claimed the book is a \\"hoax\\" and that some of its citations are plagiarized from From Time Immemorial, a 1984 book by Joan Peters. After a heated exchange between the two on Democracy Now!, in which Finkelstein repeatedly accused Dershowitz of plagiarism and questioned his credentials to teach at Harvard University, Finkelstein released a book, Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History, whose second part is about The Case for Israel. The book lists many examples of text that Finkelstein claims Dershowitz to have lifted from Peters. A Harvard Law School investigation led by former Harvard president Derek Bok found the plagiarism charges to be without merit. Finkelstein later agreed to delete all references to \\"plagiarism\\" from his book, instead writing that Dershowitz \\"lifted\\" or \\"appropriated\\" text from Peters, but said he only did it to avoid a lawsuit. According to Oxford University's professor of international relations Avi Shlaim, Finkelstein's charge of plagiarism \\"is proved in a manner that would stand up in court.\\" In response to the feud between Dershowitz and Finkelstein, Dr. Frank Menetrez, a former Editor-in- Chief of the UCLA Law Review, published an analysis of the charges made against Finkelstein by Dershowitz, finding no merit in any single charge, and that, on the contrary, \\"Dershowitz is deliberately misrepresenting what Finkelstein wrote\\". In a follow-up analysis he concluded that he could find 'no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters's From Time Immemorial, and not from the original source', as Dershowitz claimed. Michael Desch, political science professor at University of Notre Dame observed: > Not only did Dershowitz improperly present Peters's ideas, he may not even > have bothered to read the original sources she used to come up with them. > Finkelstein somehow managed to get uncorrected page proofs of The Case for > Israel in which Dershowitz appears to direct his research assistant to go to > certain pages and notes in Peters's book and place them in his footnotes > directly (32, col. 3).Michael C. Desch, \\"The Chutzpah of Alan Dershowitz,\\" > The American Conservative 5 December 2005, online posting, > normanfinkelstein.com, accessed 10 February 2007. Although repeatedly being approached by third parties to debate the book, Dershowitz refused on the ground that he had a \\"longstanding policy against debating Holocaust deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers\\".

Although the nail is a structure produced by the skin and is a skin appendage, nail diseases have a distinct classification as they have their own signs and symptoms which may relate to other medical conditions. Some nail conditions that show signs of infection or inflammation may require medical assistance. Diseases Anatomy of the basic parts of a human nail. A. Nail plate; B. lunula; C. root; D. sinus; E. matrix; F. nail bed; G. eponychium; H. free margin. *Onychia is an inflammation of the nail folds (surrounding tissue of the nail plate) of the nail with formation of pus and shedding of the nail. Onychia results from the introduction of microscopic pathogens through small wounds. *Onychocryptosis, commonly known as \\"ingrown nails\\" (unguis incarnatus), can affect either the fingers or the toes. In this condition, the nail cuts into one or both sides of the nail bed, resulting in inflammation and possibly infection. The relative rarity of this condition in the fingers suggests that pressure from the ground or shoe against the toe is a prime factor. The movements involved in walking or other physical disturbances can contribute to the problem. Mild onychocryptosis, particularly in the absence of infection, can be treated by trimming and rounding the nail. More advanced cases, which usually include infection, are treated by surgically excising the ingrowing portion of the nail down to its bony origin and thermally or chemically cauterizing the matrix, or 'root', to prevent recurrence. This surgery is called matrixectomy. The best results are achieved by cauterizing the matrix with phenol. The Vandenbos Procedure is a highly effective method that focuses on excision of excessive nail fold tissue without affecting the healthy nail and nail matrix. The Vandenbos Procedure is showing high success rates in eliminating onychocryptosis without altering the normal nail. Another, much less effective, treatment is excision of the matrix, sometimes called a 'cold steel procedure'. Ingrown nail in hallux toe *Onychodystrophy is a deformation of the nails that can result from cancer chemotherapy which includes bleomycin, hydroxyurea, or 5-fluorouracil. It can include discoloration of the nail, or dyschromia. *Onychogryposis, also called \\"ram's-horn nail\\", is a thickening and increase in curvature of the nail. It is usually the result of injury to the matrix. It may be partially hereditary and can also occur as a result of long-term neglect. It is most commonly seen in the great toe but may be seen in other toes as well as the fingernails. An affected nail has many grooves and ridges, is brownish in color, and grows more quickly on one side than on the other. The thick curved nail is difficult to cut, and often remains untrimmed, exacerbating the problem. Onychomycosis in every nail of the right foot. *Onycholysis is a loosening of the exposed portion of the nail from the nail bed, usually beginning at the free edge and continuing to the lunula. It is frequently associated with an internal disorder, trauma, infection, nail fungi, allergy to nail enhancement products, or side effects of drugs. *Onychomadesis is the separation and falling off of a nail from the nail bed. Common causes include localized infection, minor injury to the matrix bed, or severe systemic illness. It is sometimes a side effect of chemotherapy or x-ray treatments for cancer. A new nail plate will form once the cause of the disease is removed. *Onychomycosis, also known as tinea unguium, is a contagious infection of the nail caused by the same fungal organisms which cause ringworm of the skin (Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes, rarely other trichophyton species or Epidermophyton floccosum ). It can result in discoloration, thickening, chalkiness, or crumbling of the nails and is often treated by powerful oral medications which, rarely, can cause severe side effects including liver failure. Mild onychomycosis sometimes responds to a combination of topical antifungal medication, sometimes applied as special medicinal nail lacquer, and periodic filing of the nail surface. For advanced onychomycosis, especially if more than one nail is infected, systemic medication (pills) is preferred. Home remedies are often used, although their effectiveness is disputed. Subungual hematoma (mild) *Onychophosis is a growth of horny epithelium in the nail. *Onychoptosis is the periodic shedding of one or more nails, in whole or part. This condition may follow certain diseases such as syphilis, or can result from fever, trauma, systemic upsets or adverse reaction to drugs. *Onychorrhexis also known as brittle nails, is brittleness with breakage of fingernails or toenails. *Paronychia is a bacterial or fungal infection where the nail and skin meet. *Koilonychia is when the nail curves upwards (becomes spoon-shaped) due to an iron deficiency. The normal process of change is: brittle nails, straight nails, spoon-shaped nails. *Subungual hematoma occurs when trauma to the nail results in a collection of blood, or hematoma, under the nail. It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor trauma such as running in undersized shoes. Acute subungual hematomas are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the blood by creating a small hole in the nail. Drilling and thermal cautery are common methods for creating the hole. Thermal cautery is not used on acrylic nails because they are flammable. *Onychomatricoma, a tumor of the nail matrix. *Nail pemphigus, an auto-immune disease. *Erythronychia, red bands in the nail from some inflammatory conditions. *Melanonychia, a black or brown discoloration of the nail, with numerous causes. Nail changes and conditions associated with them Nail inspection can give hints to the internal condition of the body as well. Nail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine. A nail technician may be the first to note a subtle change in nail health.Common nail tumors. Baran R, Richert B., Dermatol Clin. 2006 Jul;24(3):297-311. Review.Dealing with melanonychia.

Funnels are usually made of stainless steel, aluminium, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring diesel, while plastic funnels are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable paper funnels are used in cases where it would be difficult to adequately clean the funnel afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil to a car). Dropper funnels, also called dropping funnels or tap funnels, have a tap to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat funnel, made of polypropylene, utilises living hinges and flexible walls to fold flat. The term \\"funnel\\" may refer to the chimney or smokestack on a steam locomotive and commonly refers to the same on a ship. The term funnel is also applied to other seemingly strange objects like a smoking pipe or a kitchen bin. Laboratory funnels There are many different kinds of funnels that have been adapted for specialised applications in the laboratory. Filter funnels, thistle funnels (shaped like thistle flowers), and dropping funnels have stopcocks which allow the fluids to be added to a flask slowly. For solids, a powder funnel with a wide and short stem is more appropriate as it does not clog easily. When used with filter paper, filter funnels, Büchner and Hirsch funnels can be used to remove fine particles from a liquid in a process called filtration. For more demanding applications, the filter paper in the latter two may be replaced with a sintered glass frit. Separatory funnels are used in liquid-liquid extractions. The Tullgren funnel is used to collect arthropods from plant litter or similar material.  Construction  Glass is the material of choice for laboratory applications due to its inertness compared with metals or plastics. However, plastic funnels made of nonreactive polyethylene are used for transferring aqueous solutions. Plastic is most often used for powder funnels that do not come into contact with solvent in normal use.  Uses  * To channel liquids or fine-grained substances into containers with a small opening. Used for pouring liquids or powder through a small opening and for holding the filter paper in filtration. Used in transferring liquids in small containers. *Funnels known as killing cones are used to slaughter individual birds in poultry farming. The funnel is used to hold a bird upside down so that it can be bled more easily.SPARREY, J., SANDERCOCK, D., SPARKS, N., & SANDILANDS, V. (2014). Current and novel methods for killing poultry individually on-farm. World's Poultry Science Journal, 70(4), 737-758. doi:10.1017/S0043933914000816  Culture  The painting Cutting the Stone depicts the extraction, by a man wearing a funnel hat, of the stone of madness The inverted funnel is a symbol of madness. It appears in many Medieval depictions of the mad; for example, in Hieronymus Bosch's Ship of Fools and Allegory of Gluttony and Lust. The Cebuano word for inverted funnel is embodo; such devices are sometimes used as timers. In popular culture, the Tin Woodman in L. Frank Baum's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (and in most dramatizations of it) uses an inverted funnel for a hat, though that is never specifically mentioned in the story—it originated in W. W. Denslow's original illustrations for the book. In the East Coast of the United States, \\"beer funnel\\" is another term for \\"beer bong\\". \\"Funneling\\" a beer involves pouring an entire beer into a funnel attached to a tube, in which a person then consumes the beer via the tube. In the computing world, a funnel is frequently used as the icon for the filter functionality.

Generally flavored with vanilla and based on the taste of an ice cream soda, a wide range of variations can be found worldwide. History and development A recipe for cream soda written by E. M. Sheldon and published in Michigan Farmer in 1852—called for water, cream of tartar (Potassium bitartrate), Epsom salts, sugar, egg, and milk, to be mixed, then heated, and mixed when cool with water and a quarter teaspoonful of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to make an effervescent drink. It was suggested as a temperance drink preferable to those of \\"Uncle Bacchus\\" and in compliance with the recently introduced Maine law. Alexander C. Howell, of Vienna, New Jersey, was granted a patent for \\"cream soda-water\\" on June 27, 1865. Howell's cream soda-water was made with sodium bicarbonate, water, sugar, egg whites, wheat flour, and \\"any of the usual flavoring materials—such as oil of lemon, extracts of vanilla, pine-apple, to suit the taste\\". Before drinking, the cream soda-water was mixed with water and an acid such as tartaric acid or citric acid. In Canada, James William Black of Berwick, Nova Scotia was granted a U.S. patent on December 8, 1885, and a Canadian patent on July 5, 1886, for \\"ice-cream soda\\". (Patent information at CIPO). \\"This invention relates to a new confectionery composition or sirup for conveniently and economically making, as desired, a refreshing beverage called \\"ice-cream soda.\\" The ingredients used in the beverage, except the ice-water, are combined in a concentrated form and bottled for use, so that as occasion demands it may be quickly mixed with ice-water to form an effervescent, refreshing, and healthful drink.\\" Black's ice-cream soda, which contained whipped egg whites, sugar, lime juice, lemons, citric acid, flavoring, and bicarbonate of soda,Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950, Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton, New Brunswick, 2001, p. 19. was a concentrated syrup that could be reconstituted into an effervescent beverage by adding ordinary ice water. International variations=North and South AmericaUnited States= In the United States, cream soda is often vanilla-flavored and is either clear or colored a light golden brown, but red, pink, orange, and blue are relatively common variants. In some places in the U.S. where it is made on location, especially in cafes, cream soda consists of soda water, vanilla syrup, and cream or half and half. Popular brands include: * Americana Honey Cream Soda * AriZona Soda Shaq * A-Treat Cream Soda * A&W; Vanilla Cream Soda * Barq's Red Creme Soda * Big Red * Blue Sky * Boylan's Creme Vanilla * Big Shot Cream Soda (New Orleans area) * Canfield's Swiss Creme (mainly in the Chicago area) * Dad's Cream Soda * Dr. Brown's (mainly in the New York City area, but also kosher delicatessens across the country) * Faygo * Foxon Park (mainly in Connecticut) * Hosmer Mountain (mainly in Connecticut) * Henry Weinhard's Cream Soda * IBC * Jones Soda * Jelly Belly French Vanilla Cream Soda * Mug Cream Soda * Original New York Seltzer Vanilla Cream Soda * Polar Beverages Cream Soda * Shasta Creme Soda * SodaStream Cream Soda Syrup * Sprecher Brewery * Stewart's * Vess (Old St. Louis variety that is a deep pink) * Virgil's Cream Soda * Wegmans Cream Soda * White Rock Beverages * Zevia Another variety is referred to as Italian cream soda. Despite the name, this drink originated in the US, not in Italy. The name is due to it being a form of Italian soda. Italian cream soda is usually a mixture of carbonated water, vanilla syrup, and added half and half or cream. Ratios vary widely, but the taste is usually that of sweetened, flavored milk. =Canada= In Canada, cream soda is mostly pink (except in Quebec and Newfoundland, where it is sold clear). Some brands, such as Fanta, market a colourless version. Many brands have a long-lasting, foamy head. Brands include: * Barq's Cream Soda - colourless * Big 8 Cream Soda * Cott Cream Soda * Crush * Fanta * Jones Soda * Kiri Cream Soda – colourless * Life Brand * The Pop Shoppe * President's Choice (Loblaws) * Walmart Canada – US-style vanilla flavour Some American brands are available in Canada as imports. =Caribbean and Latin America= Cream soda is usually served as a \\"red pop\\", particularly Fanta's Red Cream Soda. * Crema Soda (El Salvador) * DG Soft Drink Cream Soda (Jamaica) * Frescolita (Venezuela) - a bubble gum-flavored soda * Solo Beverage Company (Trinidad) * ToniCol (Mexico) – a naturally flavored vanilla soda OceaniaAustralia= In Australia, two distinctly different flavored sodas exist. Creamy soda or brown cream soda is vanilla flavored, whereas creaming soda generally refers to a pink soft drink with fruit and berry flavors produced by Kirks, Bundaberg, and Bickford's, among other brands. Another local variant produced by Golden Circle is vanilla and fruit-flavored, and colored yellow to distinguish it from existing brands. More traditional brown varieties are also available, but less common. Brands include Kirks' Sno Drop (only available in South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory), Tarax, River Port, Saxby's and Schweppes, which also produce a red variety as part of its \\"Traditionals\\" range. The term \\"creaming soda\\" is generally used to refer to the drink itself, the combination of soda and ice-cream is called a spider. =New Zealand= This is known as creaming soda, ice cream soda, chill drink, or cream soda, though the flavor changes are negligible. It is usually a bright yellow color or a white opaque. It is one of the many flavors sold by Foxton Fizz. It is also one of the many carbonated drink-flavors offered by Golden Circle. EuropeNetherlands= A brand called UGGO is being sold in the Netherlands. There is a wide variety of tastes available. Asian (especially Chinese) supermarkets also sell Schweppes Cream Soda, which is imported from Hong Kong. A&W; is also being sold in some supermarkets. =Ireland= Ireland has a brand of cream soda called Country Spring. =United Kingdom= In the UK, A.G. Barr, Ben Shaw's (a Cott brand), and DG Jamaica manufacture their own brands of cream soda, and many supermarkets sell it under their respective own brands. Pakola, a Pakistani brand of ice cream soda, is also available. The colour varies on a geographical basis it is either green or clear. =Finland= A brand called Sun'n Cream Soda is made by Finnish brewery Nokian Panimo. They also have a variation called Orange Cream Soda, with a hint of orange taste. Asia Hale's Blue Boy Cream Soda Syrup In Hong Kong, the Swire Coca-Cola Company markets a yellow Schweppes Cream Soda. Some people enjoy cream soda in a 1:1 ratio with fresh milk. In Japan, \\"cream soda\\" (クリームソーダ) is a term used for an ice cream float made with melon-flavored soda(メロンソーダ) topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Japanese style cream soda In Malaysia, the F&N; or Fraser and Neave brand makes a clear ice cream soda. Pakistan's popular brand is Pakola Ice Cream Soda, which is green in color. In Sri Lanka, Elephant House Cream Soda is the most popular soft drink. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka launched their newest flavor, Fanta Cream Soda, in July 2009. In Thailand, Hale's Trading produces Hale's Blue Boy Brand Cream Soda Flavoured Syrup, a green colored, rose/floral flavored cordial. This is mixed 1 part to 4 parts water/soda water to get a cream soda drink, very similar to the South African Creme Soda, or is used as a flavoring in their shaved-ice deserts. This syrup is sold worldwide in some Asian food stores. Additionally, PepsiCo's division in Thailand produces a green, cream- flavored soda under their brand name Mirinda. In some Arabian countries, Canada Dry offers a cream soda flavor. Africa Sparletta Creme Soda In South Africa, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe, cream soda is sold under the label Sparletta Creme Soda, a product of the Coca-Cola company. It is green in color.

For thousands of years, the native Lenni Lenape tribe fished its streams, hunted its forests, and planted its fields. Evidence of the tribe's existence is found in quartz spear points that have been discovered on and around the property and can be found on display in the Peirce-du Pont House on the Longwood Gardens property.Randall, Colvin (2005). 100 Years of Garden Splendor. Longwood Gardens. p. 13. In 1700, a Quaker farmer named George Peirce purchased 402 acres of this English-claimed land from William Penn’s commissioners. George’s son Joshua cleared and farmed the land and in 1730 he built the brick farmhouse that, enlarged, still stands today.Randall, Colvin, p. 13. In 1798, Joshua’s twin grandsons Samuel and Joshua, who had inherited the farm, actively pursued an interest in natural history and began planting an arboretum that eventually covered 15 acres. The collection included specimens that they collected from the wild as well as plants acquired from some of the region’s leading botanists.Randall, Colvin, p. 14. By 1850, the arboretum boasted one of the finest collections of trees in the nation and had become a place for the locals to gather outdoors – a new concept that was sweeping America at the time. Community picnics and socials were held at Peirce's Park in the mid to late 19th century.Randall, Colvin, p. 14. The Pennsylvania guide noted in 1940 that \\"Longwood received its present name from 'Long Woods,' as the section was known before the Civil War, when Negro slaves fleeing from the South found shelter in this station on the Underground Railroad... which was supported by Quakers of Kennett Square, Hamorton, and Wilmington, Delaware.\\" As the 19th century rolled into the 20th, the family’s heirs lost interest in the property and allowed the arboretum to deteriorate. The farm passed out of the family through several hands in quick succession, and a lumber mill operator was about to cut down the trees for timber in early 1906.Randall, Colvin, p. 16. This threat moved Pierre S. du Pont, American entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist, and member of the prominent du Pont family to take action. On July 20th 1906, 36-year-old du Pont purchased the farm primarily to preserve the trees. He was not planning to create Longwood Gardens, but within a few years, his desire to make it a place where he could entertain his friends transformed a simple country farm into one of the country’s leading horticultural display gardens.Randall, Colvin, p. 16. Pierre du Pont opened the garden to the public in 1921 and in 1937 created the Longwood Foundation, which came under the control of trustees in 1946. When he died in 1954, he \\"had in place a well-funded yet adaptable mechanism for Longwood to continue.\\" The garden was free, relying solely on its sizable endowment, until 1973, when it began charging admission.

Grounds and fountains The Italian Water Garden, Longwood Gardens, Kennett Square, Chester County, Pennsylvania The development of Longwood as a public garden began in the 1800s with the Peirce family's arboretum. Joshua and Samuel Peirce collected many native and exotic trees, which they planted in straight rows on land east of their farmhouse. This area became known as Peirce's Park toward the end of the 19th century.Randall, Colvin, p. 14. Visitors to Longwood Gardens today still enjoy Peirce's Park, which is now punctuated by the Sylvan Fountain, added by Pierre S. du Pont in 1925-27. After Pierre S. du Pont purchased the property in 1906, he began developing the outdoor gardens further, adding the 600-foot long Flower Garden Walk in 1907. The Flower Garden Walk features a pool known as the Round Fountain at the intersection of the main paths. Its simple jet of water was Longwood's first fountain.Randall, Colvin, p. 27-28. In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont added the Open Air Theatre after visits to the Villa Gori in Siena, Italy, provided inspiration.Randall, Colvin, p. 31. From 1925-27 Pierre designed and constructed the Italian Water Garden on a site northeast of Longwood's Large Lake, after gaining inspiration from a visit to the Villa Gamberaia, near Florence, Italy.Randall, Colvin, p. 48. The Main Fountains at Longwood Gardens In 1928, Pierre began adding fountains to a garden he had begun developing in 1921. This space, directly south of the Conservatory, would become Mr. du Pont's most ambitious project—the 5-acre Main Fountain Garden. The Main Fountain Garden \\"combines Italianate ornamentation and French grandeur with World’s Fair showmanship. Like other great fountains, it is an engineering tour de force using the latest technology of the time.\\" The Main Fountain Garden debuted to the public in 1931 and was the last major project in the Gardens during Pierre's life.Randall, Colvin, p. 63. In 1957, the Waterlily Display opened under the direction of Russell Seibert, who was Longwood's first Director after Pierre du Pont's death in 1954.Randall, Colvin, p. 75. In the 1970s, celebrated landscape architect Thomas Church was engaged to advise Longwood on long-range planning, garden improvement, and visitor circulation. He contributed to many spaces throughout the Gardens, and designed the Theatre Garden (opened in 1975), the Wisteria Garden (opened in 1976), and the Peony Garden (opened in 1976).Randall, Colvin, p. 87. By 1977, Thomas Church could no longer visit because of his declining health, and the noted English designer Sir Peter Shepheard became Longwood's consulting architect. In 1987 he re-worked the original Waterlily Display layout. The re- designed garden opened in 1988.Randall, Colvin, p. 91. In 1995, landscape architect W. Gary Smith designed Peirce's Woods as an \\"art form\\" garden that brings together the most ornamental characteristics of the eastern deciduous forest. Thousands of native plants were added, including 10,000 rescued from the North Carolina mountains prior to impending highway construction.Randall, Colvin, p. 105. In 2014, Longwood Gardens unveiled its new Meadow Garden, an iconic American landscape spanning 86 acres that showcases native plantings and highlights the relationship between the human and natural worlds. Both sustainably managed and visually artistic, the Meadow Garden blends bursts of colorful plantings and grand vistas with best practices in land stewardship. The Meadow Garden is actively propagated with herbaceous perennials and includes other interventions to manage invasive plants, control trees and shrubs, and promote wildlife.

Peirce-du Pont House The Peirce-du Pont House The Peirce-du Pont House dates from 1730 and is the oldest building at Longwood Gardens. It was the family homestead of the Peirce family until 1905 and then became the weekend residence of Pierre du Pont from 1906 until his death in 1954. It is now open to the public every day of the year and is included with general admission to the Gardens.“Peirce-du Pont House.” Longwood Gardens. Retrieved January 26, 2016. http://longwoodgardens.org/gardens/peirce-du-pont- house This spacious country home resulted from five major periods of construction covering nearly 200 years. The original two-story brick farmhouse was built by Joshua Peirce in 1730 to replace a log cabin built in 1709. The brick pattern was Flemish bond brickwork with dark glazed headers and unglazed stretchers. The roof had a simple cornice and pent eaves protected the first floor windows and doors. In 1764, a two-story addition was made to the east end of the house and included a new dining room. The house was enlarged in 1824 adding a large addition to the north of the original structure. This building campaign doubled the size of the Peirce's house. In 1909, Pierre du Pont modernized the house with a two-story addition to the north. Plumbing, electricity, and heating were added throughout the house.Knowles, Suzanne (1987). The Peirce- du Pont House Guides Manual. Longwood Gardens. p. 25. The largest addition was built by Mr. du Pont in 1914 when a mirror image of the original farmhouse was added to the north. At the same time, the two wings were connected by Longwood's first conservatory.Knowles, Suzanne, p. 12. After Pierre du Pont's death in 1954, the 1914 rooms were converted into administrative offices. Many of Mr. du Pont's possessions were distributed to the du Pont family, although his garden books were retained and form the basis for Longwood's horticultural library. Mr. du Pont's other books and his personal papers were transferred to what has become the Hagley Museum and Library near Wilmington, DE.Knowles, Suzanne, p. 26. The culmination of a decade of planning and research, the Heritage Exhibit details Longwood's historical and horticultural legacy. It draws upon the extensive photographic and manuscript resources now stored at the Hagley Museum and Library to show the entire 300-year history of the property. Although the rooms housing the exhibit no longer appear residential, their architectural features have been preserved intact and are visible to visitors, as are photos in many rooms showing the decor during Mr. du Pont's occupancy.Knowles, Suzanne, p. 21. Plant collections Longwood's plant collection contains more than 10,000 taxa. Although the focus of the gardens is on horticultural displays, rather than developing extensive collections, the Gardens have taken steps to prioritize certain collections and are designated as core collections, which receive special focus with regard to their development, management and display in the garden.

Life He was born in Pisa, Tuscany. He was the second son of William Hamilton (1758–1790), professor of anatomy and botany, Glasgow, and was younger brother of Sir William Hamilton (1788–1856), the metaphysician. His father died a few months after he was born. After preliminary education at Glasgow, he was placed in 1801 as a pupil with the Rev. Dr. Home, Chiswick, and some months later with the Rev. Dr. Scott, Hounslow. For several months in 1803, he was with Dr. Sommers at Mid Calder, Midlothian, preparatory to entering Glasgow University, where he matriculated the following November. He studied there three winters, proving himself an able if not very diligent student. His close college companion, of whom he saw little in after life, was Michael Scott, the author of 'Tom Cringle's Log.' Hamilton's bias was towards the army, and in 1810, after fully showing, in Glasgow and Liverpool, his incapacity for business, he got a commission in the 29th regiment. Twice on active service in the Peninsula, he received from a musket bullet, at Albuera, a somewhat serious wound in the thigh. He was also in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with his regiment, which at length was sent to France as part of the army of occupation. About 1818, Hamilton retired on half-pay, fixing his headquarters at Edinburgh. He became a valued member of the 'Blackwood' writers. He is specially complimented in the song of personalities in the 'Noctes Ambrosianae' for February 1826 (Noctes, i. 89). James Hogg in his 'Autobiography' credits him with a considerable share in some of the 'ploys' led by John Gibson Lockhart. Hamilton married in 1820, and for several summers he and his wife lived at Lockhart's cottage of Chiefs wood, near Abbotsford House, Sir Walter Scott finding them very congenial neighbours and friends. In 1829, Captain and Mrs. Hamilton went to Italy, and at the end of the year Mrs. Hamilton died and was buried at Florence. Hamilton's house, Elleray painted by Alexander Nasmyth 1808 Some time after his return, Hamilton visited America, bringing back materials for a book on the Americans. Marrying a second time, the widow of Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, bart., governor of the Mauritius, he settled at John Wilson's former house, Elleray, and saw much of Wordsworth, whom he was one of the first Scotsmen to appreciate. Visiting the continent with his wife, Hamilton was seized with paralysis at Florence, and he died at Pisa of a second attack 7 December 1842. He was buried at Florence beside his first wife. Works Hamilton's novel Cyril Thornton appeared in 1827. It is partly autobiographical, with Hamilton's early impressions of Scottish university life and Glasgow citizens when he could call Govan \\"a pretty and rural village\\", on to his military experiences. The book went through three editions in the author's lifetime, and was one of Blackwood's Standard Novels. In 1829, Hamilton published Annals of the Peninsular Campaign. His Men and Manners in America appeared in 1833. Craig Lamont has placed Thomas Hamilton within a 'Glasgow School' of early nineteenth century Scottish novelists, along with John Galt and Michael Scott.Craig Lamont,Finding Galt in Glasgow, in Gerard Carruthers & Colin Kidd, (Eds.), The International Companion to John Galt, Scottish Literature International, 2017, pp. 34-43 References ;Attribution Further reading * Hamilton, Thomas.

The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the commonest tune and its variations as number 10266,\\"Searchable database\\", English Folk Song and Dance Society, retrieved 18 March 2012. although it has been set to several others. The original rhyme dates back to the 18th century and different numbers of verses were later added, each with variations in the wording. Throughout the 19th century new versions of the story were written featuring different incidents. A number of theories continue to be advanced to explain the rhyme’s historical origin. Text From Mother Goose's Melody (1791 edition) The earliest version of the rhyme was in a reprint of John Newbery's Mother Goose's Melody, thought to have been first published in London around 1765.B. Cullinan and D. G. Person, The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature (London: Continuum, 2003), , p. 561. The rhyming of \\"water\\" with \\"after\\" was taken by Iona and Peter Opie to suggest that the first verse might date from the 17th century.The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, OUP 1997, pp.265-7 Jill was originally spelled Gill in the earliest version of the rhyme and the accompanying woodcut showed two boys at the foot of the hill. Later the spelling was changed to Jill and more verses were added to carry the story further, of which the commonest are: As presented over the following century, the rhyming scheme of the six-line stanzas is AABCCB and they are trochaic in rhythm. Alternatively, when given the form of internally rhymed quatrains, this would be an example of the ballad form commonly used for nursery rhymes.L. Turco, The Book of Forms: a Handbook of Poetics (Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 3rd edn., 2000), , pp. 28–30. The phrase \\"Jack and Jill\\" existed earlier in England to indicate a boy and girl as a generic pair. It is so used, for example, in the proverb \\"Every Jack (shall/must) have his Jill\\",William George Smith, The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs, (OUP 1935) p.95 to which there are references in two plays by William Shakespeare dating from the 1590s.In A Midsummer Night's Dream (III:ii:460-2, \\"Jack shall have Jill\\") and in Love's Labour's Lost (V:ii:874–5, \\"Jack hath not Jill\\") The compress of vinegar and brown paper to which Jack resorted after his fall was a common home cure used to heal bruises. Gabrielle Hatfield, Encyclopedia of Folk Medicine, ABC Clio 2004, p.187 New versions Though approximately the words above are what have survived of the nursery rhyme to the present, their sense is preserved at the start of a 15-stanza chapbook, Jack & Jill and Old Dame Gill, published in 1806. The work dates from the period when children’s literature was beginning to shift from instruction to fun in the wake of the success of Old Mother Hubbard and kindred works.Delaney, Lesley Jane: \\"'Making amusement the vehicle of instruction': Key Developments in the Nursery Reading Market 1783-1900\\", UCL PhD thesis, 2012, p.105 - 120 This change of emphasis was signalled by the book's coloured illustrations and introductory epigraph: \\"Read it who will, They’ll laugh their fill\\". In this version the trio of Jack, Jill, and their mother Dame Gill experience further mishaps involving the dog Ball, an attack from a goat, falls from a see-saw, a swing and a pig, followed by a parental whipping for getting dirty.Reproduced in the Public Domain Review Many pirated editions of the work followed from both London and provincial presses, accompanied by black and white as well as coloured woodcuts. Sometimes there were several different editions from the same press, such as, for example, the Banbury editions of John Golby Rusher (1784-1877) between 1835-1845. The wording also varied in these, and there were multiplications of the creatures involved in the adventures of the three protagonists – a donkey, a reindeer, a bull, a goose and a camel.University of Washington An advertising card based on Kate Greenaway's 1881 illustration of the rhyme As the decades advanced there were changes in form as well as wording. An 1840s edition from Otley, titled The adventures of Jack & Jill and old Dame Jill, was written in longer and more circumstantial quatrains of between ten and twelve syllables, rhymed AABB.An example preserved in McGill Library Among other changes in the poem, Jack's injuries are treated, not with vinegar and brown paper, but \\"spread all over with sugar and rum\\". There were also radical changes in the telling of the story in America. Among the Juvenile Songs rewritten and set to music by Fanny E. Lacy (Boston 1852) was a six-stanza version of Jack and Jill. Having related their climb and fall from the hill, the rest of the poem is devoted to a warning against social climbing: \\"By this we see that folks should be/ Contented with their station,/ And never try to look so high/ Above their situation.\\"A copy at Johns Hopkins University There is a similar tendency to moral instruction in the three \\"chapters\\" of Jack and Jill, for old and young by Lawrence Augustus Gobright (1816-1879), published in Philadelphia in 1873. There the pair have grown up to be a devoted and industrious married couple; the fall is circumstantially explained and the cure afterwards drawn out over many, many quatrains.See the digitized Library of Congress copy at the Internet Archive In the introduction to his work, Gobright makes the claim that the two-stanza version of the original nursery rhyme was, in earlier editions, followed by two more: No such verses are found in English editions, although they do appear in a later American edition of Mother Goose's nursery rhymes, tales and jingles (New York 1902).Edited by W. Gannon, copy available at the Internet Archive, pp.374-6 Yet another American variation on the story appeared in the Saint Nicholas Magazine. This was Margaret Johnson's \\"A New Jack and Jill\\", in which the brother and sister constantly return with an empty bucket because they have not noticed that there is a hole in it.St Nicholas Magazine' for young folks, January 1884, pp.238-9 Clifton Bingham (1859-1913) followed it with \\"The New Jack and Jill\\", which appeared in the children’s album Fun and Frolic (London and New York, 1900), illustrated by Louis Wain.The University of Michigan’s digitized version, pp.50-51 Here there is a return to the six-line stanza form: But the cow objects and chases them down again. The exclamatory style used in all three stanzas replicates that used only in the sixth stanza of the popular Jack and Jill and Old Dame Gill. Musical settings Musical setting by Charles Burney (1777) A musical arrangement of the rhyme as a catch by Charles Burney was published in 1777, at a date earlier than any still existing copy of Mother Goose's Melody. But the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded with the three stanza version by the composer and nursery lore collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (1870),University of Florida, pp.2-3 which was published in America as Mother Goose Set to Music the following year.Google Books And in 1877 the single-stanza version illustrated by Walter Crane appeared in The Baby's Opera (London 1877), which described itself as \\"a book of old rhymes in new dresses, the music by the earliest masters\\".Available at Gutenberg, pp.52-3 The Victorian composer Alfred James Caldicott, who distinguished himself by setting several nursery rhymes as ingenious part songs, adapted \\"Jack and Jill\\" as one in 1878. These works were described by the Dictionary of National Biography as a \\"humorous admixture of childish words and very complicated music…with full use of contrast and the opportunities afforded by individual words\\".DNB entry for \\"Caldicott, Alfred James\\" in the 1901 supplement Among American adaptations of his work for female voices, there were settings by E. M. Bowman (New York, 1883)Library of Congress and Charles R. Ford (Boston, 1885).Library of Congress In Canada, Spencer Percival was responsible for a part-song of his own for four voices, first performed in 1882.McGill University A modern performance on Good Night, Good Night, Beloved! and other Victorian part songs, Atma Classique 2012 Sigmund Spaeth was eventually to have fun with the rhyme by adapting it to a number of bygone musical styles as The musical adventures of Jack & Jill in Words & Music: A Book of Burlesques, (Simon and Schuster, 1926). These included a Handel aria, Italian operatic and Wagnerian versions.Google Books, pp.15-34 Later on the English composer Geoffrey Hartley (1906-1992) set the original as a chamber piece for horn and two bassoons, or for wind trio (1975), and later reset it as a bassoon trio.Trevco Varner Music Interpretations The plaque erected in 2000 at Kilmersdon to commemorate the village's association with the rhyme There are several theories concerning the origin of the rhyme. Most such explanations postdate the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. S. Baring-Gould suggested that the rhyme is related to a story in the 13th-century Icelandic Gylfaginning in which the brother and sister Hjuki and Bil were stolen by the moon while drawing water from a well, to be seen there to this day.Elizabeth Knowles, The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (OUP 2000), \\"Jack and Jill\\" Other suggestions rooted in history include a reference to the executions of Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley in 1510,Elizabeth Knowles, The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (OUP 2000), \\"Jack and Jill\\" or to a marriage negotiation conducted by Thomas Wolsey in 1514.W. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose (Bramhall House, 1962), , pp. 60–62. Alternatively it has been taken to satirise the attempt by King Charles I of England to raise extra revenue by ordering that the volume of a Jack (1/8 pint) be reduced, while the tax remained the same. In consequence of this, the Gill (a quarter pint in liquid measure) \\"came tumbling after\\".Albert Jack, Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes, Penguin 2008, \\"Jack and Jill\\" There is also a belief in Somerset that the rhyme records events in the village of Kilmersdon when a local girl became pregnant; the putative father is said to have died from a rockfall and the woman afterwards died in childbirth. The local surname of Gilson is therefore taken to derive from Gill's son.Laura Lee, The Name's Familiar, Pelican 1999, pp.139-40 See also *List of nursery rhymes NotesExternal links * * Category:Literary duos Category:Jack tales Category:English nursery rhymes Category:Roud Folk Song Index songs Category:Songs about fictional male characters Category:Songs about fictional female characters ","title":"Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)"},{"id":"431814","text":"Pot stills at the Lagavulin Distillery A pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or still used to distill flavoured liquors such as whisky or cognac, but not rectified spirit because they are bad at separating congeners. Pot stills operate on a batch distillation basis (as opposed to a Coffey or column stills which operate on a continuous basis). Traditionally constructed from copper, pot stills are made in a range of shapes and sizes depending on the quantity and style of spirit desired. Spirits distilled in pots top out between 60 and 80 percent ABV (after multiple distillations). By law, cognac, Irish and Scotch malt whiskies, and single pot still whiskey must be distilled using a pot still.The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009, The National Archives, 2009.  Method of operation  During first distillation, the pot still (or \\"wash still\\") is filled about two-thirds full of a fermented liquid (or wash) with an alcohol content of about 7–12%. In the case of whiskey distillation, the liquid used is a beer, while in the case of brandy production, it is a base wine. The pot still is then heated so that the liquid boils. The liquid being distilled is a mixture of mainly water and alcohol, along with smaller amounts of other by-products of fermentation (called congeners), such as aldehydes and esters. Alcohol (ethanol) has a normal boiling point of 78.4 °C (173.12 °F), compared with pure water, which boils at 100 °C (212 °F). As alcohol has a lower boiling point, it is more volatile and evaporates at a higher rate than water. Hence the concentration of alcohol in the vapour phase above the liquid is higher than in the liquid itself. During distillation, this vapour travels up the swan neck at the top of the pot still and down the lyne arm, after which it travels through the condenser, where it is cooled to yield a distillate with a higher concentration of alcohol than the original liquid. This distillate, called \\"low wines\\" has a concentration of about 25–35% alcohol by volume. These low wines can be further distilled a second time in a pot still to yield a distillate with a higher concentration of alcohol. In the case of many Irish whiskeys, the spirit is further distilled a third time. However, cognac and most single malt scotch whiskies are only distilled twice. During distillation, the initial and final portions of spirit which condense (termed the heads and tails respectively) may be captured separately from that in the centre or \\"heart\\" of the distillation. This is because these portions of the distillate may contain high concentrations of methanol (which is toxic), or other congeners (which it may be desirable to keep out of the final distillate for reasons of style or taste).  History  The modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device. Jameson Midleton distillery in Cork, Ireland The largest pot still ever used was located in the Old Midleton Distillery, County Cork, Ireland.

The route of US 81 follows that of the old Meridian Highway (so called because it roughly followed the Sixth Principal Meridian of the US Public Land Survey System) which dates back as early as 1911.Transcript - The Meridian Highway The highway has alternately (and unofficially) been known as part of the Pan-American Highway.Highway 81 In the segment in the state of Oklahoma, the highway closely corresponds to the old Chisholm Trail for cattle drives from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the 1860s and 1870s. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus is just north of Pembina, North Dakota, at the Canadian border. At this point, it is routed along Interstate 29 (I-29) and continues northward into Manitoba on Highway 75, which leads to Winnipeg. Its southern terminus is in Fort Worth, Texas, at an intersection with I-35W and US 287. Between the inception of the numbered highway system in 1926 through 1991, US 81's southern terminus was at the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas. In 1991, the terminus was moved to San Antonio. The route was shortened to its present length of in 1993, when the terminus was moved to Fort Worth. In both cases, the dropped portions of US 81 were replaced by I-35. Portions of former US 81 south of Fort Worth continue to exist as business loops of I-35; a section from Hillsboro to Fort Worth exists as State Highway 81. The decommissioning of portions of US 81 that have been displaced by concurrent Interstate Highways means that US 81 no longer extends from the Canadian border to the Mexican border, while one of its children, US 281 does extend to both borders. As a result of decommissioning portions of US 81, the length of US 81 is actually miles shorter than its child. Route description=Texas US 81 at its inception in 1926 followed the route of State Highway 2, which began in Laredo and passed through San Antonio, Austin, Waco, and Fort Worth before passing over the Red River into Oklahoma north of Ringgold. The 1936 Official Map of the Highway System of Texas clearly shows the route labeled both as US 81 and SH 2. It was cosigned with US 83 for from Laredo to south of Webb, with US 79 for from Austin north to Round Rock, and with US 77 for from Waco to Hillsboro. In 1940 US 287 was extended south into Texas, and a stretch from Fort Worth northwest to Bowie was cosigned with US 81\\\\. The summer 1941 Texas Highway Map shows this pairing, and the current southern terminus of US 81 is still cosigned with US 287\\\\. The spring and summer 1949 Texas Highway Department Official Map designates the length of US 81 from Laredo to Fort Worth as part of the National System of Interstate Highways, but no numeric designation was given. It was not until 1959 that parts of US 81 in Texas appeared on the Texas Official Highway Travel Map cosigned with I-35 shields. Succeeding maps reflect the slow completion of I-35 and I-35W over the stretch of US 81 between Laredo and Fort Worth, with the 1978-79 Texas Official Highway Travel Map showing only a section from Encinal north to south of Artesia Wells as incomplete, and the 1980 Texas Official Highway Travel Map showing that section completed. In 1980, US 81 was cosigned with I-35 and I-35W except where the Interstate bypassed towns, with US 81 providing the main route through town and then reconnecting with I-35 on the other side. The longest section of US 81 in 1980 not cosigned with the Interstate ran from I-35 in Hillsboro north to I-35W, just north of Grandview. Oklahoma Enid, El Reno, Chickasha, and Duncan are major Oklahoma towns on the highway; historically, the small town of Hennessey is notable. Among the elders throughout the small towns that are dotted along US 81 in Oklahoma, the sixth meridian is commonly known among the locals as the \\"Indian Meridian\\" but US 81 is not known as the \\"Indian Meridian Highway\\". The Indian Meridan is located some east and parallel of US 81\\\\. By pure coincidence, the Chisholm Trail of the post-Civil-War decades roughly followed along the corridor of present-day US 81; the region was not opened for settlement until several years after the cattle drives were discontinued; cultural memory harkened exclusively for many years to Indian Meridian Highway until recognition of the old cattle trail grew in the late 1900s. Kansas 1912 Meridian Highway Inspection team in Concordia, Kansas Nearly all of US 81 in Kansas is either freeway or expressway. The route enters Kansas as a two-lane near Caldwell. From South Haven to Wichita it closely parallels I-35, which is also known as the Kansas Turnpike in that area. After South Haven, the only town of any significance along US 81 until Wichita is Wellington, which is just west of the Turnpike along US 160\\\\. At Wichita, US 81 joins I-135. The two highways remain joined until Salina; I-135's mile markers take precedence. I-135 ends at I-70 but US 81 continues as a freeway to Minneapolis, then as an expressway passing through Concordia before exiting the state north of Belleville. The alignment of US 81 from Wichita to Salina prior to the completion I-135 is fully intact. The prior alignment ran from where current US 81 breaks off for I-135 at 47th street, north through Wichita along Broadway street. Old US 81 roughly parallels I-135 to Newton. Old US 81 follows current K-15 through Newton between an interchange with US 50 and Hesston Road, where old US 81 breaks northwest onto Hesston road. Old US 81 then travels through the small Kansas towns of Hesston, Moundridge, and Elyria, before turning to the north, and going through the town of McPherson as Main Street. North of McPherson, old US 81 continues to Lindsborg, where it follows current K-4 until an interchange with I-135. Old US 81 passes under I-135 and continues to parallel it about to the east. Old US 81 then travels through Assaria, where it encounters another brief overlap with K-4 and K-104. Old US 81 continues through the city of Salina as Ninth Street. North of Salina, Old US 81 encounters brief overlaps with K-143 and K-18. Old US 81 follows K-106 to an interchange with current US 81, where the two alignments are joined back together. From Salina to the Nebraska state line, the highway is named the Frank Carlson Memorial Highway, in honor of the late Senator Frank Carlson. Senator Carlson was a native of Concordia who represented Kansas in the United States Senate from 1951 until 1969. Before serving in the Senate, he was Governor of Kansas from 1947 until 1950. Nebraska US 81 enters Nebraska as an expressway at Chester and continues as an expressway to York, where the highway intersects I-80. After a two-lane section going north from York and an overlap with Nebraska Highway 92 (N-92), US 81 again becomes an expressway at N-64. This expressway section passes through Columbus and Norfolk. North of Norfolk, US 81 is a two-lane, undivided highway which passes through no towns before exiting the state in Cedar County. South Dakota US 81 enters South Dakota by a Missouri River crossing, via the Discovery Bridge at Yankton. Its junction with I-90 is south of Salem. US 81 passes near Madison before it joins with I-29 at Watertown. The two highways remain concurrent through the rest of the state, leaving South Dakota near New Effington. The South Dakota section of US 81, with the exception of a concurrency with US 14, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-179. North Dakota US 81 enters North Dakota concurrently with I-29. It is paired with I-29 from the South Dakota border, passing through Fargo, to the north side of Grand Forks. There it splits off to the northwest, passing through the city of Manvel. It parallels I-29, passing through the town of Grafton before joining North Dakota Highway 5 (ND 5) near Cavalier. It rejoins I-29 and continues to the Canadian border at Pembina. The original route of US 81 survives as ND 127 and County Road 81 (CR 81) in Richland, Cass, Traill, and Grand Forks counties. History US 81 started out as the Meridian Highway, an auto trail organized in 1911 to connect Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico near the Sixth Principal Meridian. The southern terminus, initially at Galveston, was later moved to Laredo, where it would connect with a proposed extension to Mexico City (later built as part of the Pan-American Highway). Five of the six states along the route assigned a single number to the highway, mostly changing at the state line. (Kansas did not number its highways until 1926.)Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926, accessed via the Broer Map LibraryThe following routes were used, shown on the 1926 Rand McNally: *Texas: 2 *Oklahoma: 2 *Kansas: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system *Nebraska: 4 (Lincoln Star, Road Conditions, October 11, 1925) *South Dakota: 21 *North Dakota: 1 Planning to replace these designations—and the Meridian Highway name—began in 1925, when the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states; the entire Meridian Highway was assigned US 81. The new number was officially adopted in late 1926.United States Numbered Highways, American Highways (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials), April 1927 The Interstate Highway System was approved in 1956, and included several routes that would replace much of US 81. I-35 followed the corridor from Laredo north to Wichita, where I-35 turned northeast towards Kansas City, with a branch—I-35W—continuing parallel to US 81 to Salina, Kansas. Between Fort Worth, Texas, and South Haven, Kansas, I-35 did not directly replace US 81, instead following US 77 through Oklahoma City, but replaced it as a long-distance highway. From Salina north through Nebraska, the US 81 corridor was not part of the Interstate Highway System, but I-29 began at Kansas City, gradually heading northwest and intersecting US 81 at Watertown, South Dakota, then following it north to the Canadian border. The portion through northern Kansas and Nebraska remains an important regional corridor, but by the late 1970s, the rest had been mostly replaced by I-35 and I-29 for non-local traffic.Gulf, Tourgide: United States, Canada and Mexico (Rand McNally & Company), 1977 The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved a truncation in 1991, changing the southern terminus from Laredo to north of Fort Worth and removing long overlaps with and short sections parallel to I-35. The portion of US 81 between Grandview, Texas, and Hillsboro, Texas, that was not part of I-35W was renamed SH 81\\\\. Business US 81 in San Antonio was replaced by Loop 368 and Loop 353. The north side (Loop 368) traveled down Broadway and Austin Highway while the south side (Loop 353) was Nogalitos and Laredo Highway. When it was replaced, they renamed the street New Laredo Highway. Old portions of US 81 in various parts of North Dakota are now county roads. The current US 81 in these areas is cosigned with I-29. Completion of the four-lane section of US 81 between Salina and Minneapolis, Kansas, occurred in 1971. Between Wichita and Salina, Kansas, old sections of US 81 are now county roads and short sections of state highways. The current US 81 in this area is cosigned with I-135. In McPherson County, the old alignment of US 81 is signed as Business US 81\\\\. Major intersections ;Texas : in Fort Worth.

Analyzer* B. Rectifier* 1\\\\. Wash 2\\\\. Steam 3\\\\. Liquid out 4\\\\. Alcohol vapour 5\\\\. Recycled less volatile components 6\\\\. Most volatile components 7\\\\. Condenser *Both columns are preheated by steam A column still, also called a continuous still, patent still or Coffey still, is a variety of still consisting of two columns. Column stills can produce rectified spirit (95% ABV). Description The first column (called the analyzer) in a column still has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. A column still is an example of a fractional distillation, in that it yields a narrow fraction of the distillable components. This technique is frequently employed in chemical synthesis; in this case, the component of the still responsible for the separation is a fractionating column. A continuous still can, as its name suggests, sustain a constant process of distillation. This, along with the ability to produce a higher concentration of alcohol in the final distillate, is its main advantage over a pot still, which can only work in batches. Continuous stills are charged with preheated feed liquor at some point in the column. Heat (usually in the form of steam) is supplied to the base of the column. Stripped (approximately alcohol-free) liquid is drawn off at the base, while alcoholic spirits are condensed after migrating to the top of the column. Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Distillation by column still is the traditional method for production of Armagnac, although distillation by pot still is allowed. The use of column stills for the distillation of Cognac is forbidden, although they may be used for other types of brandy. Distillation by column stills is permitted for Calvados AOC and Calvados Domfrontais. Calvados Pays d'Auge AOC is required to be distilled by pot still. Difference between pot still and column still Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, which is low in alcohol, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column. The temperature of each successively higher stage is slightly lower than the previous stage, so the vapor in equilibrium with the liquid at each stage is progressively more enriched with alcohol. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapor enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapor alcohol content of 96%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water. Further enrichment is only possible by absorbing the remaining water using other means, such as hydrophilic chemicals or azeotropic distillation, or a column of 3A molecular sieves, like 3A zeolite. History In the early 1800s, a number of different scientists, engineers, and businessmen contributed to the development of a variety of different continuous distillation apparatuses. Several of these early developers were French, spurred on by a prize offered by Napoleon to improve sugar beet development and fermentation, in an effort to reduce reliance on British imports. These early French stills were suited to the production of wine, but deficient in the processing of the residual solids found in whiskey mashes. These French designs were further developed and improved upon by a number of Irish, British, and German contributors, to allow for use in the distillation of whiskey and other liquids. Notable contributors included: Jean‐Édouard Adam In 1805, Jean‐Édouard Adam developed a discontinuous fractional distillation apparatus. Isaac Bérard In 1806, Bérard developed a device to allow for partial condensation Jean‐Baptiste Cellier‐Blumenthal The work of Adam and Bérard, focused on two key principles: # the enrichment of a low boiling component in the rising vapour # the enrichment of the vapour by partial condensation and reflux into the still In 1813, Jean‐Baptiste Cellier‐Blumenthal (1768-1840), built upon and combined these ideas, and patented the first continuously operating distillation column. This still had a pot still type-kettle, but replaced the traditional lyne arm and cooling worm with a vertical column of perforated plates. Although many of the details of Cellier-Blumenthal's column were improved upon in later years, the general concept was to provide the basis for future column still designs.  Heinrich Pistorius  In 1817, Heinrich Pistorius, a German, patented a still for the distillation of alcohol from potato mash. The Pistorius still which produced spirit with an alcohol content of about 60-80%, was widely used across Germany until the 1870s. Sir Anthony Perrier Sir Anthony Perrier (1770–1845) was operator of the Spring Lane distillery (Glen distillery) in Cork, Ireland from 1806. In 1822, he patented one of Europe's first continuous whiskey stills. The still included a labyrinth of partitions, which allowed the wash to flow gradually and continuously over the heat, with increased contact between the vapour and liquid phases of the distillate. In addition, the still contained \\"baffles\\", similar to modern bubble trays. This meant small portions of fermented \\"wash\\" received the greatest amount of heat, thereby increasing the amount of potable alcohol that was collected. Anthony Perriers Patent Submission- Improved Distillation Apparatus (P.10)  Jean-Jacques St. Marc  In 1823, Jean-Jacques St. Marc, a French veterinary surgeon attached to Napoleon's personal staff, moved to England where he sought investors in his \\"Patent Distillery Company\\", which was to distill potato brandy. The company erected a distillery at Vauxhall, called the Belmont Distillery, but it proved unsuccessful. During which time, St. Marc worked on developing a continuous distillation apparatus. In 1827 he was granted a patent, and moved back to France. The still was later used successfully in England, Ireland, and the West Indies. Robert Stein In 1828, Scotsman, Robert Stein, patented a continuous still that fed the \\"wash\\" through a series of interconnected pots. Piston strokes were used to vapourise the wash and feed it into a horizontal cylinder which was divided into a series of compartments using cloth. December 1828 Patent for Stein The Stein still offered improved fuel efficiency compared with the traditional pot still and was the first continuous still to be employed commercially in Scotland, finding use at the Kirkliston (1828), Cameron Bridge (1830), Yoker (1845), and Glenochil (1845) distilleries. However, as the still did not allow for siphoning off of the pungent fusel oils, the spirit produced was not highly rectified, and still needed to be stopped frequently for cleaning. Aeneas Coffey In 1830, Irishman, Aeneas Coffey, patented the two-column, continuous distillation distillation apparatus which bears his name, versions of which are now ubiquitous across the distilling industries. The still allowed for the production of alcoholic spirit with an ethanol content of greater than 90%, though modern versions can achieve about 95%. Educated at Dublin's Trinity College, Coffey had ample opportunities to observe all manner of still designs having worked as a distillery excise tax collector for a quarter of a century. Coffey's early designs, based on modifications to the Cellier-Blumenthal still, were unsuccessful. Being made of iron, they were attacked by the acids in the hot distillate, resulting in a poor spirit. However, his final design, which incorporated design elements from Perrier, Fournier, and Saint Marc, was to prove successful. Coffey Still from Kilbeggan Distillery in County Westmeath in Ireland In his patent application, Coffey claimed that his design made three new improvements over previous designs: # Forcing the wash to pass rapidly through a pipe or pipes of small diameter, during the time it is acquiring heat and before it reaches its boiling temperature. # Causing the wash, after it has come in contact with the vapours, to flow into a continued and uninterrupted stream over numerous metallic plates, furnished with valves # The method of ascertaining whether or not the wash exhausted of its alcohol by means of the apparatus herein described or any similar apparatus, whereby the vapour to be tried undergoes a process of analyzation or rectification, and is deprived of much of its aqueous part before it is submitted to trial. In addition, the design introduced perforated trays as sieve structures for vapour liquid contact. This new continuous distillation method produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills,The History of Whisky and Whiskey without the need for cleaning after each batch was made.The Difference Between Pot Versus Column Stills, Explained As the reciprocating steam engines of the time were unable to feed the still with the necessary high temperature/pressure steam, it took some time for the Coffey still came to dominate the industry. However, with technological improvements, most notably the introduction of steam regulators in 1852, the Coffey still found widespread use in alcohol production across Europe and the Americas. Although, notably, it found resistance within Irish whiskey industry, then the dominant force in global whiskey production, who considered the high-strength spirit, to be inferior in taste profile to lower strength pot still distillate. Within five years of receiving his patent, Coffey had enough orders to warrant the establishment of Aeneas Coffey & Sons in London, a company that remains in operation today under the name John Dore & Co Limited. He closed Dock Distillery four years later and devoted all of his time to building and installing stills in distilleries owned by others.

When launched, it was Britain's lowest priced car. The name Popular was also used by Ford to describe its 1930s Y Type model. The Popular name was also later used on basic models of the Escort and Fiesta cars. __TOC__  Ford Popular 103E Electrics were 6 volts, a provided starting handle often necessary. Rod operated drum brakes, synchromesh only on 2nd and top gear. The boot accessed with a coach key, no heater or demister, semaphore indicators, pull-wire starter, manual choke. No water pump, engine cooling by thermosyphon – this was very basic motoring. When production of the older Ford Anglia and Ford Prefect was stopped in 1953 the Popular was developed as a budget alternative, based on the old, pre-war style E494A Anglia. The E494A was, in turn, a facelift of the Anglia E04A, which was a facelifted version of the 7Y, itself a rebodied Model Y. Thus through several adjustments, updates and name changes, a design with provenance dating back to 1932 was produced by Ford for 27 years. It was powered by a Ford Sidevalve 1172 cc, , four-cylinder engine. The car was very basic. It had a single vacuum-powered wiper, no heater, vinyl trim, and very little chrome; even the bumpers were painted, and the bakelite dash of the Anglia was replaced by a flat steel panel. The Popular 103E differed visually from the Anglia E494E in having smaller headlights and a lack of trim on the side of the bonnet.Bill Ballard, English and Australian Small Fords: Recognition and Restoration, 2003, page 74 Early 103Es had the three spoke banjo type Anglia/Prefect steering wheel as stocks of these were used up, but most have a two spoke wheel similar to the 100E wheel but in brown. Early Populars also had the single centrally mounted tail/stop-lamp of the Anglia, but this changed to a two tail/stop lamp set up with the lamps mounted on the mudguards and a separate number plate lamp. In total, 155,340 Popular E103s were produced. This car proved successful because, while on paper it was a sensible alternative to a clean, late-model used car, in practice there were no clean late-model used cars available in postwar Britain owing to the six- year halt in production caused by the Second World War. This problem was compounded by stringent export quotas that made obtaining a new car in the late 1940s and into the early 1950s difficult, and covenants forbidding new- car buyers from selling for up to three years after delivery. Unless the purchaser could pay the extra £100 or so for an Anglia 100E, Austin A30 or Morris Minor, the choice was the Popular or a pre-war car. In later years, these cars became popular as hot rods since the late 1950s when people started drag racing them due to their lightweight construction. This practice started in the United States with Ford's 1932 Model B/18, while the Ford \\"Pop\\" as it was affectionately known became the definitive British hot rod – a reduced sized but readily available British alternative, a role it still plays today to a considerable extent. A car tested by The Motor magazine in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 24.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £390 including taxes. In Australia The Popular 103E was available in Australia up to 1955 as a two-door coupe utility and also in chassis-cowl form to accept custom built bodyworkwork. It utilised the 94 inch wheelbase of the Ford Prefect with 103E front panels. The utility was designated as 103E-67 and the chassis-cowl model as 103E-84. Bill Ballard, English and Australian Small Fords: Recognition and Restoration, 2003, page 134 The Popular utility differed from its Anglia A494A utility predecessor in that the Popular did not have running boards Bill Ballard, English and Australian Small Fords: Recognition and Restoration, 2003, page 76 whereas the Anglia did have them.Bill Ballard, English and Australian Small Fords: Recognition and Restoration, 2003, page 71 1954 Ford Popular 103E Coupe Utility Ford Popular 100E In 1959 the old Popular was replaced by a new version that was in production until 1962. Like the previous version it used a superseded Anglia body shell, this time that of the 100E, and it was powered by a strengthened 1172 cc sidevalve engine producing 36 bhp. The brakes were now hydraulic with drums all round. The new Popular offered 1,000 mile (1,500 km in metric countries) service intervals, like its predecessor, but it only had 13 grease points as against its predecessor's 23 (or 28 for the pre-war cars). The basic model stripped out many fittings from the Anglia but there was a large list of extras available and also a De Luxe version which supplied many as standard. 126,115 Popular 100Es were built. The Motor magazine tested a 100E in 1960 and found it to have a top speed of , acceleration from 0– in 19.6 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £494 including taxes with a comment that it was the lowest-priced orthodox saloon on the British Market. In 1960, the manufacturer's recommended retail price of £494 was equivalent to 26 weeks' worth of the average UK wage. The £100 charged in 1935 and the £1,299 charged for the Ford Escort Popular in 1975 both also amounted to 26 weeks' worth of average wage for the years in question. In the 1950s, however, the country had been undergoing a period of above average austerity: in 1953 the car's £390 sticker price represented 40 weeks' worth of the average UK wage. Ford Popular deluxe (100E) Popular trim level In 1975 the Popular name was revived as a base trim level of the newly released Ford Escort Mk2. This model featured a standard 1.1 litre OHV Kent engine, 12-inch wheels with cross ply tyres and drum brakes all round. The 1975 Ford Escort Popular was the first Ford to carry the Popular name that also featured a heater as standard equipment. The \\"Popular\\" trim level proved long-standing across the Ford range, featuring on later Escorts and the Fiesta, from 1980 to 1991. A 'Popular Plus' variant was also available. Ford Popular in television shows In 1970, a 1954 Ford Popular-based kit car, the Siva Edwardian (MTR 5), was used by Jon Pertwee to become \\"Bessie\\", the Doctor's sprightly Edwardian roadster on the long-running science-fiction television show, Doctor Who. (The plate number \\"WHO 1\\" had already been taken, so Bessie's legal plate number was MTR 5. A special set of WHO 1 plates were made for filming sequences only. In Bessie's last appearance in Sylvester McCoy's story \\"Battlefield\\" (Doctor Who), the plate number was WHO 7, possibly as a nod to McCoy's 7th Doctor. A black Ford Popular 103E (EBW 343) was also used in the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch Mr. and Mrs. Brian Norris' Ford Popular. In a spoof of epic journeys, the Norrises (Michael Palin as Brian Norris and Graham Chapman in drag as Betty Norris) set out to see if the journey from Surbiton to Hounslow was possible; they were thwarted by the Thames and had to finish the trek by rail. Between 1992 and 1997, two black Ford Populars (8253 PU and VXL 794) were used in Heartbeat as Oscar Blaketon's car.

Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists. Art The Young Shepherd, engraving using stipple technique by Giulio Campagnola, around 1510 In a drawing or painting, the dots are made of pigment of a single colour, applied with a pen or brush; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface. This is similar to—but distinct from—pointillism, which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours. In printmaking, dots may be carved out of a surface to which ink will be applied, to produce either a greater or lesser density of ink depending on the printing technique. In engraving, the technique was invented by Giulio Campagnola in about 1510. Stippling may also be used in engraving or sculpting an object even when there is no ink or paint involved, either to change the texture of the object, or to produce the appearance of light or dark shading depending on the reflective properties of the surface: for instance, stipple engraving on glass produces areas that appear brighter than the surrounding glass. The technique became popular as a means of producing shaded line art illustrations for publication, because drawings created this way could be reproduced in simple black ink. The other common method is hatching, which uses lines instead of dots. Stippling has traditionally been favoured over hatching in biological and medical illustration, since it is less likely than hatching to interfere visually with the structures being illustrated (the lines used in hatching can be mistaken for actual contours), and also since it allows the artist to vary the density of shading more subtly to depict curved or irregular surfaces. Images produced by halftoning or dithering and computer printers operate on similar principles (varying the size and/or spacing of dots on paper), but do so via photographic or digital processes rather than manually. These newer techniques have made it possible to convert continuous-tone images into patterns suitable for printing, but artists may still choose stippling for its simplicity and handmade appearance. The Wall Street Journal still features stippled and hatched portraits known as hedcuts (a style brought to the WSJ by Kevin Sprouls in 1979) in its pages, a holdover from its earlier avoidance of photographs. Due to the constraints of deferred shading, stippled transparency, where some pixels are fully opaque and some fully transparent, has become common for 3D models in some video games. Botany Artistic composition of musical elements using stippling technique In description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of Calochortus luteus, a lily endemic to California.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Gold Nuggets: Calochortus luteus, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Other uses The term stipple can also apply to a random pattern of small depressions applied to a surface to increase the friction and make the surface easier to grip. This process is similar to knurling or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as anatomical grips, where a regular pattern would not fit. Stippling can be cast into plastic objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to wood or metal objects. A further use of stipple indicates the damage caused by spider mites which make tiny white spots on plant leaves which can coalesce until the entire leaf appears silvery. In quilt making, the term refers to background quilting in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion machine quilting by densely stitching through all layers in a relatively close repetitive design. In interior decoration, the tips of the bristles of a stippling brush are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through. In digital photography, stippling refers to image noise similar to film grain. In forensic science, stippling refers to a pattern of gunshot residue burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm.

Alternatively, the covariant derivative is a way of introducing and working with a connection on a manifold by means of a differential operator, to be contrasted with the approach given by a principal connection on the frame bundle – see affine connection. In the special case of a manifold isometrically embedded into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space, the covariant derivative can be viewed as the orthogonal projection of the Euclidean directional derivative onto the manifold's tangent space. In this case the Euclidean derivative is broken into two parts, the extrinsic normal component (dependent on the embedding) and the intrinsic covariant derivative component. The name is motivated by the importance of changes of coordinate in physics: the covariant derivative transforms covariantly under a general coordinate transformation, that is, linearly via the Jacobian matrix of the transformation. This article presents an introduction to the covariant derivative of a vector field with respect to a vector field, both in a coordinate free language and using a local coordinate system and the traditional index notation. The covariant derivative of a tensor field is presented as an extension of the same concept. The covariant derivative generalizes straightforwardly to a notion of differentiation associated to a connection on a vector bundle, also known as a Koszul connection. History Historically, at the turn of the 20th century, the covariant derivative was introduced by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita in the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Ricci and Levi-Civita (following ideas of Elwin Bruno Christoffel) observed that the Christoffel symbols used to define the curvature could also provide a notion of differentiation which generalized the classical directional derivative of vector fields on a manifold.; reprint, ed. Weber, H. (1953), New York: Dover. This new derivative – the Levi-Civita connection – was covariant in the sense that it satisfied Riemann's requirement that objects in geometry should be independent of their description in a particular coordinate system. It was soon noted by other mathematicians, prominent among these being Hermann Weyl, Jan Arnoldus Schouten, and Élie Cartan,cf. with that a covariant derivative could be defined abstractly without the presence of a metric. The crucial feature was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second order transformation law. This transformation law could serve as a starting point for defining the derivative in a covariant manner. Thus the theory of covariant differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider range of possible geometries. In the 1940s, practitioners of differential geometry began introducing other notions of covariant differentiation in general vector bundles which were, in contrast to the classical bundles of interest to geometers, not part of the tensor analysis of the manifold. By and large, these generalized covariant derivatives had to be specified ad hoc by some version of the connection concept. In 1950, Jean-Louis Koszul unified these new ideas of covariant differentiation in a vector bundle by means of what is known today as a Koszul connection or a connection on a vector bundle. Using ideas from Lie algebra cohomology, Koszul successfully converted many of the analytic features of covariant differentiation into algebraic ones. In particular, Koszul connections eliminated the need for awkward manipulations of Christoffel symbols (and other analogous non-tensorial objects) in differential geometry. Thus they quickly supplanted the classical notion of covariant derivative in many post-1950 treatments of the subject. Motivation The covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, abla_{\\\\mathbf u}{\\\\mathbf v}, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, u, defined at a point P, and (2) a vector field, v, defined in a neighborhood of P.The covariant derivative is also denoted variously by \\\\partialvu, Dvu, or other notations. The output is the vector abla_{\\\\mathbf u}{\\\\mathbf v}(P), also at the point P. The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that abla_{\\\\mathbf u}{\\\\mathbf v} must, in a certain precise sense, be independent of the manner in which it is expressed in a coordinate system. A vector may be described as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in the fact that when a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of basis formula. Such a transformation law is known as a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, in the same way as a basis does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name). In the case of Euclidean space, one tends to define the derivative of a vector field in terms of the difference between two vectors at two nearby points. In such a system one translates one of the vectors to the origin of the other, keeping it parallel. With a Cartesian (fixed orthonormal) coordinate system \\"keeping it parallel\\" amounts to keeping the components constant. Euclidean space provides the simplest example: a covariant derivative which is obtained by taking the ordinary directional derivative of the components in the direction of the displacement vector between the two nearby points. In the general case, however, one must take into account the change of the coordinate system. For example, if the same covariant derivative is written in polar coordinates in a two dimensional Euclidean plane, then it contains extra terms that describe how the coordinate grid itself \\"rotates\\". In other cases the extra terms describe how the coordinate grid expands, contracts, twists, interweaves, etc. In this case \\"keeping it parallel\\" does not amount to keeping components constant under translation. Consider the example of moving along a curve γ(t) in the Euclidean plane. In polar coordinates, γ may be written in terms of its radial and angular coordinates by γ(t) = (r(t), θ(t)). A vector at a particular time tIn many applications, it may be better not to think of t as corresponding to time, at least for applications in general relativity. It is simply regarded as an abstract parameter varying smoothly and monotonically along the path. (for instance, the acceleration of the curve) is expressed in terms of (\\\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\mathbf{e}_{\\\\theta}), where \\\\mathbf{e}_r and \\\\mathbf{e}_{\\\\theta} are unit tangent vectors for the polar coordinates, serving as a basis to decompose a vector in terms of radial and tangential components. At a slightly later time, the new basis in polar coordinates appears slightly rotated with respect to the first set. The covariant derivative of the basis vectors (the Christoffel symbols) serve to express this change. In a curved space, such as the surface of the Earth (regarded as a sphere), the translation is not well defined and its analog, parallel transport, depends on the path along which the vector is translated. A vector e on a globe on the equator at point Q is directed to the north. Suppose we parallel transport the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) drag it along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we notice that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and is caused by the curvature of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector is a measure of the curvature. Remarks * The definition of the covariant derivative does not use the metric in space. However, for each metric there is a unique torsion-free covariant derivative called the Levi- Civita connection such that the covariant derivative of the metric is zero. * The properties of a derivative imply that abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u} depends on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point p in the same way as e.g. the derivative of a scalar function along a curve at a given point p depends on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of p. * The information on the neighborhood of a point p in the covariant derivative can be used to define parallel transport of a vector. Also the curvature, torsion, and geodesics may be defined only in terms of the covariant derivative or other related variation on the idea of a linear connection. Informal definition using an embedding into Euclidean space Suppose a Riemannian manifold M, is embedded into Euclidean space (\\\\R^n, \\\\langle\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot\\\\rangle) via a twice continuously-differentiable (C) mapping \\\\vec\\\\Psi : \\\\R^d \\\\supset U \\\\rightarrow \\\\R^n such that the tangent space at \\\\vec\\\\Psi(p) \\\\in M is spanned by the vectors :\\\\left\\\\lbrace \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\right_p : i \\\\in \\\\lbrace1, \\\\dots, d\\\\rbrace\\\\right\\\\rbrace and the scalar product on \\\\R^n is compatible with the metric on M: :g_{ij} = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^j} \\\\right\\\\rangle. (Since the manifold metric is always assumed to be regular, the compatibility condition implies linear independence of the partial derivative tangent vectors.) For a tangent vector field, \\\\vec V = v^j \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\,, one has :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec V}{\\\\partial x^i} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v^j}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^j} + v^j \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\, \\\\partial x^j} . The last term is not tangential to M, but can be expressed as a linear combination of the tangent space base vectors using the Christoffel symbols as linear factors plus a vector orthogonal to the tangent space: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\, \\\\partial x^j} = {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k} + \\\\vec n . In the case of the Levi-Civita connection, the covariant derivative abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\vec V, also written abla_i \\\\vec V, is defined as the orthogonal projection of the usual derivative onto tangent space: : abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_i} \\\\vec V := \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec V}{\\\\partial x^i} - \\\\vec n = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v^k}{\\\\partial x^i} + v^j {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k}. Since \\\\vec n is orthogonal to tangent space, one can solve the normal equations: : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\, \\\\partial x^j}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^l} \\\\right\\\\rangle = {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^l} \\\\right\\\\rangle = {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} \\\\, g_{kl} . On the other hand, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ab}}{\\\\partial x^c} = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{ \\\\partial x^c \\\\, \\\\partial x^a}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^b} \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^a}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{ \\\\partial x^c \\\\, \\\\partial x^b} \\\\right\\\\rangle implies : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{jk}}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ki}}{\\\\partial x^j} \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^k} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^j \\\\, \\\\partial x^k} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^j}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k \\\\, \\\\partial x^i} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\, \\\\partial x^j} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{pmatrix} (using the symmetry of the scalar product and swapping the order of partial differentiations) : \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{jk}}{\\\\partial x^i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ki}}{\\\\partial x^j} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^k} = 2\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec \\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^k}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\, \\\\partial x^j} \\\\right\\\\rangle and yields the Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection in terms of the metric: : g_{kl} {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{jl}}{\\\\partial x^i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{li}}{\\\\partial x^j}- \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^l}\\\\right). For a very simple example that captures the essence of the description above, draw a circle on a flat sheet of paper. Travel around the circle at a constant speed. The derivative of your velocity, your acceleration vector, always points radially inward. Roll this sheet of paper into a cylinder. Now the (Euclidean) derivative of your velocity has a component that sometimes points inward toward the axis of the cylinder depending on whether you're near a solstice or an equinox. (At the point of the circle when you are moving parallel to the axis, there is no inward acceleration. Conversely, at a point (1/4 of a circle later) when the velocity is along the cylinder's bend, the inward acceleration is maximum.) This is the (Euclidean) normal component. The covariant derivative component is the component parallel to the cylinder's surface, and is the same as that before you rolled the sheet into a cylinder. Formal definition A covariant derivative is a (Koszul) connection on the tangent bundle and other tensor bundles: it differentiates vector fields in a way analogous to the usual differential on functions. The definition extends to a differentiation on the duals of vector fields (i.e. covector fields) and to arbitrary tensor fields, in a unique way that ensures compatibility with the tensor product and trace operations (tensor contraction). Functions Given a point p of the manifold, a real function f on the manifold, and a tangent vector v at p, the covariant derivative of f at p along v is the scalar at p, denoted \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} f\\\\right)_p, that represents the principal part of the change in the value of f when the argument of f is changed by the infinitesimal displacement vector v. (This is the differential of f evaluated against the vector v.) Formally, there is a differentiable curve \\\\phi:[-1, 1]\\\\to M such that \\\\phi(0) = p and \\\\phi'(0) = \\\\mathbf{v}, and the covariant derivative of f at p is defined by :\\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} f\\\\right)_p = \\\\left(f \\\\circ \\\\phi\\\\right)'\\\\left(0\\\\right) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0}t^{-1}\\\\left(f\\\\left[\\\\phi\\\\left(t\\\\right)\\\\right] - f\\\\left[p\\\\right]\\\\right). When v is a vector field, the covariant derivative abla_\\\\mathbf{v}f is the function that associates with each point p in the common domain of f and v the scalar \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}f\\\\right)_p. This coincides with the usual Lie derivative of f along the vector field v. Vector fields A covariant derivative abla at a point p in a smooth manifold assigns a tangent vector ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u})_p to each pair (\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}), consisting of a tangent vector v at p and vector field u defined in a neighborhood of p, such that the following properties hold (for any vectors v, x and y at p, vector fields u and w defined in a neighborhood of p, scalar values g and h at p, and scalar function f defined in a neighborhood of p): # \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p is linear in \\\\mathbf{v} so #: \\\\left( abla_{g\\\\mathbf{x} + h\\\\mathbf{y}} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p = \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p g + \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p h # \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p is additive in \\\\mathbf{u} so: #: \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\right]\\\\right)_p = \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p + \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\right)_p # ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u})_p obeys the product rule; i.e., where abla_\\\\mathbf{v}f is defined above, #: \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\left[f\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right]\\\\right)_p = f(p)\\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u})_p + ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}f\\\\right)_p\\\\mathbf{u}_p. If u and v are both vector fields defined over a common domain, then abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf u denotes the vector field whose value at each point p of the domain is the tangent vector \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf u\\\\right)_p. Note that \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p depends not only on the value of u and v at p but also on values of u in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of p because of the last property, the product rule. Covector fields Given a field of covectors (or one-form) \\\\alpha defined in a neighborhood of p, its covariant derivative ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\alpha)_p is defined in a way to make the resulting operation compatible with tensor contraction and the product rule. That is, ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\alpha)_p is defined as the unique one-form at p such that the following identity is satisfied for all vector fields u in a neighborhood of p :\\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\alpha\\\\right)_p \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{u}_p\\\\right) = abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\left[\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)\\\\right]_p - \\\\alpha_p\\\\left[\\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right)_p\\\\right]. The covariant derivative of a covector field along a vector field v is again a covector field. Tensor fields Once the covariant derivative is defined for fields of vectors and covectors it can be defined for arbitrary tensor fields by imposing the following identities for every pair of tensor fields \\\\varphi and \\\\psi\\\\, in a neighborhood of the point p: : abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\left(\\\\varphi \\\\otimes \\\\psi\\\\right)_p = \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\varphi\\\\right)_p \\\\otimes \\\\psi(p) + \\\\varphi(p) \\\\otimes \\\\left( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\psi\\\\right)_p, and for \\\\varphi and \\\\psi of the same valence : abla_\\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\varphi + \\\\psi)_p = ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\varphi)_p + ( abla_\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\psi)_p. The covariant derivative of a tensor field along a vector field v is again a tensor field of the same type. Explicitly, let T be a tensor field of type . Consider T to be a differentiable multilinear map of smooth sections α1, α2, ..., αq of the cotangent bundle T∗M and of sections X1, X2, ... Xp of the tangent bundle TM, written T(α1, α2, ..., X1, X2, ...) into R. The covariant derivative of T along Y is given by the formula :\\\\begin{align} ( abla_Y T)&\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right) = Y\\\\left(T\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\ &\\\\- T\\\\left( abla_Y\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right) - T\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, abla_Y\\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right) - \\\\ldots \\\\ &\\\\- T\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, abla_YX_1, X_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right) - T\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots, X_1, abla_YX_2, \\\\ldots\\\\right) - \\\\ldots \\\\end{align} Coordinate description Given coordinate functions : x^i,\\\\ i=0,1,2,\\\\dots, any tangent vector can be described by its components in the basis : \\\\mathbf{e}_i={\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial x^i}. The covariant derivative of a basis vector along a basis vector is again a vector and so can be expressed as a linear combination \\\\Gamma^k \\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\,. To specify the covariant derivative it is enough to specify the covariant derivative of each basis vector field \\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\, along \\\\mathbf{e}_j\\\\,. : abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} \\\\mathbf{e}_i = {\\\\Gamma^k}_{i j} \\\\mathbf{e}_k, the coefficients \\\\Gamma^k_{\\\\ i j} are the components of the connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols. Then using the rules in the definition, we find that for general vector fields \\\\mathbf{v} = v^j \\\\mathbf{e}_j and \\\\mathbf{u} = u^i \\\\mathbf{e}_i we get :\\\\begin{align} abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u} &= abla_{v^j \\\\mathbf{e}_j} u^i \\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\ &= v^j abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} u^i \\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\ &= v^j u^i abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} \\\\mathbf{e}_i + v^j \\\\mathbf{e}_i abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} u^i \\\\ &= v^j u^i {\\\\Gamma^k}_{i j}\\\\mathbf{e}_k + v^j{\\\\partial u^i \\\\over \\\\partial x^j} \\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\end{align} so : abla_\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\left(v^j u^i {\\\\Gamma^k}_{i j} + v^j{\\\\partial u^k\\\\over\\\\partial x^j}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{e}_k The first term in this formula is responsible for \\"twisting\\" the coordinate system with respect to the covariant derivative and the second for changes of components of the vector field u. In particular : abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} \\\\mathbf{u} = abla_j \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u^i}{\\\\partial x^j} + u^k {\\\\Gamma^i}_{kj} \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_i In words: the covariant derivative is the usual derivative along the coordinates with correction terms which tell how the coordinates change. For covectors similarly we have : abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_j} {\\\\mathbf \\\\theta} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta_i}{\\\\partial x^j} - \\\\theta_k {\\\\Gamma^k}_{ij} \\\\right) {\\\\mathbf e^*}^i where {\\\\mathbf e^*}^i(\\\\mathbf{e}_j) = {\\\\delta^i}_j. The covariant derivative of a type tensor field along e_c is given by the expression: :\\\\begin{align} {( abla_{e_c} T)^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_s} = {} &\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^c}{T^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_s} \\\\ &\\\\+ \\\\,{\\\\Gamma ^{a_1}}_{dc} {T^{d a_2 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_s} + \\\\cdots + {\\\\Gamma^{a_r}}_{dc} {T^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_{r-1}d}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_s} \\\\ &-\\\\,{\\\\Gamma^d}_{b_1 c} {T^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{d b_2 \\\\ldots b_s} - \\\\cdots - {\\\\Gamma^d}_{b_s c} {T^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_{s-1} d}. \\\\end{align} Or, in words: take the partial derivative of the tensor and add: +{\\\\Gamma^{a_i}}_{dc} for every upper index a_i, and -{\\\\Gamma^d}_{b_ic} for every lower index b_i. If instead of a tensor, one is trying to differentiate a tensor density (of weight +1), then you also add a term :-{\\\\Gamma^d}_{d c} {T^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_r}}_{b_1 \\\\ldots b_s}. If it is a tensor density of weight W, then multiply that term by W. For example, \\\\sqrt{-g} is a scalar density (of weight +1), so we get: :\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\right)_{;c} = \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\right)_{,c} - \\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,{\\\\Gamma^d}_{d c} where semicolon \\";\\" indicates covariant differentiation and comma \\",\\" indicates partial differentiation. Incidentally, this particular expression is equal to zero, because the covariant derivative of a function solely of the metric is always zero. Examples For a scalar field \\\\displaystyle \\\\phi\\\\,, covariant differentiation is simply partial differentiation: :\\\\displaystyle \\\\phi_{;a} \\\\equiv \\\\partial_a \\\\phi For a contravariant vector field \\\\lambda^a\\\\,, we have: :{\\\\lambda^a}_{;b} \\\\equiv \\\\partial_b \\\\lambda^a + {\\\\Gamma^a}_{bc}\\\\lambda^c For a covariant vector field \\\\lambda_a\\\\,, we have: :\\\\lambda_{a;c} \\\\equiv \\\\partial_c \\\\lambda_a - {\\\\Gamma^b}_{c a}\\\\lambda_b For a type (2,0) tensor field \\\\tau^{a b}\\\\,, we have: :{\\\\tau^{a b}}_{;c} \\\\equiv \\\\partial_c \\\\tau^{a b} + {\\\\Gamma^a}_{c d}\\\\tau^{d b} + {\\\\Gamma^b}_{c d}\\\\tau^{a d} For a type (0,2) tensor field \\\\tau_{a b}\\\\,, we have: :\\\\tau_{a b ;c} \\\\equiv \\\\partial_c \\\\tau_{a b} - {\\\\Gamma^d}_{c a}\\\\tau_{d b} - {\\\\Gamma^d}_{c b}\\\\tau_{a d} For a type (1,1) tensor field {\\\\tau^{a}}_{b}\\\\,, we have: :{\\\\tau^a}_{b;c}\\\\equiv \\\\partial_c {\\\\tau^a}_b + {\\\\Gamma^a}_{c d}{\\\\tau^d}_b - {\\\\Gamma^d}_{c b} {\\\\tau^a}_d The notation above is meant in the sense :{\\\\tau^{a b}}_{;c} \\\\equiv \\\\left( abla_{\\\\mathbf{e}_c}\\\\tau\\\\right)^{a b} Covariant derivatives do not commute; i.e. \\\\lambda_{a;bc} eq \\\\lambda_{a;cb}\\\\,. It can be shown that: : \\\\lambda_{a;bc} - \\\\lambda_{a;cb} = {R^d}_{abc}\\\\lambda_d where {R^d}_{abc} \\\\, is the Riemann tensor. Similarly, : {\\\\lambda^a}_{;bc} - {\\\\lambda^a}_{;cb} = -{R^a}_{dbc}\\\\lambda^d and : {\\\\tau^{ab}}_{;cd} - {\\\\tau^{ab}}_{;dc} = -{R^a}_{ecd}\\\\tau^{eb} - {R^b}_{ecd}\\\\tau^{ae} The latter can be shown by taking (without loss of generality) that \\\\tau^{ab} = \\\\lambda^a \\\\mu^b \\\\,. Notation In textbooks on physics, the covariant derivative is sometimes simply stated in terms of its components in this equation. Often a notation is used in which the covariant derivative is given with a semicolon, while a normal partial derivative is indicated by a comma. In this notation we write the same as: : abla_{e_j} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {v^s}_{;j}e_s \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; {v^i}_{;j} = {v^i}_{,j} + v^k {\\\\Gamma^i}_{k j} Once again this shows that the covariant derivative of a vector field is not just simply obtained by differentiating to the coordinates {v^i}_{,j}, but also depends on the vector v itself through v^k {\\\\Gamma^i}_{k j}. In some older texts (notably Adler, Bazin & Schiffer, Introduction to General Relativity), the covariant derivative is denoted by a double pipe and the partial derivative by single pipe: : abla_{e_j} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {v^i}_{j} = {v^i}_{j} + v^k {\\\\Gamma^i}_{k j} Derivative along a curve Since the covariant derivative abla_XT of a tensor field T at a point p depends only on the value of the vector field X at p one can define the covariant derivative along a smooth curve \\\\gamma(t) in a manifold: :D_tT= abla_{\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t)}T. Note that the tensor field T only needs to be defined on the curve \\\\gamma(t) for this definition to make sense. In particular, \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}(t) is a vector field along the curve \\\\gamma itself. If abla_{\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t)}\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t) vanishes then the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. If the covariant derivative is the Levi- Civita connection of a certain metric then the geodesics for the connection are precisely the geodesics of the metric that are parametrised by arc length. The derivative along a curve is also used to define the parallel transport along the curve. Sometimes the covariant derivative along a curve is called absolute or intrinsic derivative. Relation to Lie derivative A covariant derivative introduces an extra geometric structure on a manifold that allows vectors in neighboring tangent spaces to be compared: there is no canonical way to compare vectors from different tangent spaces because there is no canonical coordinate system. There is however another generalization of directional derivatives which is canonical: the Lie derivative, which evaluates the change of one vector field along the flow of another vector field. Thus, one must know both vector fields in an open neighborhood, not merely at a single point. The covariant derivative on the other hand introduces its own change for vectors in a given direction, and it only depends on the vector direction at a single point, rather than a vector field in an open neighborhood of a point. In other words, the covariant derivative is linear (over C∞(M)) in the direction argument, while the Lie derivative is linear in neither argument. Note that the antisymmetrized covariant derivative , and the Lie derivative Luv differ by the torsion of the connection, so that if a connection is torsion free, then its antisymmetrization is the Lie derivative.

It was founded as Wheeling College in 1954 by the Society of Jesus (also known as the Jesuits) and was a Jesuit institution until 2019. Wheeling University competes in Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association as a member of the Mountain East Conference. History Richard Whelan, bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling, lobbied the Society of Jesus in the 19th century to establish a university in the growing city. Over a century later, Whelan's original vision came to fruition. After a donor, Sara Tracy, left her estate to the diocese, it purchased land for a Jesuit college from Mt. De Chantal Visitation Academy.\\"Home in a New Land: The Uncanny Jesuit Journey to Wheeling.\\" In Wheeling, Winter 2009: 32–33. Print. Wheeling College was founded through a partnership of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston with the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus. Ground was broken on November 24, 1953, and the college was officially incorporated on September 25, 1954. It opened to students on September 26, 1955. The establishment of the college required $2.75 million in start-up costs. Overcoming the difficulties of temporary facilities and a faculty of twelve Jesuit priests and four lay professors, the school grew considerably. For the 1987–1988 school year, the university became Wheeling Jesuit College, and in July 1996, gained university status. In 2012, university leadership was accused by the federal government of misappropriating NASA grant money received for sponsored programs. Wheeling Jesuit settled with the federal government in 2015, paying $2.3 million in restitution. In March 2013, the university announced the selection of Fr. James Fleming as its tenth president. Fleming took office effective July 1, 2013. Fleming resigned from the presidency on January 3, 2017. In 2019, the school eliminated majors in history, theology, philosophy, literature and engineering, and cut 20 of the university's full-time faculty members. Jesuit heritage Prior to 2019, the Jesuit community was active in the process of education at Wheeling. In addition, the Jesuits were involved in many other academic works, such as the Appalachian Institute on campus. Members of Wheeling's Jesuit Community reside at Whelan Hall, dedicated in 1955. The Jesuit community and tradition for critical thinking were reflected in the school's curriculum and mission. Wheeling Jesuit University was a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.I Make A Difference: National Jesuit Alumni Service Days 2016. Retrieved April 25, 2016, from http://www.ajcunet.edu/ In April 2019, as part of a broader restructuring of its academic programs, the university announced the elimination of its programs in theology and philosophy that are key to its identity as a Jesuit institution. The Jesuits in turn decided to end their academic affiliation with the university at the end of the 2018–2019 academic year, while continuing to provide \\"an ongoing Jesuit presence\\" through its campus ministry and other programs. Two months later, Monsignor Kevin Quirk resigned from his position as chair of the university's board of trustees after The Washington Post published details from a confidential report alleging that one of his former colleagues was guilty of sexual abuse and financial impropriety. In July, the university formally dropped \\"Jesuit\\" from its name and became Wheeling University. Presidents *Very Rev. Lawrence R. McHugh, S.J., 1954-1959 *Rev. William F.

Favede - 2019- Admissions and rankings According to the Wheeling University's page on the U-CAN Network, the average high school GPA of the freshman class is 3.5 The school is given a selectivity score of 81 out of 100 by the Princeton Review. In 1997, WJU was named as the fourth-best educational value in the southeast, and the 15th-best college in the region. In addition, the school is ranked as the 18th best master's university in the South by U.S. News and World Report. The 2009 Forbes magazine ranking placed WJU as 180 of 600 colleges, a marked improvement from their No. 437 rank in 2008. Forbes ranked the university as the 79th best value in America. The university is ranked among the John Templeton Foundation's Colleges that Encourage Character Development. Academics In honor of former professor Fr. Stephen J. Laut, S.J., the university offers the Laut Honors Program. Throughout each school year, members of the program meet to discuss and study material related to that year's theme. At the conclusion of a student's sophomore year, students who have successfully completed the Laut program are invited to join the Ignatian Honors Seminar, a more rigorous program for which only six juniors and six seniors are selected. Wheeling encourages all students to become actively involved in research in their desired fields. In many fields, seniors are required to complete a thesis or capstone project. In addition, students are actively encouraged to participate in the annual Student Research and Scholarship Symposium, in which students present research done over the past academic year. Graduate Programs Wheeling University's Center for Professional and Graduate Studies offers five graduate programs, a Master of Business Administration; Master of Accountancy; Master of Science in Nursing; Master of Science in Organizational Leadership; and a Doctor of Physical Therapy. The Center for Professional and Graduate Studies offers a Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Leadership and Development (BOLD) and a Master of Science in Organizational Leadership (MSOL). These are adult education programs that meet once a week in the evening. Clifford M. Lewis, S.J. Appalachian Institute The Appalachian Institute at Wheeling University focuses on issues such as Appalachian health, hope, education, economic development, and coal impoundment, and has conducted research and produced exhibits regarding this issues. In 2010, the university hosted the Ignatian Solidarity Network Spring Teach-In, which focused on issues of environmental sustainability and stewardship. In September 2010, the Appalachian Institute held its second annual Appalachian Film Festival. Institute for the Study of Capitalism and Morality As a result of a donation from BB&T;, in 2006 the university became home to the Institute for the Study of Capitalism and Morality. According to its website, the Institute desires to study the roles of capitalism in a free society. The institute also promotes research and essay competitions, forums and debates, and a lecture series. Lecturers for the 2007–2008 school year included Thomas Woods and Doug Bandow.\\"The Study of Capitalism and Morality.\\" WJU Institute for the Study of Capitalism and Morality.

Fr. Thomas S. Acker, S.J., the center was built in 2002. It is home to classrooms and labs. Donahue Hall The oldest academic building on campus, Donahue Hall was constructed in 1955 and was renovated in 1988. Donahue holds faculty offices, labs, and classrooms.\\"Donahue Hall.\\" History of Campus Buildings. Wheeling Jesuit University. April 18, 2008 . The hall is connected to the Acker Science Center via the \\"Acker bridge.\\" Mount de Chantal Conservatory of Music The adjacent former girl's academy, Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy ceased operations in August 2010 and the Sisters of the Visitation who ran the school since its inception moved to the monastery at Georgetown Visitation Academy in Washington, DC. Wishing to see the Mount's legacy continued, the sisters gifted a large sum of money to establish and fund a Conservatory of Music at the university. Thus the Mount de Chantal Conservatory of Music came to be in the lower floor of the university's CET building. The Conservatory features a recital hall, practice rooms, a parlor for students and visitors, and a gallery displaying art, antiques and archival materials from Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy. Each year, one incoming female freshman receives a $10,000 Mount de Chantal Scholarship, renewable annually, through the Mount de Chantal Fine Arts Education Fund. In the Fall of 2013, Wheeling University expanded its physical therapy doctoral program into downtown Wheeling, WV where it offers a free physical therapy clinic. The physical therapy program will relocate back to campus starting in the Fall 2019 semester. Athletics Wheeling currently supports 16 NCAA Division II sports, including: Women's volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's golf, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's indoor and outdoor track & field, men's and women's basketball, women's lacrosse, softball, baseball, and football. The Cardinals also have D1A men's rugby program. The university's home indoor athletic events for volleyball and basketball are held in WJU's McDonough Center. WJU's soccer and women's lacrosse teams play on the turfed Bishop Schmitt Field. The Cardinals baseball and softball teams call the J.B. Chambers Complex located off campus located along I-470 as their home fields. Wheeling competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as part of the Mountain East Conference (MEC) as one of the four-year conference's founding members. Prior to the MEC, the Cardinals played in the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from 1957 to 2013. Campus life Wheeling University's campus features fifteen buildings, six of which are residence halls. Residence life Looking toward Campion and McHugh Residence Halls on WU's campus The university has seven residence halls under its jurisdiction. * Campion – Housing for male freshman and upperclassmen students with 1 floor for female students * McHugh – Housing for male freshman students * Ignatius – Upgraded co-ed housing for upperclass students, featuring an \\"Ace Floor\\" for approved, academically achieved students with around-the-clock quiet hours * Kirby – Upgraded housing for female students, occasionally freshmen * Sara Tracy – Housing for female freshman students * Steenrod – Apartment housing for graduate students, off the main campus but on university-owned property across Washington Avenue. Student organizations and publicationsStudent government= The Student Government Association offices are located in Swint Hall. The Student Government Association is the elected voice of WU students. The Wheeling SGA consists of two branches: the Executive Board (\\"E-Board\\") and the Student Senate. The E-Board consists of a President and Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Student Advocate, Social Affairs Representative, Academic Affairs Representative, and Academic Affairs Representative. The Student Senate is composed of at-large representatives, class officers, and a commuter representative. =Organizations= Wheeling University students are given an array of opportunities for campus involvement. Student Government and the Campus Activities Board plan activities each year, in addition to those already put on by clubs. While many of the clubs are service-oriented in nature, there are also political, artistic, and major-related organizations. *Appalachian Experience Club *Campus Activities Board *Criminal Justice Club *HESS (Help Enrich Someone Special) Mentoring *International Student Club *Philosophy Club (Sense and Nonsense) *Student Leaders Across Campus *Student Nurses Association *Theatre Guild Campus traditionsCulture Fest= Each spring Wheeling's International Student club sponsors a festival celebrating the cultural diversity of WU.

On January 1, 1963 it merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).IEEE History Center: A Brief History of IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, USA. Retrieved on 10-06-2010. Founding Following several attempts to form a technical organization of wireless practitioners in 1908–1912, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) was finally established in 1912 in New York City. Among its founding organizations were the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (SWTE) and the Wireless Institute (TWI). At the time, the dominant organization of electrical engineers was the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). Many of the founding members of IRE considered AIEE too conservative and too focused on electric power. Moreover, the founders of the IRE sought to establish an international organization (unlike the “American” AIEE), and adopted a tradition of electing some of the IRE's officers from outside the United States. In the first half of the 20th century, radio communications has experienced great expansion, and the growing professional community of developers and operators of radio systems required standardization, research, and authoritative dissemination of new results among practitioners and researchers. To meet these needs, the IRE established professional journals (most notably the Proceedings of the IRE, established 1913 and edited for 41 years by Alfred N. Goldsmith); participated actively in all aspects of standardization and regulations of the frequency spectrum, modulation techniques, testing methods, and radio equipment; and organized regional and professional groups (starting in 1914 and 1948, respectively) for cooperation and exchange between members. The IRE was a major participant in planning of the Federal Radio Commission (established 1927; later the Federal Communications Commission), and worked in close cooperation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Radio Manufacturers Association, the Radio and Television Manufacturers Association, and the National Television System Committee on Standards. The IRE also started (in 1914) a program of professional recognition, through the membership grade of IRE Fellow. The first Fellow was Jonathan Zenneck (1871–1959), a pioneer of wireless telegraphy. Merger Until the early 1940s IRE was a relatively small engineering organization, but the growing importance of electrical communications and the emergence of the discipline of electronics in the 1940s have increased its appeal to practitioners. Students of electrical engineering and young electrical engineers favored IRE over its older rival, the AIEE, and in 1957 IRE (with 57,000 members) was the larger organization. Negotiations about merging the two organizations started that year and continued until a new joint organization, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) was established in 1963. Several new professional organizations (such as the Society of Broadcast Engineers), were founded shortly thereafter by IRE and AIEE members who opposed the merger. The first president of IRE was Robert H. Marriott, chief engineer of the Wireless Company of America. Other notable presidents of the IRE included Irving Langmuir (1923), John H. Morecroft (1924), Lee deForest (1930), Louis A. Hazeltine (1936), Frederick E. Terman (1941), Arthur F. Van Dyck (1942), William R. Hewlett (1954), Ernst Weber (1959; also first president of IEEE, 1963) and Patrick E. Haggerty (1962).IRE Presidents, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, USA. Retrieved on 10-06-2010.

Biography Shines was born in the community of Frayser, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was taught to play the guitar by his mother and spent most of his childhood in Memphis, playing slide guitar at an early age in juke joints and on the street. He moved to Hughes, Arkansas, in 1932 and worked on farms for three years, putting aside his music career.Johnny Shines interviewed by John Hammond Jr. in The Search for Robert Johnson (UK, 1991). A chance meeting with Robert Johnson, his greatest influence, gave him the inspiration to return to music. In 1935, Shines began traveling with Johnson, touring in the United States and Canada. They parted in 1937, one year before Johnson's death. Shines played throughout the southern United States until 1941, when he settled in Chicago. There he found work in the construction industry but continued to play in local bars. He made his first recording in 1946 for Columbia Records, but the takes were never released. He recorded for Chess Records in 1950, but again no records were released. He kept playing with blues musicians in the Chicago area for several more years. In 1952, Shines recorded what is considered his best work, for J.O.B. Records. The recordings were a commercial failure, and Shines, frustrated with the music industry, sold his equipment and returned to working in construction. In 1966, Vanguard Records found Shines taking photographs in a Chicago blues club, and he recorded tracks for the third volume of Chicago/The Blues/Today! The album became a blues classic, and it brought Shines into the mainstream music scene. Shines toured with the Chicago All Stars alongside Lee Jackson, Big Walter Horton and Willie Dixon. Shines moved to Holt, Alabama, in Tuscaloosa County, in 1969. Natalie Mattson, a student at the University of Alabama, learned that he was living in the area and invited him to play at a campus coffee house, the Down Under, which she ran. Shines played there on several occasions and brought his friend, blues artist Mississippi Fred McDowell, to perform with him. These were some of his earliest appearances in Alabama after his move there. He continued to play the international blues circuit while living in Holt. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Shines toured with Robert Lockwood, Jr., Robert Johnson's stepson, one of the last living original Delta blues musicians. In 1980, Shines's career was brought to a standstill when he suffered a stroke. He later appeared and played in the 1991 documentary The Search for Robert Johnson. His final album, Back to the Country, with accompaniment by Snooky Pryor and Johnny Nicholas, won a W. C. Handy Award. In 1989, Shines met Kent DuChaine, and the two of them toured for the next several years, until Shines's death. Shines died on April 20, 1992, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame later the same year. According to the music journalist Tony Russell, > Shines was that rare being, a blues artist who overcame age and rustiness to > make music that stood up beside the work of his youth. When Shines came back > to the blues in 1965 he was 50, yet his voice had the leonine power of a > dozen years before, when he made records his reputation was based on.

He was also the author of Dehkhoda dictionary, the most extensive dictionary of the Persian language published to date. Biography Dehkhoda was born in Tehran to parents from Qazvin. His father, Khan Baba Khan Ghazvini, died when he was only 9 years old. Dehkhoda quickly excelled in Persian literature, Arabic and French. He enrolled at the School of Political Science, which employed, amongst other figures, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and his Secretary as lecturers. He was also active in politics, and served in the Majles as a Member of Parliament from Kerman and Tehran. He also served as Dean of Tehran School of Political Science and later the School of Law of the University of Tehran. In 1903, he went to the Balkans as an Iranian embassy employee, but came back to Iran two years later and became involved in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran. In Iran Dehkhoda, Mirza Jahangir Khan and Ghasem Khan had been publishing the Sur-e Esrafil newspaper for about two years, but the authoritarian king Mohammad Ali Shah disbanded the parliament and banished Dehkhoda and some other liberalists into exile in Europe. There he continued publishing articles and editorials, but when Mohammad Ali Shah was deposed in 1911, he returned to the country and became a member of the new Majles. He is buried in Ebn-e Babooyeh cemetery in Shahr-e Ray, near Tehran.

Internet research has had a profound impact on the way ideas are formed and knowledge is created. Common applications of Internet research include personal research on a particular subject (something mentioned on the news, a health problem, etc.), students doing research for academic projects and papers, and journalists and other writers researching stories. Research is a broad term. Here, it is used to mean \\"looking something up (on the Web)\\". It includes any activity where a topic is identified, and an effort is made to actively gather information for the purpose of furthering understanding. It may include some post-collection analysis like a concern for quality or synthesis. Through searches on the Internet hundreds or thousands of pages can often be quickly found with some relation to a given topic. In addition, email (including mailing lists), online discussion forums (aka message boards, BBS's), and other personal communication facilities (instant messaging, IRC, newsgroups, etc.) can provide direct access to experts and other individuals with relevant interests and knowledge. Internet research is distinct from library research (focusing on library-bound resources) and commercial database research (focusing on commercial databases). While many commercial databases are delivered through the Internet, and some libraries purchase access to library databases on behalf of their patrons, searching such databases is generally not considered part of “Internet research”. It should also be distinguished from scientific research (research following a defined and rigorous process) carried out on the Internet, from straightforward retrieving of details like a name or phone number, and from research about the Internet. Internet research can provide quick, immediate, and worldwide access to information, although results may be affected by unrecognized bias, difficulties in verifying a writer's credentials (and therefore the accuracy or pertinence of the information obtained) and whether the searcher has sufficient skill to draw meaningful results from the abundance of material typically available. The first resources retrieved may not be the most suitable resources to answer a particular question. Popularity is often a factor used in structuring Internet search results but popular information is not always most correct or representative of the breadth of knowledge and opinion on a topic. While conducting commercial research fosters a deep concern with costs, and library research fosters a concern with access, Internet research fosters a deep concern for quality, managing the abundance of information and with avoiding unintended bias. This is partly because Internet research occurs in a less mature information environment: an environment with less sophisticated / poorly communicated search skills and much less effort in organizing information. Library and commercial research has many search tactics and strategies unavailable on the Internet and the library and commercial environments invest more deeply in organizing and vetting their information. Search tools The most popular search tools for finding information on the Internet include Web search engines, meta search engines, Web directories, and specialty search services. A Web search engine uses software known as a Web crawler to follow the hyperlinks connecting the pages on the World Wide Web. The information on these Web pages is indexed and stored by the search engine. To access this information, a user enters keywords in a search form and the search engine queries its algorithms, which take into consideration the location and frequency of keywords on a Web page, along with the quality and number of external hyperlinks pointing at the Web page. A Meta search engine enables users to enter a search query once and it runs against multiple search engines simultaneously, creating a list of aggregated search results. Since no single search engine covers the entire web, a meta search engine can produce a more comprehensive search of the web. Most meta search engines automatically eliminate duplicate search results. However, meta search engines have a significant limitation because the most popular search engines, such as Google, are not included because of legal restrictions. A Web directory organizes subjects in a hierarchical fashion that lets users investigate the breadth of a specific topic and drill down to find relevant links and content. Web directories can be assembled automatically by algorithms or handcrafted. Human-edited Web directories have the distinct advantage of higher quality and reliability, while those produced by algorithms can offer more comprehensive coverage. The scope of Web directories are generally broad, such as DOZ, Yahoo! and The WWW Virtual Library, covering a wide range of subjects, while others focus on specific topics. Specialty search tools enable users to find information that conventional search engines and meta search engines cannot access because the content is stored in databases. In fact, the vast majority of information on the web is stored in databases that require users to go to a specific site and access it through a search form. Often, the content is generated dynamically. As a consequence, Web crawlers are unable to index this information. In a sense, this content is \\"hidden\\" from search engines, leading to the term invisible or deep Web. Specialty search tools have evolved to provide users with the means to quickly and easily find deep Web content. These specialty tools rely on advanced bot and intelligent agent technologies to search the deep Web and automatically generate specialty Web directories, such as the Virtual Private Library.  Website authorship  When using the Internet for research, countless websites appear for whatever search query is entered. Each of these sites has one or more authors or associated organizations. Who authored or sponsored a website is very important to the accuracy and reliability of the information presented on the website. While it is very imperative that the authorship be determined for every website during Internet research, who authored or sponsored a website is essential culture when one cares about the accuracy and reliability of the information, bias, and/or web safety. For example, a website about civil rights that is authored by a member of an extremist group most likely will not contain accurate or unbiased information. The author or sponsoring organization of a website may be found in several ways. Sometimes the author or organization can be found at the bottom of the website home page. Another way is by looking in the ‘Contact Us’ section of the website. It may be directly listed, determined from the email address, or by emailing and asking. If the author's name or sponsoring organization cannot be determined, one should question the trustworthiness of the website. If the author's name or sponsoring organization is found, a simple Internet search can provide information that can be used to determine if the website is reliable and unbiased.  Internet research software  Internet research software captures information while performing Internet research. This information can then be organized in various ways included tagging and hierarchical trees. The goal is to collect information relevant to a specific research project in one place, so that it can be found and accessed again quickly. These tools also allow captured content to be edited and annotated and some allow the ability to export to other formats. Other features common to outliners include the ability to use full text search which aids in quickly locating information and filters enable you to drill down to see only information relevant to a specific query. Captured and kept information also provides an additional backup, in case web pages and sites disappear or are inaccessible later.

He played for the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Seattle Mariners, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and Florida Marlins over a 16 year career. In 2002, Cameron became the 13th player to hit four home runs in one game. He was also an All-Star in 2001 and won Gold Gloves in 2001, 2003, and 2006. Mike Cameron has distinguished himself by being only one of 22 players in the history of baseball to have at least 250 home runs and 250 stolen bases and became the 20th member of this exclusive 250/250 club. Cameron is also the only MLB player to hit 2 home runs in the same game with 8 separate teams. Early life Cameron was born in La Grange, Georgia and raised on Render Street by his grandmother; he moved into her house when he was seven years old to keep her company after her husband died. Cameron attended LaGrange High School. His grandmother kept him from playing baseball as a high school junior because he failed a chemistry class. As a result, he drew less attention from scouts. Playing career=Chicago White Sox Cameron was drafted out of high school in the 18th round by the Chicago White Sox in 1991. His major league debut took place on August 27, , with the Chicago White Sox. In he won a starting job as the team's regular center fielder. Cincinnati Reds He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Paul Konerko in . Seattle Mariners Along with three other players he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ken Griffey, Jr. before the season. Cameron tied a major league record on May 2, 2002 when he hit four home runs in one game becoming only the 15th player in MLB history to do this. In his fifth at bat, he hit one to the warning track, just missing what would have been a record-setting fifth home run. He played in the All-Star Game in and reached the postseason twice and won the Gold Glove Award in 2001, 2003, and 2006 (with the Padres) for his defensive play in the outfield. He led all major league center fielders in range factor (3.42) in 2003. New York Mets In , he signed a three-year, $19.5 million contract to play center field for the New York Mets. With the acquisition by the Mets of Carlos Beltrán before the 2005 season, Cameron surrendered his position to the star center fielder and played most of his games in right field during the 2005 season. On August 11, 2005, in San Diego, Cameron collided with Beltran in the outfield as both made diving attempts to catch a fly ball. Cameron suffered a concussion and multiple fractures of his nose and cheekbones, and was removed from the field on a stretcher. Beltran also suffered a concussion but was able to walk off the field with help. San Diego Padres Cameron batting for the Padres in . On November 15, Cameron was traded to the San Diego Padres for Xavier Nady. He won his first National League Gold Glove award during the season with San Diego. After leaving the Seattle Mariners in 2004 via free agency, Cameron played his first game back in Seattle during inter-league play in May 2006. Mariners fans greeted his return with a standing ovation. On October 31, 2007, it was announced that he had failed a test for banned stimulants for a second time and would miss the first 25 games of the 2008 season. Cameron has said he believes that a supplement he took was \\"tainted.\\" However, given the requirement of two failed drug tests before an announcement is made, this explanation is questionable. He was just the second major leaguer to be suspended for a second positive test for stimulants, following Neifi Pérez. Milwaukee Brewers Cameron playing for the Brewers in . On January 14, he signed a 1-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. On March 13, 2008, Cameron applied for a therapeutic exemption to use stimulants during the 2008 season because of his outfield collision with former teammate Carlos Beltrán. He claimed to be struggling with after-effects of the collision that ended his 2005 season. If he had applied for the exemption in 2007, he could have avoided the 25-game suspension he had to serve to begin this season for testing positive for a banned stimulant for the second time. He also told USA Today that he will see a neurologist to determine if he is suffering from post-concussion syndrome. If the exemption is granted, Cameron would be permitted to use some amphetamines that are currently banned by the Major League Baseball drug policy. In November 2008, his club option was picked up by the Brewers for the 2009 season. On May 24, 2009, Cameron hit his 250th career home run against the Minnesota Twins, becoming the 20th player in the league to hit 250 home runs and steal 250 bases. Boston Red Sox On December 16, 2009, Cameron signed a 2-year deal with the Boston Red Sox.Browne, Ian. Red Sox welcoming Cameron, Lackey , Boston Red Sox. Published December 16, 2009. Retrieved December 16, 2009. He missed most of the season with a groin injury but managed to still hit 4 home runs on the season. Cameron made 70 plate appearances for Boston, batting .143, before being designated for assignment on June 29. Florida Marlins On July 5, he was traded to the Florida Marlins for a player to be named later or cash considerations. He was released on September 13, 2011. Washington Nationals On December 19, 2011, he agreed to a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. Cameron never played in any games for the Nationals and announced his retirement on February 19, 2012. He signed a one-day contract with Seattle on April 14, 2012, to officially retire as a Mariner before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at the Mariners' home opener that same day. Personal life Together with Greg Brown and Robin Roberts, Cameron wrote a book (aimed primarily at children) titled \\"It Takes a Team: Mike Cameron\\", , where he presents his views on the importance of teamwork and describes his life. It was published in 2002 by Triumph Books. After being selected to the American League All-Star Team in 2001, Cameron used his salary bonus to purchase All-Star Game warm-up jackets for all of his Seattle Mariner teammates. He is known for routinely sitting on top of the dugout to sign autographs and talk with fans before games. He is also the founder of the Cam4Kids Foundation and was host of the First State Golf Tournament for Inner City Kids in Seattle in 2002; these in effort to raise money to provide scholarships to inner-city youth. He is actively involved with the Make-A-Wish Foundation as well as the Starlight Foundation. Cameron married his former high school classmate, JaBreka, in or around 1999. As of 2002, they had three children, sons named Dazmon and Mehki and a daughter named T'aja. Cameron's son, Daz Cameron, played baseball at Eagle's Landing Christian Academy. He was drafted 37th overall by the Houston Astros in the 2015 MLB draft. He is currently an outfielder for the Detroit Tigers' organization.

Biography Metz was born in Béziers. During the 1970s, his work had a major impact on film theory in France, Britain, Latin America and the United States. In Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema, Metz focuses on narrative structure — proposing the \\"Grand Syntagmatique\\", a system for categorizing scenes (known as \\"syntagms\\") in films. Metz applied both Sigmund Freud's psychology and Jacques Lacan's mirror theory to the cinema, proposing that the reason film is popular as an art form lies in its ability to be both an imperfect reflection of reality and a method to delve into the unconscious dream state. In his final work, Impersonal Enunciation, Metz \\"uses the concept of enunciation to articulate how films 'speak' and explore where this communication occurs, offering critical direction for theorists who struggle with the phenomena of new media.\\" Published in French in 1991, Impersonal Enunciation received little attention in the English-speaking world until it was translated in 2016, an indicator of a resurgence of interest in Metz as a scholar whose far- sighted work on multi-screen environments was well before its time. Metz died in Paris, aged 61, having taken his own life.

For his contributions he shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics along with David Lee and Robert C. Richardson. Osheroff is currently the J. G. Jackson and C. J. Wood Professor of Physics, Emeritus at Stanford University. Life and work Osheroff was born in Aberdeen, Washington. His father, William Osheroff, was the son of Jewish immigrants who left Russia. His mother, Bessie Anne (Ondov), a nurse, was the daughter of Slovak immigrants (her own father was a Lutheran minister).Biography on the Nobel Foundation website Osheroff was confirmed in the Lutheran Church but he was given the chance to choose and decided not to attend any longer. He has stated \\"In some sense it seemed that lying in church is the worst place to lie. I guess at some emotional level I accept the idea of God, but I don't know how God would manifest itself.\\"Hargittai. 2006. Candid Science VI: More Conversations with Famous Scientists, Imperial College Press, p. 726 Osheroff earned his Bachelor's degree in 1967 from Caltech, where he attended lectures by Richard Feynman and did undergraduate research for Gerry Neugebauer. Osheroff joined the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics at Cornell University as a graduate student, doing research in low-temperature physics. Together with David Lee, the head of the laboratory, and Robert C. Richardson, Osheroff used a Pomeranchuk cell to investigate the behaviour of 3He at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero. They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of 3He. Lee, Richardson and Osheroff were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996 for this discovery. Osheroff received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1973. He then worked at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey for 15 years, continuing to research low-temperature phenomena in 3He. In 1987 he moved to the Departments of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University, where he also served as department chair from 1993-96. His research is focused on phenomena that occur at extremely low temperatures. Osheroff was selected to serve on the Space Shuttle Columbia investigation panel, serving much the same role as Richard Feynman did on the Space Shuttle Challenger panel. He currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. Osheroff photographing during a trip to Big Sur with his students Osheroff is left- handed, and he often blames his slight quirks and eccentricities on it. He is also an avid photographer and introduces students at Stanford to medium-format film photography in a freshman seminar titled \\"Technical Aspects of Photography.\\" In addition, he has taught the Stanford introductory physics course on electricity and magnetism on multiple occasions, most recently in Spring 2008, as well as undergraduate labs on low temperature physics. Among his physics outreach activities, Osheroff participated in the science festivals for middle and high school students, is an official guest of honor at the International Young Physicists' Tournament 2013. He married a biochemist, Phyllis Liu-Osheroff, in 1970. Osheroff is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Its first commander, for about eighty days in 1943, was L. Ron Hubbard, who later became the founder of Scientology. After Hubbard was removed from command for conducting unauthorized gunnery practice in Mexican territorial waters, the PC-815 served as a shore patrol vessel off San Diego, California. In September 1945, the ship was lost with one of her crew after colliding with the destroyer USS Laffey. PC-815s short career led to the vessel being dubbed the \\"jinxed sub-chaser\\".\\"PC-815: The JINXED SUB-CHASER! \\", Sables, Robert P., in Sea Classics, January 2006.  Construction  PC-815 was laid down on October 10, 1942, at the Albina Engine and Machinery Works in Portland, Oregon. Her propulsion was two 1,440bhp Hooven-Owens-Rentschler R-99DA diesel engines (Serial No. 6977 and 6978), Westinghouse single reduction gear, two shafts.http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/010815.htm The PC-815 was fitted out commencing December 5, 1942, and was commissioned on April 20, 1943, with Lieutenant (j.g.) L. Ron Hubbard in command.USS PC-815 logbook, National Archives & Records Administration, College Park, MD. A few weeks later she sailed down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she arrived on May 17 to take on supplies. On May 18, the PC-815 left Astoria for Bremerton, Washington, where she was to have radar and depth charge launchers fitted. Her journey was interrupted by an air-sea rescue operation, then was resumed with a new destination — San Diego. Propulsion= The \\"jinxed sub-chaser\\" = Claims of submarine contact off Cape Lookout  In the early hours of May 19, 1943, the crew of PC-815 detected what Hubbard thought was first one, then later two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines approximately off the shore of Cape Lookout, Oregon. Both the sonar operator and Lt. Hubbard thought that the echo of an active sonar ping, combined with apparent engine noises heard through the ship's hydrophone, indicated contact with a submarine.\\"Proceeding southward just inside the steamer track an echo ranging contact was made by soundman then on duty, , Soundman third class. The Commanding Officer had the conn and immediately slowed all engines to ahead one third to better echo ranging conditions, and placed the contact dead ahead, 500 yards away.\\" and \\"Screw noises, fluttering and without pulsation, were distinct on the bearing and quite different from the pulsations of our screws.\\" Page 1 of Hubbard's report Image: Page one of Lt. Hubbard's report Over the next 68 hours, the ship expended 37 depth charges in a \\"battle\\" that also involved the U.S. Navy blimps K-39 and K-33, the United States Coast Guard patrol boats Bonham and 78302, and the subchasers USS SC-536 and USS SC-537, all summoned to act as reinforcements. PC-815 was finally ordered back to base on May 21.Hubbard, Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship, Report of, 24 May 1943. In his eighteen-page after- action report, Hubbard claimed to have \\"definitely sunk, beyond doubt\\" one submarine and critically damaged another. However, the subsequent investigation by the Commander NW Sea Frontier, Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, cast a skeptical light on Hubbard's claims. His summary memorandum to Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, stated: :It is noted that the report of PC 815 is not in accordance with \\"Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship\\" (ASW-1) which should be submitted to Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet. An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The Commanding Officers of all ships except the PC-815 state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area.\\"Battle Report – Submission of.\\", A16-3(3)/PC815, Vice Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander NW Sea Frontier, 8 June 1943; Image of document Fletcher added that \\"there is a known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped\\", absolving the responding blimps from any fault, because their method of detecting submarines relied on a Magnetic Anomaly Detector. This also implied that Lt. Hubbard and his crew were operating the ship's sonar equipment incorrectly.\\"At 0906 (see radio log) two U.S.N. anti-submarine blimps appeared, K-39 and K-33. While we held contact they investigated and announced to us that they had a magnetic contact where we were holding a sound contact.\\" Page 4 of Hubbard's report After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast.HM Admiralty, German, Italian and Japanese U-Boat Casualties during the War: Particulars of Destruction, Cmd. 6843 (June 1946); US Department of the Navy, Japanese Naval and Merchant Shipping Losses during World War II by All Causes (February 1947) Hubbard, however, never accepted that he had been mistaken about the \\"battle.\\" Both he and Tom Moulton, one of his officers, claimed that the official denials of any Japanese submarine presence off the Pacific coast had been motivated by a desire to avoid panic among the U.S. population.Streeter, Michael (2008). Behind Closed Doors, New Holland Publishers, , p. 208 Years later, Hubbard told Scientologists: :I dropped the I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine down into the mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I never thought about it again particularly except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? But the other day I was kind of tired, and my dad suddenly sprung on me the fact that my submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn't thought about this thing for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a — I don't know, about the size of the first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons — they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there — and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.Hubbard, \\"Auditing Techniques — Games Conditions\\", lecture of 1 February 1957 However, the mouth of the Columbia River is some 75 miles north of Cape Lookout, the area in which Hubbard's naval reports claimed his anti-submarine action took place. Moreover, the Japanese submarine I-76 (renamed I-176 by that time) was based in Truk and operated only in the south Pacific during the time when Hubbard was in command of PC-815. The I-176 was sunk in the Coral Sea in May 1944 and removed from the Japanese Navy List on July 10, 1944 – a year after Hubbard was relieved of command of the PC-815.http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-176.htm  Unauthorized shelling of Coronado Islands and failure to follow orders  In June 1943, the PC-815 traveled to San Diego, which was to become her home port. She arrived there on June 2, and at the end of June was ordered to sea to join an anti-submarine training exercise. The exercise, held on June 28, ended early. Hubbard took the opportunity to order an impromptu gunnery exercise while anchored just off the Mexican territory of South Coronado Island, to the south-west of San Diego. The Mexican government sent an official protest to the U.S. Government, as no gunnery operations had been scheduled. Another view of on trials On June 30 a Board of Investigation was convened concerning PC-815. It concluded that Hubbard had disregarded orders, both by conducting gunnery practice and by anchoring in Mexican territorial waters without proper authority. His orders stated that the PC-815 was supposed to return after completing that day's training. Hubbard argued that his crew was inexperienced, it was foggy, and he was tired so he did not return to port as ordered. But a month earlier in his after action report concerning the fiasco off Cape Lookout, he had described the same men as \\"experienced\\" and \\"highly skilled\\". Vice Admiral Fletcher, who both chaired the board and read the prior after action report, rated Hubbard \\"below average\\" and noted: \\"Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised\\". Hubbard was relieved of command effective July 7, 1943.Miller, p. 106  Collision with USS Laffey  After Hubbard was replaced, PC-815 remained in San Diego as a shore patrol vessel, but appears to have been mostly inactive. According to her Movement Card she took part in the occasional offshore patrol, participated in training exercises, and escorted submarines in and out of the harbor. She was restored to active duty on September 2, 1945, but at 6:47 a.m. on September 11, the ship collided with the destroyer in dense fog off San Diego. The collision started a fire on board PC-815, which sank within five minutes. One man from PC-815 was recorded as missing, presumed drowned. The Laffey suffered significant damage, with the fire from PC-815 spreading into one of the destroyer's compartments. Navy divers demolished the wreck in early November 1945 due to the navigation hazard that it posed to a busy shipping channel. It is reported to be lying at in of water and is said to be diveable.

He is perhaps best known for the 1968 song \\"Ermutigung\\" and his expatriation from East Germany in 1976. Early life Biermann was born in Hamburg, Germany. His mother, Emma (née Dietrich), was a Communist Party activist, and his father, Dagobert Biermann, worked on the Hamburg docks. Biermann's father, a Jewish member of the German Resistance, was sentenced to six years in prison for sabotaging Nazi ships. In 1942, the Nazis decided to \\"eliminate\\" their Jewish political prisoners and Biermann's father was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was murdered on 22 February 1943.Gedenkbuch Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933–1945.

Retrieved 26 March 2010 Biermann was one of the few children of workers who attended the Heinrich- Hertz-Gymnasium (high school) in Hamburg. After the Second World War, he became a member of the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend, FDJ) and in 1950, he represented the Federal Republic of Germany at the FDJ's first national meeting. East Germany Upon finishing school at the age of 17, Biermann emigrated from West to East Germany where he believed he could live out his Communist ideals. He lived at a boarding school near Schwerin until 1955, and then began studying political economics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. From 1957 to 1959, he was an assistant director at the Berliner Ensemble. At university he changed courses to study philosophy and mathematics under until 1963, when he completed his thesis. Despite his successful defense of his thesis, he did not receive his diploma until 2008 when he was also awarded an honorary doctorate degree. In 1960, Biermann met composer Hanns Eisler, who adopted the young artist as a protégé. Biermann began writing poetry and songs. Eisler used his influence with the East German cultural elite to promote the songwriter's career, but his death in 1962 deprived Biermann of his mentor and protector. In 1961, Biermann formed the Berliner Arbeiter-Theater (\\"Berlin Workers' Theater\\"), which was closed in 1963 before the production of Biermann's show Berliner Brautgang, which documented the building of the Berlin wall. The play was officially banned and Biermann was forbidden to perform for six months. Although a committed communist, Biermann's nonconformist views soon alarmed the East German establishment. In 1963, he was refused membership in the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), although no reason was given at the time for his rejection. After the Wende, documents available from Biermann's file at the Stasi Records Agency revealed that the reviewers were under the impression that he was a regular user of stimulants, leading to the rejection of his application. In 1964, Biermann performed for the first time in West Germany. A performance in April 1965 in Frankfurt am Main on Wolfgang Neuss' cabaret program was recorded and released as an LP titled Wolf Biermann (Ost) zu Gast bei Wolfgang Neuss (West). Later that year, Biermann published a book of poetry, Die Drahtharfe, through the West German publisher Klaus Wagenbach. In December 1965, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany denounced him as a 'class traitor' and placed him onto the performance and publication blacklist. At this time, the Stasi developed a 20-point plan to \\"degrade\\" or discredit his person.Dirk von Nayhauss: . Cicero, November 2006. While blacklisted, Biermann continued to write and compose, culminating in his 1968 album Chausseestraße 131, recorded on equipment smuggled from the west in his apartment at Chausseestraße 131 in Mitte, the central borough of Berlin. To break this isolation, artists like Joan Baez and many others visited him at his home during the World Festival of Youth and Students in 1973. Karsten Voigt, chairman of the West German Socialdemocratic Youth (Jusos) protested against the suppression of the freedom of opinion and information by the state security. Deprivation of citizenship Wolf Biermann 1977 in Hamburg In 1977, while Biermann was on an officially sanctioned tour of West Germany, the GDR government stripped him of his citizenship. As later revealed, the SED Politbüro had made this decision in 1976 and hence way before the first concert in Cologne, which was then used as a justification. Biermann's exile provoked protests by leading East German intellectuals, including actor Armin Mueller-Stahl and novelist Christa Wolf. In 1977, he was joined in West Germany by his wife at the time, actress Eva-Maria Hagen and her daughter Catharina (Nina Hagen). Return to the west Now living in the West, Biermann continued his musical career, criticizing East Germany's Stalinist policies. He was able to perform publicly again in East Germany on 1 and 2 December 1989 during the Wende that eventually toppled the Communist government. In 1998, he received the German national prize. He supported the 1999 NATO Kosovo War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Article in \\"Der Spiegel\\": Brachiale Friedensliebe In the Arab–Israeli conflict he supports Israel and is critical of the fact, as he sees it, that, under the influence of antisemitic views, a majority of Germans lack both understanding and empathy for the Israeli side. He lives in Hamburg and in France. He is the father of ten children, three of them with his wife Pamela Biermann.

Other members included Flipper (Silas Howard), Slade Bellum, Jen Schwartz, Mama T, Kat Buell, and Tantrum.  Concerts  In concert, lead singer Breedlove frequently performed shirtless, wearing a strap-on dildo, and encouraged audience members to interact with it. Their songs often deal with subjects such as S/M, nudity, fellatio, and transgender issues, and the band was the subject of controversy because of this. An article from the Chicago Tribune praised their Fireside Bowl show in 1998 stating \\"If the members of Tribe 8 play punk rock like they own it, it's only because they do.\\" Tribe 8 toured throughout the United States, playing at venues such as DUMBA and 924 Gilman Street; they also played in Europe and Canada, and released a number of recordings on independent record labels. In 1996, the band made its screen debut in A Gun For Jennifer, directed by Todd Morris. The band performs live in the documentary film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane, released in 1997. Members of the band are also interviewed, speaking about a range of topics including the development of the queercore music scene. In 2003 the film Rise Above: A Tribe 8 Documentary, by director Tracy Flannigan, was released, documenting not only performances by the band but the motivations and reasons behind the band and the part it plays in their lives.

Most vehicles manufactured from the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic air intake systems that regulate the temperature of the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods, modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic air intake system and the factory-installed air intake draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold air intake systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold air intake is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air. Design features Some strategies used in designing aftermarket cold air intakes are: *Reworking parts of the intake that create turbulence to reduce air resistance. *Providing a more direct route to the air intake by eliminating muffling devices. *Shortening the length of the intake. *Placing the intake duct to use the ram-air effect to give positive pressure at speed. Construction Intake systems come in many different styles and can be constructed from plastic, metal, rubber (silicone) or composite materials (fiberglass, carbon fiber or Kevlar). The most efficient intake systems utilize an airbox which is sized to complement the engine and will extend the powerband of the engine. The intake snorkel (opening for the intake air to enter the system) must be large enough to ensure sufficient air is available to the engine under all conditions from idle to full throttle. The most basic cold air intake consists of a long metal or plastic tube leading to a conical air filter. Power may be lost at certain engine speeds and gained at others. Because of the reduced covering, intake noise is usually increased. Some intakes use heat shields to isolate the air filter from the rest of the engine compartment, providing cooler air from the front or side of the engine bay. This can make a big difference to intake temperatures, especially when the car is moving slowly. Some systems, called \\"fender mount,\\" move the filter into the fender wall instead. This system draws air up through the fender wall which provides even more isolation and still cooler air. Cold air intake efficiency The following items can have an affect on CAI efficiency: *Output location of the CAI unit. *Obstruction by side and front parts of the vehicle (e.g., headlights). *Length and geometry of intake air tube. The shortest length tube with a smooth interior has a positive effect on increasing airflow.

Sandy Hawley decided to be a jockey when he was a 17-year-old boy, hotwalking, grooming and excise horses at a Woodbine racetrack in Toronto Ontario. Two years later, when he was 19 years old, he rode his first race at Woodbine race track as a Jockey. Then he became a regular rider at racetracks in Ontario and then rode at racetracks on the East Coast of the United States. Hawley became the first jockey to ever lead the Canadian standings in a full season as an apprentice. In 1969, a time when there were no Sovereign or Eclipse Awards for jockeys, Hawley rode 230 winners, the most that year of any apprentice jockey in North America. He went on to race in the United States where he led all jockeys in victories for the years 1970, 1972, 1973 and 1976. In the 1973 season, he became the first jockey to ever win 500 races in one year, breaking Bill Shoemaker's record. Sandy Hawley has career earnings of over $88.6 million and was one of the most successful jockeys of his generation. Racing in California, Hawley was named the winner of Santa Anita Park's prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. Given to a North American rider who demonstrates the highest of standards of personal and professional conduct both on and off the racetrack, Hawley has had the lifelong reputation of being a gentleman and a man of honor. In 1976 he won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in the United States after he broke thoroughbred racing's all-time money-winning record for a single year. As a boy growing up in Canada, Hawley developed a love for the game of ice hockey and while riding in California, he got an ice-level job as a penalty timekeeper for the home games of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, giving himself a great view of his favorite game. He won the Lou Marsh Trophy in 1973 and 1976 as Canada’s top athlete and was named a Member of the Order of Canada, his country’s highest individual civilian honor for outstanding accomplishments by a citizen. In addition to winning many major Stakes races in the United States, four times he won Canada's most prestigious thoroughbred horse race, the Queen's Plate. Twice, Hawley won seven races in a single day at Toronto’s Woodbine Racetrack and at Santa Anita Park had six wins in a single day on two occasions. Hawley and Avelino Gomez each won the Coronation Futurity Stakes a record five times. Gomez won the race four years running between 1964 and 1967. Hawley won the race five out of six years between 1971 and 1976, his streak broken by Gomez's fifth win in 1972. Hawley's best result in the Kentucky Derby was two third-place finishes one of which was with Golden Act in 1979 aboard whom he finished second in both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. Overall, Sandy Hawley's career as a jockey spanned 31 years from 1968 to his retirement on July 1, 1998. He had 31,455 mounts, garnering 6,449 wins and won 18 riding titles at Woodbine Racetrack. Diagnosed with skin cancer in 1987, doctors only gave him a few months to live but he fought to overcome the disease with experimental drugs, a careful high-fiber diet, and his sheer determination. Sandy Hawley was voted the 1986 Avelino Gomez Memorial Award and that same year was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the United States National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1992 and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. The Sandy Hawley Award is presented every year by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame to an individual who best exemplifies a dedication to the community. He currently is a Public Relations Ambassador for Woodbine Entertainment Group, and resides in Toronto, Ontario with his wife Kaoru. He has worked as an analyst for The Score and CKXT-TV's horse racing coverage.https://www.thestar.com/article/424992 Living Legends Race On October 18, 2008 at Santa Anita Park, Sandy Hawley and seven other U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockeys came out of retirement for the Living Legends Race that officially counted in their career totals and was specially approved for legalized parimutuel wagering.

It is the categorical construction dual to the equalizer.  Definition  A coequalizer is a colimit of the diagram consisting of two objects X and Y and two parallel morphisms f, g : X → Y. More explicitly, a coequalizer can be defined as an object Q together with a morphism q : Y → Q such that q ∘ f = q ∘ g. Moreover, the pair (Q, q) must be universal in the sense that given any other such pair (Q′, q′) there exists a unique morphism u : Q → Q′ such that u ∘ q = q′. This information can be captured by the following commutative diagram: Image:Coequalizer-01.png As with all universal constructions, a coequalizer, if it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism (this is why, by abuse of language, one sometimes speaks of \\"the\\" coequalizer of two parallel arrows). It can be shown that a coequalizer q is an epimorphism in any category.  Examples  *In the category of sets, the coequalizer of two functions f, g : X → Y is the quotient of Y by the smallest equivalence relation \\\\sim such that for every x\\\\in X, we have f(x)\\\\sim g(x). In particular, if R is an equivalence relation on a set Y, and r1, r2 are the natural projections (R ⊂ Y × Y) → Y then the coequalizer of r1 and r2 is the quotient set Y/R. (See also: quotient by an equivalence relation.) *The coequalizer in the category of groups is very similar. Here if f, g : X → Y are group homomorphisms, their coequalizer is the quotient of Y by the normal closure of the set :S={f(x)g(x)^{-1}\\\\mid x\\\\in X} *For abelian groups the coequalizer is particularly simple. It is just the factor group Y / im(f – g). (This is the cokernel of the morphism f – g; see the next section). *In the category of topological spaces, the circle object S^1 can be viewed as the coequalizer of the two inclusion maps from the standard 0-simplex to the standard 1-simplex. *Coequalisers can be large: There are exactly two functors from the category 1 having one object and one identity arrow, to the category 2 with two objects and one non-identity arrow going between them. The coequaliser of these two functors is the monoid of natural numbers under addition, considered as a one-object category. In particular, this shows that while every coequalising arrow is epic, it is not necessarily surjective.  Properties  *Every coequalizer is an epimorphism. *In a topos, every epimorphism is the coequalizer of its kernel pair.  Special cases  In categories with zero morphisms, one can define a cokernel of a morphism f as the coequalizer of f and the parallel zero morphism. In preadditive categories it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms (the hom- sets actually form abelian groups). In such categories, one can define the coequalizer of two morphisms f and g as the cokernel of their difference: :coeq(f, g) = coker(g – f). A stronger notion is that of an absolute coequalizer, this is a coequalizer that is preserved under all functors. Formally, an absolute coequalizer of a pair of parallel arrows f, g : X → Y in a category C is a coequalizer as defined above, but with the added property that given any functor F: C → D, F(Q) together with F(q) is the coequalizer of F(f) and F(g) in the category D. Split coequalizers are examples of absolute coequalizers.

The label took its name from a popular luncheonette frequented by musicians in Havana, Cuba that Masucci frequented when he worked for a public relations firm there during the pre-Castro era. Fania is known for its promotion of Salsa music. History Frustrated by the meager amount of money he was receiving for his recordings, Pacheco started Fania in 1964 and sold records to music stores out of the trunk of his car. To help finance the business, he partnered with Brooklyn-born lawyer and promoter Jerry Masucci, and in 1964 they founded the Fania label to produce, promote and market the music of Latinos in New York. The label started out as a small venture, but gained popularity after the success of its first official record, Pacheco's \\"Cañonazo\\", leading to the expansion of its talent base. Among Fania's signature stars are: Willie Colon, Celia Cruz, Larry Harlow, Ray Barretto, Ralfi Pagan, Luis \\"Perico\\" Ortiz, Bobby Valentín, Rubén Blades, Héctor Lavoe, Cheo Feliciano, Adalberto Santiago, Ismael Miranda and many others. In 1968, Pacheco created a supergroup known as the Fania All-Stars that brought together the elite of Salsa musicians and singers for joint performances and recording. The Fania All-Stars were Fania's best selling band, outlasting the label itself. They made their debut at the Red Garter club located in New York's Greenwich Village, but it was their 1971 performance at the Cheetah, a club in Midtown Manhattan, which became legendary. Larry Harlow was chosen by Jerry Masucci to produce the band's records while Pacheco acted as director on stage. The Fania All-Stars were filmed for the documentary Our Latin Thing released a year later. In 1973, Fania All-Stars performed at Yankee Stadium to a stadium with 45,000 attendees. Pacheco directed the band to an excited crowd who cheered on each Fania All-Star member. As of 2007 all that is left is \\"Larry Harlow and the Latin Legends of Fania\\". In 2003, the 1975 Fania release Live at Yankee Stadium was included in the second set of 50 recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry. Masucci, who’d bought out Pacheco’s share of the company around 1967, became the sole owner of Fania Records and the numerous other labels and umbrella labels in South America that he acquired and created. Masucci died in 1997, and for the next eight years Fania and all of its assets were tied up in probate court while various parties battled over its ownership. In September 2005, Fania's assets were sold to Miami-based label Emusica, and by early 2006, the new owners began to reissue material from Fania's backlog catalog (some of which has never appeared on CD before) with enhanced sound and liner notes.http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1407697/emusica-acquires- fania-assets In an effort to create additional content, Código Records, a subsidiary of the Emusica label, allowed DJs and producers to remix original material. As of July 27, 2018, Fania is owned by Concord, which acquired the label from Codigo Entertainment. Fania's catalogue included 19,000 master recordings and 8,000 compositions.https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/concord-acquires- independent-latin-music-company-fania ReferencesExternal links * – official site * * Fania Records at SoundCloud Category:American record labels Category:Record labels established in 1964 Category:Record labels disestablished in 2005 Category:Latin American music record labels ","title":"Fania Records"},{"id":"431942","text":"For the college in Vermont, see Champlain College. Champlain Regional College, is an English-language Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEP) with campuses located in three distinct administrative regions of Quebec: Lennoxville, Saint-Lambert, and Quebec City. The College offers post-secondary pre-university and technical DEC diploma programs as well as vocational AEC certificate programs. History The college was founded in 1971 and named in honour of Samuel de Champlain, the first governor of New France. It traces its origins to the merger of several educational institutions which became public in 1967 with the creation of Quebec's CEGEPs and the collegiate system. Organization and administration Champlain Regional College (CRC) is composed of an Administrative Office located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and three campuses located in different regions of the province: Champlain College Lennoxville,http://www.crc-lennox.qc.ca/contact-us/ in the Estrie; Champlain College Saint-Lambert,http://www.champlainonline.com/champlainweb/contact-us/ in the Montérégie; and Champlain College St. Lawrence, in the Capitale- Nationale area. Despite having \\"Regional\\" in its name, CRC is not a regional college as defined by Quebec's General and Vocational Colleges Act.http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file;=//C_29/C29_A.htm The only regional college under the Act is the Cégep régional de Lanaudière, which has a much more decentralized structure.http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=5&file;=1997C87A.PDF This more decentralized structure has been proposed to the Board of Governors by administrators as a possible new organizational model for the College, but it was rejected as unworkable for CRC, in part due to the distances between the campuses.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Minutes- Meetingof2015-09-23(1).pdf The Director General and Director of Studies are based at the Sherbrooke Administrative offices along with the Director of Financial Services, the Director of Material Resources, Director of Human Resources and Secretary General, Coordinator of Information Technology, and their respective staff teams. All teaching and direct services to students are offered on the three campuses only. The College is overseen by a Board of Governors with representation divided over the regions, following the usual structurehttp://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file;=//C_29/C29_A.htm except that CRC has one more faculty member on the Board than other public colleges, to ensure faculty representation from each campus and to account for the campuses' isolation from each other.http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=5&file;=1996C99A.PDF Many members of the college community complain that their regions are underrepresented on the board, because its membership is divided between the four locations,https://montrealgazette.com/business/cnw/release.html?rkey=20160404C1494&filter;=5611 giving the Estrie region approximately half of the Board members.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/20160831-BG- Members-2016-2017-Web-version.pdf The 16-member Commission of Studies is also composed of Sherbrooke administrators plus faculty, staff and students from each teaching location.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp- content/themes/champlain/pdf/bylaw/bylaw2.pdf Each campus is overseen by a Campus Director under the authority of the Director General. Each campus has administrators in charge of local management of human resources, finances, buildings and grounds, information technology, student services, registrar's office, and continuing education, all under the Campus Director's authority but also answerable to Administrators in Sherbrooke. Occasional issues arise due to this doubling of administrative services between Sherbrooke and the Campuses. Campuses CRC has three teaching locations: Champlain College Saint-Lambert The St. Lambert campus is located 148 kilometres from the College's Head Office, on the South Shore of Montreal Island in the Montérégie town of Saint-Lambert. It offers pre-university and technical DEC programs, as well as AEC programs and an extensive range of other continuing education services (including Recognition of Acquired Competencies or RAC) both on and off campus. Champlain College Lennoxville The Lennoxville campus is located only seven kilometres from head office in the Estrie region, in the Sherbrooke borough of Lennoxville, where it shares grounds and facilities with Bishop's University. It offers pre-university and technical DEC programs on its main campus as well as AEC programs and other continuing education services at a separate location. Champlain College St. Lawrence The St. Lawrence campus is located 227 kilometres from the Sherbrooke office in Capitale-Nationale region, in the Québec City borough of Ste-Foy. Originally an independent Classical College affiliated with Université Laval, this campus offers primarily pre-university DEC programs, one technical DEC program, and one AEC program. It is the only fully-English Cégep in Eastern Québec. The College administrative offices are located apart from the teaching locations in the city of Sherbrooke. The regional and cultural differences between the campuses have led to a debate over the value of the multi-regional structure of the college. Many members of the college community argue this structure limits campuses' ability to respond as well as they might to their students' and local communities' needs, while others argue that regional diversity creates opportunities for \\"synergy\\" across multiple regions of Quebec, even though there is little interaction between the campuses due to the vast distances between them. Some contact is facilitated by participation in college-wide bodies such as the Commission of Studies. Distinct culture and traditions In part due to regional disparity and distances, each campus has, over time, developed its own distinct culture and traditions.Évaluation institutionelle, Champlain Regional College. Québec: Commission d'évaluation de l'enseignement collégial, 2004. pp 6-7) Contributing to this is also the fact that union contracts apply to the individual campuses rather than to the college as a whole, meaning that each location has its own separate teaching, professional and support staff unions, with little chance for job mobility between locations.Convention collective, Fédération nationale des enseignantes et enseignants du Québec (FNEEQ-CSN), Annexe I-5http://cpn.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/documents/CPNC/conv_coll_2015-2020/FPPC- CSQ_CC2015-2020_SANS_MODIFICATIONS_21Juin2016.pdf Article 2-1.02 Meetings of college-wide bodies are often held in rented space in the city of Drummondville, which is more or less equidistant from each of the three campuses and the Sherbrooke administrative offices. Communication between the campuses is rare below the management level. Controversy Over the Regional Structure Since early 2014, a movement has re-emerged among the faculty and staff of Champlain College, in favour of creating three colleges from the campuses and eliminating the Sherbrooke administration office, which they consider distant from educational realities on the campuses and detrimental to the campuses' success. This movement first appeared in the 1990s. The more recent version began at the St-Lawrence Campus, which had been an independent institution prior to the formation of CRC. There, all three unions (faculty, support staff and professionals) have been working together since early in 2014 to make their campus an independent college.http://www.cbc.ca/player/AudioMobile/Breakaway/ID/2522563808/ In separate General Assemblies in the Fall of 2014, the faculty union of the St- Lambert Campus took a position in favour of St-Lawrence independence, and subsequently voted to support independence for St-Lambert. In December 2014, the Fédération Nationale des Enseignantes et Enseignants du Québec (Quebec Teachers' Federation, or FNEEQ) passed a unanimous motion at its Federal Council supporting the move for campus independence. Support Staff at Champlain St-Lambert also voted to seek independence for their campus in March, 2015. This was followed in March, 2016 by unanimous support from the provincial Fédération des Employées et Employés du Secteur Publique (FEESP: Public Sector Employees Federation), Cégep sector. In February 2015, a campaign to promote the St-Lawrence Campus' independence was officially launchedhttp://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1490277/independence-for-the- champlain-st-lawrence-college with support from FNEEQ, a supporting web page, and student-created video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPpCrqOjNrI Teachers from St-Lambert campus traveled to Quebec City to attend the launch, stating their hope that this would also lead to independence for their own campus.http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1489739/-r-e-p-e-a-t-notification-to- the-media-st-lawrence-must-become-an-independent-cegep-un-cegep-a-part- entierehttp://globalnews.ca/news/1879161/frustrations-brew-over-possible- champlain-regional-college- separtionhttp://globalnews.ca/video/1875234/champlain-college-separation A formal petition was sponsored at the Québec National Assembly by the Official Opposition Critic for Higher Education, Véronique Hivon (Parti- Québécois).https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre- opinion/petition/Petition-5135/index.html The St-Lambert staff and faculty took a table and presented a petition during the \\"St-Lambert Days\\" street festival that summer. In April, the teachers' union at the Lennoxville campus passed a General Assembly motion supporting their colleagues' push for independence at the other two campuses. College administrators officially oppose this movement,http://www.cbc.ca/player/AudioMobile/Breakaway/ID/2524121035/ and say they consider it a matter of \\"deep concern\\".http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1490983/champlain-is-deeply- concerned-by-the-call-for-independence-by-the-unions-at-our-st-lawrence-campus Nevertheless, after the Director of Studies resigned in November, 2014 to take a position at another college, campus autonomy arose several times at the Board of Governors due to the observed difficulty of fulfilling the role of Director of Studies in a multi-regional structure. During most of the following year, the Board of Governors unsuccessfully explored a variety of ideas for improving the structure of the academic leadership of the College while maintaining the institutional structure, and hired an outside consultant to specifically examine the Director of Studies role.http://admin.crc- sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Min.-BG-150128.pdf The consultant's report stated that under the current structure \\"[there] is no value‐added brought by the Director of Studies... . This person is in charge of all the important dossiers and yet, does not control anything.\\"http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp- content/uploads/Binder-Final-Report-DS-Study-150320.pdf. page 19. The consultant recommended that pedagogical leadership should become much more decentralized, with a separate Director of Studies for each campus,http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Binder-Final-Report-DS- Study-150320.pdf. page 32 because this would provide leadership that is currently lacking according to the report, create less confusion, and make the College more responsive to students' needs.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp- content/uploads/Binder-Final-Report-DS-Study-150320.pdf. pages 15-19 Despite this, in a series of votes over several subsequent meetings, the Board opted instead to maintain the status quo. At its June meeting in 2015, the Board voted 10 to 4 http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp- content/uploads/Minutes_Meeting_of_2015-06-12.pdf to reaffirm the current multi-regional structure. Notwithstanding this, at the following Board meeting, the Director General and Acting Director of Studies moved and seconded a resolution calling for the Board to request a change to the structural model used by the Cégep Régional de Lanaudière,http://admin.crc- sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Minutes-Meetingof2015-09-23.pdf which is much more decentralized. They then both spoke and voted against their own motion, which was defeated, 7 to 4.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp- content/uploads/Minutes-Meetingof2015-09-23(1).pdf The Board then suspended its review of the Director of Studies position and proceeded to work towards finding candidates for the vacant position while retaining the status quo structure.http://admin.crc-sher.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Minutes- Meetingof2015-10-23.pdf The Campus independence movement continues to assert that the best change would be the elimination of the Central Administration in favour of creating three separate colleges, one per region. In April, 2016, the majority of College employees at St-Lambert and St-Lawrence campuses voted to cease participating at the Board of Governors until the College's institutional problems were resolved.https://edmontonjournal.com/business/cnw/release.html?rkey=20160404C1494&filter;=5599&__lsa=68ae- ff08 In November 2016, several hundred people attended a rally supporting independence for the campuses,http://www.canada.com/business/cnw/release.html?rkey=20161129C2461&filter;=5615 while in December 2016 the college reiterated its support for the current structure.http://lescegeps.com/gestion/gestion_dun_college/a_wind_of_change_at_champlain_regional_college The College returned to this issue in Spring, 2017, when the Sherbrooke office began further centralizing control of campus affairs by having certain managers report directly to Sherbrooke rather than to the local campus authorities. This began at the Saint-Lawrence campus, where it was extremely controversial. The proposal was then presented to the Board of Governors for its approbation, and after an in-camera meeting in late June 2017, at which representatives of each employee group were invited to speak to the question, the College announced in a letter to all employees that it was withdrawing this centralization plan.

The The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has always been open to Black Mormons joining through baptism, but from the mid-1800s until 1978, the LDS Church prevented most men of black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay priesthood, barred black men and women from participating in the ordinances of its temples and opposed interracial marriage. Since black men of African descent could not receive the priesthood, they were excluded from holding leadership roles and performing these rituals. Temple ordinances such as the endowment and marriage sealings are necessary for exaltation. The church's first presidents, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, reasoned that black skin was the result of the Curse of Cain or the Curse of Ham. As early as 1908, a church publication suggested that blacks could not receive the priesthood because their spirits were less valiant in the pre-existence. Before the civil rights movement, the LDS Church's stance went largely unnoticed and unchallenged for around a century. Many leaders, including Ezra Taft Benson were vocally opposed to the civil rights movement. In 1978, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, led by church president Spencer W. Kimball, declared they had received a revelation that the time had come to end these restrictions. Kimball publicly refuted earlier justifications for the restrictions. Later church leaders have called the explanation a folk belief. The LDS Church's stance towards slavery alternated several times in its history, from one of neutrality, to moderate abolition, to pro-slavery. Smith at times advocated both for and against slavery. Young was instrumental in officially legalizing slavery in the Utah Territory, teaching that the doctrine of slavery was connected to the Curse of Cain. Slavery in Utah ended in 1862 when Congress abolished it. After the 1978 revelation, the LDS Church began actively proselyting and reaching out to black communities, which they had avoided prior, and black membership greatly increased. Six temples are planned or built in Africa outside of South Africa. In 2008, there were about 1 million black members worldwide. The priesthoods of most other Mormon denominations, such as the Community of Christ, Bickertonite, and Strangite, have always been open to persons of all races. Temple and priesthood restriction From 1849 to 1978, the church prohibited anyone with real or suspected black ancestry from taking part in live ordinances in LDS temples, serving in any significant church callings, serving missions, attending priesthood meetings, being ordained to any priesthood office, speaking at firesides, or receiving a lineage in their patriarchal blessing. In 1978, the church's First Presidency declared in a statement known as \\"Official Declaration 2\\" that the temple and priesthood ban had been lifted by the Lord. Before 1849, a few black men had been ordained to the priesthood under Joseph Smith. Non-black spouses of black people were also prohibited from entering the temple. Over time, the ban was relaxed so that black people could attend priesthood meetings and people with a \\"questionable lineage\\" were given the priesthood, such as Fijians, Indigenous Australians, Egyptians, as well as Brazilians and South Africans with an unknown heritage who did not appear to have any black heritage. During this time, the church taught that the ban came from God and officially gave several race-based explanations for the ban, including a curse on Cain and his descendants, Ham's marriage to Egyptus, a curse on the descendants of Canaan, and that black people were less valiant in their pre-mortal life. They used LDS scriptures to justify their explanations, including the Book of Abraham which teaches that the descendants of Canaan were black and Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was a descendant of Canaan. In 1978, the church issued a declaration that the Lord had revealed that the day had come in which all worthy males could receive the priesthood. This was later adopted as scripture.Official Declaration 2. They also taught that the ancient curse was lifted and that the Quorum of the Twelve heard the voice of the Lord. Today, none of these explanations are accepted as official doctrine, and the church has taken an anti-racism stance.Ballard, President M. Russell, et al. \\"Race and the Priesthood.\\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the- priesthood?lang=eng. History Jane Manning was an early African American member who was a servant\\"Saints, Slaves, and Blacks\\" by Bringhurst. Table 8 on p.223 in Joseph Smith's household in Nauvoo and later followed Brigham Young to Utah Territory. She petitioned church leadership to allow her to obtain the endowment, but was repeatedly denied because of the ban. During the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, two black men held the priesthood and became priests: Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis. Elijah Abel received both the priesthood office of elder and the office of seventy, evidently in the presence of Joseph Smith himself. After Smith's death in 1844, Brigham Young became president of the main body of the church and led the Mormon pioneers to what would become the Utah Territory. Like many Americans at the time, Young, who was also the territorial governor, promoted discriminatory views about black people. On January 16, 1852, Young made a pronouncement to the Utah Territorial Legislature, stating that \\"any man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] ... in him [could not] hold the priesthood.\\" At the same time, however, Young also said that at some point in the future, black members of the church would \\"have [all] the priviledge and more\\" that was enjoyed by other members of the church. Brigham Young, Speeches Before the Utah Territorial Legislature, Jan. 23 and Feb. 5, 1852, George D. Watt Papers, Church History Library, Salt Lake City, transcribed from Pitman shorthand by LaJean Purcell Carruth; “To the Saints,” Deseret News, April 3, 1852, 42. Some scholars have suggested that the actions of William McCary, a half-black man who also claimed to be a prophet and the successor to Joseph Smith, led to Young's decision to ban blacks from receiving the priesthood. Harris, Matthew L.; Bringhurst, Newell G. (2015). The Mormon Church and Blacks. Chicago: University of Illinois Press. . McCary went as far as once claiming to be Adam from the Bible, and was excommunicated from the church for apostasy.Bush, Lester E.; Mauss, Armand L. (1984). Neither White nor Black. Midvale, Utah: Signature Books. . As recorded in the Journal of Discourses, Young taught that black people's position as \\"servant of servants\\" was a law under heaven and it was not the church's place to change God's law. Under the racial restrictions that lasted from Young's presidency until 1978, persons with any black African ancestry could not receive church priesthood or any temple ordinances including the endowment and eternal marriage or participate in any proxy ordinances for the dead. An important exception to this temple ban was that (except for a complete temple ban period from the mid-1960s until the early 70s under McKay) black members had been allowed a limited use recommend to act as proxies in baptisms for the dead.In her autobiography, Jane Elizabeth Manning James says she \\"had the privilege of going into the temple and being baptized for some of my dead.\\" http://www.blacklds.org/manning Life History of Jane Elizabeth Manning James as transcribed by Elizabeth J.D. Round The priesthood restriction was particularly limiting, because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood and most male members over the age of 12 have received the priesthood. Holders of the priesthood officiate at church meetings, perform blessings of healing, and manage church affairs. Excluding black people from the priesthood meant that men could not hold any significant church leadership roles or participate in many important events such as performing a baptism, blessing the sick, or giving a baby blessing. Between 1844 and 1977, most black people were not permitted to participate in ordinances performed in the LDS Church temples, such as the endowment ritual, celestial marriages, and family sealings. These ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, so this meant that they could not enjoy the full privileges enjoyed by other Latter-day Saints during the restriction. Celestial marriage For Latter-day Saints, a celestial marriage is not required to get into the celestial kingdom, but is required to obtain a fullness of glory or exaltation within the celestial kingdom. The righteous who do not have a celestial marriage would still live eternally with God, but they would be \\"appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants.\\" As black people were banned from entering celestial marriage prior to 1978, some interpreted this to mean that they would be treated as unmarried whites, being confined to only ever live in God's presence as a ministering servant. Apostles George F. RichardsGeorge F. Richards, Conference Report, April 1939, p. 58. and Mark E. Petersen taught that blacks could not achieve exaltation because of their priesthood and temple restrictions.Those teachings were based on the doctrines, policies, and practices of the church as they were understood at that time. Several leaders, including Joseph Smith,In regards to black people, Joseph Smith taught that \\"They have souls, and are subjects of salvation.\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, selected by Joseph Fielding Smith, (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1976), 269. Brigham Young,Brigham Young said \\"when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the Holy Priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we are now entitled to.\\" quoted by the First Presidency, August 17, 1949. Wilford Woodruff,Wilford Woodruff said \\"The day will come when all that race will be redeemed and possess all the blessings which we now have\\" quoted by the First Presidency on August 17, 1949 George Albert Smith,George Albert Smith reiterated what was said by both Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff in a statement by the First Presidency on August 17, 1949 David O. McKay,David O. McKay taught \\"Sometime in God's eternal plan, the Negro will be given the right to hold the priesthood. In the meantime, those of that race who receive the testimony of the Restored Gospel may have their family ties protected and other blessings made secure, for in the justice of the Lord they will possess all the blessings to which they are entitled in the eternal plan of Salvation and Exaltation.\\"(Mormonism and the Negro, pp. 23) Joseph Fielding Smith,In reference to black people, Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith taught: \\"Every soul coming into this world came here with the promise that through obedience he would receive the blessings of salvation. No person was foreordained or appointed to sin or to perform a mission of evil. No person is ever predestined to salvation or damnation. Every person has free agency.\\" (Joseph Fielding Smith Jr., Doctrines of Salvation, Vol.1, p. 61) and Harold B. LeeIn 1972, Harold B. Lee said, \\"It's only a matter of time before the black achieves full status in the Church. We must believe in the justice of God. The black will achieve full status, we're just waiting for that time.\\" (Kimball, Lengthen Your Stride, working draft chapter 20, page 22; citing Goates, Harold B. Lee, 506, quoting UPI interview published November 16, 1972.) taught that black people would eventually be able to receive a fullness of glory in the celestial kingdom. In 1973 church spokesperson Wendell Ashton stated that Mormon prophets have stated that the time will come when black Mormon men can receive the priesthood. Patriarchal blessing In the LDS Church, a patriarch gives patriarchal blessings to members to help them know their strengths and weaknesses and what to expect in their future life. The blessings also tell members which tribe of Israel they are descended from. Members who are not literally descended from the tribes are adopted into a tribe, usually Ephraim. In the early 19th and 20th centuries, members were more likely to believe they were literally descended from a certain tribe. The LDS Church keeps copies of all patriarchal blessings. In Elijah Abel's 1836 patriarchal blessing, no lineage was declared, and he was promised that in the afterlife he would be equal to his fellow members, and his \\"soul be white in eternity\\". Jane Manning James's blessing in 1844 gave the lineage of Ham. Later, it became church policy to declare no lineage for black members. In 1934, patriarch James H. Wallis wrote in his journal that he had always known that black people could not receive a patriarchal blessing because of the priesthood ban, but that they could receive a blessing without a lineage. In Brazil, this was interpreted to mean that if a patriarch pronounced a lineage, then the member was not a descendant of Cain and was therefore eligible for the priesthood, despite physical or genealogical evidence of African ancestry. Actual patriarchs did not strictly adhere to Wallis's statement. In 1961, the Church Historian's Office reported that other lineages had been given, including from Cain. In 1971, the Presiding Patriarch stated that non- Israelite tribes should not be given as a lineage in a patriarchal blessing. In a 1980 address to students at Brigham Young University, James E. Faust attempted to assure listeners that if they had no declared lineage in their patriarchal blessing, that the Holy Ghost would \\"purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham.\\" After the 1978 revelation, patriarchs sometimes declared lineage in patriarchal blessings for black members, but sometimes they did not declare a lineage. Some black members have asked for and received new patriarchal blessings including a lineage. End of the temple and priesthood ban On June 8, 1978, the LDS Church's First Presidency released an official declaration which would allow \\"all worthy male members of the church [to] be ordained to the priesthood without regard to race or color\\", and which allowed black men and women access to endowments and sealings in the temple. According to the accounts of several of those present, while praying in the Salt Lake Temple, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles received the revelation relating to the lifting of the temple and priesthood ban. The apostle McConkie wrote that all present \\"received the same message\\" and were then able to understand \\"the will of the Lord.\\"Priesthood, pp. 127–128, Deseret Book Co., 1981. There were many factors that led up to the publication of this declaration: trouble from the NAACP because of priesthood inequality, the announcement of the first LDS temple in Brazil,Mark L. Grover, \\"The Mormon Priesthood Revelation and the São Paulo Brazil Temple\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 23:39–53 (Spring 1990). and other pressures from members and leaders of the church. After the publication of Lester Bush's seminal article in Dialogue, \\"Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview\\", BYU vice-president Robert K. Thomas feared that the church would lose its tax exemption status. The article described the church's racially discriminatory practices in detail. The article inspired internal discussion among church leaders, weakening the idea that the priesthood ban was doctrinal. However, in a 2016 landmark survey, almost two- thirds of 1,156 self-identified Latter-day Saints reported believing the pre-1978 temple and priesthood ban was \\"God's will\\". Non-white members of the church were almost 10% more likely to believe that the ban was \\"God's will\\" than white members. “Forty Years on, Most Mormons Still Believe the Racist Temple Ban Was God's Will.” Religion News Service, 13 June 2018, religionnews.com/2018/06/11/40-years-later-most-mormons-still-believe-the- racist-priesthood-temple-ban-was-gods-will/. Direct commandment of God Church leaders taught for decades that the priesthood ordination and temple ordinance ban was commanded by God. Brigham Young taught it was a \\"true eternal principle the Lord Almighty has ordained.\\" In 1949, the First Presidency under George Albert Smith officially stated that it \\"remains as it has always stood\\" and was \\"not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord\\". A second First Presidency statement (this time under McKay) in 1969 re-emphasized that this \\"seeming discrimination by the Church towards the Negro is not something which originated with man; but goes back into the beginning with God\\". As president of the church, Kimball also emphasized in a 1973 press conference that the ban was \\"not my policy or the Church's policy. It is the policy of the Lord who has established it.\\" On the topic of doctrine and policy for the race ban lifting the apostle Dallin H. Oaks stated in 1988, \\"I don’t know that it’s possible to distinguish between policy and doctrine in a church that believes in continuing revelation and sustains its leader as a prophet. ... I’m not sure I could justify the difference in doctrine and policy in the fact that before 1978 a person could not hold the priesthood and after 1978 they could hold the priesthood.\\" Protection from Hell In 2012, Randy L. Bott, a BYU professor, suggested that God denied the priesthood to black men in order to protect them from the lowest rung of hell, since one of few damnable sins is to abuse the exercise of the priesthood. Bott compared the priesthood ban to a parent denying young children the keys to the family car, stating: \\"You couldn't fall off the top of the ladder, because you weren't on the top of the ladder. So, in reality the blacks not having the priesthood was the greatest blessing God could give them.\\" The church responded to these comments by stating the views do not represent the church's doctrine or teachings, nor do BYU professors speak on its behalf. Teachings about black people=Teachings about black people and the pre-existence One of the justifications which the LDS Church used for its discriminatory policy was its belief that black individual's pre- existence spirits were not as virtuous as white pre-existence spirits. Brigham Young rejected the idea, but Orson Pratt supported it. Formally, this justification appeared as early as 1908 in a Liahona magazine article. Joseph Fielding Smith supported the idea in his 1931 book The Way to Perfection, stating that the priesthood restriction on black was a \\"punishment\\" for actions in the pre-existence. In a letter in 1947, the First Presidency wrote in a letter to Lowry Nelson that blacks were not entitled to the full blessings of the gospel, and referenced the \\"revelations [...] on the preexistence\\" as a justification. In 1952, Lowry published a critique of the racist policy in an article in The Nation. Lowry believes it was the first time the folk doctrine that blacks were less righteous in the pre-existence was publicized to the non-Mormon world. The LDS Church also used this explanation in its 1949 statement which explicitly barred blacks from holding the priesthood. An address by Mark E. Peterson was widely circulated by BYU's religious faculty in the 1950s and 1960s and they used the \\"less valiant in the pre-existence\\" explanation to justify racial segregation, a view which Lowell Bennion and Kendall White, among other members, heavily criticized. The apostle Joseph Fielding Smith also taught that black people were less faithful in the preexistence. A 1959 report by US Commission found that the LDS Church in Utah generally taught that non-whites had inferior performance in the pre- earth life. After the priesthood ban was lifted in 1978, church leaders refuted the belief that black people were less valiant in the pre-existence. In a 1978 interview with Time magazine, Spencer W. Kimball stated that the LDS Church no longer held to the theory that those of African descent were any less valiant in the pre-earth life. In that same year, apostle Bruce R. McConkie told members to \\"Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world.\\" He went on to say that, \\"We get our truth and our light line upon line and precept upon precept. We have now had added a new flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases all the darkness and all the views and all the thoughts of the past.”“Find Answers.” FairMormon, www.fairmormon.org/answers/Bruce_R._McConkie:_\\"Forget_everything_that_I_have_said,_or_what_President_Brigham_Young_or_President_George_Q._Cannon_or_whomsoever_has_said_in_days_past_that_is_contrary_to_the_present_revelation\\". In a 2006 interview for the PBS documentary The Mormons, apostle Jeffrey R. Holland stated that inaccurate racial \\"folklore\\" was invented in order to justify the priesthood ban, and the reasons for the previous ban are unknown. The church explicitly denounced any justification of the priesthood restriction which was based on views of events which occurred in the pre- mortal life in the \\"Race and the Priesthood\\" essay which was published on its website in 2013. Curses of Cain and Ham Joseph Smith and Brigham Young taught that blacks were under the Curse of Ham. According to the Bible, after Cain killed Abel, God cursed him and put a mark on him, although the Bible does not state what the nature of the mark was. The Pearl of Great Price, another Mormon book of scripture, describes the descendants of Cain as dark- skinned. In another biblical account, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan to be \\"servants of servants\\". Although the scriptures do not mention Ham's skin color, a common Judeo-Christian interpretation of these verses, which pre- dates Mormonism, associated the curse with black people and used it to justify slavery. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young referred to the curse as a justification for slavery at some point in their lives. Prior to the Latter Day Saint settlement in Missouri, Joseph Smith was a firm abolitionist, but softened his opposition to slavery during the Missouri years, going as far as writing a very cautious justification of the institution. Following the Mormon Extermination Order and violent expulsion of the church from the slave state, Joseph Smith once again openly embraced abolitionism and preached the equality of all of God's children, in 1841 stating that if opportunity for blacks were equal to the opportunity provided to whites, blacks could perform as well or even outperform whites. Brigham Young, however, while seemingly open to blacks holding the priesthood in his earlier years and praising of black members of the church, later used the curse as justification of barring blacks from the priesthood, banning interracial marriages, and opposing black suffrage. He stated that the curse would one day be lifted and that black people would be able to receive the priesthood post-mortally. Young once taught that the devil was black, and his successor as church president, John Taylor, taught on multiple occasions that the reason that black people (those with the curse of Cain) were allowed to survive the flood was so that the devil could be properly represented on the earth through the children of Ham and his wife Egyptus. The next president, Wilford Woodruff also affirmed that millions of people have Cain's mark of blackness drawing a parallel to modern Native American's \\"curse of redness\\". None of these ideas are accepted as official doctrine of the church. In a 1908 Liahona article for missionaries, an anonymous but church-sanctioned author reviewed the scriptures about blackness in the Pearl of Great Price. The author postulated that Ham married a descendant of Cain. Therefore Canaan received two curses, one from Noah, and one from being a descendant of Cain. The article states that Canaan was the \\"sole ancestor of the Negro race\\" and explicitly linked his curse to be \\"servant of servants\\" to black priesthood denial. To support this idea, the article also discussed how Pharaoh, a descendant of Canaan according to LDS scripture, could not have the priesthood, because Noah \\"cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood\\". In 1931, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith wrote on the same topic in The Way to Perfection: Short Discourses on Gospel Themes, generating controversy within and without Mormonism. For evidence that modern blacks were descended from Cain, Smith wrote that \\"it is generally believed that\\" Cain's curse was continued through his descendants and through Ham's wife. Smith states that \\"some of the brethren who were associate with Joseph Smith have declared that he taught this doctrine.\\" In 1978, when the church ended the ban on the priesthood, apostle Bruce R. McConkie taught that the ancient curse of Cain and Ham was no longer in effect. General authorities in the LDS Church favored Smith's explanation until 2013, when a Church-published online essay disavowed the idea that black skin is the sign of a curse. The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS institutes, teaches that Canaan could not hold the priesthood because of the cursing of Ham his father, but makes no reference to race. Antediluvian people of Canaan According to the Book of Moses, the people of Canaan were a group of people that lived during the time of Enoch, before the Canaanites mentioned in the Bible. Enoch prophesied that the people of Canaan would war against the people of Shum, and that God would curse their land with heat, and that a blackness would come upon them. When Enoch called the people to repentance, he taught everyone except the people of Canaan. The Book of Abraham identifies Pharaoh as a Canaanite. There is no explicit connection from the antediluvian people of Canaan to Cain's descendants, the Canaanites descended from Ham's son Canaan or modern black people. However, the Book of Moses identifies both Cain's descendants and the people of Canaan as black and cursed, and they were frequently used interchangeably. Bruce R. McConkie justified restrictions on teaching black people because Enoch did not teach the people of Canaan. Righteous black people would become white Early church leaders believed that souls of everyone in the celestial kingdom (the highest degree of heaven) would be \\"white in eternity.\\" They often equated whiteness with righteousness, and taught that originally God made his children white in his own image. A 1959 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that most Utah Mormons believed \\"by righteous living, the dark-skinned races may again become 'white and delightsome'.\\" Conversely, the church also taught that white apostates would have their skins darkened when they abandoned the faith. Several black Mormons were told that they would become white. Hyrum Smith told Jane Manning James that God could give her a new lineage, and in her patriarchal blessing promised her that she would become \\"white and delightsome\\". In 1808, Elijah Abel was promised that \\"thy soul be white in eternity\\". Darius Gray, a prominent black Mormon, was told that his skin color would become lighter. In 1978, apostle LeGrand Richards clarified that the curse of dark skin for wickedness and promise of white skin through righteousness only applied to Indians, and not to black people. In recent decades, church leaders have refuted these ideas, describing them as racial \\"folk beliefs,\\" and teaching that blackness in Latter-day Saint theology is a symbol of disobedience to God and not necessarily a skin color. Slavery Biddy Mason was one of 14 blacks who sued for their freedom after being illegally held captive by Mormons in San Bernardino. Initial Mormon converts were from the north and opposed slavery. This caused contention in the slave state of Missouri, and the church leadership began distancing itself from abolitionism and sometimes justifying slavery based on the Bible. During this time, several slave owners joined the church and brought their slaves with them when they moved to Nauvoo. The church adopted scriptures which teaches against influencing slaves to be \\"dissatisfied with their condition\\". As mayor of Nauvoo, Joseph Smith prohibited blacks from holding office, joining the Nauvoo Legion, voting or marrying whites. Also during this time, Joseph Smith began his presidential campaign on a platform for the government to buy slaves into freedom over several years. He was killed during his presidential campaign. After the murder of Joseph Smith by a violent mob, fearful Latter- day Saints fled to Utah, then part of the Mexican province of Alta California, under the direction of Brigham Young. Some slave owners brought their slaves with them to Utah, though several slaves escaped. The church put out a statement of neutrality towards slavery, stating that it was between the slave owner and God. A few years later, Brigham Young began teaching that slavery was ordained of God, but remained opposed to creating a slave-based economy in Utah like that seen in the South. In 1852, the Utah Territory, under the governance of Brigham Young, legalized the slave trade for both Blacks and Native Americans. Under his direction, Utah passed laws supporting slavery and making it illegal for blacks to vote, hold public office, join the Nauvoo Legion, or marry whites. Many prominent members of the church owned or used slaves, including William H. Hooper, Abraham O. Smoot, Charles C. Rich, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball. Members bought and sold slaves as property, gave the church slaves as tithing, and recaptured escaped slaves.Brigham Young told Greeley: \\"If slaves are brought here by those who owned them in the states, we do not favor their escape from the service of their owners.\\" (see Greeley, Overland Journey 211–212) quoted in In California, slavery was openly tolerated in the Mormon community of San Bernardino, despite being a free state. The US government freed the slaves and overturned laws prohibiting blacks from voting. Civil rights movement After the Civil War, issues around black rights went largely unnoticed until the American civil rights movement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) criticized the church's position on civil rights, led anti-discrimination marches and filed a lawsuit against the church's practice of not allowing black children to be troop leaders. Glen W. Davidson, \\"Mormon Missionaries and the Race Question,\\" The Christian Century, September 29, 1965, pp. 1183–86. Several athletes began protesting BYU over its discriminatory practices and the LDS Church policy that did not give black people the priesthood., p. 1, p. 10 In response, the Church issued a statement supporting civil rights and changed its policy on boy scouts. Apostle Ezra Taft Benson began criticizing the civil rights movement and challenging accusations of police brutality. African-American athletes protested discriminatory practices at BYU by refusing to play against them. After the reversal of the priesthood ban in 1978, the LDS church stayed relatively silent on matters of civil rights for a time, but eventually began meeting with and has formed a partnership with the NAACP, with its President speaking at the NAACP convention in 2019. Segregation During the first century of its existence, the church discouraged social interaction with blacks and encouraged racial segregation. Joseph Smith supported segregation, stating, \\"I would confine them [black people] by strict law to their own species\\". Until 1963, many church leaders supported legalized racial segregation. David O. McKay, J. Reuben Clark, Henry D. Moyle, Ezra Taft Benson, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Mark E. Peterson were leading proponents of segregation. In the late 1940s First Presidency members publicly and privately condemned white-black marriage calling it \\"repugnant\\", \\"forbidden\\", and a \\"wicked virus\\". During the years, different black families were either told by church leadership not to attend church or chose not to attend church after white members complained. The church began considering segregated congregations, and sent missionaries to southern United States to establish segregated congregations. In 1947, mission president, Rulon Howells, decided to segregate the branch in Piracicaba, Brazil, with white members meeting in the chapel and black members meeting in a member's home. When the black members resisted, arguing that integration would help everyone, Howells decided to remove the missionaries from the black members and stop visiting them. The First Presidency under Heber J. Grant sent a letter to stake president Ezra Taft Benson in Washington, D.C., advising that if two black Mormon women were \\"discreetly approached\\" they should be happy to sit at the back or side so as not to upset some white women who had complained about sitting near them in Relief Society. At least one black family was forbidden from attending church after white members complained about their attendance. In 1956, Mark E. Petersen suggested that a segregated chapel should be created for places where a number of black families joined. The church also advocated for segregation laws and enforced segregation in its facilities. Hotel Utah, a church-run hotel, banned black guests, even when other hotels made exceptions for black celebrities. Blacks were prohibited from performing in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Deseret News did not allow black people to appear in photographs with white people. Church leaders urged white members to join civic groups and opened up LDS chapels \\"for meetings to prevent Negroes from becoming neighbors\\", even after a 1948 Supreme Court decision against racial covenants in housing. They counseled members to buy homes so black people wouldn't move next to LDS chapels. In the 1950s, the San Francisco mission office took legal action to prevent black families from moving into the church neighborhood. A black man living in Salt Lake City, Daily Oliver, described how, as a boy in the 1910s, he was excluded from an LDS-led boy scout troop because they did not want blacks in their building. In 1954, apostle Mark E. Petersen taught that segregation was inspired by God, arguing that \\"what God hath separated, let not man bring together again\\". He used examples of the Lamanites and Nephites, the curse of Cain, Jacob and Esau, and the Israelites and Canaanites as scriptural precedence for segregation. Church leaders advocated for the segregation of donated blood, concerned that giving white members blood from black people might disqualify them from the priesthood. In 1943, the LDS Hospital opened a blood bank which kept separate blood stocks for whites and blacks. It was the second-largest in-hospital blood bank. After the 1978 ending of the priesthood ban, Consolidated Blood Services agreed to supply hospitals with connections to the LDS Church, including LDS Hospital, Primary Children's and Cottonwood Hospitals in Salt Lake City, McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, and Utah Valley Hospital in Provo. Racially segregated blood stocks reportedly ended in the 1970s, although white patients worried about receiving blood from a black donor were reassured that this would not happen even after 1978. Church leaders opposed desegregation in schools. After Dr. Robinson wrote an editorial in the Deseret News, President McKay deleted portions that indicated support for desegregation in schools, explaining it would not be fair to force a white child to learn with a black child. Decades earlier as a missionary he had written that he did \\"not care much for a negro\\". Apostle J. Rueben Clark instructed the Relief Society general president to keep the National Council of Women from supporting going on record in favor of school desegregation. BYU and black students Church leaders supported segregation at BYU. Apostle Harold B. Lee protested an African student who was given a scholarship, believing it was dangerous to integrate blacks on BYU's campus. In 1960 the NAACP reported that the predominantly LDS landlords of Provo, Utah would not rent to a BYU black student, and that no motel or hotel there would lodge hired black performers. Later that year BYU administrators hired a black man as a professor without the knowledge of its president Ernest Wilkinson. When Wilkinson found out he wrote that it was a \\"serious mistake of judgement\\", and \\"the danger in doing so is that students ... assume that there is nothing improper about mingling with other races\\", and the man was promptly reassigned to a departmental advisory position to minimize the risk of mingling. A few months later, BYU leaders were \\"very much concerned\\" when a male black student received a large number of votes for student vice president. Subsequently, Lee told Wilkinson he would hold him responsible if one of his granddaughters ever went to \\"BYU and bec[a]me engaged to a colored boy\\". Later the BYU Board of Trustees decided in February 1961 to officially encourage black students to attend other universities for the first time. In 1965 administrators began sending a rejection letter to black applicants which cited BYU's discouragement of interracial courtship and marriage as the motive behind the decision. By 1968 there was only one black American student on campus, though, Wilkinson wrote that year when responding to criticism that \\"all Negroes who apply for admission and can meet the academic standards are admitted.\\" BYU's dean of athletics Milton Hartvigsen called the Western Athletic Conference's 1969 criticism of BYU's ban on black athletes bigotry towards a religious group, and the next month Wilkinson accused Stanford University of bigotry for refusing to schedule athletic events with BYU over its discrimination towards black athletes. Interracial marriages and interracial sexual relations thumbright250pxU.S. states, by the date of repeal of anti-miscegenation laws: The church's stance against interracial marriage held consistent for over a century while attitudes towards black people and the priesthood, slavery, or equal rights saw considerable changes. Nearly every decade beginning with the church's formation until the '70s saw some denunciation against miscegenation. Church leaders' views stemmed from the priesthood policy and racist \\"biological and social\\" principles of the time.  19th century  One of the first times that anti-miscegenation feelings were mentioned by church leaders, occurred on February 6, 1835. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote a letter theorizing that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain and that Ham himself was cursed for \\"marrying a black wife\\". Joseph Smith wrote that he felt that black peoples should be \\"confined by strict law to their own species,\\" which some have said directly opposes Smith's advocacy for all other civil rights. In Nauvoo, it was against the law for black men to marry whites, and Joseph Smith fined two black men for violating his prohibition of intermarriage between blacks and whites. In 1852, the Utah legislature passed Act in Relation to Service which carried penalties for whites who had sexual relations with blacks. The day after it passed, church president Brigham Young explained that if someone mixes their seed with the seed of Cain, that both they and their children will have the Curse of Cain. He then prophesied that if the Church were approve of intermarriage with blacks, that the Church would go on to destruction and the priesthood would be taken away. The seed of Cain generally referred to those with dark skin who were of African descent. In 1863 during a sermon criticizing the federal government, Young said that the penalty for interracial reproduction between whites and blacks was death.  20th century  In 1946, J. Reuben Clark called racial intermarriage a \\"wicked virus\\" in an address in the church's official Improvement Era magazine. The next year, a California stake president Virgil H. Sponberg asked if members of the church are \\"required to associate with [Negroes]\\". The First Presidency under George Albert Smith sent a reply on May 5 stating that \\"social intercourse ... should certainly not be encouraged because of leading to intermarriage, which the Lord has forbidden.\\" Two months later in a letter to Utah State sociology professor Lowry Nelson, the First Presidency stated that marriage between a black person and a white person is \\"most repugnant\\" and \\"does not have the sanction of the Church and is contrary to church doctrine\\". Two years later in response to inquiries from a member Mrs. Guy B. Rose about whether white members were required to associate with black people the apostle Clark wrote that the church discouraged social interaction with black people since it could lead to marriage with them and interracial children. Church apostle Mark E. Petersen said in a 1954 address that he wanted to preserve the purity of the white race and that blacks desired to become white through intermarriage. The speech was circulated among BYU religion faculty, much to embarrassment of fellow LDS scholars. Over twenty years later Petersen denied knowing if the copies of his speech being passed around were authentic or not, apparently out of embarrassment.Petersen, Mark E.Race Problems — As They Affect The Church, Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954 In 1958, church general authority Bruce R. McConkie published Mormon Doctrine in which he stated that \\"the whole negro race have been cursed with a black skin, the mark of Cain, so they can be identified as a caste apart, a people with whom the other descendants of Adam should not intermarry.\\" The quote remained, despite many other revisions, until the church's Deseret Book ceased printing the book in 2010. Utah's anti- miscegenation law was repealed in 1963 by the Utah state legislature. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruling on the case of Loving v. Virginia determined that any prohibition of interracial marriages in the United States was unconstitutional. In a 1965 address to BYU students, apostle Spencer W. Kimball advised BYU students on interracial marriage: \\"Now, the brethren feel that it is not the wisest thing to cross racial lines in dating and marrying. There is no condemnation. We have had some of our fine young people who have crossed the lines. We hope they will be very happy, but experience of the brethren through a hundred years has proved to us that marriage is a very difficult thing under any circumstances and the difficulty increases in interrace marriages.\\"\\"Interracial Marriage Discouraged\\", Church News, June 17, 1978, p. 2. A church lesson manual for boys 12–13, published in 1995, contains a 1976 quote from Spencer W. Kimball that recommended the practice of marrying others of similar racial, economic, social, educational, and religious backgrounds. In 2003, the church published the Eternal Marriage Student Manual, which uses the same quote. There was no written church policy on interracial marriages, which had been permitted since before the 1978 Revelation on the Priesthood. In 1978, church spokesman Don LeFevre said, \\"So there is no ban on interracial marriage. If a black partner contemplating marriage is worthy of going to the Temple, nobody's going to stop him ... if he's ready to go to the Temple, obviously he may go with the blessings of the church.\\"Don LeFevre, Salt Lake Tribune, June 14, 1978.  21st century  Speaking on behalf of the church, Robert Millet wrote in 2003: \\"[T]he Church Handbook of Instructions ... is the guide for all Church leaders on doctrine and practice. There is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in this handbook concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members.\\"Robert L. Millet, \\"Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven\\", June 27, 2003. Racial attitudes Between the 19th and mid-20th centuries, some Mormons held racist views, and exclusion from priesthood was not the only discrimination practiced toward black people. With Joseph Smith as the mayor of Nauvoo, blacks were prohibited from holding office or joining the Nauvoo Legion. Brigham Young taught that equality efforts were misguided, claiming that those who fought for equality among blacks were trying to elevate them \\"to an equality with those whom Nature and Nature's God has indicated to be their masters, their superiors\\", but that instead they should \\"observe the law of natural affection for our kind.\\" A 1959 report by the US Commission found that blacks experienced the most wide-spread inequality in Utah, and Mormon teachings on blacks were used to explain racist teachings on blacks. During the 1960s and 1970s, Mormons in the western United States were close to averages in the United States in racial attitudes. In 1966, Armand Mauss surveyed Mormons on racial attitudes and discriminatory practices. He found that \\"Mormons resembled the rather 'moderate' denominations (such as Presbyterian, Congregational, Episcopalian), rather than the 'fundamentalists' or the sects.\\" Negative racial attitudes within Mormonism varied inversely with education, occupation, community size of origin, and youth, reflecting the national trend. Urban Mormons with a more orthodox view of Mormonism tended to be more tolerant. The American racial attitudes caused difficulties when the church tried to apply the one-drop rule to other areas. For example, many members in Brazil did not understand American classifications of race and how it applied to the priesthood ban, causing a rift between the missionaries and members. Anti-black jokes commonly circulated among Mormons before the 1978 revelation. In the early 1970s, apostle Spencer W. Kimball began preaching against racism. In 1972, he said: \\"Intolerance by church members is despicable. A special problem exists with respect to black people because they may not now receive the priesthood. Some members of the Church would justify their own un-Christian discrimination against black people because of that rule with respect to the priesthood, but while this restriction has been imposed by the Lord, it is not for us to add burdens upon the shoulders of our black brethren. They who have received Christ in faith through authoritative baptism are heirs to the celestial kingdom along with men of all other races. And those who remain faithful to the end may expect that God may finally grant them all blessings they have merited through their righteousness. Such matters are in the Lord's hands. It is for us to extend our love to all.\\"The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 237, emphasis in original In a study covering 1972 to 1996, church members in the United States has been shown to have lower rates of approval of segregation than others from the United States, as well as a faster decline in approval of segregation over the periods covered, both with statistical significance. Today, the church actively opposes racism among its membership. It is currently working to reach out to black people, and has several predominantly black wards inside the United States.Wilcox, Lauren, \\"The Saints Go Marching In\\", Washington Post, May 13, 2007. It teaches that all are invited to come unto Christ and it speaks against those who harbor ill feelings towards another race. In 2006, church president Gordon B. Hinckley said in a General Conference of the church that those who use racial slurs can not be called disciples of Christ. In the July 1992 edition of the New Era, the church published a MormonAd promoting racial equality in the church. The photo contained several youth of a variety of ethic backgrounds with the words \\"Family Photo\\" in large print. Underneath the picture are the words \\"God created the races—but not racism. We are all children of the same Father. Violence and hatred have no place in His family. (See Acts 10:34.)\\" In August 2017, the LDS Church released a statement about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemning racism in general through its Public Relations Department. Following the statement, the LDS Church released an additional statement, specifically condemning white supremacy as morally wrong. Black Mormon blogger Tami Smith said that she joyfully heard the statement and felt that the church was standing with black church members. White Mormon blogger Ayla Stewart argues that the statement is non-binding since it came from the Public Relations Department, rather than the First Presidency. Opposition to race-based policies In the second half of the 20th century some white LDS Church members protested against church teachings and policies excluding black members from temple ordinances and the priesthood. For instance, three members, John Fitzgerald, Douglas A. Wallace, and Byron Marchant, were all excommunicated by the LDS Church in the 1970s for publicly criticizing these teachings (in the years 1973, 1976, and 1977 respectively). Wallace had given the priesthood to a black man on April 2, 1976 without authorization and the next day attempted to enter the general conference to stage a demonstration. After being legally barred from the following October conference, his house was put under surveillance during the April 1977 conference by police at the request of the LDS church and the FBI. Marchant was excommunicated for signaling the first vote in opposition to sustaining the church president in modern history during the April 1977 general conference. His vote was motivated by the temple and priesthood ban. He had also received previous media attention as an LDS scoutmaster of a mixed-faith scout troop involved in a 1974 lawsuit that changed the church's policy banning even non-Mormon black Boy Scouts from acting as patrol leaders as church-led scouting troop policy had tied scouting position with Aaronic Priesthood authority. Others white members who publicly opposed church teachings and policies around black people included Grant Syphers and his wife who were denied access to the temple over their objections, with their San Francisco bishop stating that \\"Anyone who could not accept the Church's stand on Negroes ... could not go to the temple.\\" Their stake president agreed and they were denied the temple recommend renewal. Additionally, Prominent LDS politician Stewart Udall, who was then acting as the United States Secretary of the Interior, wrote a strongly worded public letter in 1967 criticizing LDS policies around black members to which he received hundreds of critical response letters, including ones from apostles Delbert Stapley and Spencer Kimball. Racial discrimination after the 1978 revelation LDS historian Wayne J. Embry interviewed several black LDS Church members in 1987 and reported that all the participants reported \\"incidents of aloofness on the part of white members, a reluctance or a refusal to shake hands with them or sit by them, and racist comments made to them.\\" Embry further reported that one black church member attended church for three years, despite being completely ignored by fellow church members. Embry reports that \\"she [the same black church member] had to write directly to the president of the LDS Church to find out how to be baptized\\" because none of her fellow church members would tell her. Despite the end of the priesthood ban in 1978, and proclamations from church leadership extolling diversity, racist beliefs in the church prevailed. White church member Eugene England, a professor at Brigham Young University, wrote in 1998 that most Mormons still held deeply racist beliefs, including that blacks were descended from Cain and Ham and subject to their curses. England's students at BYU who reported these beliefs learned them from their parents or from instructors at church, and had little insight into how these beliefs contradicted gospel teachings. In 2003, black LDS Church member Darron Smith noticed a similar problem, and wrote in Sunstone about the persistence of racist beliefs in the LDS church. Smith wrote that racism persisted in the church because church leadership had not addressed the ban's origins. This racism persisted in the beliefs that blacks were descendants of Cain, that they were neutral in the war in heaven, and that skin color was tied to righteousness. In 2007, journalist and church member, Peggy Fletcher Stack, wrote that black Mormons still felt separate from other church members because of how other members treat them, ranging from calling them the \\"n-word\\" at church and in the temple to small differences in treatment. The dearth of blacks in LDS Church leadership also contributes to black members' feelings of not belonging.Peggy Fletcher Stack, \\"New film and revived group help many feel at home in their church\\", Salt Lake Tribune, July 6, 2007. in June 2016, Alice Faulkner Burch—a women's leader in the Genesis Group, an LDS-sponsored organization for black Mormons in Utah—said black Mormons \\"still need support to remain in the church—not for doctrinal reasons but for cultural reasons.\\" Burch added that \\"women are derided about our hair ... referred to in demeaning terms, our children mistreated, and callings withheld.\\" When asked what black women today want, Burch recounted that one woman had told her she wished \\"to be able to attend church once without someone touching my hair.\\" In 2020, a printed Sunday school manual that accompanied an LDS course studying the Book of Mormon contained teachings about “dark skin” as constituting a “curse” and a sign of divine disfavor. After a public outcry, the church corrected its digital version of the manual of the course, titled “Come, Follow Me”, and apostle Gary E. Stevenson told a Martin Luther King Day gathering of the NAACP that he was “saddened” by the error, adding: “We are asking members to disregard the paragraph in the printed manual.” BYU law professor Michalyn Steele, a Native American, later expressed concern about the church's editorial practice and dismay that church educators continue to perpetuate racism. Black membership The first statement regarding proselyting towards blacks was about slaves. In 1835, the Church's policy was to not proselyte to slaves unless they had permission from their masters. This policy was changed in 1836, when Smith wrote that slaves should not be taught the gospel at all until after their masters were converted. Though the church had an open membership policy for all races, they avoided opening missions in areas with large black populations, discouraged people with black ancestry from investigating the church, counseled members to avoid social interactions with black people, and instructed black members to segregate when white members complained of having to worship with them. Relatively few black people who joined the church retained active membership prior to 1978. Proselytization Bruce R. McConkie stated in his 1966 Mormon Doctrine that the \\"gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them, although sometimes negroes search out the truth.\\" Despite interest from a few hundred Nigerians, proselyting efforts were delayed in Nigeria in the 1960s. After the Nigerian government stalled the church's visa, apostles did not want to proselyte there. In Africa, there were only active missionaries among whites in South Africa. Blacks in South Africa who requested baptism were told that the church was not working among the blacks. In the South Pacific, the church avoiding missionary work among native Fijians until 1955 when the church determined they were related to other Polynesian groups. In Brazil, LDS officials discouraged individuals with black ancestry from investigating the church. They instituted a mission-wide genealogy program to discover black ancestry, and their official records were marked if any black ancestry was discovered. In the 1970s \\"lineage lessons\\" were added to determine that interested persons were eligible for teaching. An example of these missionary \\"lineage lessons\\" (in Portuguese) can be viewed at the Church History website here with a document translation found here and here After 1978, there were no restrictions against proselytizing to blacks. Shortly after, missionaries began entering areas of Africa that were more predominately black. After 1978 Accra Ghana Temple, the second in Africa The church does not currently keep official records on the race of its membership, so exact numbers are unknown. Black people have been members of Mormon congregations since its foundation, but in 1964 its black membership was small, with about 300 to 400 black members worldwide. In 1970, the officially sanctioned black LDS support group, the Genesis Group, was formed in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1997, there were approximately 500,000 black members of the church (about 5% of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean.Adherents.com quoting Deseret News 1999–2000 Church Almanac. Deseret News: Salt Lake City, UT (1998); pg. 119. Since then, black membership has grown, especially in West Africa, where two temples have been built, doubling to about 1 million black members worldwide by 2008. In April 2017, the LDS Church announced plans to build a temple in Nairobi, Kenya, bringing to six the number of temples planned or built in Africa outside South Africa. In 2017 two black South African men were called to serve as mission presidents. Regarding the LDS Church in Africa, professor Philip Jenkins noted in 2009 that LDS growth has been slower than that of other churches due to a number of reasons, one being the white face of the church due to the priesthood ban, and another being the church's refusal to accommodate local customs like polygamy. Other Latter Day Saint groups' positions=Community of Christ Joseph Smith III opposed slavery. Joseph Smith III, the son of Joseph Smith, founded the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1860, now known as the Community of Christ. Smith was a vocal advocate of abolishing the slave trade, and a supporter of Owen Lovejoy, an anti-slavery congressman from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln. He joined the Republican Party and advocated its antislavery politics. He rejected the fugitive slave law, and openly stated that he would assist slaves who tried to escape. While he was a strong opponent of slavery, he still viewed whites as superior to blacks, and held the view that they must not \\"sacrifice the dignity, honor and prestige that may be rightfully attached to the ruling races.\\" The priesthood has always been open to men of all races, and it has also been open to women since 1984. The Community of Christ rejects the Pearl of Great Price, especially its teachings on priesthood restrictions.Faith and Beliefs , webpage, retrieved June 17, 2006 Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Warren Jeffs, President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since 2002, has made several documented statements on black people including the following: *\\"The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth.\\" *\\"[Cain was] cursed with a black skin and he is the father of the Negro people. He has great power, can appear and disappear. He is used by the devil, as a mortal man, to do great evils.\\" *\\"Today you can see a black man with a white woman, et cetera. A great evil has happened on this land because the devil knows that if all the people have Negro blood, there will be nobody worthy to have the priesthood.\\" *\\"If you marry a person who has connections with a Negro, you would become cursed.\\" Bickertonite The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) has advocated full racial integration throughout all aspects of the church since its organization in 1862. While America was engaged in disputes over the issues of civil liberties and racial segregation, the church claimed that its message was open to members of all races. In 1905, the church suspended an elder for opposing the full integration of all races. Historian Dale Morgan wrote in 1949: \\"An interesting feature of the Church's doctrine is that it discriminates in no way against ... members of other racial groups, who are fully admitted to all the privileges of the priesthood. It has taken a strong stand for human rights, and was, for example, uncompromisingly against the Ku Klux Klan during that organization's period of ascendancy after the First World War.\\" At a time when racial segregation or discrimination was commonplace in most institutions throughout America, two of the most prominent leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ were African American. Apostle John Penn, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve from 1910 to 1955, conducted missionary work among Italian Americans, and he was often referred to as \\"The Italian's Doctor\\". Matthew Miller, who was ordained an evangelist in 1937, traveled throughout Canada and established missions to Native Americans. The Church does not report any mission involvement or congregations in predominantly black countries. Strangite Strangites welcomed African Americans into their church during a time when some other factions denied them the priesthood, and certain other benefits that come with membership in it. Strang ordained at least two African Americans to his church's eldership during his lifetime.\\"African-Americans\\". Strangite.org. Retrieved on October 18, 2007.

The academy was established in 1750, and is the oldest institution for higher education in Norway. The current commandant is Colonel Erlend Bekkestad.  History  The Commander-in-Chief of the Norwegian armed forces, Hans Jacob Arnold Jensen, sent a request to the King of Denmark-Norway in 1750 to establish a school of mathematics in Christiania. The King determined, through the Royal Resolution of 16 December 1750, to establish Den frie matematiske skole (The Free Mathematical School). It was the first institution offering higher education in Norway, but it did not give any extensive military education. The students were recruited from the officer corps or from nobles in military service. After a reorganization in 1804, the school became an officer school and an independent unit with its own command. From 1876-1880 a college degree was required to apply. The school was first established at 10 Tollbugata in Oslo. It was moved to St. Olavsplass in 1899 and in 1918 it was moved back to Tollbugata 10. In 1969, it was moved to Linderud, where it is currently located. Between 1984 and 1995 Krigsskolen Gimlemoen in Kristiansand was also in operation. This was a 2-year degree (in addition to a one-year NCO/Sergeant schools, and at least one year service as an NCO as a requirement for admission). Students from KSG was awarded a commission as officers in the Army. . In 2003, the Military Academy was obligated to follow the Law of Universities and granted the right to award bachelor's degrees.  Application and selection  Applicants must be Norwegian citizens aged at least eighteen, have good health and no criminal record, and must have completed high school and a one-year NCO course. After being accepted as candidates, all applicants must then complete and pass a two-week field exercise, with physical tests which include a three kilometre run, hang-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, and a 200-metre swimming test. The entrance to the old Academy building located in Tollbugata  Organization  The Academy is a part of the Norwegian Army. The Academy consists of seven courses. One course is located at Terningmoen, with a yearlong NCO course and prep course. Five courses are located at Linderud, with general education, engineering education and a qualifying course. The logistical course is located at the Naval Academy in Bergen.  Courses  The Academy offers a general education as well as a specialized engineering and logistical education. In addition, several civilian studies are available. The general course last for three years and is divided into the fields of military power, leadership, language and inter-cultural communication, strategy and physical training. When finished, the cadets will serve as platoon commanders. The engineering course lasts for three years and is divided into the fields of military building techniques, military geography, mathematics, statistics, physics, chemistry and computer science. When finished, the cadets will serve as platoon commanders. The logistics course lasts for three years and is divided into the fields of methodology, logistics, law and economy. When finished, the cadets will serve as logistical officers. The NCO course lasts for one year and is divided into the fields of military leadership, tactics and operations, physical training, language and mathematics. After completing the course, the cadets can start a three-year course. The qualifying course lasts for six months and includes the fields of military power and operations, military leadership, methodology and physical training.  Training  During the courses, the cadets complete several field exercises to train leadership, tactics and decision-making. One of the infamous field exercises is the combat course, conducted to test the limits of the cadets in a combat environment over a long period of time. The exercise must be completed, and certain demands must be met before the cadets qualify the 3-year courses.  Traditions  The classes have a tradition of taking names from Norwegian officers, inspiring the cadets to follow in their paths. The Norwegian Military Academy performs ceremonial duties for the King of Norway. A parade is conducted every 16 December to celebrate the establishment of the Academy. In addition, the Academy conducts a parade on 8 May, to celebrate the Liberation Day or Veteran Day.

The Greenbelt includes High Rock Park, LaTourette Park, William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, and Willowbrook Park among others. Description Clay Pit Ponds The administrative headquarters of the Greenbelt and Greenbelt Conservancy are located at the entrance to High Rock Park (one of the many parks within the system) with a street address of 200 Nevada Avenue in the Egbertville neighborhood; in June 2004 a second facility, known as the Greenbelt Nature Center, was opened approximately away, at 700 Rockland Avenue. The Greenbelt Conservancy, which works in partnership with the NYC Parks Department, is a membership organization offering year-round nature-themed events for young people and adults. The Protectors of Pine Oak Woods, a citizen organization committed to the conservation and preservation of remaining natural area on Staten Island has, since the early 1970s, carried on the mission of its predecessor, SIGNAL. Today the \\"Protectors\\" continue the tradition of organizing people concerned about the island's fragile and threatened wilderness via lobbying and naturalist led hikes. A researchable archive of planning, legal, public relations, and other documents related to the Staten Island Greenbelt, its ecology and history, is housed at the library of the College of Staten Island, a campus of the City University of New York. Geology Containing an extensive system of connected trails and covering , its forested hills run the length of Staten Island's midsection while wetlands and kettle ponds fill much of the low-lying areas. Four hundred and ten feet above sea level, Todt Hill is the highest elevation south of Maine along the Eastern Seaboard. This and other surface features are the result of glacial activity from the Pleistocene epoch; the metamorphic and igneous rocks below the surface – schist, sandstone, serpentine, magnetite, iron oxide – are the result of tectonic activity from the much earlier Paleozoic era and volcanic activity from subsequent geologic eras. Wildlife The Greenbelt is one of the most biologically diverse places in New York City. It is home to several species of amphibians; such as the eastern redback salamander, the green frog, the American bullfrog, and the grey tree frog; reptiles; such as the eastern garter snake, the eastern box turtle, and the northern water snake, as well as New York's state reptile, the common snapping turtle. On occasion northern \\"black\\" racer and eastern milksnakes are reported here. Both species are threatened elsewhere on Staten Island due to habitat destruction due to development. The Greenbelt provides year-round habitat native mammals like the gray squirrel, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the white- tailed deer. Permanent bird residents include the blue jay, northern cardinal, downy woodpecker, and black-capped chickadee, while northern flickers and other migrants use the Greenbelt as a stopover on seasonal migration routes. Raptors such as Cooper's hawks, redtail hawks, and great horned owls also call the greenbelt home. The waterways are rich in fish life, and such species found here include the largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, brown bullhead, black crappie, yellow perch, chain pickerel, as well as several darter species. Early settlement The native Lenni-Lenape, who inhabited the island centuries before the arrival of the Dutch, reportedly dubbed Staten Island Aquehonga Monocknong or \\"the place of bad woods\\" perhaps because of the spirits they believed dwelled there. Then, as today, the boulder-littered moraines were covered with many species of trees: oak, hickory, maple, beech, as well as lesser quantities of birch, sweet gum, ash, black walnut, wild cherry, and tulip. Below the canopy of this sub-climax forest grew dogwood, ironwood, spicebush, blackberry, wild grape, Virginia creeper, and sassafras, along with royal and cinnamon ferns, skunk cabbage, lady slipper, and trout lilies in the wetter areas. Within the oak-mulch enriched soil that has been laid down over millennia, arrowheads have been found. These finds attest to both the Leni-Lenape's subsistence on and unsuccessful defense of their home, which contained the natural resources that made it so attractive to first Dutch and then British colonizers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its forested hills, strategically located between and above the Raritan Bay and the New York Harbor, offered timber for ship building, iron ore for the production of cannonballs, and a staging ground for British troops during the War for Independence. In the 1800s, several centuries after European settlers had come to, named, deforested, and farmed large portions of Staten Island, travelers of a different sort arrived. Henry David Thoreau - in his furthest journey from his native Massachusetts – came for one year in 1843 in order to tutor the nephews of his friend and fellow transcendentalist, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some years later, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, famed for his design of urban parks throughout the U.S.,This includes Central Park in Manhattan, Prospect Park, Brooklyn; Mount Royal Park, Montreal; the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.; the Boston Emerald Necklace park system; Stanford University, Palo Alto, California; Lake Park, Milwaukee; and Jackson Park, Chicago; Olmsted's most important late work was the design for the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago (1890-1893). settled for a time on a experimental farm overlooking the Raritan Bay, which he called Tosomock Farm. After 10 years, he and his new bride left the island only to return later in his life. After Olmsted left Tosomock Farm, businessman Erastus Wiman bought it, renaming it \\"The Woods of Arden\\", which stands today at 4515 Hylan Boulevard, near Woods of Arden. Proposal for a park In 1871, in his capacity as consultant to the Staten Island Improvement Commission, Olmsted made the following proposal for Staten Island: Other proposals on behalf of preserving wilderness on Staten Island were put forward in subsequent years. William T. Davis, a naturalist born on the island, believed: When Davis, along with local historian Charles Leng, coauthored a history of Staten Island in 1896, they wrote: Just one year later, at an 1897 public hearing on the topic of land preservation in Albany, the state's capital, Staten Island resident Erastus Wiman stated: Parkway plan cut in the park Original plan During the first half of the 20th century, several proposals for Staten Island parks and parkways were drafted first by the Borough of Staten Island and then by the City of New York. During the early 1960s, though then-Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman Robert Moses revealed plans for what is now the Korean War Veterans Parkway, a parkway that would connect Brooklyn with New Jersey, traversing the island from the soon to be opened Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on the island's North Shore to the Outerbridge Crossing on the southern shore of Staten Island. This original route of the proposed \\"Richmond Parkway\\" would have bisected the swath of land on whose behalf Olmsted had pleaded including what is today Fresh Kills, William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, Reed's Basket Willow Swamp, Willowbrook and High Rock Park. The parkway route going through the area has been de-mapped despite occasional proposals for its revival due to steadily increasing highway congestion on Staten Island. None of these proposals, however, have received any significant support from either the island's elected officials or residents. The parkway ends at the Greenbelt's southwestern edge, at Richmond Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, near the Fresh Kills Park. Opposition Conservation activists, given immediacy by the Federal Highway Act and hope in the person of President John F. Kennedy's Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, mobilized in opposition to these plans. They first saved High Rock Girl Scout Camp, the acreage of which had originally been a part of Pouch Boy Scout Camp, including Orbach Lake, to the north. With a $35,000 grant from the State of New York it was bought from the Boy Scouts and established as Camp High Rock for Girls. For thirteen years, the camp served girl scouts from throughout the five boroughs of New York City. However, in 1964, the Girl scout Council of Greater New York secretly decided to sell the camp to a developer for $1 million. Upon learning about this sale, the New York City Parks Department and the State of New York, with the help of the Open Lands Foundation, raised over $1.3 million to buy back the land from the developer, thus creating High Rock Park. Then, on November 22, 1965, the Staten Island Citizens Planning Committee (SICPC), which had begun in 1954 as an ad hoc committee of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Staten Island, issued the first of many position papers beginning by invoking Olmsted's plea for a linear park; it concluded by presenting an alternate parkway plan that would spare what has come to be known as the Staten Island Greenbelt, a term proposed by landscape architect, Bradford Greene, one of the group's founding members. Greene was familiar with this policy or land use designation from previous work he had been involved with in Maryland. At the helm of the SICPC, an all-volunteer organization, were several \\"off-islanders\\" – young professionals who had moved to Staten Island's North Shore area in the 1950s largely because of the quality of life promised by the open space that still existed. In addition to Bradford Greene, there were Terrence Benbow and Frank Duffy, both attorneys practicing in Manhattan; Robert Hagenhofer, a graphic designer; George Pratt, director of the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences; and New York Times staff writer Alan Oser. Summoning their many and diverse talents, their strategy involved developing and advocating for an alternate route in the press, before public officials, and, when necessary, the courts. One year into the SICPC's legal fight against the original route of the Richmond Parkway, the Staten Island Greenbelt Natural Areas League (SIGNAL), spearheaded by another resident- journalist, John G. Mitchell, formed as a vehicle for rallying community opposition to the highway construction. From 1966 until the early 1970s, SIGNAL organized thousands of citizens and elected officials (including Planning Commissioner Eleanor Guggenheimer, Parks Commissioner Thomas Hoving, Mayor John V. Lindsay, and U.S. Senator Jacob Javits) to participate in annual winter walks through the highland forests, tracing the route of the proposed (and already mapped) highway route. These two citizen organizations and their combined strategies of lobbying, public relations, and grassroots organizing challenged Robert Moses, who had been thwarted by community efforts only twice before: In 1956, mothers who frequented Manhattan's Central Park with their young children successfully had stopped a proposed parking lot expansion by challenging Moses in court. Two years later, when Robert Moses proposed the construction of a sunken boulevard which would have sped traffic through the middle of the famed Washington Square Park, the Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway led by Jane Jacobs, defeated him again.Caro, Robert A. (1974) The Power Broker. New York: Vintage. Work continues In spite of opposition, road work began in 1965 on what became known as \\"Section 1\\". In 1966 Volmer Associates were hired by the city of New York to describe alternate routes to Section 1. They were proposed, studied, and debated by New York state and city officials, creating contention and divisions even within these governmental units. While travel distance between the island's bridges was on paramount concern to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the City Park Department, led by August Hecksher, commissioned the planning firm Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd. Ian McHarg, a Glasgow born landscape architect, who had stated in his much studied book Design with Nature that engineer road builders were \\"gouging and scarring the landscape without remorse,\\" headed up the landmark study. Having pointed out that a method for displaying and factoring social values into highway design and planning had not been developed, McHarg set about creating just that. Long before GIS technology was available, McHarg used data rich maps and overlays which allowed planners to visually understand how social values – historic, residential, economic, recreational, scenic, ecological factors – synergistically interacted with and potentially impacted upon human activity, including road building. Using map transparencies he and his colleagues produced the commissioned report with a recommendation stating that the route to the west of what is today the Greenbelt, was the \\"least social cost corridor.\\" Under duress from developers who were eager to begin building homes adjacent to the roadway, the Greenbelt's erstwhile supporters, Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, publicly backed a compromise route. In response, the two citizen organizations were willing to stop at nothing to preserve what John Mitchell, in one of his writings, referred to as \\"a fine patch of wild\\".Mitchell, John (1976) High Rock: A Natural and Unnatural History. Friends of High Rock. With their combined memberships behind them, the officers of the SICPC and SIGNAL sought injunctive relief in New York State Supreme Court, which meant suing both Lindsay and Rockefeller. The court decision found for the plaintiffs. The citizen planners and conservationists were victorious. The area was earmarked as one of two Special Natural Features Districts in the City of New York, and between 1972 and 1974 the urbanist and architect Peter Verity (now of PDRconsultants) prepared for the New York City Planning Commission the strategic and detailed documentation to support this designation.City of New York, Special Natural Features District 1985. Remaining parts When the work was halted by the city, excavations were used to construct what is now known as \\"Moses Mountain,\\" a rise adjacent to the Manor Road - Rockland Avenue interchange. Other remnants of construction can be seen from the Staten Island Expressway between the Clove Road and Bradley Avenue exits, which are referred to as the abandoned bridges. They are a little west of the Petrides School Complex. This abandoned interchange was removed as part of a $140 million overhaul of the Expressway.Yates, Maura (February 7, 2010) \\"Major surgery planned for Staten Island Expressway\\" Staten Island Advance 1980s expansion In 1982, of city- owned land, which heretofore had belonged to the New York City Farm Colony, were added to the Greenbelt; this tract is located on the north side of Rockland Avenue, from Brielle Avenue almost to Forest Hill Road. In 1984, the Staten Island Greenbelt was officially recognized by the city, becoming one of the largest natural areas within the five boroughs of New York City and the second largest park in the city, behind Pelham Bay Park.

She was sunk as a target in 2000 off the East Coast of the United States near Maryland.  History  Dale was named in honor of Commodore Richard Dale (1756–1826). She was built at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, USA and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 23 November 1963. Her sponsor was Mrs. Daniel J. Flood. Assigned to Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force Pacific Fleet, she made five deployments to the Western Pacific over the next seven years. Between 1965 and 1970, Dales Seventh Fleet tours included participation in Vietnam War operations, during which she rescued several American aviators in the Gulf of Tonkin.  1970s  On 10 November 1970 Dale was decommissioned and began modernization at Bath, Maine to increase flexibility in combat systems. This work fitted her with the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) and other improvements that enhanced her anti-air and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. When recommissioned on 11 December 1971, Dale was assigned to Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet and homeported in Newport, Rhode Island. In Dales first Mediterranean deployment in June 1973, she participated in the multinational exercise \\"Swift Move\\" in northern European Waters, and helped augment the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean during the tense period of U.S.-Soviet relations that accompanied the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. In February 1974, Dale moved to her new homeport in Mayport, Florida. During 1974, Dale was selected as the operational platform for the newly deployed AN/SPS-49 two dimensional air search radar, which took Dale to the Caribbean several times during 1974 and early 1975. Dale was reclassified as a guided-missile cruiser (CG-19) at the beginning of July 1975. In October 1975, Dale deployed to the Mediterranean, participating successfully in several national and multinational exercises and earning praise from Commander, Sixth Fleet and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe on her departure for home. In July 1976, she helped represent the U.S. Navy during the Bicentennial Naval Review in New York Harbor. Then, Dale began a regular 12-month overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard which upgraded Dales NTDS and missile fire control systems. Upon the completion of the overhaul, the cruiser returned to Mayport. In June 1978, Dale deployed to the Mediterranean, participating successfully in several national and multinational exercises returning home February 1979. In September 1979, Dale deployed to the North Atlantic for two months to serve as the flagship for the Commander Striking Force Atlantic Fleet for the NATO exercise \\"Ocean Safari.\\"  1980s  In January and February 1980, Dale participated in the Atlantic Fleet Readiness Exercise \\"READEX 1-80.\\" Dale deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in March 1980 and, as a unit of the Sixth Fleet, served as flagship for Commander-Destroyer Group Eight. A highlight of this deployment was entering the Black Sea to visit Constanța, Romania. Dale returned to Mayport in August 1980. The remainder of the year included two trips to the Caribbean for carrier support operations and participations in \\"COMPUTEX/ASWEX 1-81.\\" Dale entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard in March 1981 to begin a Baseline Overhaul to update the ship's combat weapons systems and overhaul major engineering equipment. During the overhaul, which Dale completed a month early in February 1982, the 3 inch/50 caliber gun mounts were replaced with Harpoon surface-to-surface guided missiles and the Phalanx gun system to the port and starboard sides. Dale completed Refresher Training in June 1982. USS Dale (CG-19) anchored off Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, on 25 December 1982 Dale deployed December 1982 to the Mediterranean. After port visits in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France and Athens, Greece, Dale transited the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. While in the Indian Ocean the vessel made port visits to Karachi, Pakistan; Trincomalee, Sri Lanka; and, Mombasa, Kenya. As the guided missile cruiser was headed to Diego Garcia, she crossed the equator on 26 February 1983 and again on 12 April 1983–344 people became Shellbacks. On the morning of 27 April 1983, Dale was conducting tactical maneuvers with other ships of the U.S. and British fleets. During the course of the exercise, the British frigate http://www.ambuscade.org.uk/Amb_Collision01-1.htm collided with Dales port quarter. Resulting in serious damage to the Ambuscade's bow and enough damage to have the Dale Dry docked when she returned to Jacksonville Florida. A team was flown in from USS America to help R and First Divisions make satisfactory repairs, enough to keep her seaworthy and to get her to the Mediterranean. Finishing touches would be completed while re- transiting the Suez Canal on her way to the Indian Ocean. Dale re-transited the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. The cruiser's last port call was Málaga, Spain before heading back to United States of America in June 1983. During the 1980s her Mediterranean tours were sometimes extended to take her into the increasingly important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf regions. In 1986 she took part in the confrontation with Libya. Dale received an extensive overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard which included the New Threat Upgrade combat systems enhancement. Dale entered the yard January 1987 and completed the overhaul June 1988. Dale deployed with the battle group to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean on 11 May 1989 and returned to Mayport 10 November 1989.  1990s  Dale spent much of her final years of service on counter-narcotics patrols in the Caribbean area, and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as on regular cruises with the Sixth Fleet. During 1991 she went to the Red Sea to help enforce sanctions against Iraq after Operation Desert Storm. She had similar duties in 93, in support of United Nations' Resolutions concerning Bosnia and Yugoslavia.  Fate  The USS Dale was decommissioned in September 1994, at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. She made her way to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at some point in June of 1999. She was then towed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in December of 1999 to participate in \\"CG-19 Weapons Effect Test (WET)\\". On December 17, 1999 a 500lb SLAM-ER missile detonated in the aft portion of the ship. Then on January 13, 2000, an F/A-18 Hornet pilot fired a tactical SLAM-ER and made a direct hit to the forward starboard side of the ship. She was then towed back to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads for evaluation. Ultimately, she was sent back out once more and on 6 April 2000 was sunk as a target off the East Coast near Maryland: 037° 35' 59.0\\" North / 070° 45' 04.0\\" West... 2,150 Fathoms or 12,900 feet, and 485 feet lower than the RMS Titanic.

Its most likely mechanism of action is activation of intracellular protein kinases in response to the binding of membrane-impermeable peptide hormones to the external cell surface.  Synthesis  Guanylate cyclase (GC) catalyzes cGMP synthesis. This enzyme converts GTP to cGMP. Peptide hormones such as the atrial natriuretic factor activate membrane-bound GC, while soluble GC (sGC) is typically activated by nitric oxide to stimulate cGMP synthesis. sGC can be inhibited by ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1- Functions cGMP is a common regulator of ion channel conductance, glycogenolysis, and cellular apoptosis. It also relaxes smooth muscle tissues. In blood vessels, relaxation of vascular smooth muscles lead to vasodilation and increased blood flow. cGMP is a secondary messenger in phototransduction in the eye. In the photoreceptors of the mammalian eye, the presence of light activates phosphodiesterase, which degrades cGMP. The sodium ion channels in photoreceptors are cGMP-gated, so degradation of cGMP causes sodium channels to close, which leads to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor's plasma membrane and ultimately to visual information being sent to the brain. cGMP is also seen to mediate the switching on of the attraction of apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in cortical layer V towards semaphorin-3A (Sema3a). Whereas the axons of pyramidal cells are repelled by Sema3a, the apical dendrites are attracted to it. The attraction is mediated by the increased levels of soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) that are present in the apical dendrites. SGC generates cGMP, leading to a sequence of chemical activations that result in the attraction towards Sema3a. The absence of SGC in the axon causes the repulsion from Sema3a. This strategy ensures the structural polarization of pyramidal neurons and takes place in embryonic development. cGMP, like cAMP, gets synthesized when olfactory receptors receive odorous input. cGMP is produced slowly and has a more sustained life than cAMP, which has implicated it in long-term cellular responses to odor stimulation, such as long-term potentiation. cGMP in the olfactory is synthesized by both membrane guanylyl cyclase (mGC) as well as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Studies have found that cGMP synthesis in the olfactory is due to sGC activation by nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter. cGMP also requires increased intracellular levels of cAMP and the link between the two second messengers appears to be due to rising intracellular calcium levels.  Degradation  Numerous cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) can degrade cGMP by hydrolyzing cGMP into 5'-GMP. PDE 5, -6 and -9 are cGMP- specific while PDE1, -2, -3, -10 and -11 can hydrolyse both cAMP and cGMP. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors prevent the degradation of cGMP, thereby enhancing and/or prolonging its effects. For example, Sildenafil (Viagra) and similar drugs enhance the vasodilatory effects of cGMP within the corpus cavernosum by inhibiting PDE 5 (or PDE V). This is used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. However, the drug can inhibit PDE6 in retina (albeit with less affinity than PDE5). This has been shown to result in loss of visual sensitivity but is unlikely to impair common visual tasks, except under conditions of reduced visibility when objects are already near visual threshold. This effect is largely avoided by other PDE5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil. role of PKG in cellular system  Protein kinase activation  cGMP is involved in the regulation of some protein-dependent kinases. For example, PKG (protein kinase G) is a dimer consisting of one catalytic and one regulatory unit, with the regulatory units blocking the active sites of the catalytic units. cGMP binds to sites on the regulatory units of PKG and activates the catalytic units, enabling them to phosphorylate their substrates. Unlike with the activation of some other protein kinases, notably PKA, the PKG is activated but the catalytic and regulatory units do not disassociate.

It was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday from 1981 to 1986. The manga has been adapted into a 101-episode anime television series – which was one of the highest-rated anime television series ever, three theatrical anime movies which summarized the TV series, two anime television specials which take place after the events in the TV series, a live-action TV drama special, and a live-action movie released in 2005. Touch has sold over 100 million copies, making it one of the best-selling manga series. In 1983, it was one of the winners of the Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen and shōjo categories, along with Adachi's other work Miyuki. Synopsis Touch follows twin brothers Tatsuya and Kazuya Uesugi, along with their childhood friend and nextdoor neighbor Minami Asakura. Tatsuya, a naturally gifted athlete whose raw skills exceeds Kazuya’s, has always allowed his hard-working younger brother take the spotlight, but as the two of them near high school with Minami, Tatsuya realizes that perhaps he doesn’t want to lose Minami to his brother after all. When Kazuya is struck in a traffic accident on the morning before the final game of the regional tournament, Tatsuya takes over his brother’s position of ace pitcher, and utilizes his natural talent to complete his younger brother’s goal of fulfilling Minami’s dream of going to the Koshien. Characters ; : The main character. The elder of the Uesugi twins, seemingly selfish and lazy, he is actually very altruistic and reluctant to compete against others, especially his brother, Kazuya. A naturally talented athlete, he could be successful in baseball or most sports if he put in the effort but lets his younger brother succeed in his place. Like Kazuya, he loves Minami Asakura, the girl next door and their childhood friend, but initially cedes this relationship to his brother as well. When Tatsuya starts high school he nearly joins the baseball club but, when he hears that Minami has joined as the club manager, he can't go through with it. Instead, Harada cons him into joining the boxing club with him. Played by: Shota Saito, Tatsuki Shibuya (young) ; : The younger of the Uesugi twins. Serious, hard working, and seemingly confident in everything he does, he seems to be the complete opposite of his older brother, Tatsuya. His pitching skills, perfect manners, and perfect grades makes him the idol of his parents, his schoolmates, and the neighborhood. He and everyone else sees himself and Minami as the perfect couple who will eventually marry. He strives to lead Meisei to win the prefectural tournament and advance to the national tournament at the Koushien, fulfilling a childhood promise to take Minami there. Though he projects an image of confidence he is actually always wary of his brother, knowing that, if Tatsuya tried, he could be a better athlete than he is and also steal Minami away. Played by: Keita Saito, Itsuki Shibuya (young) ; : The Uesugi twins' neighbor and childhood friend. A responsible, attractive, athletic and intelligent student who also has to help her father with house chores and at the family coffee shop since her mother died at a young age. Her interests match up more with Kazuya, whom she cares for very deeply and supports completely on his road to the Koushien, but her heart mainly lies with Tatsuya. Like Kazuya, she sees Tatsuya's true potential and kind heart. Although she wishes to focus on being the baseball team's manager, she is eventually convinced to join the school's rhythmic gymnastics team and becomes a star athlete on her own. Played by: Masami Nagasawa ; ; : Tatsuya and Kazuya's parents. Always seen flirting and teasing each other despite the boys' presence. Mr. Uesugi sometimes puts on a straight face, usually to tell off Kazuya but soon turns back to teasing with his wife. Mrs. Uesugi is always seen smiling, sometimes giggling behind her hand. They live very carefree lives, often at the cost of their sons. (Shingo) , (Haruko) Played by: Fumiyo Kohinata ; :Punch is the Uesugi family Samoyed. She has puppies in part 2 of the manga. In the anime, Punch is a male dog and the puppies are instead adopted strays. ; : Minami's father and owner of the Minami Kaze (\\"South/Southern Wind\\") coffee shop. A widower, his wife died when Minami was very young but he remains faithful to her, never interested in remarrying. Despite this, he maintains an upbeat, positive attitude, looking forward to the day he believes Minami and Kazuya will marry. For a while, he also employs Tatsuya part-time and sees what a good worker he can be. Played by: Shin Takuma ; : Meisei's portly catcher and clean-up hitter. He is Kazuya's best friend and is always paired with him. Initially, he is vehemently against Tatsuya joining the baseball team but eventually warms to him and becomes as close to him as he was to Kazuya. He occasionally expresses his jealousy of his friends' greater talent and ability to attract Minami and other girls. Played by: Shinsuke Hiratsuka ; : A big, intimidating schoolmate at Meisei. Introduced as a street brawler and bully, he actually proves to be kindhearted and very loyal to his friends, especially to Tatsuya and Minami, who he often gives sound advice to on various matters. He is a member, and eventual captain, of the boxing club and initially had Tatsuya join him, forcing him to toughen up and exercise. Played by: Rikiya ; : A star slugger for Sumi Tech, the two time winner of the prefectural tournament and runner-up at Koshien. Akio became seriously devoted to baseball when he played against Kazuya in middle school. He has a crush on Minami and is a friend of Harada's from junior high, when they were both delinquents. After Kazuya dies he wants Tatsuya to take his place and show him \\"Kazuya's pitches\\" again. Played by: Seiji Fukushi ; : Akio's little sister, she is unusually close to her brother, and somewhat childish besides. She enters Meisei under the pretense of spying for her brother but really is there to try to seduce Tatsuya into being her boyfriend. She is very good at observing and analyzing baseball players. Despite her bratty behavior, she is also a very good student who scores even higher in history exams than Sakata. ; : A somewhat conceited pitcher who refuses to acknowledge Tatsuya's skills and considers Akio Nitta to be his true rival. He has the best curve ball of any pitcher in their prefecture but no one will rise to his boasting. He also has a crush on Minami and constantly asks her out on dates. Due to overusing his curve ball he suffers damages his elbow and can no longer effectively pitch in his final tournament. ; : Coach of the Meisei High team. He becomes ill in the brothers' senior year, and must stay in the hospital throughout the prefectural tournament. He assigns an interim coach, Eijiro Kashiwaba, to fill his position, touting him as a \\"kind, gentle man who loves baseball from the bottom of his heart,\\" unaware that he had gotten him confused with his elder brother, the more popular Eiichirō. Coach Nishio returns at the end of the prefectural tournament. ; : A brutal and spartan substitute coach that fills in while Coach Nishio is ill. Nishio meant to recommend his brother, Eiichirō, but either he or the school got the names mixed up. On his first day, he fires Minami as manager and ruthlessly beats Tatsuya. His training consists of further beatings, humiliation, and working the players beyond exhaustion. Most first year members of the team quickly resigned. He holds a grudge against Meisei's baseball team because of some events that occurred when he attended. He also compares the Uesugi twins' relationship to his own poor relationship with his own brother. ; : Daughter of Coach Nishio, girlfriend of Kuroki, and early manager for the Meisei High team. Early on, she mistakes Tatsuya for Kazuya and recognizes his athletic ability, encouraging him to join the team as well. ; : Upperclassman of Kazuya who initially scouts him and finds his pitching so incredible that he unselfishly gives up his position as Meisei's ace the following year. He moves to third base and becomes team captain. He and his girlfriend Sachiko see talent in Tatsuya as well as Kazuya, and try to get him to join the team, especially after Kazuya dies. Played by: Fuuma Uehara ; : Transfer student to Meisei High who initially idolizes Tatsuya. He joins the team in their second year to be close to him and to try to gain self confidence. As his skills increase as a pitcher, being able to effectively mimic both Tasuya's fastball and Nishimura's curve ball with great control, he grows from confident to over-confident, conceited, and condescending. He challenges Tatsuya in a pitching contest for the ace position but before the duel can be held he has to move to South America due to his father's job. He returns in his third year as a cocky and ill-mannered pitcher of another team to play a game against Meisei. → ; : : In the same class as Yuka Nitta and top student of their year. Despite being timid and not athletic, he joins the team and sticks with it even after the majority of the other new students quit. He falls in love with Yuka and tenaciously tries to win her affection. ; :The brother of Eijirō, and the one who Coach Nishio thought he was hiring. He might not be the model baseball hero that many believe him to be. Media=Manga Vol.14 of the 1999 - 2000 Touch bunkoban, showing Tatsuya and Minami. The series was collected in 26 tankōbon volumes.

It is included in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, TSC's FLEX, Digital Research/Novell DR DOS, the AROS shell, the Microware OS-9 shell, and ReactOS. The command is also available for FreeDOS and Microsoft Windows. Overview In its default usage, it is the equivalent of creating or opening a file and saving it without any change to the file contents. \`touch\` avoids opening, saving, and closing the file. Instead it simply updates the dates associated with the file or directory. An updated access or modification date can be important for a variety of other programs such as backup utilities or the make command-line interface programming utility. Typically these types of programs are only concerned with files which have been created or modified after the program was last run. The \`touch\` command can also be useful for quickly creating files for programs or scripts that require a file with a specific name to exist for successful operation of the program, but do not require the file to have any specific content. The Single Unix Specification (SUS) specifies that \`touch\` should change the access times, modification times, or both, for a file. The file is identified by a pathname supplied as a single argument. It also specifies that if the file identified does not exist, the file is created and the access and modification times are set as specified. If no new timestamps are specified, \`touch\` uses the current time. History A \`touch\` utility first appeared in Version 7 AT&T; UNIX. Today, the command is available for a number of different operating systems, including many Unix and Unix-like systems, DOS, Microsoft Windows and the classic Mac OS. The version of \`touch\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Paul Rubin, Arnold Robbins, Jim Kingdon, David MacKenzie, and Randy Smith. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The FreeDOS version was developed by Kris Heidenstrom and is licensed under the GPL. DR DOS 6.0DR DOS 6.0 User Guide Optimisation and Configuration Tips and KolibriOS include an implementation of the command. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

CL can also be used to create CL programs (congruent to shell scripts) where there are additional commands that provide program-like functionality (IF/ELSE, variable declaration, file input, etc.) Although CL is a scripting language for system administration, it is used mainly to create compiled programs. The use of interpreted CL scripts through the SBMDBJOB command itjungle.com is in fact extremely limited. While thousands of commands were written by IBM developers to perform system level tasks like compiling programs, backing up data, changing system configurations, displaying system object details, or deleting them, commands are not limited to systems level concerns and can be drafted for user applications as well. Commands and programs Parameters (command- line arguments) defined in the main procedures of all traditional AS/400 programs are hard coded lists that are made up of parameters that can be numeric, alphanumeric, boolean, etc. and the order in which parameters are passed is important. This is a stark difference from the Unix and DOS worlds where the parameter list in Unix shell scripts and C programs is a set or array of character pointers and more often than not the parameters are not positionally dependent. The AS/400 developer's solution to this problem was the command object (*CMD). While the parameters on the command can be specified in any order, each parameter is defined to be passed in a specific order to the program. The programmer can also define, among other things, the parameter's data type, unique parameter name, descriptive text (for prompting), default value (used only if the parameter isn't specified during execution), if the values are restricted to a certain set or range, if the data entered should be changed to another value before calling the program, etc. At its most basic a command names a single program to call when the user types or prompts the command and presses the Enter key. The command takes all of the parameters typed by the user, and those not typed by the user, and builds a parameter list that it passes to the program when it's called. Syntax The BNF for a much simplified CL command syntax would be defined as follows: ::= command-name [] [] ::= [] ::= parameter-name \\"(\\" \\")\\" [] ::= [] ::= CL-name  qualified-CL-name  \\"*\\"special-value  generic-CL-name\\"*\\"  \\"'\\"alphanumeric-value\\"'\\"  numeric-value  \\"X'\\"hexadecimal-value\\"'\\" The items above that end in -name follow AS/400 object naming conventions which, generally speaking, means the name starts with a letter and can be up to ten characters in length. (CL commands are also case-insensitive.) A good example of a typical CL command is the Change Program (CHGPGM) command below: CHGPGM MYPGM OPTIMIZE(*FULL) RMVOBS(*BLKORD *PRCORD) TEXT('My program.') The above command is passing four parameters to the program that does Change Program processing and they are: * MYPGM: A positional parameter (PGM), and the only required parameter. In this case it's the name of the program being changed. Positional parameters are always first. Once a named parameter appears all parameters that follow must be named parameters. * OPTIMIZE(*FULL): A named parameter specifying a single element which is a special value. In this case it will change the program to be fully optimized. * RMVOBS(*BLKORD *PRCORD): A named parameter (Remove Observability) specifying multiple special values. In this case telling it to remove two kinds of profiling data from the program. * TEXT('My program.'): Another named parameter specifying a single alphanumeric value. In this case it's changing the descriptive text of the program. In reality the AS/400 will pass many more parameters than the four specified above. This is because the rest of the CHGPGM command's parameters were not specified, so default values will be passed instead. For every parameter on this, aside from the PGM parameter, that default is *SAME, meaning don't change it. Prompting All AS/400 commands can be prompted directly from the command line or within CL program source by typing the command and pressing the F4 function key. An OS/400 command can also be prompted by typing a ? before the command. (This is useful in an interactive program which cues a command string, having already filled in some values.) The system will then present a screen with the set of parameters that the program accepts/requires (required parameters are usually highlighted). Required parameters are listed first, and parameters with system-supplied default values are listed last of all. To see all parameters, press F10. If any one choice requires further selections, those are cued as you select that value for that parameter, by appearing onscreen. Prompting is further enhanced to allow the programmer to find what values are valid for each parameter. To do this during prompting the user would move the cursor to the parameter field in question and press F4 again. The system would then display a screen describing the type of input required and an available list of allowable values. To enter a longer name, or extend the list to allow you to enter extra values, type a plus sign instead of a value. (As when listing names of objects to be saved or restored.) Command help Cursor sensitive help can also be provided on AS/400 commands but it's not required. If help has been provided one can view help for a parameter by moving the cursor to the desired parameter field and pressing F1 (help). To get help for the entire command itself (and all of its parameters) the user would press F1 anywhere on the prompt display and then press F2 (extended help). Creating new commands New commands can be created to call non-system programs and they will work exactly like the AS/400 variety. The Command Definition Language is described in the CL Programmer's Guide. It's a good idea to create help screens for new commands and their parameters. All help screens use Panel Group objects (*PNLGRP) and these can be created using the UIM language described in the IBM AS/400 Application Display Programming manual. Beginning in V5R3 of the operating system a new, much simpler method of creating help was added: run the command GENCMDDOC CMD(MYLIB/MYCMD) TODIR('/QSYS.LIB/MYLIB.LIB/QPNLSRC.FILE) GENOPT(*UIM) A skeleton UIM panel group will be automatically generated including all parameters described by the command. The result file can be edited (seu, wdsc, rdi), then compiled with the CRTPNLGRP command, and finally associated with the command via CHGCMD HLPPNLGRP(). Finding the right command There are 2,262 built-in IBM commands contained in V7R3,IBM.com but finding them isn't all that hard because of several designs of the system that make life easier. These labor saving designs are: Standardized Abbreviations, Command Grouping Menus, and Command Selection. Standardized abbreviations The AS/400 developers standardized the abbreviations used to create command names. Verbs like change are always rendered as CHG, display as DSP, work as WRK, create as CRT, etc. Subjects like program are always PGM, user is USR, module is MOD, server is SVR, etc. You can see every possible verb and subject used on the AS/400 in the VERB and SUBJECT menus, just enter the commands GO VERB or GO SUBJECT. Likewise, \\"Control Language Programming\\" was abbreviated CLP, and the source type was accordingly CLP. With the introduction of the ILE programming model, the source type was changed to \\"CLLE\\". Command grouping menus The VERB and SUBJECT menus are part of what are called the Command Grouping Menus. For every Three (or four) Letter abbreviation there is a menu devoted to it that starts with the letters CMD. So to see all CHG commands the user would execute the command GO CMDCHG. For program commands the menu would be CMDPGM. There are other menus besides the Command Grouping Menus. The starting point for the menuing system can be accessed by pressing F4 on an empty command line. Command selection If one only knows part of a command or if third party software is being used where the commands don't conform to the AS/400 abbreviation standard then you would enter that part of the command that is known, attach an asterisk (to make it generic), and press enter. The system will then display a list of commands in the job's library list that match the generic names just typed. One can then page through the list looking for the command needed and then select it using option 1. In the background the system is using the SLTCMD command to perform this function. If one wants to select all commands in a library then prompt this command and enter the special value *ALL. Sample code The following is a sample of CL programming. The program interactively converts dates from Julian to MDY and vice versa. Results are displayed on line 24 of the terminal. It accepts two parameters. The \`&IN;\` parameter which is the date string to be converted. If a Julian string it should be in the format YYNNN where YY is the year number and NNN is the day number of the year. If a MDY string it must be in the format MMDDYY. The second parameter is \`&TYP;\` which is the type of date to be converted to. It must be 'J' (Julian) or 'M' (MDY). For example: the command \`CALL PGM(ICVTDATC) PARM('04180' 'M')\` will convert the Julian date 04180 to 062804 (June 28, 2004).

It contains one high school and eight other schools, and has been home to many notable people. The neighborhood is centered on the lake of the same name. History The area now known as Echo Park n 1894. Echo Park Lake is at the top left. Glendale Blvd. is marked as Lake Shore Ave. Temple-Beaudry district is at the right center. Edendale First established in 1892, and long before \\"Hollywood\\" became synonymous with the commercial film industry, the area of Echo Park known as Edendale was the center of filmmaking on the West Coast. By the 1910s, several film studios were operating on Allesandro Avenue (now Glendale Boulevard) along the Echo Park-Silverlake border, including the Selig Polyscope Company, Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, the Pathe West Coast Film Studio, and others. Several silent film stars worked in the Edendale studios, including Mabel Normand, Fatty Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd, and Gloria Swanson. Charlie Chaplin's first film was made at Keystone Studios, as well as the very first feature-length comedy ever made, which starred Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand. The first pie-in- the-face scene was filmed at what later became the Mack Sennett Studios on Glendale Boulevard near Effie Street. The complex, which is now part of a storage facility, dates from 1909 and includes one of the area's first permanent sound stages, the factories where movies are made. The former studio, 1712 Glendale Boulevard, is City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 256. Echo Park Lake Echo Park Lake's earliest use by the city was as a reservoir. The Los Angeles Canal and Reservoir Co. formed Reservoir No. 4 in 1868. The company obtained the water by digging a ditch that sent water flowing from the Los Angeles River — in the area now known as Los Feliz — along a zigzag path that emptied into the reservoir. In 1891 the four owners of the surrounding area gave up 33 acres (13 ha) of land to the city around the reservoir so that it could be used as a park. The city began work landscaping the park in October 1892. City parks superintendent Joseph Henry Tomlinson is recognized for coining the name of the new park, which later became the name of the neighborhood. He chose the name because of echoes he heard during the construction of Echo Park Lake in 1892. By 1895, the park and accompanying boathouse were completed. By the late 1910s, motion picture companies on Allesandro Street, now Glendale Boulevard, had been using the park as a filming location. City leaders responded by barring Keystone Studios, home of the Keystone Kops, from shooting any of its comedies at the lake, on the grounds that too many flowers were being trampled. Echo Park Lake was identified as an impaired body of water in 2006, and the city allocated $64.7 million to fund its cleanup and revitalization. The lake was closed off and drained in the summer of 2011 when renovation work began. The rehabilitation project tackled Echo Park Lake not only as a recreational body of water, but also as an important part of the Los Angeles ecosystem. Although Echo Park Lake is man-made, it is part of the local watershed. The lake reopened on June 5, 2013 after a $45 million renovation. Transportation Glendale Freeway termination = The Glendale Freeway (SR 2) was originally planned and constructed in 1959 to connect with the Hollywood Freeway (US-101) through the neighborhoods of Silver Lake and Echo Park, but terminates roughly northeast of its intended terminus at the Hollywood Freeway due to opposition from residents living and developers building on a hill that is now a private gated community called Hathaway Estates. In 1962, as a result of this local community opposition, the full build-out plan was rescinded and construction was terminated at the present SR-2 terminus near Glendale Bl and Duane Street. Since then, commuter traffic exiting and entering on to SR-2 has passed through the community, primarily along Glendale Bl and Alvarado Street, which has contributed to congestion. Since that plan has been scrapped, the freeway is somewhat isolated from the remainder of the Los Angeles freeway system. =Pacific Electric Railway= The Pacific Electric Railway, better known as the Red Cars, used to run through Echo Park along the center of Glendale Boulevard. The citywide system of electric trolleys began with the dawn of the 20th century, ultimately spinning a web of rail that linked cities in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It was the largest and most advanced public transit system in the world at the time. The Red Car system was sold to Metropolitan Coach Lines, whose executive, Jesse Haugh, had connections to a public transportation company funded by General Motors and other auto-related industries. The Red Cars faded out of service not long afterwards, with the Los Angeles-Glendale-Burbank Line that traveled through Echo Park officially ending service on June 19, 1955.  Gangs  Echo Park has been infamous as being a hot spot for gang activity. This was true in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the early 2010s as the neighborhood began gentrifying, rents started to skyrocket, and a controversial gang injunction forced gang members to move outside their turf, instances of gang violence waned. In 2013, a Los Angeles judge signed off on a permanent gang injunction aimed at six rival gangs in the Echo Park area, creating what authorities call a \\"safety zone\\" for the area. The injunction targets the members of six gangs, namely Echo Park Locos, the Crazys, the Big Top Locos, the Diamond Street Locos, Frogtown Rifa, and Head Hunters. The perimeter for the safety zone is roughly bound by the Los Angeles River to the north, the 110 Freeway to the east, Beverly Boulevard to south and Glendale Boulevard to the west. It includes Echo Park Lake park and Dodger Stadium. The injunction, a civil order, prohibits two or more listed gang members from associating in any way in public or in common areas like courtyards. It also allows for stricter penalties if any listed gang member is caught with drugs, alcohol, guns or vandalizing property. Geography Echo Park has many rolling hills and valleys with a few flat areas like Echo Park Lake.  Location  According to the Los Angeles Times \\"Mapping L.A.\\" project, Echo Park is in Central Los Angeles, between Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. It is situated near the 101, the SR-2, and the Interstate 5 freeways. Echo Park is flanked by Elysian Valley to the north and northeast, Elysian Park to the east, Chinatown and Downtown to the southeast, Westlake to the southwest and west, and Silver Lake to the northwest. Boundaries are the Golden State Freeway–Glendale Freeway interchange at the north apex, Riverside Drive on the northeast, Elysian Park neighborhood on the east, Stadium Way and Beaudry Avenue on the southeast, the south apex being Beaudry Avenue and West Second Street and the west limit being an irregular line consisting of Second Street and Beverly Boulevard, then moving upward north along Benton Way and the Glendale Freeway.Thomas Guide, Los Angeles County, 2004, pages 594 and 634 Climate Being in the central part of Los Angeles, Echo Park experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). Temperatures here are almost identical to that of Downtown Los Angeles. Districts Within Echo Park are the following: =Angelino Heights= Angelino Heights is most notable for its Victorian era residences, although these are few in number. It lies at an elevation of 502 =Elysian Heights= Since the 1910s, Elysian Heights, along with Edendale, has been home to many of the counter-culture, political radicals, artists, writers, architects and filmmakers. The children of many progressives attended school there during the 1930s, '40s and '50s. =Historic Filipinotown= Historic Filipinotown makes up the southwest portion of Echo Park. It was created by a resolution proposed by then-City Councilmember Eric Garcetti on August 2, 2002. The district is bounded by the Hoover Street on the west to Glendale Boulevard on the east, Temple Street on the north and Beverly Boulevard on the south. =Temple-Beaudry or Central City West= Temple-Beaudry forms a triangle south of the Hollywood Freeway, east of Glendale Boulevard, and west of Beaudry. Settled in the late 1800s as a residential neighborhood, many of the residences were torn down as part of slum clearance in preparation for a high school, which was instead turned into Vista Hermosa Park, and in anticipations of the expansion of the Downtown business district west across the Harbor Freeway, for which some promoters used the term \\"Central City West\\" around 1990 for this area plus the area to its south, immediately west of the Harbor Freeway and as far south as Olympic Boulevard. =Victor Heights= Victor Heights lies between Chinatown, Los Angeles, and the central part of Echo Park, off Sunset Boulevard near the Pasadena Freeway below Elysian Park. One of its streets is the hilly Figueroa Terrace, where in 1992 a resident named Betty Oyama lived and helped popularized a name for Victor Heights as the \\"Forgotten Edge\\", because, as she said, the Police Department couldn't figure out where Victor Heights was exactly. In a feature story about Oyama's successful fight to form a Neighborhood Watch, a Los Angeles Times reporter said of Victor Heights that it was \\"a mix of new and old housing styles and [of] residents who span the socioeconomic and ethnic spectrums. New condominium complexes stand next to 1920s-era bungalow houses and old apartment buildings.\\"Iris Yokoi, \\"Chinatown/Echo Park: 'Forgotten Edge' Takes a Stand,\\" Los Angeles Times; March 27, 1994, page 7 In 2009 Victor Heights and its hilly streets were described as \\"a collection of stuccoed apartments and faded bungalows, a place with a lot of old-timers.\\" With its dramatic views of the Los Angeles Civic Center, Victor Heights had a population of \\"older Italians and Croatians who once dominated the area,\\" along with \\"newer Asian and Latino immigrants [and] a smattering of hipsters betting that Victor Heights will be the next big thing.\\" The area became known for the flock of peacocks and peahens, with their chicks, who had taken over parts of the district, often on Everett Street, where they gathered in the morning.Cara Nua DiMassa, \\"They're True-Blue Fans of Peacocks: West of Chinatown in Victor Heights, Locals Happily Abide Eggs on Awnings, Symphonies of Screeches, Mating Dances in Mid-Street,\\" Los Angeles Times, page A= Victor Heights is an old area. In 1887 \\"Choice lots, commanding a splendid view,\\" were being advertised for $1,200. Lesser lots went for $700 to $1,300. All had \\"Water piped through the street.\\"\\"Lots in Victor Heights Tract,\\" Los Angeles Herald, January 1, 1887, advertisement In 1908 its residents took a fight against disruptive dynamite blasting by the Los Angeles Brick Company in Chavez Ravine to the Los Angeles City Police Commission. They complained that the explosions were \\"cracking the plaster on their walls and causing their homes to settle to such an extent that they could not open their doors.\\"No Half Measures on Blasting Asked,\\" Los Angeles Herald, August 19, 1908, page 12 Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 40,455 residents in the 2.4-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 16,868 people per square mile, one of the highest densities in Los Angeles and among the highest densities for the county. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 43,832. The median age for residents was 30, about the same as the city norm. Echo Park was considered moderately diverse ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 64%; Asians, 18.8%; whites, 12.9%; blacks, 2%, and others, 2.3%. Mexico (41.3%) and El Salvador (15.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 53% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high compared to the city as a whole. The median household income in 2008 dollars was $37,708, a low figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $20,000 or less. The average household size of three people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 76% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners the rest. The percentages of never-married men and women, 46.8% and 38.3%, respectively, were among the county's highest. The 2000 census found 5,325 families headed by single parents, a high rate for both the city and the county. There were 1,034 military veterans in 2000, or 3.5%, a low figure for Los Angeles. Census data below for Echo Park is generally cited from only US Census District 1974.20 and does not include a large portion of what is geographically and culturally considered Echo Park. District boundaries shifted from 2000 to 2010 in most of the other contributing districts, so trends are not necessarily reliably reported by the data. It is also alleged that Echo Park and Hollywood are among the lowest responding areas to census polls. The 2010 US Census estimates that the neighborhood demographics for tract 1974.20 are as follows: Latinos still form the majority of the community, though the percentage fell from 69.8% in 2000 to 59.5% in 2010; Whites grew from 13.2% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2010; Asian population remained almost unchanged at 13.3% in 2010 compared to 13.2% in 2000; Other grew from 3.4% in 2000 to 4% in 2010. The number of people in the district shrank by almost 15% to around 3500 people. This represents less than 10% of the number of residents considered to live in Echo Park. The demographic shift from Latino to White is generally acknowledged as the overall trend in the area. Data collected by Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count in 2019 show that Echo Park's homeless population is 367 (0.008%). Parks and recreation=ParksElysian Park= The park is one of largest in Los Angeles at 600 acres (240 ha). It is also the city's oldest park, founded in 1886 by the Elysian Park Enabling Ordinance. Most of Elysian Park falls in the Eastern neighborhood of the same name, but a small portion of the park does fall in Echo Park. * Angels Point, a small hill in Elysian Park overlooking Dodger Stadium and the Downtown Los Angeles Skyline.

Lucien Laurin trained Secretariat, who won the Triple Crown in 1973. Life and career Laurin was born in Joliette, Quebec, Canada. His career in Thoroughbred horse racing began in 1929 as a jockey at Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal, Quebec. Battling weight problems, after riding 161 race winners, in 1942 he began working as a trainer in New England, a job that would span 45 years and take him to the pinnacle of horse racing success. While working for two different stables, he enjoyed a long and successful association with owner Reginald N. Webster. For Webster, Laurin trained a number of winners including Quill, the 1958 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, and Amberoid, who won the 1966 Wood Memorial Stakes and gave Laurin his first of six American Classics, the Belmont Stakes.Palm Beach Post - May 6, 1972 His son, Roger Laurin, worked as a trainer at Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stable and when Roger accepted an offer to work for Ogden Phipps, he suggested to Penny Chenery Tweedy that his father might help them on a temporary basis.William Nack (1975) Secretariat: The Making of a Champion (Originally published as Big Red of Meadow Stable) Da Capo, p.100. (pbk.) Coming out of retirement in 1971, Lucien Laurin went to work at the Meadow Stable for what was supposed to be a temporary period. At that time, the stable was having financial difficulties but things soon changed. With their colt, Riva Ridge, earning more than $500,000 and being named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1971, Lucien Laurin and the Meadow Stable would soon become the number one stable in racing, winning numerous important Stakes races and five of the six U.S. Triple Crown races in 1972-73. Under Lucien Laurin, Riva Ridge, with fellow Canadian jockey Ron Turcotte in the saddle, won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes. A heavy rainstorm muddied the track at Pimlico Race Course; otherwise the horse might have won the Triple Crown. For 1972, Lucien Laurin was named the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's Eclipse Award winner as North America's most outstanding trainer. However, despite this success, Laurin is best known as the trainer of Secretariat who was voted the 1972 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, and the 1972 and 1973 American Horse of the Year and who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in twenty-five years and the horse ranked #2 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. Lucien Laurin retired from racing a second time in 1976, but returned in 1983 as trainer and part owner of Evergreen Stable. In all, he trained a total of 36 stakes winners and was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1977National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame biography of Lucien Laurin and enshrined in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame the following year.Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame biography of Lucien Laurin Laurin died at Key Largo, Florida.

It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953. In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles. During World War II, Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi's creation of Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium began being produced in the Hanford Site reactors in 1945. After the war, Compton became Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. During his tenure, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions, named its first female full professor, and enrolled a record number of students after wartime veterans returned to the United States.  Early life  Arthur Compton and Werner Heisenberg in 1929 in Chicago Arthur Compton was born on September 10, 1892, in Wooster, Ohio, the son of Elias and Otelia Catherine (née Augspurger) Compton, who was named American Mother of the Year in 1939. They were an academic family. Elias was dean of the University of Wooster (later the College of Wooster), which Arthur also attended. Arthur's eldest brother, Karl, who also attended Wooster, earned a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in physics from Princeton University in 1912, and was president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1948. His second brother Wilson likewise attended Wooster, earned his PhD in economics from Princeton in 1916 and was president of the State College of Washington, later Washington State University from 1944 to 1951. All three brothers were members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Compton was initially interested in astronomy, and took a photograph of Halley's Comet in 1910. Around 1913, he described an experiment where an examination of the motion of water in a circular tube demonstrated the rotation of the earth. That year, he graduated from Wooster with a Bachelor of Science degree and entered Princeton, where he received his Master of Arts degree in 1914. Compton then studied for his PhD in physics under the supervision of Hereward L. Cooke, writing his dissertation on The Intensity of X-Ray Reflection, and the Distribution of the Electrons in Atoms. When Arthur Compton earned his PhD in 1916, he, Karl and Wilson became the first group of three brothers to earn PhDs from Princeton. Later, they would become the first such trio to simultaneously head American colleges. Their sister Mary married a missionary, C. Herbert Rice, who became the principal of Forman Christian College in Lahore. In June 1916, Compton married Betty Charity McCloskey, a Wooster classmate and fellow graduate. They had two sons, Arthur Alan Compton and John Joseph Compton. Compton spent a year as a physics instructor at the University of Minnesota in 1916–17, then two years as a research engineer with the Westinghouse Lamp Company in Pittsburgh, where he worked on the development of the sodium-vapor lamp. During World War I he developed aircraft instrumentation for the Signal Corps. In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson. For a time Compton was a deacon at a Baptist church. \\"Science can have no quarrel\\", he said, \\"with a religion which postulates a God to whom men are as His children.\\"  Career  Compton on the cover of Time magazine on January 13, 1936, holding his cosmic ray detector  Compton effect  Returning to the United States, Compton was appointed Wayman Crow Professor of Physics, and Head of the Department of Physics at Washington University in St. Louis in 1920. In 1922, he found that X-ray quanta scattered by free electrons had longer wavelengths and, in accordance with Planck's relation, less energy than the incoming X-rays, the surplus energy having been transferred to the electrons. This discovery, known as the \\"Compton effect\\" or \\"Compton scattering\\", demonstrated the particle concept of electromagnetic radiation. In 1923, Compton published a paper in the Physical Review that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to photons, something Einstein had invoked for his 1905 Nobel Prize–winning explanation of the photo-electric effect. First postulated by Max Planck in 1900, these were conceptualized as elements of light \\"quantized\\" by containing a specific amount of energy depending only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron. His paper concludes by reporting on experiments that verified his derived relation: :\\\\lambda' - \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\\\\cos{\\\\theta}), where :\\\\lambda is the initial wavelength, :\\\\lambda' is the wavelength after scattering, :h is the Planck constant, :m_e is the electron rest mass, :c is the speed of light, and :\\\\theta is the scattering angle. The quantity is known as the Compton wavelength of the electron; it is equal to . The wavelength shift lies between zero (for ) and twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for ). He found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron. Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10,000 times smaller. \\"When I presented my results at a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923,\\" Compton later recalled, \\"it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known.\\" The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons. In Germany, Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger independently developed a similar method.  X-rays  Luis Alvarez next to his cosmic ray telescope. In 1923, Compton moved to the University of Chicago as Professor of Physics, a position he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried out a series of experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case. Compton investigated the effect of X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it. Compton's first book, X-Rays and Electrons, was published in 1926. In it he showed how to calculate the densities of diffracting materials from their X-ray diffraction patterns. He revised his book with the help of Samuel K. Allison to produce X-Rays in Theory and Experiment (1935). This work remained a standard reference for the next three decades.  Cosmic rays  By the early 1930s, Compton had become interested in cosmic rays. At the time, their existence was known but their origin and nature remained speculative. Their presence could be detected using a spherical \\"bomb\\" containing compressed air or argon gas and measuring its electrical conductivity. Trips to Europe, India, Mexico, Peru and Australia gave Compton the opportunity to measure cosmic rays at different altitudes and latitudes. Along with other groups who made observations around the globe, they found that cosmic rays were 15% more intense at the poles than at the equator. Compton attributed this to the effect of cosmic rays being made up principally of charged particles, rather than photons as Robert Millikan had suggested, with the latitude effect being due to Earth's magnetic field.  Manhattan Project  Arthur Compton's ID badge from the Hanford Site. For security reasons he used a pseudonym. In April 1941, Vannevar Bush, head of the wartime National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), created a special committee headed by Compton to report on the NDRC uranium program. Compton's report, which was submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Enrico Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235, conservatively estimating it to be between and . He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey, spoke with Eugene Wigner about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible, although he was more conservative about its destructive power than Mark Oliphant and his British colleagues. The final draft of Compton's November report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. He hoped to achieve a controlled chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a bomb by January 1945. To tackle the problem, he had the different research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley, concentrated together as the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the nuclear weapons program and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of the Manhattan Project. That month, Compton gave Robert Oppenheimer responsibility for bomb design. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs that the Metallurgical Laboratory scientists had devised should be pursued, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. When labor disputes delayed construction of the Metallurgical Laboratory's new home in the Red Gate Woods, Compton decided to build Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, under the stands at Stagg Field. Under Fermi's direction, it went critical on December 2, 1942. Compton arranged for Mallinckrodt to undertake the purification of uranium ore, and with DuPont to build the plutonium semi-works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A major crisis for the plutonium program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium created in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Compton's house in Chicago, now a national landmark Compton was at the Hanford site in September 1944 to watch the first reactor being brought online. The first batch of uranium slugs was fed into Reactor B at Hanford in November 1944, and shipments of plutonium to Los Alamos began in February 1945. Throughout the war, Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator. In 1945, he served, along with Lawrence, Oppenheimer, and Fermi, on the Scientific Panel that recommended military use of the atomic bomb against Japan. He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services to the Manhattan Project.  Return to Washington University  After the war ended, Compton resigned his chair as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago and returned to Washington University in St. Louis, where he was inaugurated as the university's ninth Chancellor in 1946. During Compton's time as Chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton's accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for moving too slowly toward full racial integration, making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to African Americans. Compton retired as Chancellor in 1954, but remained on the faculty as Distinguished Service Professor of Natural Philosophy until his retirement from the full-time faculty in 1961. In retirement he wrote Atomic Quest, a personal account of his role in the Manhattan Project, which was published in 1956.  Philosophy  Compton was one of a handful of scientists and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935. Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of people's actions, Compton clarified the two- stage nature of his idea in an Atlantic Monthly article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice.  Death and legacy  The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory released into Earth's orbit in 1991 Compton died in Berkeley, California, from a cerebral hemorrhage on March 15, 1962. He was survived by his wife (who died in 1980) and sons. Compton is buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster, Ohio. Before his death, he was Professor-at-Large at the University of California, Berkeley for Spring 1962. Compton received many awards in his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927, the Matteucci Gold Medal in 1930, the Royal Society's Hughes Medal and the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal in 1940. He is commemorated in various ways. The Compton crater on the Moon is co-named for Compton and his brother Karl. The physics research building at Washington University in St Louis is named in his honor, as is the university's top fellowship for undergraduate students studying math, physics, or planetary science. Compton invented a more gentle, elongated, and ramped version of the speed bump called the \\"Holly hump,\\" many of which are on the roads of the Washington University campus. The University of Chicago Residence Halls remembered Compton and his achievements by dedicating Arthur H. Compton House in Chicago in his honor. It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark. Compton also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was named in honor of Compton. The Compton effect is central to the gamma ray detection instruments aboard the observatory.

While begun for practical reasons of identifying friendly units, the practice evolved to express the individuality often constrained by the uniformity of the military, to evoke memories of home and peacetime life, and as a kind of psychological protection against the stresses of war and the probability of death. The appeal, in part, came from nose art not being officially approved, even when the regulations against it were not enforced.Ethell, Jeffrey L. (1991). The History of Aircraft Nose Art: World War I to Today. Osceola, Wisconsin: Motorbooks International, p. 14. Because of its individual and unofficial nature, it is considered folk art, inseparable from work as well as representative of a group. It can also be compared to sophisticated graffiti. In both cases, the artist is often anonymous, and the art itself is ephemeral. In addition, it relies on materials immediately available. Nose art is largely a military tradition, but civilian airliners operated by the Virgin Group feature \\"Virgin Girls\\" on the nose as part of their livery. In a broad sense, the tail art of several airlines such as the Eskimo of Alaska Airlines can be called \\"nose art\\", as are the tail markings of present-day U.S. Navy squadrons. There were exceptions, including the VIII Bomber Command, 301st Bomb Group B-17F \\"Whizzer\\", which had its girl-riding-a-bomb on the dorsal fin.Bowers, Peter M. (1976). Fortress In The Sky, Granada Hills, CA: Sentry Books. , p. 219. History Count Francesco Baracca and his SPAD S.VII, with the cavallino rampante that inspired the Ferrari emblem Eddie Rickenbacker with SPAD XIII (note the \\"Hat in the Ring\\" 94th Aero Squadron insignia), France, 1918 Spad XIII pursuit aircraft of the 95th Aero Squadron with the \\"Kicking Mule\\" insignia, France, 1918 Placing personalized decorations on fighting aircraft began with Italian and German pilots. The first recorded example was a sea monster painted on an Italian flying boat in 1913. This was followed by the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the propeller's spinner begun by German pilots in World War I. What is perhaps the most famous of all nose art, the shark-face insignia later made famous by the First American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers, first appeared in World War I on a British Sopwith Dolphin and a German Roland C.II, though often with an effect more comical than menacing.Ward, Richard. Sharkmouth, 1916–1945. New York: Arco, 1979. The cavallino rampante (prancing horse) of the Italian ace Francesco Baracca was another well-known image. World War I nose art was usually embellished or extravagant squadron insignia. This followed the official policy established by the American Expeditionary Forces' Chief of the Air Service, Brigadier General Benjamin Foulois, on 6 May 1918, requiring the creation of distinct, readily identifiable squadron insignia. World War I examples include the \\"Hat in the Ring\\" of the American 94th Aero Squadron (attributed to Lt. Johnny Wentworth) and the \\"Kicking Mule\\" of the 95th Aero Squadron. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather by ground crews. Hell's Angels, the 3rd Squadron of the 1st American Volunteer Group \\"Flying Tigers\\", 28 May 1942 True nose art appeared during World War II, which is considered by many observers to be the golden age of the genre, with both Axis and Allied pilots taking part. At the height of the war, nose artists were in very high demand in the USAAF and were paid quite well for their services, while AAF commanders tolerated nose art in an effort to boost aircrew morale. (The U.S. Navy, by contrast, prohibited nose art, the most extravagant being limited to a few simply-lettered names, while nose art was uncommon in the RAF and RCAF.) The work was done by professional civilian artists as well as talented amateur servicemen. In 1941, for instance, the 39th Pursuit Squadron commissioned a Bell Aircraft artist to design and paint the \\"Cobra in the Clouds\\" logo on their aircraft. Perhaps the most enduring nose art of World War II was the shark-face motif, which first appeared on the Bf 110s of Luftwaffe 76th Destroyer Wing over Crete, where the twin-engined Messerschmitts outmatched the Gloster Gladiator biplanes of RAF 112 Squadron. The Commonwealth pilots were withdrawn to Egypt and refitted with Curtiss Tomahawks off the same assembly line building fighter aircraft for the American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers being recruited for service in China. In November 1941, AVG pilots saw a color photo in a newspaper of a shark mouth painted on a No. 112 Squadron RAF P-40 fighter in North Africa and immediately adopted the shark-face motif for their own P-40Bs. The British version itself was inspired by \\"sharkmouth\\" nose art (without any eyes) on the Bf 110 heavy fighters of ZG 76. This work was done by the pilots and ground crew in the field.Ford, Daniel. Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941–1942. Washington, DC: Harper Collins–Smithsonian Books, 2007, pp. 82–83. However, the insignia for the \\"Flying Tigers\\" – a winged Bengal Tiger jumping through a stylized V for Victory symbol – was developed by graphic artists from the Walt Disney Company.Eisel, Braxton. The Flying Tigers: Chennault's American Volunteer Group in China. Washington, DC: Air Force History and Museums Program, 2009. A-10 Thunderbolt II with shark mouth themed nose art, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, 2011 Similarly, when in 1943 the 39th Fighter Squadron became the first American squadron in their theatre with 100 kills, they adopted the shark-face for their P-38 Lightnings. The shark-face is still used to this day, most commonly seen on the A-10 Thunderbolt II (with its gaping maw leading up to the muzzle of the aircraft's GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon), especially those of the 23d Fighter Group, the AVG's descendent unit, and a testament to its popularity as a form of nose art. Witchcraft (s/n 44-44052) The largest known work of nose art ever depicted on a World War II-era American combat aircraft was on a B-24J Liberator, tail number 44-40973, which had been named \\"The Dragon and his Tail\\" of the USAAF Fifth Air Force 64th Bomb Squadron, 43d Bomb Group, in the Southwest Pacific, flown by a crew led by Joseph Pagoni, with Staff Sergeant Sarkis Bartigian as the artist. The dragon artwork ran from the nose just forward of the cockpit, down the entire length of the fuselage's sides, with the dragon's body depicted directly below and just aft of the cockpit, with the dragon holding a nude woman in its forefeet. Sgt. J.S. Wilson painting a bomber based at Eniwetok in June 1944 Tony Starcer was the resident artist for the 91st Bomb Group (Heavy), one of the initial six groups fielded by the Eighth Air Force. Starcer painted over a hundred pieces of renowned B-17 nose art, including \\"Memphis Belle\\". A commercial artist named Brinkman, from Chicago was responsible for the zodiac-themed nose art of the B-24 Liberator- equipped 834th Bomb Squadron, based at RAF Sudbury, England.Valant, Gary M. Classic Vintage Nose Art. Ann Arbor, Michigan: Lowe and B. Hould, 1997, pp. 13–15. Contemporary research demonstrates that bomber crews, who suffered high casualty rates during World War II, often developed strong bonds with the planes they were flying, and affectionately decorated them with nose art.Pfau, Ann Elizabeth. Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender and Domesticity During World War II. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Available at Gutenberg-e, a program of the American Historical Association and Columbia University Press: It was also believed by the flight crews that the nose art was bringing luck to the planes.Polmar, Norman, and Thomas B. Allen. World War II: The Encyclopedia of the War Years, 1941–1945. New York: Random House, 1996, p. 595. The artistic work of Alberto Vargas's pin-up girls from Esquire Magazine was often duplicated, or adapted, by air force crews and painted on the nose of American and allied aircraft during World War II. Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker, based with Sioux City Air National Guard, 2007. Some nose art was commemorative or intended to honor certain people, such as the B-29 Superfortress \\"The Ernie Pyle\\".Superfort \\"Ernie Pyle\\", Gift of Plane Plane Workers, Here En Route to Japan PDF In the Korean War, nose art was popular with units operating A-26 and B-29 bombers, C-119 Flying Boxcar transports, as well as USAF fighter-bombers.Thompson, Warren E. Heavy Hauler. Wings of Fame, The Journal of Classic Combat Aircraft, Volume 20. London: Aerospace Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 107. Due to changes in military policies and changing attitudes toward the representation of women, the amount of nose art declined after the Korean War. During the Vietnam War, AC-130 gunships of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Squadrons were often given names with accompanying nose art – for example, \\"Thor\\", \\"Azrael – Angel of Death\\", \\"Ghost Rider\\", \\"War Lord\\" and \\"The Arbitrator.\\"Olausson, Lars. Lockheed Hercules Production List – 1954–2011, 27th ed. Såtenäs, Sweden, 2009. (Self-published.) The unofficial gunship badge of a flying skeleton with a Minigun was also applied to many aircraft until the end of the war and was later adopted officially. Nose art underwent a revival during the Gulf War and has become more common since Operation Enduring Freedom and the Iraq War began. Many crews are merging artwork as part of camouflage patterns. The United States Air Force had unofficially sanctioned the return of the pin-up (albeit fully clothed) with the Strategic Air Command permitting nose art on its bomber force in the Command's last years. The continuation of historic names such as \\"Memphis Belle\\" was encouraged. Regional variation Source material for American nose art was varied, ranging from pinups such as Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable and cartoon characters such as Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Popeye to patriotic characters (Yankee Doodle) and fictional heroes (Sam Spade). Lucky symbols such as dice and playing cards also inspired nose art, along with references to mortality such as the Grim Reaper. Cartoons and pinups were most popular among American artists, but other works included animals, nicknames, hometowns, and popular song and movie titles. Some nose art and slogans imposed contempt to the enemy, especially to enemy leaders. The farther the planes and crew were from headquarters or from the public eye, the racier the art tended to be. For instance, nudity was more common in nose art on aircraft in the Pacific than on aircraft in Europe.Cohan, Phil. \\"Risque Business.\\" Air and Space, 5 (Apr.–May 1990), p. 65. \\"Sharkmouth\\" Bf 110C of ZG 76, May 1940 Luftwaffe aircraft did not often display nose art, but there were exceptions.Ketley, Barry. Luftwaffe emblems. Manchester: Flight Recorder Publications, 2012. For example, Mickey Mouse adorned a Condor Legion Bf-109 during the Spanish Civil War and one Ju 87A was decorated with a large pig inside a white circle during the same period. Adolf Galland's Bf-109E-3 of JG 26 also had a depiction of Mickey Mouse, holding a contemporary telephone in his hands, in mid-1941. A Ju 87B-1 (Geschwaderkennung of S2+AC) of Stab II/St. G 77, piloted by Major Alfons Orthofer and based in Breslau-Schöngarten (today Copernicus Airport Wrocław) during the invasion of Poland, was painted with a shark's mouth, and some Bf 110s were decorated with furious wolf's heads, stylistic wasps (as with SKG 210 and ZG 1), or as in the case of ZG 76, the very shark mouths that inspired both the RAF's 112 Squadron and in turn the Flying Tigers in China, on their noses or engine covers. Another example was Erich Hartmann's Bf-109G-14, \\"Lumpi\\", with an eagle's head. The fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 54 was known as the Grünherz (Green Hearts) after their fuselage emblem, a large green heart. The Geschwader was originally formed in Thüringen, nicknamed \\"the green heart of Germany\\". Perhaps the flashiest Luftwaffe nose art was the red and white viper snake insignia running through the whole fuselage of certain Ju 87 Stukas that served with the II Gruppe, and especially the 6. Staffel of StG 2 in North Africa, the only known artwork on an Axis-flown combat aircraft that could have rivaled the length of that on \\"The Dragon and his Tail\\" B-24. front portside view entire portside ground view. The Soviet Air Force also decorated their planes with historical images, mythical beasts, and patriotic slogans. The attitude of the Finnish Air Force to the nose art varied by unit. Some units disallowed nose art, while others tolerated it. Generally, the Finnish airforce nose art was humorous or satirical, such as the \\"horned Stalin\\" on Maj. Maunula's Curtiss P-36. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has decorated fighter aircraft with Valkyrie- themed characters under the names Mystic Eagle and Shooting Eagle. Beginning in 2011, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force has AH-1S Cobra anti-tank helicopters and Kawasaki OH-1 observation helicopter named Ita-Cobra and Ita- Omega respectively, decorated in the theme of 4 Kisarazu (木更津) sisters (Akane (木更津茜), Aoi (木更津葵), Wakana (木更津若菜), Yuzu (木更津柚子)). The Aoi-chan first appeared in 2011, followed by the other three sisters in 2012. Canadian Forces were reported having nose art on CH-47D Chinook and CH-146 Griffon helicopters in Afghanistan. Famous examples Adolf Galland was famous for painting Mickey Mouse on his aircraft, and the mascot was adopted by his Gruppe during the early airwar phase of World War II. Werner Mölders flew a yellow-nosed Bf 109F-2 while with JG 51 during June 1941. Other fighter aces and their nose art have become synonymous. * Don Gentile's P-51C named \\"Shangri-La\\", with an eagle sporting boxing gloves. * John D. Landers' P-51D, which sported a distinctive black-and-white checkerboard with red trim. * Chuck Yeager's series of aircraft named \\"Glamorous Glennis\\", with bright letter art. * Ian Gleed's Hurricanes and Spitfires featured Figaro the Cat, from the 1940 Disney animated movie Pinocchio. * Pierre Clostermann's Hawker Tempest Le Grand Charles featured the Cross of Lorraine. * Johnny Johnson's Spitfire IX featured the Canadian maple leaf. * Erich Hartmann's Bf 109s featured a distinctive \\"black tulip\\" design on the very front of the cowling, immediately behind the spinner. * James MacLachlan, who flew with an artificial arm, had his Hawker Hurricane adorned with a picture of his amputated arm giving a V sign * Brendan Finucane's Spitfires wore a shamrock with a \\"B\\" within it. Ireland's top ace in World War Two who also was the youngest wing commander in Royal Air Force history. The markings of aces were often adopted by their squadrons, such as Galland's Mickey Mouse and Hartmann's black tulip (still in use until recently on the aircraft of JG 71 \\"Richthofen\\" – not known to be in use on the unit's new Eurofighter Typhoons). Ted W. Lawson, who (along with journalist Bob Considine) famously wrote about the 1942 Doolittle Raid in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, piloted a B-25 Mitchell bomber nicknamed The Ruptured Duck, after a minor training accident in which the aircraft tail scraped the ground during takeoff; this was decorated by a caricature of an angry Donald Duck figure with crutches and wearing a pilot's headphones. Similar art Designs similar to aviation nose art could be found during World War II on some British torpedo boats, and German and US submarines.

It was founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981, with the help of Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, Charles Zegar, and a 12% ownership investment by Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg L.P. provides financial software tools and enterprise applications such as analytics and equity trading platform, data services, and news to financial companies and organizations through the Bloomberg Terminal (via its Bloomberg Professional Service), its core revenue-generating product. Bloomberg L.P. also includes a wire service (Bloomberg News), a global television network (Bloomberg Television), websites, radio stations (Bloomberg Radio), subscription-only newsletters, and two magazines: Bloomberg Businessweek and Bloomberg Markets. The company has 167 locations and nearly 20,000 employees. The company's director of global construction Anthony Gozzone took part in bribery between 2010-2017 in which he accepted bribes in exchanging for awarding construction work done for Bloomberg. Guzzone has accepted more than $5.1 million in bribes and he pleaded guilty to tax evasion on the bribes in September, 2020. History Bloomberg Terminal at London City Airport In 1981, Salomon Brothers was acquired, and Michael Bloomberg, a general partner, was given a $10million partnership settlement. Bloomberg, having designed in- house computerized financial systems for Salomon, used his $10million partnership buyout to start Innovative Market Systems (IMS). Bloomberg developed and built his own computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The Market Master terminal, later called the Bloomberg Terminal, was released to market in December 1982. Merrill Lynch became the first customer, purchasing 20 terminals and a 30% equity stake in the company for $30million in exchange for a five-year restriction on marketing the terminal to Merrill Lynch's competitors. Merrill Lynch released IMS from this restriction in 1984. In 1986, the company renamed itself Bloomberg L.P. (limited partnership). Within a few years, Bloomberg launched ancillary products including Bloomberg Tradebook (a trading platform) and the Bloomberg Messaging Service. Bloomberg launched Bloomberg Business News, later Bloomberg News, in 1990, with Matthew Winkler as editor-in-chief. Bloomberg.com was first established on September 29, 1993, as a financial portal with information on markets, currency conversion, news and events, and Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions. In late 1996, Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in the company for $200million, valuing the company at $2billion. In 2008, facing losses during the financial crisis, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in the company back to Bloomberg Inc., majority-owned by Michael Bloomberg, for a reported $4.43billion, valuing Bloomberg L.P. at approximately $22.5billion. Bloomberg L.P. has remained a private company since its founding; the majority of which is owned by billionaire Michael Bloomberg. To run for the position of Mayor of New York against Democrat Mark Green in 2001, Bloomberg gave up his position of CEO and appointed Lex Fenwick as CEO in his stead. in 2012, Peter Grauer became the chairman of the company, a role he still holds. In 2008, Fenwick became the CEO of Bloomberg Ventures, a new venture capital division and Daniel Doctoroff, former deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, was named president and CEO, serving until September 2014. At that point, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would be taking the reins of his eponymous market data company from Doctoroff, who was chief executive of Bloomberg for the past six years after his term as deputy mayor. In June 2019, Bloomberg extended its parental leave policy for primary caregivers from 18 to 26 weeks. Acquisitions Since its founding, Bloomberg L.P. has made several acquisitions including the radio station WNEW, BusinessWeek magazine, research company New Energy Finance, the Bureau of National Affairs and the financial software company Bloomberg PolarLake. On July 9, 2014, Bloomberg L.P. acquired RTS Realtime Systems, a global provider of low-latency connectivity and trading support services. On August 13, 2019, Bloomberg acquired RegTek.Solutions in a move to expand its suite of regulatory reporting and data management services. Bloomberg Radio (formerly WNEW) In 1992, Bloomberg L.P. purchased New York Radio station WNEW for $13.5million. The station was converted into an all-news format, known as Bloomberg Radio, and the call letters were changed to WBBR. Bloomberg Businessweek (formerly BusinessWeek) Bloomberg L.P. bought a weekly business magazine, BusinessWeek, from McGraw-Hill in 2009. The company acquired the magazine—which was suffering from declining advertising revenue and limited circulation numbers—to attract general business to its media audience composed primarily of terminal subscribers. Following the acquisition, BusinessWeek was renamed Bloomberg Businessweek. In 2018, Joel Weber was named editor of the magazine. New Energy Finance In 2009, Bloomberg L.P. purchased New Energy Finance, a data company focused on energy investment and carbon markets research based in the United Kingdom. New Energy Finance was created by Michael Liebreich in 2004, to provide news, data and analysis on carbon and clean energy markets. Bloomberg L.P. acquired the company to become an industry resource for information to support low-carbon energy development. It was renamed to Bloomberg New Energy Finance or BNEF for short. Liebreich continued to lead the company, serving as the chief executive officer until 2014, when he stepped down as CEO but remained involved as Chairman of the Advisory Board. The company has been renamed BloombergNEF — or BNEF for short. BloombergNEF has expanded its research areas to cover renewable energy, advanced transport, digital industry, innovative materials, sustainability and commodities. BNEF provides research, long-term forecasts, analytical tools and global in-depth analysis covering a wide range of energy and related industries. Analysts covering 6 continents publish more than 700 research reports a year. Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) Bloomberg L.P. purchased Arlington, Virginia-based Bureau of National Affairs in August 2011, for $990million to bolster its existing Bloomberg Government and Bloomberg Law services. BNA publishes specialized online and print news and information for professionals in business and government. The company produces more than 350 news publications in topic areas that include corporate law and business, employee benefits, employment and labor law, environment, health and safety, health care, human resources, intellectual property, litigation, and tax and accounting. Bloomberg PolarLake In May 2012, Bloomberg L.P. acquired Dublin-based software provider PolarLake and launched a new enterprise data management service to help companies acquire, manage and distribute data across their organizations. Barclays indices business On December 16, 2015, it was announced that Barclays had agreed to sell its index business, Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions Ltd (BRAIS), to Bloomberg L.P. for £520million, or about $787million. The company will be renamed Bloomberg Index Services Limited.  Bloomberg sports analysis  In September 2014, Bloomberg sold its Bloomberg Sports analysis division to the data analysis firm STATS LLC for a fee rumored to be between $15million and $20million.  CityLab  On December 10, 2019, Bloomberg Media announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire CityLab, The Atlantic’s award-winning news site for solutions-based journalism on urban innovation and the future of cities. This was Bloomberg's first acquisition of an editorial property by the news and financial data company in over a decade. Products and services=Bloomberg Professional Services In 2011, sales from the Bloomberg Professional Services, also known as the Bloomberg terminal, accounted for more than 85 percent of Bloomberg L.P.'s annual revenue. The financial data vendor's proprietary computer system, starting at $24,000 per user per year, allows subscribers to access the Bloomberg Professional service to monitor and analyze real-time financial data, search financial news, obtain price quotes and send electronic messages through the Bloomberg Messaging Service. The Terminal covers both public and private markets globally. Bloomberg News Bloomberg News was co-founded by Michael Bloomberg and Matthew Winkler in 1990, to deliver financial news reporting to Bloomberg terminal subscribers. In 2000, Bloomberg News included more than 2,300 editors and reporters in 100 countries. Content produced by Bloomberg News is disseminated through the Bloomberg terminal, Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg Markets and Bloomberg.com. Since 2015, John Micklethwait has served as editor-in-chief. Bloomberg RadioBloomberg Television Bloomberg Television, a service of Bloomberg News, is a 24-hour financial news television network. It was introduced in 1994, as a subscription service transmitted on satellite television provider DirecTV, 13 hours a day, 7 days a week. Soon after, the network entered the cable television market and by 2000, Bloomberg's 24-hour news programming was being aired to 200million households. Justin B. Smith serves as CEO of Bloomberg Multimedia Group which includes Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Television and online components of Bloomberg's multimedia offerings. Bloomberg Markets Bloomberg Markets is a monthly magazine launched in 1992, that provides in- depth coverage of global financial markets for finance professionals. In 2010, the magazine was redesigned in an effort to update its readership beyond Bloomberg terminal users. Michael Dukmejian has served as the magazine's publisher since 2009.  Bloomberg Pursuits  Bloomberg Pursuits was a bimonthly luxury magazine distributed exclusively to Bloomberg terminal users and to newsstands. It ceased publication in 2016. A digital edition and show on Bloomberg Television continue under the same name. Bloomberg Entity Exchange Bloomberg Entity Exchange is a web-based, centralised and secure platform for buy side firms, sell side firms, corporations and insurance firms, banks or brokers to fulfill Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance requirements. It was launched on May 25, 2016.

Leadership Bloomberg L.P.'s Management Committee includes Michael Bloomberg, Peter Grauer, and Thomas Secunda. Controversies= Turner Construction and Bloomberg LP construction scandal  Between 2010 and 2017, a \\"pay-to-play\\" scheme went along between two Turner Construction executives, two Bloomberg executives; and vendors and subcontractors involving interior construction at the Bloomberg offices including its headquarters at 731 Lexington Ave. In July 2020, Bloomberg's construction manager Michael Campana was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion on $420,000 in connection with accepting bribery. The bribery was in the form of cash, work on personal property, superbowl tickets and payment for Campana's wedding. On September 29, 2020, Anthony Guzzone, the Director of Global Construction at Bloomberg from 2010 and 2017, pleaded guilty to evading taxes on over $1.45 million he received in bribes from construction subcontractors in exchange for being awarded work performed for Bloomberg.  Lawsuits Olszewski v. Bloomberg L.P.= In 1996, former Bloomberg L.P. sales representative Mary Ann Olszewski sued the company, alleging that she was drugged and raped by her supervisor, Bryan Lewis, and claimed she was terminated shortly after reporting the incident in a May 25, 1995 meeting. The lawsuit also alleged the company internally investigated Olszewski, attempting to get coworkers to portray her as “flirtatious” or a “sex hound.” Olszewski also claimed that male employees at the company engaged in the “sexual degradation of women” and that the company “took no steps to prevent or curtail the ongoing sexual harassment of female employees by Michael Bloomberg.” Bloomberg, on behalf of Bloomberg L.P., testified that he was made aware of the rape allegation and offered to move Olszewski into another sales unit. Bloomberg also testified that he did not find Olszewski's allegation genuine because there was not \\"an unimpeachable third-party witness” present during the alleged event, elaborating that “there are times when three people are together.” The case was dismissed by a federal judge in 1999 after Olszewski's lawyer had ignored repeated deadlines to submit a response to a motion to end the case. The case was re-opened by another lawyer in 2000, but disappeared from the court docket in 2001. =Sekiko Sakai Garrison v. Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg L.P.= In 1997, former Bloomberg L.P. sales executive Sekiko Sakai Garrison filed a lawsuit against the company and Michael Bloomberg, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination. Garrison alleged that when she told Bloomberg that she was pregnant, he told her to \\"Kill it!\\" and said \\"Great! Number 16,\\" referring to the number of women in the company who were pregnant or on maternity leave at the time. According to the lawsuit, Garrison told a manager about the incident but was told to \\"forget it ever happened\\" before being fired. Garrison also claimed that Bloomberg told female salespeople to “line up to give him [oral sex] as a wedding present,” referring to a male employee who was getting married. The lawsuit also alleged that Bloomberg berated a female employee who had trouble finding a nanny, saying, “It’s a f------ baby! All it does is eat and s---! It doesn’t know the difference between you and anyone else! All you need is some black who doesn’t even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building!” The company did not admit any wrongdoing, but settled the lawsuit out of court in 2000. =EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P.= In September 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a class-action lawsuit against Bloomberg L.P. on behalf of more than 80 female employees who argued that Bloomberg L.P. engaged in discrimination against women who took maternity leave. In August 2011, Judge Loretta A. Preska of the Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the charges, writing that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not present sufficient evidence to support their claim. In September 2013, Preska dismissed an EEOC lawsuit on behalf of 29 pregnant employees of Bloomberg L.P. In addition, she dismissed pregnancy bias claims from five individual plaintiffs, and allowed part of the case from a sixth plaintiff to proceed. =Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve= Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve System (Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to force the Fed to share details about its lending programs during the U.S. Government bailout in 2008. The records documented Federal Reserve loans issued to financial firms and revealed the identities of the firms, the amounts borrowed and the collateral posted in return. Bloomberg L.P. won at the trial court level.Docket entry 31, Bloomberg, L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, case no. 1:08-cv-09595-LAP, U.S. District Court for the District of New York. The Second Circuit Court ruled in favor of Bloomberg L.P. in March 2010, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court by a group of large U.S. commercial banks in October. In March 2011, the Supreme Court let stand the Second Circuit Court ruling mandating the release of Fed bailout details. =Bloomberg L.P. v. Bloomberg Ltd= On October 22, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. applied for a change of name of Bloomberg Ltd, under s.69(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2006. Bloomberg L.P. then amended its name to Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. Bloomberg Ltd was ordered at the Company Names Tribunal on May 11, 2009, to change its name so as to not have a name that would likely interfere, by similarity, with the goodwill of Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. as well as to pay costs.Bloomberg LP v Bloomberg Ltd Retrieved September 18, 2014 = Nafeesa Syeed v. Bloomberg LP = According to a recent case in August 2020, Bloomberg LP is again being charged with discrimination against blacks, and against non-white workers. Nafeesa Syeed, who served at Bloomberg for around four years as a national security reporter and Middle East reporter, sued the corporation in New York city court for sexism based on her gender and her ethnicity as a South Asian-American. Bloomberg faces a related complaint by a former saleswoman, who filed under a pseudonym in June and the corporation is now seeking to compel a public release of her name. Throughout both cases the same law firm defends the victims. * Bloomberg Markets * Bloomberg Terminal * Financial data vendor ReferencesExternal links * * Bloomberg: Overview * PND News – New York City Mayor Gave $130Million to Charity in 2002 * Bloomberg LP v.

The front drawbar is pulled by two horses, and pulls the scraper proper behind it, while the operator walks behind controlling the depth of scrape with the handle Fresno scrapers in use building the Miocene Ditch near Nome, Alaska The Fresno Scraper is a machine pulled by horses used for constructing canals and ditches in sandy soil. The design of the Fresno Scraper forms the basis of most modern earthmoving scrapers, having the ability to scrape and move a quantity of soil, and also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually.  History  The Fresno scraper was invented in 1883 by James Porteous. Working with farmers in Fresno, California, he had recognised the dependence of the Central San Joaquin Valley on irrigation, and the need for a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil. In perfecting the design of his machine, Porteous made several revisions on his own and also traded ideas with William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, who invented and held patents on similar scrapers. Porteous bought the patents held by Deidrick, Dusy, and McCall, gaining sole rights to the Fresno Scraper. Prior scrapers pushed the soil ahead of them, while the Fresno scraper lifted it into a C-shaped bowl where it could be dragged along with much less friction. By lifting the handle, the operator could cause the scraper to bite deeper. Once soil was gathered, the handle could be lowered to raise the blade off the ground so it could be dragged to a low spot, and dumped by raising the handle very high.  Impact  This design was so revolutionary and economical that it has influenced the design of modern bulldozer blades and earth movers to this day. Between 1884 and 1910 thousands of Fresno scrapers were produced at the Fresno Agricultural Works which had been formed by Porteous, and used in agriculture and land levelling, as well as road and railroad grading and the construction industry. They played a vital role in the construction of the Panama Canal and later served the US Army in World War I. It was one of the most important agricultural and civil engineering machines ever made. In 1991 the Fresno Scraper was designated as an International Historic Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is currently on display at the San Joaquin County Historical Society & Museum.

Overview AS/400 objects share similarities with objects in object-oriented programming, but there are differences as well. There are similarities in that when storage is allocated for something, that something is of a specific type, and only a specific set of programs are allowed to act upon that object. There are differences in that even though the AS/400 supports Java and C++, AS/400 objects cannot be inherited like the classes in those languages. Another difference is that the set of object types in OS/400 (the AS/400's operating system) is fixed by IBM, and only IBM has the ability to create new ones. The number of object types is huge and a small subset of them are available to users. The human readable form of the object type is always a three to six character mnemonic preceded by an asterisk. What follows is a short list of the more commonly used objects and their mnemonics: * *LIB: Library (where everything below, except directories and stream files, is stored; libraries cannot exist within other libraries). * *PGM: Program (for compiled languages: CL, RPG-IV, C, C++, COBOL, etc. and there are no interface restrictions between the languages). * *MODULE: Module (linkable into a program from a compiled language above and here too there are no restrictions on linkability between languages). * *SRVPGM: Service program (dynamic set of one or more modules, akin to a DLL file in Microsoft Windows). * *BNDDIR: Binding directory (holds a list of modules and service programs and is used when creating programs). * *CMD: Command (an object used for calling programs that allows users to prompt for their parameters; can be created with the Command Definition language). See AS/400 Control Language for more information. * *MENU: Menu (accessed with the GO command). * *FILE: File (AS/400 files can be used for data, input/output devices, and source code, depending on sub type). * *DTAARA: Data area (small bits of storage used to store tiny items of data for fast access). * *DIR: Directory (part of the Integrated File System that is equivalent to Unix and Microsoft Windows hierarchical file systems). * *STMF: Stream file (traditional file that would be familiar to most Unix and Microsoft Windows users and only stored in directories). * *JRN & *JRNRCV: Journal and journal receiver (used to journal changes to files, data areas, and stream files). * *USRPRF: User profile (allows users to sign-on to the system). * *JOBD: Job description (used when submitting/starting jobs). * *SBSD: Subsystem description (used when starting subsystems; this is the place where user jobs run). * *JOBQ: Job queue (used to queue up batch jobs to run in a subsystem). * *LIND: Line description (communications line: Ethernet, token ring, etc.). * *CTLD: Controller description (communications controller for lines, workstations, etc.). * *DEVD: Device description (communications device for lines, workstations, printers tape drives, etc.) * *DTAQ: Data queue (used to queue up data entries for fast retrieval by other jobs). * *MSGQ: Message queue (used to send message to users, can also be used like a data queue). * *OUTQ: Output queue (used to queue up output to a printer). * *USRSPC: User space - a generic data-containing object of arbitrary size (up to 16T). Creating an object usually (but not always) involves a command that begins with the mnemonic \\"CRT\\". So, to create a job description you would prompt the CRTJOBD command. User profiles would be created with the CRTUSRPRF command. Similarly changing objects is done by prompting commands preceded by \\"CHG\\" (CHGJOBD, CHGUSRPRF, etc.), deleting an object uses \\"DLT\\" (DLTJOBD, DLTUSRPRF, etc.), displaying an object uses \\"DSP\\" (DSPJOBD, DSPUSRPRF, etc.), and working with a set of objects uses \\"WRK\\" (WRKJOBD, WRKUSRPRF, etc.). To view a generic set of objects in a library use the DSPOBJD command. WRKOBJ can be used to view objects in multiple libraries. The AS/400 command structure focuses on ease of use. In order to view all the objects that the verb portion of an AS/400 command can work (\\"WRK\\") upon the \\"go cmdWRK\\" where \\"WRK\\" may be any of the verbs current and future \\"CHG\\",\\"DLT\\",\\"DSP\\",\\"EDT\\",\\"INZ\\",\\"PRT\\" etc. Parameters for the command can be displayed by simply typing the command name and pressing F4 or by typing the command name on an AS/400 command line. This will prompt a standard SAA panel providing prompt information for each parameter the command can accept. The command string can be displayed at any point during prompting by pressing F1u2, which if used to exit from the command prompting can be utilized by the F9=Retrieve previous command. A help summary for the command and its parameters can be obtained by pressing F1. This command structure and strict adherence to the S.A.A. standards make the AS/400 extremely easy to use from at command level and also to develop source files containing commands. Commands may be executed interactively or placed in text files and executed in sequence or can be compiled into an AS/400 object of type *PGM, with a type-attribute of CLP.

It is located within the South Los Angeles region, bordering the cities of Lynwood and South Gate to the east and southeast, respectively, and the unincorporated community of Willowbrook to the south. Founded in the late nineteenth century as a ranching community, the arrival of the railroads and the construction of Watts Station saw the rapid development of Watts as an independent city, but in 1926 was consolidated with Los Angeles. By the 1940s, Watts transformed into a primarily working class African-American neighborhood, but from the 1960s developed a reputation as a low-income, high-crime area, following the Watts riots and the increasing influence of street gangs. Watts has become a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood with a significant African American minority, and remains one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Los Angeles despite falling crime rates since the 1990s. Notable civic activities by residents of Watts include the \\"Toys for Watts\\" toy drive, the Watts Christmas parade, and the \\"Watts Summer Games\\" athletic tournament, as well as a local theatre and a dance company, in an effort to improve the neighborhood. Watts is noted internationally for the landmark Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, which are a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The neighborhood has also been featured or referenced in numerous forms of media, particularly West Coast hip-hop music, and movies and television shows set in Los Angeles. History Looking east on Main Street (later 103rd Street) towards the Pacific Electric Railway depot, right of center, and various businesses. Photograph dated July, 1912. The area now known as Watts is located on the 1843 Rancho La Tajauta Mexican land grant. As on all ranchos, the principal vocation at that time was grazing and beef production. With the influx of European American settlers into Southern California in the 1870s, La Tajuata land was sold off and subdivided for smaller farms and homes, including a parcel purchased by Charles H. Watts in 1886 for alfalfa and livestock farming. In those days each Tajuata farm had an artesian well. The arrival of the railroad spurred the settlement and development of the area. Most of the first residents were the traqueros, Mexican and Mexican American rail workers who constructed and maintained the new rail lines. With this new growth, Watts was incorporated as a separate city, taking its name from the first railroad station, Watts Station that had been built in 1904 on 10 acres of land donated by the Watts family. The city voted to merge with Los Angeles in 1926. Watts did not become predominantly black until the 1940s. Before then, there were some African American residents, many of whom were Pullman car porters and cooks. Schoolroom photos from 1909 and 1911 show only two or three black faces among the 30 or so children pictured. By 1914, a black realtor, Charles C. Leake, was doing business in the area. Racially restrictive covenants prevented blacks from living in any other neighborhoods outside of Central Avenue District and Watts. World War II brought the Second Great Migration, tens of thousands of African American migrants, mostly from Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, who left segregated Southern states in search of better opportunities in California. During World War II, the city built several large housing projects (including Nickerson Gardens, Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts) for the thousands of new workers in war industries. By the early 1960s, these projects had become nearly 100 percent black, as whites moved on to new suburbs outside the central city. As industrial jobs disappeared from the area, the projects housed many more poor families than they had traditionally. Longstanding resentment by Los Angeles's working class black community over discriminatory treatment by police and inadequate public services (especially schools and hospitals) exploded on August 11, 1965, into what were commonly known as the Watts riots. The event that precipitated the disturbances, the arrest of a black youth by the California Highway Patrol on drunk-driving charges, actually occurred outside Watts. Mobs did the most property damage in Watts in the turmoil. Watts suffered further in the 1970s, as gangs gained strength and raised the level of violence in the neighborhood. Between 1989 and 2005, police reported more than 500 homicides in Watts, most of them gang- related and tied to wars over control of the lucrative illicit market created by illegal drugs. Four of Watts's influential gangs— Watts Cirkle City Piru, Grape Street Watts Crips, Bounty Hunter Watts Bloods, and PJ Watts Crips—formed a Peace Treaty agreement, known as the Watts truce on April 26, 1992. Key hallmarks of the pact continue to influence life in Watts to date, with colors and territory having little to do with gang-related crime. Beginning in the 1980s, those African Americans who could leave Watts moved to other suburban locations in the Antelope Valley, the Inland Empire, the San Gabriel Valley, Orange County and the San Joaquin Valley. The black population in Watts has been increasingly replaced by other demographic groups, primarily Hispanic immigrants of Mexican and Central American ancestry, as well as by a median proportion of Ethiopian and Indian ancestry. This demographic change accelerated after the 1992 riots. In addition, there has been a net migration of African Americans out of California to return to the South in a New Great Migration. From 1995 to 2000, California was a net loser of African-American residents. With new jobs, Southern states have attracted the most black college graduates since 1995. Neighborhood leaders have begun a strategy to overcome Watts's reputation as a violence-prone and impoverished area. Special promotion has been given to the museums and art galleries in the area surrounding Watts Towers. This sculptural and architectural landmark has attracted many artists and professionals to the area. I Build the Tower, a feature-length documentary film about the Watts Towers and their creator, Simon Rodia, provides a history of Watts from the 1920s to the present and a record of the activities of the Watts Towers Arts Center. Watts is one of several Los Angeles neighborhoods with a high concentration of convicted felons. In 2000, singer and actor Tyrese Gibson chartered a foundation to build a community center in Watts. In 2019, the Watts Towers were a gathering place along the funeral procession from the memorial for Nipsey Hussle at the Staples Center that wound through the streets of South L.A. At times, the crowd flooded the street creating gridlock. Geography Map of Watts as delineated by the Los Angeles Times The Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times states as follows: The neighborhood's irregular street boundaries follow the Los Angeles city limits on the north and east, except for a small patch of Los Angeles County territory surrounding Ritter Elementary School, between 108th Street and Imperial Highway, which the Times includes in Watts. The southern boundary runs east-west on Imperial Highway, the eastern line is north-south on Alameda Street and the western line is north-south on Central Avenue to 103rd Street. Ted Watkins Park and other county areas are excluded. Thence the line is Success Avenue between Century Boulevard and 92nd Street. Watts is flanked on the north by Florence- Firestone, on the east by South Gate, on the southeast by Lynwood, on the south by Willowbrook and on the north and west by Green Meadows. Population A total of 36,815 people lived in Watts's 2.12 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census—averaging 17,346 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles. Population was estimated at 41,028 in 2008. The median age was 21, making Watts the Los Angeles neighborhood with the youngest population. The percentages of residents aged birth to 18 were among the county's highest. Hispanics made up 61.6% of the population, blacks 37.1%, non-Hispanic whites 0.5%, Asian 0.2%, and others 0.5%. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common places of birth for the 34% of the residents who were born abroad, an average percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city or county as a whole. The $25,161 median household income in 2008 dollars was considered low for the city and county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 4 people was high for the city. Renters occupied 67% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest. In 2000, there were 2,816 families headed by single parents, or 38.9%, the highest rate for any neighborhood in the city. The percentages of never-married women (45.3) and never-married men (44.7) were among the county's highest. In 2000, there were 739 military veterans, or 3.6% of the population, low when compared to the rest of the city.

In May 2013 Wiegand Avenue Elementary School became the first school in California from which a principal was ordered removed in response to the state's 2010 \\"trigger law,\\" which compels the dismissal of a school administrator on petition of a majority of parents. As a result of the pending loss of principal Irma Cobian, 21 of 22 teachers asked for transfer to other schools. Public libraries Los Angeles Public Library operates the Alma Reaves Woods – Watts Branch. Watts received its first library service in 1913 when temporary space was designated in the city hall for a library. In 1914 the library moved into a newly built Carnegie library. Los Angeles annexed Watts in 1926, so the library became the Watts Branch of the Los Angeles library system. In 1957 voters approved a library branch bond, and a Watts Branch opened in 1960. In 1991 the Los Angeles City Council approved a measure, backed by the Friends of the Watts Branch Library, the 15th District Council Office, and the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) of the City of Los Angeles, to build a new library as a part of the Watts Civic Center. $1.3 million from Proposition 1, the branch library facility bond issue of 1989, funded the construction of the new Watts library. On June 25, 1996 the city council voted to name the library after Alma Reaves Woods, a woman in the community who encouraged reading and library usage. James C. Moore, AIA & Associates designed the current Watts Library, which opened on June 29, 1996. Community service=CicLAvia Tour On January 22, 2012, the popular cycling event called CicLAvia took place in south L.A.'s Central-Alameda neighborhood to the Watts Towers. Volunteers were excited to hold an event close to the CicLAvia events in downtown L.A. The event was meant to encourage civic engagement. Throughout the group of volunteers the diversity was large. Cyclists took photos for a \\"crowd-source\\" map made up of photos and recordings by the cyclists. Toys for Watts For the fourth continuous year, brother Powe of Called to Destiny Motorcycle Ministries has hosted a toy drive for the kids in the community of Watts, California. This happened after a flood that devastated the local area in 2003. Powe said he was \\"awakened by the Lord\\" to get him and his biker friends together and help replace the toys that were lost in the flood. Since then, he has worked with \\"Sweet Alice\\" Harris hand in hand; she's a local activist and founder of Parents of Watts, a charity that has been helping the community for more than 43 years. Watts Re-Imagined Watts Re:Imagined is a local urban planning initiative led by Grant Housing Economic Development Corps (Grant EDC, a non-profit division of the community-based Grant AME church) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Urban Solutions program. Its mission is to help the community of Watts realize their full potential by promoting economic opportunity, social equity, public health, and an improved quality of life, all while working with community leaders to preserve the identity of the area. It is trying to achieve this goal by implementing different existing plans proposed for the area. The Watts Re:Imagined initiative was formed in response to the dissolution of the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles. Parks and recreation The following recreation facilities are within the Watts boundaries: * Watts Senior Citizen Center, 1657 East Century Boulevard * 109th Street Recreation Center, 1464 East 109th Street. The center, which acts as a Los Angeles Police Department stop-in center, has an auditorium, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor and outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, a lighted football field, an indoor gymnasium with weights, an outdoor gymnasium without weights, a lighted soccer field, and lighted tennis courts. The 109th Street Pool is a seasonal outdoor unheated pool. In June 2008, a group of young men attacked a manager there, forcing the city to close the pool for a short period of time. When it re-opened, police were stationed there. The pool, located between the Nickerson Gardens and Jordan Downs public housing complexes, also lay between two competing gangs in 2008. * Unnamed Park, Evers Street Attractions * Watts Towers The Watts Towers or Towers of Simon Rodia is a collection of 17 interconnected structures, two of which reach heights of over 99 feet (30 m). The Towers were built by Italian immigrant construction worker Sabato (\\"Sam\\" or \\"Simon\\") Rodia in his spare time over a period of 33 years, from 1921 to 1954. The work is an example of non- traditional vernacular architecture and American Naïve art. * Watts Station The Watts station was a train station built in 1904. It is a National Historic Landmark. It has been known as one of the few structures that were untouched by a huge fire along 103rd Street stores during the 1965 Watts riots. When it was found intact, it was a symbol of hope and faith for the Watts community. Being one of the most original buildings that was first constructed in Watts, it was a popular stop for the Pacific Electric Railway's \\"Red Car\\" that ran through Los Angeles, CA, to Long Beach, CA, for 50 years. It was also admitted to the NRHP (National Register of Historic Places) four months after the riots. * Watts Christmas Parade The Watts Christmas parade was created in 1964 by Edna Aliewine before the Watts riots. She put together a group of local volunteers to fundraise and create the parade. Ms. Aliewine started a drill team with neighborhood girls which marched in homemade Santa hats. She died at the age of 90 in her home in Watts on July 5, 2011. * Watts Summer Games The L.A. Watts Summer Games started in 1968 and were held at Locke High School. The games are a three-day athletic tournament that brings together more than 5,000 students from 200 California schools. Almost 200,000 youth have competed in the games over the past 30 years. The Watts Summer Games have a scholarship program for students who are dedicated to the community and have awarded more than $300,000 since their inception in 1992. Performing arts=Dance Epifani Dance Company was founded by Lakesha Buchanon in Watts in 2002. They compete in year-round SHARP International competitions, where they have won several first-place trophies. Theater Located on 107th Street, the Watts Village Theater Company is a multicultural urban company whose mission is to \\"inspire its community with an appreciation of all cultures.\\" The company was started in 1996 and has been involved in helping the community with educational workshops ever since. The members strive to make a more understanding Watts whose citizens can harmoniously live together in a diverse community. Newspapers LA Youth was founded by Donna Myrow in 1988. The first edition of the publication sold 2,500 copies. Its current circulation is 120,000. LA Youth reaches approximately half a million readers. L.A. Watts Times Weekender Newspaper is an African American newspaper in both print form and online. It was started in 1965 with the motto: \\"The Voice of Our Community Speaking for Itself.\\" In the summer of 2010 the Bakewell family was in negotiation to purchase the LA Watts Times. Danny Bakewell said, \\"I am proud and honored that Melanie chose me and my family to continue the great legacy of the Watts Times, its founders and her parents,\\". In popular culture=Music *Watts, along with several other California areas, is referenced in the hip-hop songs \\"California Love\\" by 2Pac featuring Dr. Dre & Roger Troutman, and \\"Creep N Crawl\\" by Eazy E. For five years, the record label Top Dawg Entertainment has hosted a Christmas benefit concert in the Nickerson Gardens Housing Projects. The free concert draws tens of thousands of attendees and includes performances from TDE artists SZA, Kendrick Lamar, and Jay Rock who was raised in the Nickerson Gardens Housing Projects. Television and film *The television series Sanford and Son, was set in Watts, and the neighborhood was mentioned prominently by the characters. * The television series Two and a Half Men had an episode called \\"Weekend in Bangkok with Two Olympic Gymnasts\\", which makes reference to Watts in a brief scene.

As on all ranchos, the principal vocation was at that time grazing and beef production. There were household settlers in the area as early as 1882,\\"Watts Pioneer Dies,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 16, 1907, page 18 and in 1904 the population was counted as 65 people; a year later it was 1,651.\\" 'The Marvel of Suburbs,' \\": Rapid Growth and Development of Town of Watts Set Forth in a Folder,\\" Los Angeles Herald, October 8, 1905, page 8 C.V.

Seven ranchers said that they had no intention of subdividing and that all unimproved land should be omitted from the proposed city. Another petition declared that most of the property owners in Watts did not pay taxes inasmuch as they were buying the 25-foot lots for speculation, that the residents were \\"migratory\\" and that most of them were transitory \\"Mexican railroad laborers.\\" A third petition for exemption was submitted by residents of the Palomar stop, who dressed up their plea with quotations ranging from Greek philosophers to Hamlet. Those petitioners announced that they had recently changed the name of their settlement from \\"Watts Park\\" because they did not want any affiliation with Watts.\\"Would Remain Outside: Many Protests Made Against Lines of Proposed City of Watts,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 6, 1907, page II-8 The City of Watts was approved by voters of the district, and it became a municipality in May 1907, with J.F. Donahue, who was a driver for the Blue Ribbon beer company, as mayor and Frederick J. Rorke as city clerk. There was, however, no money to run the city because it had become incorporated too late to levy and collect any taxes. A proposed business license fee raised so much objection that the Board of Trustees, or the city council, submitted to the people a straw vote (nonbinding) question about allowing liquor to be sold in the city. A majority of the 250 votes did agree that Watts should allow saloons, or bars, and that the municipality should raise money by taxing them.\\"Saloon Taxes Run the City,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 11, 1907, page II-8, August 21, 1907\\"Mayor of Watts Is Exonerated,\\" Los Angeles Herald, July 12, 1907, page 3 Rorke said: > We have two retail saloons and one wholesale as a result, and an income that > more than pays our running expenses.

By January 1910 Watts had a population of about 2,500, \\"well improved streets, a fire department, a weekly newspaper\\" (the Watts Advertiser, owned by W.F. Schubert), and it was completing a $12,000 city hall. It had \\"the best of public schools, churches of the leading denominations, the principal fraternal orders, a chamber of commerce and a good government league,\\" of which J.H. Hurley was the president and W.C. Street the secretary. In 1910 J.B. Traughber was the city marshal and tax collector, and A.B. Waddingham was the city engineer.Los Angeles Herald Sunday Magazine, January 3, 1910, page 5 In 1910, C.H. Dodd was the mayor. Water Water for the community came from Artesian wells, which were said to provide a supply at 10 feet depth and a \\"big flow\\" at sixty feet, but in 1912 it was noted that \\"the present source of water supply is very unsatisfactory, and in many cases people are unable to get service at all.\\"\\"Watts Water Bonds,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 26, page I-16 In 1913, voters were asked to approve $85,000 in bonds for a water system and $15,000 for new fire department equipment, but both measures were defeated.\\"Watts Defeats Bonds,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 19, 1913, page II-10 In 1916, things got better with the installation of more and larger water mains, and a worker was kept on duty at the water plant all night in case a conflagration required additional water pressure.\\"Watts: Better Water Service,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 12, 1916, page 17 Education and library Classroom sketch by Edna Schye of Watts, 1909 There was a school in Watts from an early date.

In 1910 it was a transfer point for the Santa Ana, Long Beach and San Pedro lines of the Pacific Electric system. The Watts Station, which is now a National Historic Landmark, included Wells Fargo Express and Western Union telegraph facilities.C.H. Dodd, \\"Watts: A Growing Suburb With a Future,\\" Los Angeles Herald, January 2, 1910 Pioneer settler A.E. Ruoff recalled that the electric line was installed about 1902. The point known as Latin Station, just a mile north of Watts station, was called North Watts, and Abila station, 1.5 miles south of Watts, was South Watts (later \\"Palomar\\").

Business and industry After 1903, Watts saw the establishment of a newspaper, a general merchandise store, a lumber yard, a grocery store, a millinery, dry goods and confectionery stores, a blacksmithery and bakeries. The Pacific Coast Laundry Company opened in August 1907, with a payroll promised to be between $750 to $1,000 a month. The officers were P.L. Howland, J. Flautt and H.E. Munger, all of Los Angeles. Laundry deliveries were to be made via the electric railway. By 1910, business enterprises included the California Gold Recovery Company, which manufactured a machine used in mining districts to capture \\"flour gold,\\" which is fine gold floating on a liquid surface. Merriam-Webster dictionary In 1925, Watts had a pump-manufacturing plant, a machine shop, two sash-and-door plants, and a pickle works. Banks were Farmers & Merchants and Hellman. In that year there was a steel plant, McClintic Marshal Company, which covered fifteen acres and employed 180 men. A new California Thorn Cordage factory was set to hire five hundred men.

Municipal elections were fought over the issue, people were beaten and put into jail, and court cases were legion. A public speaker was threatened by a mob because he used a cuss word. Arson was suspected at a church.

The endeavor, with music by J.A. Rayne and book by Judson D. Brusie, ran for 88 performances at the Circle Theatre, 1825 Broadway, from January 20 through April 24, 1908. Internet Broadway Database It was produced by the vaudeville team of Kolb and Dill — Clarence Kolb and Max Dill.

IMDb Response A Balloon Route excursion car, 1905 In response to the raillery occasioned by the play, a \\"big advertising excursion\\" took place on Thursday, May 30, 1912, via a special train of three chartered electric railway cars. The route was scheduled over the Balloon Route by way of Los Angeles, Hollywood, the Soldiers' Home, Ocean Park, Venice, Redondo, Gardena and back to Watts. The object of the excursion was to call attention \\"to the fact that Watts has been 'born again,' and the name 'Lucky Watts' will be used as much as possible, the idea being to get new ideas into people's heads, so they will get away from the notion that there is any joke about what the people here believe is the most promising suburban community in the county.\\" Some 25,000 pieces of advertising material were distributed.\\"Watts Will Proclaim Itself,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 17, 1912, page II-6\\"Watts Boosters Ride,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 2, 2012, page IV-14 The excursion was repeated in 1913.\\"Watts Boosters Busy,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 24, 1913, page II-10 Proposed name change In 1912 and 1913, a movement was afoot to change the name of Watts because, as one headline writer put it, the residents were tired of the \\"quips and jests\\" at the town's expense. One real- estate agent said that prospective clients backed out of a property inspection tour when they found out their streetcar ride would end up in Watts. The name \\"South Angeles\\" was proposed.\\"Shall It Remain Watts?\\" Los Angeles Times, August 10, 1912, page I-14\\"South Angeles Is New Name: Citizens of Watts Tire of Quips and Jests at Expense of City and Will Rechristen Town,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 17, 1913, page II-9 Another plan for a city name change surfaced in 1919, when the city trustees asked for suggestions. Mayor Towne said: \\"Watts has got a bad reputation in Southern California, somehow or other . . . a good many of us felt that the liquor element left a black mark upon the community's name. . . . Towns are something like people. They can live up to a good name easier than they can live down a bad name.\\" First woman jury Defendant A.A. King and all-woman jury, with story as printed in the Los Angeles Times Watts had the distinction of being the site of the first all-woman jury impaneled in Los Angeles County, and perhaps the state, when A.A. King, editor of the Watts News, was tried on a charge that he printed obscene and indecent language in his newspaper. Justice of the Peace Cassidy ordered 36 women who lived in San Antonio Township to report for service.\\"First Woman Jury Will Try Editor,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, October 29, 1911, page 34\\"Women Drawn on Jury Duty,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 29, 1911, page II-8 At trial, the testimony was that one of the Watts city council members had vociferously used indecent and obscene language against King while visiting the Watts News office and that King had repeated the language in a story he wrote about the incident, not naming the councilman. The crowd that gathered in the courtroom for the trial was so large – about 100 people – that it had to be moved to the City Council chambers.\\"Quick With a Verdict and It's 'Not Guilty,'\\" Los Angeles Times, November 3, 1911, page II-1 The jurywomen were \\"Mmes.

Carolus and Bertha Scherner.\\" They were allowed to wear their headgear during the first half of the trial, but when they returned from lunch, they were asked to remove their hats so that everybody could see they were the same women who were there in the morning. The jury was out for just twenty minutes and returned a verdict of \\"not guilty,\\" to the cheers of the spectators. Joining Los Angeles In a special election on April 2, 1926, Watts residents decided to enter Los Angeles by a vote of 1,338 to 535.

Luro (February 27, 1901 - December 16, 1991) was a thoroughbred horse racing trainer in the United States. Luro was born in Argentina as one of nine children into the wealthy family of rancher and meat packer Adolfo Luro. The family had been involved for several generations with the lucrative business of polo horses, and Horatio Luro grew up as something of a playboy and maintained this lifestyle after moving to the United States. Well connected, he was friends with the social and business elite who could afford to be involved in the costly sport of thoroughbred racing. One of those elite was Canada's E. P. Taylor (1901–1989), chairman of a giant business conglomerate, the founder of the Jockey Club of Canada, and later the president of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. Taylor hired Luro to run his Windfields Farm, a large breeding and racing operation with two farms in Ontario and another in Chesapeake City, Maryland. In a career that spanned 48 years from 1937 to 1984, Luro trained 43 Stakes winners and 3 Champions. He won the 1962 Kentucky Derby with California-bred Decidedly and two years later won both the Derby and the Preakness Stakes with Northern Dancer, a horse who went on to be the 20th century's greatest sire. Luro also trained three winners of the Canadian International Stakes: Eugenia II (1956), Spinney (1957), and One For All (1971). While running Windfields Farm, Luro oversaw the breeding of Nijinsky II and from 1960 to 1969 won more races than any other breeding farm in North America. Luro trained three horses that won Canada's most prestigious thoroughbred horse racing event, the Queen's Plate. Luro basked in the publicity surrounding his racing success, associating with the rich and famous including Hollywood stars such as Bing Crosby while his dashing personality and good looks saw him dating some of society's most glamorous women. In the 1950s, he dated and eventually married the former Frances Weinman Latimer, daughter of Georgia mining and chemical products magnate William Weinman. He subsequently developed a breeding and training facility on her family's land in Cartersville, Georgia, operating under the name \\"Old Mill Farm\\". Despite training activities throughout the United States and Canada, it was at this location that he and his wife Frances raised their family. While no longer performing thoroughbred racing operations, Old Mill Farm remains in the hands of Luro's grandson, and an equestrian facility still operates on the site. In 1980, Luro was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. On Sunday, December 16, 1991, Luro died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Bal Harbour, Florida, at the age of 90. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Cartersville, Georgia. References * Hirsch, Joe.

Early British popular music, in the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, can be seen to originate in the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of the broadside ballad as a result of the print revolution, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the 19th century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s, the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves. Broadside ballads An 18th century broadside ballad Broadside ballads were arguably the first form of commercial popular music in Britain. They were a product of the development of cheap print from the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a large sheet of poor quality paper. This could also be cut in half lengthways to make ‘broadslips’, or folded to make chapbooks.G. Newman and L. E. Brown, Britain in the Hanoverian Age, 1714-1837: An Encyclopedia (Taylor & Francis, 1997), pp. 39-40. They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s.B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., Popular Culture in Seventeenth- Century England (Routledge, 1985), p. 199. Many were sold by travelling chapmen in city streets or at fairs.M. Spufford, Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-128. The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, religion, drinking-songs, legends and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England (Routledge, 1985), p. 204. Brass bands Although the most of the instruments used by British brass bands had existed and had been used together for some time, they only became a mass activity in the 1840s and 1850s out of village, church and military bands. Brass bands were a response to the process of industrialisation, which produced a large working class population, technological advancements, including more efficient piston valve instruments, which were easier to play and more accurate, and mass production that could quickly produce and distribute the instruments.T. Herbert, The British Brass Band: a Musical and Social History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 4-5. Arguably, brass bands were an expression of the local solidarity and aspirations of newly formed or rapidly growing communities. This was particularly expressed in the rapid growth and organisation of bands, clearly seen in the creation of brass band competitions by the late 1850s. Brass bands probably reached their peak of popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when, it has been estimated, there were over 20,000 brass band instrumentalists in the country.T. Herbert, The British Brass Band: a Musical and Social History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 138. Parlour music Front cover of \\"Just Awearyin' for You\\" (published 1901), a widely selling example of a parlour song. \\"Parlour music\\" was popular music performed in the parlours of middle class homes by amateur singers and pianists. Disseminated as sheet music, its heyday came in the 19th century as a result of a steady increase in the number of households with enough surplus cash to purchase musical instruments and instruction in music and with the leisure time and cultural motivation to engage in recreational music-making. In contrast to the chord-based classical music, parlour music features melodies, which are harmonically independent or not determined by the harmony. Many of the earliest parlour songs were transcriptions for voice and keyboard of other music, such as Thomas Moore's Irish Melodies, which comprised traditional tunes with new lyrics. Other genres performed included arias from Italian operas, patriotic selections, religious songs and pieces written for the musical stage, including excerpts from blackface minstrel shows. As the 19th century wore on, more and more songs were newly composed specifically for use by amateurs at home and these pieces began to develop a style all their own: similar in melodic and harmonic content to art songs of the day, but shorter and simpler in structure and making fewer technical demands on singer and accompanist. The high point of the parlour song came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in North America and the British Isles. Songs became more complex and sophisticated in their melodic and harmonic vocabulary and, in addition to their continuing use in the parlour, were also often sung in public recitals by professional singers. Characteristic and popular parlour songs include \\"Home, Sweet Home\\" by Henry Bishop with lyrics by John Howard Payne, \\"The Old Arm Chair\\" by Henry Russell, \\"The Lost Chord\\" composed by Arthur Sullivan with lyrics by Adelaide A. Proctor and \\"Take Back the Heart\\" by Claribel (Mrs. Charlotte Barnard). Music hall Music hall developed as a result of the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations in the 19th century.H. Cunningham, Leisure in the Industrial Revolution c. 1780-c. 1880 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1980), pp. 164-70. The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll.M. R. Booth and J. H. Kaplan, ed., The Edwardian Theatre Essays on Performance and the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 62. Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join. Leading music hall stars included: Marie Lloyd, Harry Champion, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Gus Elen, Little Tich, Gracie Fields and Flanagan and Allen. Musical hall composers included Lionel Monckton, Felix Powell and Noel Gay. Dance bands (big bands) Jack Hylton Dance Band leader and impresario, c. 1930 From about 1925 to 1946 the most popular form of music in the UK was that produced by dance bands. The British bands never quite adopted the kind of \\"Swing\\" music that was generally associated American \\"Big Band\\" jazz. It was quite tame compared to American jazz and was generally more sweet. Billy Cotton had perhaps the longest fame, as he still had a prime-time TV programme until the late '60s. The fame of Ted Heath lasted until 1964. Fans tended to divide them into \\"Sweet\\" (Ambrose, Geraldo and Victor Silvester) and \\"Hot\\" (Harry Roy and Nat Gonella). Jack Hylton's band was \\"hot\\" until 1933, then became sweeter as their success grew. Some of the lead singers enjoyed fame on their own. Most famous were Al Bowlly and Leslie \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson.

Several important and influential subgenres were created in Britain in this period, by pursuing the limitations of rock music, including British folk rock and glam rock,http://www.allmusic.com/style/glam- rock-ma0000002619 a process that reached its apogee in the development of progressive rock and one of the most enduring subgenres in heavy metal music. Britain also began to be increasingly influenced by third world music (roots of World music), including Jamaican and Indian music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres. In the middle years of the decade the influence of the pub rock and American punk rock movements led to the British intensification of punk, which swept away much of the existing landscape of popular music, replacing it with much more diverse new wavehttp://www.allmusic.com/style/new- wave-ma0000002750 and post punk bands who mixed different forms of music and influences to dominate rock and pop music into the 1980s. Rock=Progressive rock Pink Floyd, 1973. Progressive or prog rock developed out of late 1960s blues-rock and psychedelic rock. Dominated by British bands it was part of an attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. Progressive rock bands attempted to push the technical and compositional boundaries of rock by going beyond the standard verse-chorus- based song structures. The arrangements often incorporated elements drawn from classical, jazz, and world music. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used \\"concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme.\\" King Crimson have been seen as the band who established the concept of progressive rock\\". The term was applied to the music of bands and artists such as Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Kate Bush, Soft Machine, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. It reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1970s, but had mixed critical acclaim and the punk movement can be seen as a reaction against its musicality and pomposity. British rock mainstream Cat Stevens is widely considered as one of the most prominent soft rock acts of the decade. Some British rock bands that began their careers in the British Invasion 60s, notably The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks, also developed their own particular styles and expanded their international fan base during 1970s, but would be joined by new acts in new styles and subgenres.J. Atkins, The Who on record: a critical history, 1963-1998 (McFarland, 2000), p. 11. UK mainstream rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.J. M. Curtis, Rock eras: interpretations of music and society, 1954–1984 (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236. It reached its peak in the mid- to late 1970s with acts like the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the best selling album of the decade.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378. Major British soft rock artists of the 1970s included 10cc, Mungo Jerry and ELO. A large number of mainstream rock songs fit into the singer-songwriter classification. Some of the actives were Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood and Elton John.J. Beethoven and C. Moore, Rock-It: Textbook (Alfred Music Publishing, 1980), , pp. 37–38. Kate Bush became the first solo woman to have a self-written song become a number 1 UK single and became a sensation, drawing on art rock, literature, dance and mime.Kate Bush Allmusic Hard rock and Heavy metal Led Zeppelin, 1977 The hard rock and heavy metal genres were developed from blues-rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in England and the United States.D., Weinstein, Heavy Metal: The Music and its Culture (Da Capo, 2000). p. 14. Played louder and with more intensity, it often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like The Who and The Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience and The Jeff Beck Group.[ \\"Hard Rock\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 11 November 2009.

Eiche, Legends of Rock Guitar: the Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists (Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997), , p. 113. From the late 1960s the term heavy metal began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity.R. Walser, Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), , p. 7. By 1970 three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre. Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues-rock, Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phrase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony, helping to produce a \\"darker\\" sound.R. Walser, Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), , p. 10. These elements were taken up by a \\"second generation\\" of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s. Rainbow helped turn the genre into a form of arena rock; Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence and Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the new wave of British heavy metal, such as Iron Maiden and Saxon, followed in a similar vein. Unlike progressive rock, heavy metal (already a minority sub-culture) was able to survive the rise of punk and electronic music intact. Despite a lack of airplay and very little presence on the singles charts, late-1970s heavy metal built a considerable following, particularly among adolescent working-class males in North America and Europe.R. Walser, Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), , p. 3. Glam rock David Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust Tour Glam or glitter rock was developed in the UK in the post-hippie early 1970s. It was characterised by outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. The flamboyant lyrics, costumes, and visual styles of glam performers were a campy, playing with categories of sexuality in a theatrical blend of nostalgic references to science fiction and old movies, all over a guitar- driven hard rock sound. Pioneers of the genre included Marc Bolan and T.Rex, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople. These, and many other acts straddled the divide between pop and rock music, managing to maintain a level of respectability with rock audiences, while enjoying success in the singles chart, including Queen and Elton John. Other performers aimed much more directly for the popular music market, where they were the dominant groups of their era, including Slade and Sweet. The glitter image was pushed to its limits by Gary Glitter and The Glitter Band. Largely confined to the British, glam rock peaked during the mid-1970s, before it disappeared in the face of punk rock and new wave trends.\\"Glam rock\\", All music guides, retrieved 26 June 2009. British folk rock Fairport Convention in a Dutch television show in 1972 British folk rock was developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle which built on elements of American folk rock, and on the second British folk revival.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003). Rather than mixing electric music with forms of American influenced progressive folk, it used traditional English music as its basis.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005). A significant moment was the release of Fairport Convention's 1969 album Liege & Lief, which developed further in the 1970s, when it was taken up by groups such as Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. It was rapidly adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Brittany, where it was pioneered by Alan Stivell and bands like Malicorne; in Ireland by groups such as Horslips; and also in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives.J. S. Sawyers, Celtic Music: A Complete Guide (Cambridge MA: Da Capo Press, 2001), pp. 1–12. It was also influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to Britain, such as the US and Canada and gave rise to the subgenre of Medieval folk rock and the fusion genres of folk punk and folk metal. By the end of the 1970s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, as other forms of music, including punk and electronic began to be established. Pub rock Pub rock was a short-lived trend that left a lasting influence on the British music scene, especially in punk rock. It was a back-to-basics movement that reacted against the glittery glam rock of David Bowie and Gary Glitter, and peaked in the mid-1970s. Pub rock developed in large north London pubs.NME article on Pub Rock by Roy Carr published 29 October 1977, http://www.punk77.co.uk/punkhistory/pub_rock.htm, retrieved 14 May 2009. and is said to have begun in May 1971 with Eggs over Easy, an American band, playing in the Tally Ho! in Kentish Town. A group of musicians who had been playing in blues and R&B; bands during the 1960s and early 70s soon formed influential bands like Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe. Brinsley Schwarz was probably the most influential group, achieving some mainstream success both in the UK and in the States.L. D. Smith, Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, and the Torch Song Tradition (Greenwood, 2004), p. 132. The second wave of pub rock included Kilburn and the High Roads, Ace and Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers; these were followed by the third and final wave of pub rock, including Dr. Feelgood, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Ian Dury, Nick Lowe and Sniff 'n' the Tears. Several pub rock musicians joined the new wave acts such as Graham Parker's backing band, The Rumour, Elvis Costello & the Attractions and even The Clash.\\"Pub rock\\", All Music guides, retrieved 27 March 2009.

The first punk band is usually thought to be the Ramones from 1976 (although the Sex Pistols formed in the UK in 1975 so perhaps Punk rock originally developed in the UK first). This was taken up in Britain by bands also influenced by the pub rock scene and Us punk rock, like the Sex Pistols and The Clash, The Damned, The Jam, The Stranglers, Generation X, The Buzzcocks, Sham 69, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Tom Robinson Band, who became the vanguard of a new musical and cultural movement, blending simple aggressive sounds and lyrics with clothing styles and a variety of anti- authoritarian ideologies.\\"British punk\\", All Music Guides retrieved, 25 July 2009. Punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock, creating fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped- down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraced a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels. 1977 saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major international cultural phenomenon. However, by 1978, the initial impulse had subsided and punk had morphed into the wider and more diverse new wave and post punk movements. Post punk Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees performing in 1980. During the second half of the 1970s and early 1980s musicians identifying with or inspired by Punk rock also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise among others to the post-punk movement. The genre retained its roots in the punk movement but was more introverted, complex and experimental.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \\"[ Post-Punk]\\" Allmusic. Retrieved 2 November 2006. Post-punk laid the groundwork for alternative rock by broadening the range of punk and underground music, incorporating elements of Krautrock (particularly the use of synthesisers and extensive repetition), Jamaican dub music (specifically in bass guitar), American funk, studio experimentation, and even punk's traditional polar opposite, disco, into the genre. During 1976–77, in the midst of the original UK punk movement, bands emerged such as Manchester's Joy Division, The Fall, and Magazine, Leeds' Gang of Four, and London's The Raincoats that became central post-punk figures. Some bands classified as post-punk, such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, had been active well before the punk scene coalesced;Reynolds (2005), p. xxi. others, such as The Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. New wave The Police As the initial punk impulse began to subside, with the major punk bands either disbanding or taking on new influences, the term new wave began to be used to describe particularly British bands that emerged in the later 1970s with mainstream appeal. These included pop bands like XTC, Squeeze and Nick Lowe, the electronic rock of Gary Numan as well as songwriters like Elvis Costello, rock & roll influenced bands like the Pretenders, the reggae influenced music of bands like The Police, as well as bands of the ska revival like The Specials and Madness.\\"New wave\\", All Music Guides, retrieved 26 June 2009. By the end of the decade many of these bands, most obviously the Police, were beginning to make an impact in American and world markets.P. Buckley, The rough guide to rock (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 801. Significant popular British New Wave acts at the end of the decade included The Boomtown Rats and Ian Dury and the Blockheads.P. Gambaccini, T. Rice and J.

Macan, Rocking the classics: English progressive rock and the counterculture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 35–6. In 1977 Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR-77 drum machine, which was first featured in their October 1977 single release \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\".\\"The Man Who Dies Every Day: Ultravox\\", All Music Guides, retrieved 25 July 2009. The ballad arrangement, metronome-like percussion and heavy use of the ARP Odyssey synthesiser was effectively a prototype for nearly all synth pop and rock bands that were to follow. In 1978, the first incarnation of The Human League released their début single \\"Being Boiled\\". Others were soon to follow, including Tubeway Army, a little- known outfit from West London, who dropped their punk rock image and jumped on the band wagon, topping the UK charts in the summer of 1979 with the single \\"Are Friends Electric?\\". This prompted the singer, Gary Numan to go solo and in the same year he release the Kraftwerk inspired album, The Pleasure Principle and again topped the charts for the second time with the single \\"Cars\\".J. Miller, Stripped: Depeche Mode (Omnibus Press, 2004), p. 21. Particularly through its adoption by New Romantics, synthesisers came to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 80s. Albums such as Visage's Visage (1980), John Foxx's Metamatic (1980), Gary Numan's Telekon (1980), Ultravox's Vienna (1980), The Human League's Dare (1981) and Depeche Mode's Speak and Spell (1981), established a sound that influenced most mainstream pop and rock bands, until it began to fall from popularity in the mid-1980s.\\"Synth pop\\", All music guides, retrieved 25 July 2009. Pop Elton John is considered to be one of the most commercially successful solo pop acts of the 1970s The early 1970s were probably the decade when British pop music was most dependent on the group format, with pop acts, like rock bands, playing guitars and drums, with occasional additions of keyboard or orchestration. Some of these groups were in some sense \\"manufactured\\", but many were competent musicians, playing on their own recordings and writing their own material. In addition to the glam and glitter rock bands who enjoyed considerable success in the early 1970s. Aiming much more for the teen market, partly in response to US pop groups were The Rubettes and The Bay City Rollers.B. Longhurst, Popular Music and Society (Wiley-Blackwell, 1995), p. 245. Largely vocal-based groups included the New Seekers, Brotherhood of Man, the last of these designed as a British answer to ABBA.E. Vincentelli, ABBA Gold (Continuum, 2004), p. 50. Individuals who enjoyed successful pop careers in this period included Gilbert O'Sullivan, David Essex, Leo Sayer, Rod Stewart and Elton John. In addition there were the rock and roll revivalists Mud, Showaddywaddy and Alvin Stardust.S. Brown, Marketing: the Retro Revolution (SAGE, 2001), p. 131. This pattern changed radically in the late 1970s as a result of the impact of punk rock. Folk music Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from artists early 1970s artists like Nick Drake, and John Martyn, but these can also be considered the first among the British ‘folk troubadours’ or ‘singer-songwriters’, individual performers who remained largely acoustic, but who relied mostly on their own individual compositions.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock: the definitive guide to more than 1200 artists and bands (London: Rough Guides, 2003), pp. 145, 211–12, 643–4. The most successful of these was Ralph McTell, whose ‘Streets of London’ reached number 2 in the UK Single Charts in 1974, and whose music is clearly folk, but without and much reliance on tradition, virtuosity, or much evidence of attempts at fusion with other genres.\\"Streets Of London, Ralph McTell\\", BBC Radio 2, Sold on Song, 19 February 2009. British soul/jazz Carl Douglas got #1 hits \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" (1974), and Biddu Orchestra records also appeared in the charts. \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" in particular sold eleven million records worldwide. Popularity of British jazz from the 1950s, 1960s with Kenny Ball and Chris Barbar, UK jazz continued with innovative music scene. Some of the technical musicians during this period include guitarist John McLaughlin and Dave Holland (both of whom joined Miles Davis's group), pianists Keith Tippett and John Taylor, saxophonists Evan Parker, Mike Osborne, and the Canadian-born trumpeter Kenny Wheeler who had settled in Britain.W.

Blake, The land without music: music, culture and society in twentieth-century Britain (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 149. In the 1970s a notable development was the creation of various British jazz rock bands like Soft Machine, Nucleus, Colosseum, Henry Cow(avant garde band), National Health and Ginger Baker's Air Force, making it a major influence on progressive rock music.E. Macan, Rocking the classics: English progressive rock and the counterculture (Oxford: Oxford University Press US, 1997), p. 132. Industrial music Industrial music was an experimental music style, often including electronic music, that drew on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s to describe Industrial Records artists. It blended avant-garde electronics experiments (including tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesisers, sequencers) and a punk sensibility.\\"Industrial\\", Allmusic. [] Access date: 29 May 2009. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms.V.Vale. Re/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook, 1983. Prominent industrial musicians include the Sheffield based groups Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire. While the term was initially self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records, it broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an industrial aesthetic. Jamaican music The Specials performing in 2009. Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae had been introduced to the United Kingdom in the 1960s, and the genres became especially popular with Mods, skinheads and suedeheads.P. Childs and M. Storry, Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture (Taylor & Francis, 1999), p. 496. The 1970s saw the first major flowering of British reggae with bands such as The Cimarons, Aswad and Matumbi. Jamaican music began to influence British pop music, punk rock and the 2 Tone genre with the rise of the (often interracial) bands, such as The Specials, Madness, The Selecter and The Beat.W. Kaufman and H. S. Macpherson, Britain and the Americas: culture, politics, and history (ABC-CLIO, 2005), p. 818. Many of these Jamaican- influenced UK bands (such as UB40) adopted pop styles to appeal to mainstream audiences, but some UK reggae bands (such as Steel Pulse) played songs with more confrontational socio-political lyrics.K. Walker, Dubwise: Reasoning From the Reggae Underground (Insomniac Press, 2005), p. 205. The 1970s also saw the rise of dub poetry, exemplified by Linton Kwesi Johnson, Sister Netifa and Benjamin Zephaniah. The reggae subgenre lovers rock originated in the UK in the 1970s, and the Louisa Marks song \\"Caught You in a Lie\\" helped popularise the genre.A. Donnell, Companion to contemporary Black British culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 2002), p. 185.

It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the electronic music of synthpop. In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like heavy metal music continued to develop separately, there was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more \\"serious\\" bands, like The Police and UB40, enjoying considerable single chart success. The advent of MTV and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a Second British Invasion in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of the Beatles' popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade a fragmentation has been observed, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including hip hop and house music, while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the Hi-NRG hit factory of Stock Aitken Waterman. The rise of the indie rock scene was partly a response to this, and marked a shift away from the major music labels and towards the importance of local scenes like Madchester and subgenres, like gothic rock.S. Frith, Popular Music: The rock era (London, Routledge, 2004). Rock= New wave and New Romantics  Duran Duran on stage in 2005. New Romantic music emerged in London nightclubs including Billy's and the Blitz Club towards the end of the 1970s. Influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music, it developed glam rock fashions, gaining its name from the frilly fop shirts of early Romanticism. New Romantic music often made extensive use of synthesisers. Pioneers included Visage and Ultravox and among the commercially most successful acts associated with the movement were Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, Spandau BalletD.

Post-punk New Order performing live in 2005. Some of the most successful post punk bands in the 1970s, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Psychedelic Furs, also continued their success during the 1980s. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively. The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, in, tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1337–8. Some, such as Gang of Four, shifted to a more commercial new wave sound,[ Songs of The Free Bonus Tracks Allmusic review][ Hard Allmusic review] while others moved into gothic rock or became early examples of indie rock.D. Hesmondhaigh, \\"Indie: the institutional political and aesthetics of a popular music genre\\" in Cultural Studies, 13 (2002), p. 46. Gothic rock The Cure on stage in 2008. Gothic rock, often shortened to goth, developed out of the post-punk scene in the early 1980s. It combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and depressing lyrics. Notable early gothic rock bands include Bauhaus (whose \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" is often cited as the first goth record), Siouxsie and the Banshees (who may have coined the term), The Cure, The Sisters of Mercy, and Fields of the Nephilim.R. Shuker, Popular music: the key concepts (Routledge, 2005), p. 128. Gothic rock gave rise to a broader goth subculture that included clubs, various fashion trends and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s, gaining notoriety by being associated by several moral panics over suicide and Satanism.L. M. E. Goodlad and M. Bibby, eds, Goth: Undead Subculture (Duke University Press, 2007). Indie rock Morrissey of The Smiths performing in 2006. Indie or independent rock (often described as alternative rock in the U.S.), was a scene that emerged from post-punk and new wave eschewing the major record labels for control of their own music and relying on local scenes or national sub-cultures to provide an audience. Having enjoyed some success a number of indie acts were able to move into the mainstream, including early indie bands Aztec Camera, Orange Juice and The Smiths, followed by The Housemartins and James. The C86 cassette, released in 1986 by NME and featuring such bands as The Wedding Present, Primal Scream, The Pastels, and the Soup Dragons, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole. Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. The Jesus and Mary Chain wrapped their pop melodies in walls of guitar noise, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with techno and house music, forging the alternative dance style. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the bandmembers' tendency to stare at their feet onstage, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride, and Lush created an overwhelmingly loud \\"wash of sound\\" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the drug-fuelled Madchester scene. Based around The Haçienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as The Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop. Heavy metal Iron Maiden, one of the central bands in the new wave of British heavy metal In the 1980s, the new wave of British heavy metal broke into the mainstream, as albums by Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon reached the British top 10.Many metal artists, including Def Leppard, benefited from the exposure they received on MTV and became the inspiration for American glam metal.I. Christe Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal (London: HarperCollins, 2003), , p. 79. However, as the subgenre fragmented into various subgenres, much of the creative impetus shifted towards America and continental Europe (particularly Germany and Scandinavia), which produced most of the major new subgenres of metal, which were then taken up by British acts. These included thrash metal and death metal, both developed in the USA; black metal and power metal, both developed in continental Europe, but influenced by the British band Venom; and doom, which was developed in the USA, but which soon were adopted by a number of bands from England, including Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General.D. Weinstein, Heavy Metal: The Music and its Culture (Cambridge MA: Da Capo, 2000), , p. 21. Grindcore Grindcore, or simply grind, emerged during the mid–1980s as an extreme music genre characterised by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, high speed tempo, blast beats, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams. It drew inspiration from some of the most abrasive music genres – including death metal, industrial music, noise and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk. Grindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the crust punk scene.\\"Crustgrind,\\" \\"Grindcore Special\\" part 2, p. 46 Napalm Death inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.Felix von Havoc, Maximum Rock'n'Roll #198. Archived by Havoc Records. Access date: 20 June 2008. Folk punk Billy Bragg performing at South by Southwest in 2008. Folk punk or rogue folk is a fusion of folk music and punk rock, or occasionally other genres, which was pioneered by the London-based Irish band The Pogues in the 1980s. It achieved some mainstream success in the 1980s and, particularly as the subgenre of Celtic punk, has been widely adopted in areas of the Celtic diaspora in North America and Australia and by many bands in continental central and eastern Europe. Unlike earlier Celtic rock and electric folk groups, folk punk groups tend to include relatively little traditional music in their repertoire, but instead usually performed their own compositions, often following the form of punk rock, using additional folk instrumentation, including, mandolin, accordion, banjo and particularly violin.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 197–8. Other bands adopted some traditional forms of music, including sea shanties and eastern European gypsy music. Among the most successful performers were The Levellers, and singer- songwriter Billy Bragg, who enjoyed a series of hits in the 1980s.I. Peddie, The Resisting Muse: Popular Music and Social Protest (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), pp. 39–46. Pop The British charts at the opening of the 1980s contained the usual mix of imports, novelty acts, oddities (including rock 'n' roll revivalist Shakin' Stevens) and survivors like Queen and David Bowie, but were dominated by post punk, and then from about 1981 by new romantic acts. There were also more conventional pop acts, including Bucks Fizz, whose light lyrics and simple tempos gave them three number ones after their Eurovision Song Contest victory in 1981. The dance-pop music of Frankie goes to Hollywood, initially controversial, gave them three consecutive number ones in 1984, until they faded away in the mid-1980s. Probably the most successful British pop band of the era were the duo Wham! with an unusual mix of disco, soul, ballads and even rap, who had eleven top ten hits in the UK, six of them number ones, between 1982 and 1986.P. Gambaccini, T. Rice and J. Rice, British Hit Singles (6th edn., 1985), pp. 338–9. Another band that dominated the charts within the early to mid-1980s were Culture Club with a blend of soul, rock, pop, new wave and reggae gathered them nine top ten hits and two number ones until they broke up in 1986. In the second half of the 1980s, British pop music was dominated by Stock Aitken Waterman's \\"hit factory\\" with the uniformity of their Hi-NRG sound.K. Gelder, The Subcultures Reader (London: Routledge, 2005), p. 477. Synthpop Pet Shop Boys. Synthpop emerged from new wave, producing a form of pop music that followed electronic rock pioneers in the 1960s and 1970s like Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream, in which the synthesiser is the dominant musical instrument. Tubeway Army, a little known outfit from West London, dropped their punk rock image and topped the UK charts in 1979 with the single \\"Are Friends Electric?\\", prompting their singer, Gary Numan to go solo and release the album, The Pleasure Principle from which he gained a number one in the singles charts with \\"Cars\\". Trevor Horn of The Buggles captured the changing scene in the international hit \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". It also became dominant for many New Romantic acts like Visage, Ultravox, Duran Duran and Japan. There were also more straight forwardly new wave pop acts like The Human League as well as Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, and Yazoo. Other key artists from the early to mid-1980s include Eurythmics, Talk Talk, A Flock of Seagulls, Tears for Fears, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, OMD, Thomas Dolby, Thompson Twins, Bronski Beat, Heaven 17, Howard Jones, Blancmange and Erasure. Hi-NRG The reformed Bananarama on stage in 2007. Hi-NRG (\\"high energy\\") is high-tempo disco music (often with electronic instrumentation), as well as a more specific, derivative genre of electronic dance music that achieved mainstream popularity in the mid to late 1980s. In the early 1980s hi energy disco had become popular in the gay scene of American cities like New York and San Francisco with acts like Divine, and The Weather Girls.M. Silcott, Rave America: new school dancescapes (ECW Press, 1999), p. 47. In 1983 in the UK, music magazine Record Mirror championed the gay underground sound and began publishing a weekly Hi-NRG Chart.80s Radiomusic.com – Record Mirror Hi-NRG charts Hi-NRG also entered the mainstream with hits in the UK pop charts, such as Hazell Dean's \\"Searchin' (I Gotta Find a Man)\\" and Evelyn Thomas's \\"High Energy\\".Official Charts Company – Hazell Dean \\"Searchin'\\"Official Charts Company – Evelyn Thomas \\"High Energy\\" In the mid-1980s, Hi-NRG producers in the dance and pop charts included Ian Levine and trio Stock Aitken Waterman, both of whom worked with many different artists. Stock Aitken Waterman had three of the most successful Hi-NRG singles ever with their productions of Dead or Alive's \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" (UK No. 1 & US No. 11 in 1985), Bananarama's \\"Venus\\" (US No. 1 & UK No. 8 in 1986), and Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" (UK No. 1 & US No. 1 in 1987). Their artists dominated British pop music and the charts in the late 1980s, including Bananarama, Rick Astley and Australian actress Kylie Minogue.[ Allmusic.com – Stock Aitken Waterman] UK soul Mick Hucknall of Simply Red, 2009 In 1980s, UK soul musicians such as Junior, Princess, the Pasadenas, Mica Paris, Soul II Soul, and Central Line played soul music and had hit songs. Soul II Soul's breakthrough R&B; hits \\"Keep on Movin'\\" and \\"Back to Life\\" in 1989 have been seen as opening the door to the mainstream for black British soul and R&B; performers. Britain had produced some blue- eyed soul singers in the 1960s, including Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield and interest had been maintained by figures such as David Bowie, but it was not until the 1980s that a clear genre of British soul music developed with flourishing soul scenes in major cities like London and Manchester, often with many black artists, supported by local and pirate radio stations.A. Donnell, ed., Companion to contemporary Black British culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 2002), pp. 285–6. This interest was reflected in a series of covers or songs inspired by soul for a number of major acts, including Phil Collins's \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" (1982), Culture Club's \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\" (1983), The Style Council's \\"Shout to the Top\\", (1984) Eurythmics' \\"Missionary Man\\" (1986), and Steve Winwood \\"Roll with It\\" (1988). For the first time since the 1960s, there were also significant acts who specialised in soul. Former Wham! singer George Michael got the multi-platinum Faith album (1987).G. Wald, \\"Soul's Revival: White Soul, Nostalgia and the Culturally Constructed Past, M. Guillory and R. C. Green, Soul: Black power, politics, and pleasure (New York University Press, 1997), pp. 139–58. Also significant were Sade, Swing Out Sister, Simply Red and toward the end of the decade, Lisa Stansfield. Hip hop Tim Westwood, one of the most important DJs to promote hip hop in Britain. A British hip hop scene emerged in the early 1980s, largely based on American hip hop music at parties and club nights, In this period some pop records dabbled with rap – such as Adam and the Ants' \\"Ant Rap\\" (1981), Wham!'s \\"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\\" (1982) and Malcolm McLaren's \\"Buffalo Gals\\" (1982). More serious British artists were rapping live or recording amateur tapes in the early 1980s, but the first British hip hop tune released on record was \\"London Bridge\\" by Newtrament in 1984. Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro was released: Street Sounds Electro UK (1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists' \\"Kids Rap/Party Rap\\" (1984), but releases and national publicity were still rare. Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, and instrumental in giving the scene wider recognition were DJs such as Dave Pearce, Tim Westwood, and John Peel, but in this period it made very little impact on the mainstream charts. The scene remained predominantly underground depending on word of mouth and the patronage of pirate radio stations. The first UK record label devoted to releasing UK hip hop acts was Simon Harris' Music of Life label, founded in 1986. It was home to Derek B, the first UK rapper to achieve chart success. Music of Life went on to sign groups such as Hijack, the Demon Boyz, Hardnoise (later Son of Noise) and MC Duke. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them – for example Massive Attack with trip hop, or Galliano with acid jazz. Hip Hop Connection, the first major British hip hop magazine, was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London – such as Blade, Black Radical Mk II and Overlord X – but many distinct scenes developed nationally. Electronic music In the 1980s, dance music records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, largely influenced from the electronic music of Kraftwerk and disco music. Such music was originally born of and popularised via regional nightclub scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in discothèques as well as the rave scene. House music Paul Oakenfold House music was a style of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s. House music was strongly influenced by elements of soul and funk- infused varieties of disco. House music generally mimics disco's percussion, especially the use of a prominent bass drum on every beat, but may feature a prominent synthesiser bassline, electronic drums, electronic effects, funk and pop samples, and reverb or delay-enhanced vocals. In the early 1980s, a UK house scene developed in cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester, particularly at The Haçienda Club and on the holiday island of Ibiza.J. Muncie, Youth and Crime (SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009), p. 221. One of the earliest and most influential UK house and techno record labels was Network Records (otherwise known as Kool Kat records) who helped introduce Italian and U.S. dance music to Britain as well as promoting select UK dance music acts. The first English house tune, \\"Carino\\" by T-Coy was released in 1986.S. Redhead, The end of the century party: youth and pop towards 2000 (Manchester University Press, 1990), p. 112. By late 1987, DJs like Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling were bringing the Ibiza sound to UK clubs like Shoom in Southwark (London), Heaven, Future, Spectrum and Purple Raines in Birmingham.S. Reynolds, Generation ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture (London: Routledge, 1999), p. 1058. The genre became more well-known to the general public when it began to crossover into the mainstream singles chart around 1986, with the song \\"Love Can't Turn Around\\" by Farley \\"Jackmaster\\" Funk (featuring Darryl Pandy) generally being accredited as the first record to crossover from clubs to charts when it became a top 10 hit that year. Another major milestone for house music was when \\"Jack Your Body\\" by American DJ Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley became the first record from the genre to reach the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart in January 1987. Jazz fusion Courtney Pine performing in 2006. After the lean years of the 1970s, there was something of a British jazz revival based in London's Soho in the 1980s.Jazz Britania, http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/features/jazz- brit3.shtml, retrieved 15 July 2009. Initially this UK jazz dance scene was led by DJs like Paul Murphy, but it soon expanded to support live bands and to start its own record labels. The jazz revival was by the appearance of a new generation of British jazz and fusion musicians, including members of the jazz groups Level 42, Incognito, Jazz Warriors (formed 1986), Courtney Pine, Gary Crosby, and later Soweto Kinch. The Acid Jazz label was formed in 1987, producing a mix of hip hop and funk beat flavoured jazz stylings that put traditional jazz elements over modern beats. 2 Tone and reggae Having emerged from the post-punk and reggae scenes in the West Midlands in the 1970s, the ska revival associated with 2 Tone records was a remarkable commercial success in the early years of the 1980s. Bands like The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat, Madness, Bad Manners and The Bodysnatchers all enjoyed chart success, with Madness and The Specials managing number ones. The Specials' \\"Ghost Town\\" (1981) is often seen as summarising the disillusionment of Thatcherite, post-industrial urban youth.N. Zuberi, Sounds English: Transnational Popular Music (University of Illinois Press, 2001), p. 188. Madness managed to sustain a career that could still chart into the second half of the 1980s, but the 2-tone movement faded early in the decade, and would have a longer term effect through American bands of the third wave of ska.D. V. Moskowit, Caribbean popular music: an encyclopedia of reggae, mento, ska, rock steady, and dancehall (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006), p. 270. The more reggae based music of UB40 allowed them to continue to chart into the twentieth century, enjoying four number ones in the UK, the last of these in 1994.D. V. Moskowit, Caribbean popular music: an encyclopedia of reggae, mento, ska, rock steady, and dancehall (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006), p. 306.

Indian music in the UK Sheila Chandra on stage. By the mid-1970s, the demand among the relatively large Asian populations of many major British cities for familiar live music to entertain at weddings and other cultural occasions led to a flourishing Asian dance band scene, particularly bhangra from the Punjab which supported bands like Alaap, formed in Southhall in London and Bhujhungy Group from Birmingham.S.

Alaap's 1979 album Teri Chunni de Sitare for Multitone records, mixed traditional dhol and tumbi with synthesisers and electro beats and was a surprise hit to those outside of the scene. It opened the door for a flood of Asian recording artists in the UK including Apna Sangeet, Chirag Pehchan, Sangeeta and DCS. By the mid-1980s, bhangra was the most popular music among British Asians and a youth scene of daytime bhangra raves were a major part of a growing youth culture.S. Duncombem, Cultural Resistance Reader (Verso, 2002), p. 237. Multitone Records began to release remix albums, and bhangra picked up influences from hip hop and soul, producing groups like X-executive Sounds and Hustlers convention. Other 1980s forms of British Indian music included the punk rock and rap of Aki Nawaz, the pop of Sheila Chandra, the hip hop of Joi Bangla and Osmani Sounds, and the ghazal/jazz fusion of Najma Akhtar.

Second British Invasion The Second British Invasion consisted of acts that came mainly out of the synthpop and new wave genres.

After lengthy service as a mercenary in the Spanish Army Preston returned to Ireland following the outbreak of the Rebellion of 1641. He was appointed to command the Leinster Army of the Irish Confederacy, enjoying some success as well as a number of heavy defeats such as the Battle of Dungans Hill in 1647 where his army was largely destroyed. Like other Confederate leaders, Preston was a Catholic Royalist. He remained in close contact with the Lord Lieutenant the Marquess of Ormonde, and was a strong supporter of an alliance between Confederates and Royalists against the English Republicans. Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, he left for France where he joined the Royalist Court-in-exile and was made Viscount Tara by Charles II. Lineage Preston was a descendant of Robert Preston, 1st Baron Gormanston, who in 1363 purchased the lands of Gormanston, County Meath, and who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1388. The Prestons came originally from the Lancashire town of that name, and arrived in Ireland some time before 1320. Sir Robert's great-grandson, Robert Preston, was created Viscount Gormanston in 1478; and the latter's great-grandson was Christopher, 4th Viscount Gormanstown (d. 1599), whose second son was Thomas Preston. Continental service Thomas's elder brother succeeded the title of Viscount Gormanstown, so Thomas Preston pursued a career in the military. Since Roman Catholics were not allowed to hold state positions in Ireland, he entered the Spanish service and fought in the Thirty Years' War. Preston was in the same Irish regiment in the Spanish service as Owen Roe O'Neill, and distinguished himself in the defence of Leuven against the French and Dutch in 1635. Between him and Owen Roe O'Neill there was from the first intense jealousy. There was also some tension between Preston and James Tuchet. In 1644 Tuchet, the Earl of Castlehaven was chosen to lead a major Confederate expedition into Ulster. Unlike Preston, Castlehaven was a military amateur but was he favoured over Preston as he was of a prominent English family. Irish Confederacy Preston returned to Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 to support his fellow Irish Catholics. He was appointed general of Leinster, by the Irish Confederates, which was the largest and best equipped of the Irish Catholic forces. His performance as a commander in Ireland in the intermittent wars if 1642 to 1652 was mixed. He won widespread praise for his successful siege of Duncannon in 1645, but lost a string of field battles including New Ross (1643) and Dungans Hill (1647). This last battle was disastrous for the Confederates, as their Leinster army was all but wiped out at it. In general he was skilled in the art of siegecraft, but never had a very good understanding of mobile warfare. Preston played a major part in the Confederates' internal strife, siding at first with radicals who opposed the first Ormonde peace, but later siding with the moderates who signed a conclusive treaty with Ormonde and the Royalists in 1648. His Royalism was motivated by his Old English roots and his extreme personal dislike of Owen Roe O'Neill, who led the opposing faction. He fought with the defeated Royalists during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland – defending the city of Waterford until hunger and disease forced him to capitulate. He marched his remaining troops to Galway, the last Irish held city on the island. In late 1652, after another lengthy siege, Galway too was reduced by plague and lack of supplies. Preston surrendered the city on condition that he and his troops be allowed to leave the country and find employment in the French army. He left the country for exile in France – where the Royalist court was in exile – in 1652. In 1650 Charles II while in exile created him Viscount Tara; and after his departure from Ireland in 1652 he offered his services to Charles in Paris, where he died in October 1655. Family Preston's wife was a Flemish lady of rank, Marguerite Dieudonee de Dhuy, by whom he had several children, one of his daughters being the second wife of Sir Phelim O'Neill. His son Anthony succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Tara, a title that became extinct on the murder by Sir Francis Blundell, 3rd Baronet and his brothers of Thomas, 3rd Viscount, in 1674. Charles II, who during his exile lodged with the Preston family in Bruges, spoke warmly of the children and their guardian Miss Warren in his later years, but did nothing to repair their ruined fortunes: the younger Thomas in 1670 was said to be penniless.Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p.152 See also * William Preston (Virginia) * William Preston (poet) NotesReferences * * Bibliography * O Siochru, Micheal.

Eulenburg worked in high positions of the Prussian and German administration in Wiesbaden (1869-1872), Metz (president of the Département de la Lorraine; 1872-1873) and upper president of the Province of Hanover (1873-1878). In March 1878 Eulenburg succeeded his first cousin once removed Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg as Minister of the Interior, serving under Bismarck. He implemented a series of repressive anti-socialist measures. From 1881 to 1892 he was the president of the province of Hesse-Nassau. Prime Minister of Prussia In 1892, he was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in succession to Leo von Caprivi, who however remained Chancellor of Germany. Though Caprivi had recommended the experienced administrator Eulenburg for this appointment, the new prime minister soon made life difficult for Caprivi, and often thought of pressing for his removal. Both Caprivi and Eulenburg were eventually dismissed by Wilhelm II following the renewal of anti-Socialist moves (and an anti-subversion bill) in 1894. Eulenburg often thought of himself as the only possible successor to Caprivi, and he was extremely unhappy to be dismissed at what he regarded as the moment of his destiny. From 1899 until his death, Eulenburg was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. He died in Berlin in 1912 and is buried in No. I cemetery of Trinity Church, Berlin-Kreuzberg.

(It also keeps track of program temporary fixes (PTF) in AS/400 system libraries.) (The other directories that can be used are the directory (*DIR) and folder (*FLR) objects.) AS/400 objects are not actually stored in libraries. They're really nothing more than namespaces, but it's easier to refer to an object as being \\"in\\" or \\"stored in\\" a library. Certain types of the AS/400 object (database file, storage areas and executable program objects) can be compiled, copied, and stored into/from many different libraries concurrently, with the Library List hierarchy determining which instance of the object to use during execution of any application that utilizes that object name. There are AS/400 commands to help move objects around, and objects may be qualified at compile time to point to specific other objects statically at runtime, in order to circumvent the Library List. Other types of objects, designated as \\"system\\" objects cannot be replicated. Libraries are a \\"system\\" object, and therefore only one instance of any given Library \\"name\\" is possible. They're made to appear as if they're stored in the QSYS library. Other \\"system\\" objects include user profiles (*USRPRF), configuration objects (*LIND, *CTLD, *DEVD), etc. Shop Standards On systems with hierarchical filing systems the norm is to have many directories, most of which are contained one within the other, and with a moderate number of files in each directory. Since libraries cannot be stored within other libraries on the AS/400 and because historically the library list was always so small, the opposite became the norm; small numbers of libraries each of which contain large numbers of objects. A library is similar to a folder in Windows. In AS/400 a library is another object that can contain other objects (executable objects, source files, etc.). Libraries can't contain other libraries. AS/400 is structured as a list, the opposite of Windows which has a tree-like structure. Most homegrown applications have between one and three libraries. Some have program, source, and file objects together in one library. With shops that have a huge amount of data and a small backup window they usually split the database files into a separate data library and keep the source and programs in another library. In companies with a separate development systems they tend to split it further by placing the source into its own library. Generally speaking all libraries created by IBM for use by the operating system begin with the letter 'Q'. IBM Standard Libraries: *QSYS - System Parent Library *QSYS2 - System Library for CPI's(Characters Per Inch) *QHLPSYS - Online Documentation Library for Users *QTCP - TCP Connectivity Utilities *QAFP - Advanced Function Printing *QGPL - General Purpose Library *QTEMP - Job specific temporary Library (deleted when the job ends) AS/400 and SQL Most Database management systems (DBMS) use SQL-based terminology to describe objects. The AS/400's terminology is unique and may have generated some confusion. High-level programming languages have often been preferred over SQL with AS/400 programming, due to actual or perceived performance reasons. As SQL programming has become more common on the AS/400, both traditional and SQL-based methods have become available to create and use objects, depending on preference or need. For the most part, traditional library-based objects are the same as SQL objects, with at least equivalent capabilities. For example, a Library is a Schema, a Physical File is a Table, a Logical File is a View, and an Access Path is an Index.

As Minister of War from 1859 to 1873, Roon, along with Otto von Bismarck and Helmuth von Moltke, was a dominating figure in Prussia's government during the key decade of the 1860s, when a series of successful wars against Denmark, Austria and France led to German unification under Prussia's leadership. A moderate conservative and supporter of executive monarchy, he was an avid modernizer who worked to improve the efficiency of the army.  Education  Roon was born at Pleushagen (now Pleśna), near Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg, Poland). His family was of Flemish origin and had settled in Pomerania. His father, an officer of the Prussian army, died in poverty during the French occupation of the Kingdom of Prussia (see Napoleonic Wars), and the young Roon was brought up by his maternal grandmother. Roon entered the corps of cadets at Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland) in 1816, from where he proceeded to the military school at Berlin in 1818, and in January 1821, he received a commission in the 14th (3rd Pomeranian) regiment quartered at Stargard in Pomerania. In 1824, he went through the three-year higher course of study at the General War School in Berlin (later called the Prussian Military Academy), where he improved his general education. Two years later, he was transferred to the 15th regiment at Minden.  Publications  In 1826, he was appointed an instructor in the military cadet school at Berlin, where he devoted himself especially to the subject of military geography. He was a student of the noted geographer Carl Ritter who taught at the Berlin military school. In 1832, Roon published the well-known Principles of Physical, National and Political Geography, in three volumes (Grundlage der Erd-, Völker- und Staaten-Kunde), which gained him a great reputation, and of which over 40,000 copies were sold in a few years. This work was followed in 1834 by Elements of Geography (Anfangsgrunde der Erdkunde), in 1837 by Military Geography of Europe (Militärische Landerbeschreibung von Europa), and in 1839 by The Iberian Peninsula (Die Iberische Halbinsel). Von Roon statue, Berlin  Early military career  In 1832, Roon rejoined his regiment and was afterwards attached to the headquarters of General von Müffling's corps of observation at Krefeld, where he first became aware of the very inefficient state of the Prussian Army. In 1833, he was appointed to the Topographical Bureau at Berlin. In 1835, he entered the Prussian General Staff, and, in 1835, he was promoted captain and became instructor and examiner in the military academy at Berlin. In 1842, after an illness of two years brought on by overwork, he was promoted to major and attached to the staff of the VII Corps, where he was again impressed with the inefficiency of the organization of the army, and he occupied himself with schemes for its reform. In 1844, as tutor to Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, he attended the prince at Bonn University and in his European travels. In 1848, he was appointed chief of the staff of the VIII Corps at Koblenz. During the disturbances of that year, he served under Prince William, later king and emperor, in the suppression of the insurrection at Baden and distinguished himself by his energy and bravery, receiving the 3rd class of the order of the Red Eagle in recognition of his services. While attached to the prince's staff at that time, he broached to him the subject of his schemes of army reform. In 1850, after the revelation of defective organization and efficiency that led to the humiliating Treaty of Olmütz, Roon was made a lieutenant-colonel and, in 1851, full colonel.  Army reform  Promoted to major-general in 1856 and to lieutenant-general in 1859, Roon had held several commands since 1850, having been employed on important missions. Prince Wilhelm became regent in 1858 and, in 1859, appointed Roon a member of a commission to report on the reorganization of the army. During the Austro-Sardinian War, Roon was charged with the mobilization of a division. At the end of 1859, although he was only a junior lieutenant-general in the army, he succeeded Eduard von Bonin as war minister. In 1861 the ministry of marine was also entrusted to him. Supported by Edwin von Manteuffel and the new Prussian Chief of Staff, Helmuth von Moltke, Roon drew up plans to adapt Gerhard von Scharnhorst's system to Prussia's altered circumstances. Scharnhorst proposed an increase in universal military service to three years, with new regiments raised and a reduced role for the reserve (Landwehr), whose role in the War of Liberation (1813) was still celebrated in nationalist myth. Roon, by contrast, believed that the Landwehr was both a politically and militarily false institution, limited in utility and lacking martial qualities. Roon's proposals for army reorganization met with strong opposition from the Prussian Landtag, which was dominated by the liberal German Progress Party, which wanted parliamentary control over the military budget. It took years of political fighting and the strong support of the new prime minister, Otto von Bismarck and Moltke, before Roon carried the day. Roon, center, with Otto von Bismarck (left) and Helmuth Graf von Moltke (right). The three leaders of Prussia in the 1860s.  National hero  After the successful outcome of the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Roon went from being widely disliked in Prussia to a national hero in still-disunited Germany. At the start of the Austro-Prussian War, Roon was promoted to General der Infanterie. He was present at the decisive victory at Königgrätz, under the command of Moltke. He received the Black Eagle at Nikolsburg on the road to Vienna. His army system was adopted after 1866 by the whole North German Confederation. In later years, his army system was copied throughout continental Europe. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, Roon was in attendance on Prussian King Wilhelm I. The war was a great victory for Prussia and Roon's contribution to success was considerable. He was created a Graf (count) on 19 January 1871, just after Moltke. In January 1873, he succeeded Bismarck (who continued to be Imperial Chancellor) as Minister President of Prussia. Ill-health compelled him to resign later that year, handing the job back to Bismarck. Roon was promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1873. Roon died in Berlin on 23 February 1879. He was interred in the Roon family crypt at Schloss Krobnitz, west of Görlitz. Memorials The armored cruiser SMS Roon, completed in 1906, was named for Albrecht von Roon.

The same is true of the AS/400 and it uses an object called the library list (\`*LIBL\`). This object doesn't exist on its own and is always associated with another object like a job or a job description (\`*JOBD\`). As of OS/400 V5R1 the user portion of the Library List can contain up to 250 library names. Prior to that it could only have 25 libraries. (This is something to keep in mind when selling software because on OS/400 V4R5 and below a job description with more than 25 libraries in its library list cannot be restored.) A job's library list consists of four sections: * System portion: Always at the top and contains AS/400 system libraries like \`QSYS\`, \`QHLPSYS\`, \`QUSRSYS\`, etc. The system portion can hold up to 15 library names. The default contents of the system portion are specified in the \`QSYSLIBL\` system value. The contents of the system portion can be changed for the current job to differ from \`QSYSLIBL\` by using the \`CHGSYSLIBL\` command. * Product portion: When a CL command is executed that specifies a production library, that library will be added to the product portion of the library list for the duration of the command. It follows the system portion and the O/S will maintain up to two libraries in it. * Current library: Is a special library associated with a user profile and there can only be one in the list at a time. This library is useful for programmers to have their personal library at the top of the list regardless of what the user portion is changed to. It can be changed locally using the \`CHGCURLIB\` command. To change it for the user on all future jobs use the \`CHGUSRPRF\` command. * User portion: The last part of the library list that contains all of the application libraries. The list is normally assigned to the job from the job description but for batch jobs this can be overridden using the \`SBMJOB\` command's \`INLLIBL\` parameter. A job's library list can be changed locally with the \`EDTLIBL\`(Edit Library List), \`CHGLIBL\`(Change Library List), \`ADDLIBLE\`(Add Library List Entry), and \`RMVLIBLE\`(Remove Library List Entry) command. As was mentioned above the user portion of the library list for any job can be stored in a job description so that when a job starts up it will use the list specified there. Some job descriptions specify the special value \`*SYSVAL\` which means that the library list can be found in the system value \`QUSRLIBL\`. The AS/400 Operating System will allow the programmer to delete a library that is in a job description or either of the library list system values provided there are no jobs locking the library. However, all future jobs that use these now tainted lists will fail to start.

It was initiated between 1420 and 1422 by Afonso, Count of Barcelos, the illegitimate son of John I of Portugal (and future Duke of Bragança), after his marriage to his second wife. His prodigeny would occupy the space until the Dukes of Braganza moved to Vila Viçosa, abandoning the palace. The 16th Century marked the beginning of period of ruin, which was aggravated during the 19th century, when the local population used the palace as a personal quarry. During the Estado Novo regime, a controversial restoration restored the Palace, while implying a grandeur that may not have existed. The Palace of the Dukes was classified as a National Monument () in 1910, and has been an official residence for the Presidency. History An engraving showing the ruins of the Paços dos Duques de Bragança The Terreiro da Misericórdia, showing the shadowy figure of the Palace in the background (right) The residence was ordered to be built in the first quarter of the 15th century (likely 1420 to 1422) by Afonso, Count of Barcelos, the illegitimate son of John, and future Duke of Braganza, following his return to Portugal after a series of diplomatic missions to the Courts of France, Venice, Aragon and Castile. The construction of this building marked the concretization of his second marriage, when he took residence in the town.António Carvalho Costa (1868), p.153 The project was given, as some authors have suggested, to French architect Antom. Yet, by 1442, it was still under construction when the Regent Peter came to Guimarães and stayed at the Palace, at the time conferring on his half-brother the title of 1st Duke of Braganza. The commission continued into 1461, when Afonso died:António Carvalho Costa (1868), p.3 the property and titles passed on to his brother, Fernando, although the widow, Constança de Noronha, continued to live at the residence and received the land rents from the holdings in Guimarães. In 1464, the title of Count of Guimarães is given to Fernando II, son of the Duke of Braganza, by King Afonso V (which was later renovated in 1475). Three years later, on 1 April 1478, the 2nd Duke of Branganza, died, followed two years later by the death of the widow of the 1st Duke of Braganza: the titles and vast land holdings passed on to Fernando II. During the 16th century there was a move towards monumental construction, increasing at the time the main floor over the principal gate. This was a period when the second Duke of Braganza, Fernando who pushed for a symmetrical design and layout.José Custódio Vieira da Silva (1996), p.32-33 The functional organization of the spaces, dates from these renovations and included: the first floor, its servants' quarters and support rooms, and the second floor, that was devoted to the residence of the nobles, structured around the chapel and divided into individual spaces for the Duke and Duchess. But, Fernando's move to Vila Viçosa during the 16th century, meant that the residence was closed for long periods. Most records on the buildings construction include the fact that the Palace was incomplete at the time that it was abandoned: Father Torcato Peixoto de Azevedo indicated that the residence had never really been completed in his Memórias (1692); which was also complemented by Father António de Carvalho da Costa (1706), who mentioned the same in his work Corografia Portuguesa; and Father Manuel da Mialhada also referred to the incomplete Palace of the Dukes. Transcribed in 1900 by Albano Bellino, a 29 December 1761 document indicated the plan and elevation of the Palace, without referencing the central courtyard. King John II at the time was very interested in curbing the seigneurial power of the nobility and concentrating his power. Fernando (supported by the King's cousin, the Infante Diogo, Duke of Viseu) protested and conspired with Isabella I of Castile, which resulted in his being accused of treason by King John II, when the Duke's correspondence was intercepted by the King's spies. By order of the King, the Duke's properties and possessions were confiscated, and his residence in Guimarães continued to be looked after as Crown property, even as Duke Fernando was judged and executed on 20 June 1483 in Évora. The house was cared for by carpenters João Domingos, and later his son-in-law Afonso Anes, who were appointed to head the renovations of the property by John II. In 1496, the properties of the House of Braganza were restored to Fernando II's oldest son Jaime, three years after returning from exile in Spain. Yet, Jaime chose to remain in Vila Viçosa after the family restoration, and as a result, the residence in Guimarães were closed. The Dukedom of Guimarães was given as dowry to Isabel, sister of the 5th Duke Teodósio I, in her marriage to her cousin the Infante Edward (on 21 August 1536), thus-by passing the palace onto a peripheral branch of hereditary successors to the House of Aviz. A century later, the space began a slow decline, which began innocently enough. On 20 October 1611, the Poor Clares nuns requested rock and stone from around the palace in order to repair their monastery. A similar request was made in 1666 by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin to King Afonso VI (10th Duke of Braganza), to utilize rock from the interior walls of the palace to construct the Convent of Piedade. On January 31, the municipal chamber intervened over the destruction occurring to the Palace, and on 4 February inspected and evaluated its condition in order to inform the King of the need to conserve its structure. The local government purposed funding the friars, and providing the stone from the barbican in the Castle of Guimarães, in exchange for stone in the Palace. As conditions continued to deteriorate the municipal chamber requested the roaming magistrate determine who stole stone from near the gate of Santa Cruz. On 26 November 1672, Pedro Vaz de Sampaio, master mason, was requested to replace the gate, since it was already ruined. There was a profound degradation in the following centuries, with more and more of its stone taken for construction in the city and its re-purposing as a barracks in 1807. At that time, the inhabitable part of the Palace was retiled by the almoxarife Jerónimo de Matos Feijó and served as the barracks for the 20th Regimental Infantry. Several public works were completed on 8 January 1819. By 30 December 1880, its importance as a historical building was made clear by the Portuguese Royal Association of Civil Architects and Archeologists (), as a second-order historical monument. Father António José Ferreira Caldas, writing in 1881, referred to the site as being in a state of ruins, serving as a barracks for various regiments and battalions. He made detailed description of what existed, including the grande courtyard, its main façade with one floor, lateral and posterior façades slightly taller, chapel door, the columns that supported the courtyard's gallery, its Flemish stained-glass windows in the chapel and diverse tiled chimneys. This was complimented in a similar report in 1886 by Vilhena Barbosa who also mentioned the columns in the northeastern lateral façade that supported the porch. Republic The front façade of the Palace, with its main gate The southeast corner of the Palace, showing a clear division between building styles At the beginning of the 20th century, the medieval structure was irredeemably corrupted. On 26 September 1933, the conservational director of the Alberto Sampaio Museum, Dr. Alfredo Guimarães, requested from António de Oliveira Salazar visit the ruined palace, which helped to motivate the reconstruction of the building. Architect Rogério de Azevedo was commissioned in 1936 to complete the restoration, forcing the abandonment of the space by the military. What would become a radical restoration was started in 1937, under the architect Rogério de Azevedo, which was both restorative and controversial. In 1940, a statue of Afonso Henriques is transferred to the ramp/entranceway of the Palace, alongside Rua Conde D. Afonso Henriques, by the municipal authority. The restoration was based on the analysis of other medieval palaces of the period, but influenced by the monumentalism of the period architects. As part of the ongoing restoration, the courtyard railing from the Monastery of São Miguel de Refojos is recycled for the palace in 1943. Also, as part of the project, in 1952 and again in 1955, the architects travelled to Brussels, Antwerp and to Loire region, to study the decorative solutions for the palace. Further, there was a confluence of other styles and motifs associated with the Estado Novo regime, including a politico-religious nationalism that saw Guimarães as the centre of the modern Portuguese nation. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Palace was later transformed into an official residence of the Presidente do Conselho and President of the Republic. In 1957, the landscaping of the space is undertaken (which also included the Campo de São Mamede) by landscape architect António Viana Barreto. As the restoration of the building was coming to an end, in 1958, the chapel was renovated (by sculptor Manuel Ventura Teixeira and Pintor António Lino) and the furniture was collected and installed by the Comissão para Aquisição de Mobiliário (Commission for Furniture Acquisition) in 1959. By 24 June 1959, the new Palace of the Dukes of Braganza was inaugurated and finally open to the public. Today, part of the property has been reconverted into a Museum, whose collection and disposition are to educate the public on its history during the 16th and 17th century. In its vast collection, are the tapestries of Pastrana, which narrate some of the events in North African conquests, attributed to Nuno Gonçalves (author of the polyptych in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora; a collection of porcelains from the Portuguese East India Company; a group of Portuguese dinner sets from important factories (such as Prado, Viana, Rocha Soares and Rato); and a collection of Flemish tapestries by Peter Paul Rubens, among others. Architecture The Palace is located in the urban setting of the historic centre of Guimarães on the top of Monte Latito, encircled by a forested park and green-space, intersected by several pedestrian trails. In its proximity to the southeast, the Chapel of Santa Cruz, to the north the Church of São Miguel do Castelo and the Castle of Guimarães. In a space to the left of the main ramp/entranceway is a monument erected to Afonso Henriques. Exterior The main entrance and ramp showing the two floors and entrance The courtyard and chapel entrance, showing the Romanesque era portico and exaggerated influences dating from the Estado Novo era Portrait of Catherine of Braganaza Structured around a central rectangular courtyard, the lateral buildings housing the official residences, while a chapel is located opposite the entrance. Its simple/basic form is one of the best examples of Portuguese late-medieval construction used by the nobility, comparable to the 14th century French palaces/buildings of the time. It was also used as an example for the Palace of the Kings of Majorca, in Perpignan, of which it is a faithful model.José Custódio Vieira da Silva (1996), p.32 The plan developed around a rectangular building with four rectangular towers, around an interior courtyard dominated by the chapel on the southeast wing. The spaces are articulated and staggered horizontal floors, covered with different roof tiles, in addition to with six tall chimneys. Each façades is made of granite, masonry block and interspersed by rectangular windows of varying styles: cruciform, stained-glass, standard and oblique. A few of the first floor windows are covered in metal grating. The northwest façade has an arch doorway surmounted by corbels and is recessed from the two towers. The superior floor is a balcony that runs the length of the interior courtyard, supported by corbels, which unite the guard towers. The lateral (northeast and southwest) façades are of a lower height and covered by trim and corbels, that supports the covered balcony, interspersed by openings at floor level. The southwest wing is broken by the body of the chapel, which extends away from the façade (identifiable by two large Flemish stained-glass windows), and is highlighted by a cantilever roof within the courtyard. The towers are all closed rectangular bodies, with watchtowers, interspersed by small windows. The interior patio, accessible from the main doorway, is a balcony that overlooks the courtyard: supported by Gothic arches on the main floor and columns on the second. At the roof-line, on all interior façades are balconies supported by granite corbels, while the chapel-side façade is highlighted by two isolated balconies (covered by tiled awnings) supported by similar corbels. The same façade is highlighted by a cantilever roof, supported by a rounded wooden arch and two supports decorated with columns. In the interior of this awning is a portal (consisting of four inset arches) preceded by a staircase, which gives access to the chapel. The gallery is covered by masonry stone on the main floor, and tiles on the second, with interior covering in wood. Interior The austere interior spaces include simple granite walls with ceilings and floors in wood. Spaces on the first floor are divided into several rooms, separated by narrow corridors that run perpendicular to the façades. In these spaces are the visitors reception area, storage, carpenters space, main hall and office of the director of the site. In the main wing is the unique staircase in the palace, consisting of four flights in granite. The intermediary floor, corresponds to the museum space, consisting of the towers and halls with rock fireplaces, including the Salão de Banquetes (Banquet Hall) and the Salão dos Passos Perdidos (\\"Hall of Lost Steps\\"), with roofs designed like the interior wooden keel of a boat. The last floor, was dedicated for the use of the President of the Republic, and is characterized by a succession of bedrooms with private bathrooms, between two suites located within the towers (for the President and Prime Minister. This floor is immediately accessible via the small elevator on the ground floor and staircase from the second floor cloister. The last floor of the posterior wing is marked by a succession of rooms and the chapel. The chapel has a single nave, which is covered by a wooden ceiling presenting visible joists. A straight narrow wooden choir, allows access to balconies which extend to the front of the church and the exterior facade, as well as the corridors of the remaining wards. The richly carved wood benches in the nave precede the elevated presbytery, which is delimited by a wooden guardrail.

The mountain range is part of the Transverse Ranges and lies between the Los Angeles Basin and the Mojave Desert, with Interstate 5 to the west and Interstate 15 to the east. The range lies in, and is surrounded by, the Angeles National Forest, with the San Andreas Fault as its northern border. The highest peak in the range is Mount San Antonio, commonly referred to as Mt. Baldy. Mount Wilson is another famous peak, famed for the Mount Wilson Observatory and the antenna farm that houses many of the transmitters for local media. The observatory may be visited by the public. On October 10, 2014, President Obama designated the area the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. To date, The Trust for Public Land has protected more than 3,800 acres of land in the San Gabriel Mountains, its foothills and the Angeles National Forest. Geography Much of the range features rolling peaks. The range lacks craggy features, but contains a large number of canyons and is generally very rugged and difficult to traverse. The San Gabriel Mountains are in effect a large fault block that was uplifted and then dissected by numerous rivers and washes. Setting and elevation The highest elevation, Mount San Antonio (Mount Baldy) at , rises towards the eastern extremity of the range which extends from the Cajon Pass (Interstate 15) on the east, where the San Gabriel Mountain Range meets the San Bernardino Mountain Range, westward to meet the Santa Susana Mountains at Newhall Pass (Interstate 5). North of San Fernando, the San Gabriel Mountains crest abruptly up to almost . Pacoima and Big Tujunga Canyons cut through the range just east of San Fernando, carrying runoff into the San Fernando Valley. Little Tujunga Canyon Road bridges the range in this area, connecting the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Clara River valley in the north. Towering over Big Tujunga Canyon north of Big Tujunga Reservoir is Mount Gleason, which at , is the highest in this region of the San Gabriels. South of the gorge are the southern \\"foothills\\" of the mountains, which rise abruptly above the Los Angeles Basin and give rise to the Arroyo Seco, a tributary of the Los Angeles River. Southeast of Big Tujunga Canyon, the southern front range of the San Gabriels gradually grows in elevation, culminating in notable peaks such as Mount Wilson at . On the north the range is abruptly dissected by the canyon of the West Fork San Gabriel River. Even further north the range slopes up into the towering main crest of the San Gabriels, a sweeping arc-shaped massif in length that includes most of the highest peaks in the range: Waterman Mountain, at ; Mount Islip, at , Mount Baden-Powell, at , Pine Mountain, at , and finally Mount San Antonio, the highest peak in the range at . On the north slopes of the San Gabriel crest, the northern ranks of mountains drop down incrementally to the floor of the Mojave Desert in a much more gradual manner than the sheer southern flank. The Angeles Crest Highway, one of the main routes across the San Gabriels, runs through this area from west to east. Little Rock, Big Rock and Sheep Creeks drain off the northern part of the mountains, forming large alluvial fans as they descend into the Mojave. To the east, the San Andreas Fault cuts across the range, forming a series of long, straight and narrow depressions, including Swarthout Valley and Lone Pine Canyon. South of Mount San Antonio, San Antonio Creek drains the mountains, cutting the deep San Antonio Canyon. San Gabriel River canyon, looking west. East of San Antonio Canyon, the range gradually loses elevation, and the highest peaks in this section of the mountain range are in the south, rising dramatically above the cities of Claremont, Upland and Rancho Cucamonga. However, there are still several notable peaks in this region, including Telegraph Peak, at , Cucamonga Peak, at , and Ontario Peak, rising . Lytle Creek, flowing generally southeast, drains most of the extreme eastern San Gabriels. The range terminates at Cajon Pass, through which runs Interstate 15, and beyond which rise the even higher San Bernardino Mountains. Locale The Range is bound on the north by the Antelope Valley and the Mojave Desert and to the south by the communities of greater Los Angeles area. In the western portion of the San Gabriel Mountain Range, the Sierra Pelona Ridge stretches from approximately Soledad Canyon (14 Freeway and railroad right-of-way), formed by the Santa Clara River. The Sierra Pelona Ridge includes Liebre Mountain, Sawmill Mountain, Grass Mountain, Redrock Peak, Burnt Peak, most of which is part of the Angeles National Forest, but also features several rural communities. Hydrology Melting snow and rain runoff on the south side of the San Gabriels' highest mountains give rise to its largest river, the San Gabriel River. Just to the west of Mount Hawkins, a north-south divide separates water running down the two main forks of the river and their tributaries. The West Fork, beginning at Red Box Saddle, runs eastward, and the East Fork, starting north of Mount San Antonio, flows south and west through a steep, rugged and precipitous gorge. The two meet at San Gabriel Reservoir, and turn south, boring through the southern portion of the San Gabriels, emptying out of the mountains near Azusa into the urban San Gabriel Valley, and eventually to the Pacific Ocean near Seal Beach.

Snow can fall above elevation during frontal passages between November and April, but is most common in December through March. Annual precipitation totals are mostly in excess of on the coastal (southern) slopes above elevation, with up to falling in some areas above . The coastal (south) side of the range receives more precipitation than the desert (northern) side. The highest precipitation is found in the central and eastern parts of the range (Mt. Wilson to Mt. San Antonio). Annual precipitation totals are highly variable from year to year, and can be extremely high during wet El Nino years (sometimes over , with single storm totals over ). Runoff from the mountains during big storms often produces flooding in adjacent foothill communities (especially in areas denuded by wildfires). Fires are a problem during summer and fall, before the rains come, especially during dry \\"Santa Ana\\" wind events. The range is mostly smog free above elevation, above the inversion layer. The large telescope installation at Mt. Wilson is a testimony to the clear atmospheric conditions that prevail, although light pollution from the L.A. basin below has hindered telescope activities in recent decades. Geology Granitic and metasedimentary rocks are the primary constituent of the San Gabriel Mountains. Metasedimentary rocks were attached to the north american craton in the Precambrian eon, and granitic rocks formed throughout the Mesozoic as oceanic plates subducted underneath the north American west coast. Like nearly all of the other mountains in the Transverse Ranges, the San Gabriels are a series of fault blocks that were uplifted in the Cenozoic.USGS Tectonic uplift rates and erosion rates systematically increase as topography steepens eastward in the San Gabriel Mountains, where the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults meetDiBiase, R.A., Rossi, M.W. and Neely, A.B., 2018.

Vegetation and wildfire controls on sediment yield in bedrock landscapes. Geophysical Research Letters, 40(6), pp.1093-1097.. Ecology There are both areas of conifer as well as broadleaf forestation, including the presence of some endemic taxa. Conifer (pine, fir, cedar) and oak forests are most widespread above 5,000 feet where the precipitation is above 30 inches (the central and eastern high San Gabriels). In the wetter areas, madrone and bay laurel trees also occur in places, and ferns are common. Trees like willow, alder and cottonwood are also found throughout the range along the stream courses (riparian habitat), even at lower elevations. Chaparral (dense shrub, brush and small tree) vegetation is widespread where there is not continuous tall tree cover, especially at lower elevations. Chaparral is highly adapted to fire, and replaces trees for decades after fires. There is a subspecies of the Leather Oak which is found only within the San Gabriel Mountains.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Leather Oak, Quercus durata. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and Environment. Washington DC The Rift Zone along the San Andreas Fault produces numerous springs, sag ponds, and wetland areas that are critical habitat for a variety of native species. Larger animals include California mule deer, California black bear, San Pedro Martir coyote and the rarely seen mountain lion or cougar. Smaller mammals include raccoon, opossum, skunk and bobcats. Golden and bald eagles are found rarely, but hawks are common. Rattlesnakes are common and often encountered on trails by hikers.  Transportation  Telegraph Peak as seen from the ridge of Devils Backbone on Mount San Antonio. The main road that runs through the San Gabriel Mountains is the Angeles Crest Highway, State Route 2. It starts in the southwest at the city of La Cañada Flintridge and ends at its junction with State Route 138, just past Wrightwood, near the Victor Valley and the western Cajon Valley. Past its junction with Angeles Forest Highway, traveling east, Angeles Crest Highway features blind curves, various bumps, and potholes. This section of the \\"Crest\\" is closed during the winter due to rockfall and avalanche hazards. State Route 2, just past Mountain High, is called the Big Pines Highway all the way to the Route 138 junction. Another key county route which connects Angelenos to, and through, the mountains is Angeles Forest Highway. Angeles Forest Highway begins 11 miles northeast of La Cañada Flintridge at its Angeles Crest Highway junction. Ending near Acton, it allows easy access to the central Forest and the fast-growing Antelope Valley. Because the \\"Forest\\" and the 11-mile \\"Crest\\" portion leading to La Cañada Flintridge is well traveled by Antelope Valley commuters, its road maintenance is much better, and it is open much of the winter. State Route 39 connected the city of Azusa with the Angeles Crest Highway until it was seriously damaged by landslides, first in 1978, and again in 2005. The highway was opened to emergency crews in February 2003. The proposed State Route 39 Roadway Rehabilitation Project would begin five miles (8 km) north of Crystal Lake Recreation Area Campground. People heading to Mount Waterman must now travel west to Pasadena and then travel on the Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) in La Cañada Flintridge, a nearly two-hour trip. Reopening Highway 39 would cut the drive- time to the Waterman Ski Area in half and shorten the trip east to Wrightwood. According to the Caltrans District Seven \\"Inside Seven\\" Newsletter, \\"Two projects that will address those issues and get the highway reopened are scheduled for construction soon. The first, building two retaining walls near the city of Azusa from Old San Gabriel Canyon Road to approximately four miles south of SR-2, could begin in mid-2009. The second, a $45 million project to reconstruct the roadway, construct soldier pile retaining walls, repair drainage systems, install rock fall protection, and provide asphalt concrete overlay and traffic striping, should begin in fall 2010.\\"(source) In 2011, the planned repair of the road was abruptly terminated, due to concern of high future maintenance costs, and potential impact on the local bighorn sheep population. However, in October 2016, Caltrans announced it was again considering plans to re-open the road, after pressure from local communities. Recreation In the winter, snowboarding and skiing are quite popular in the San Gabriels, at Mountain High and Mt. Baldy. The two other resorts, Mount Waterman and Kratka Ridge, are rarely open. In the summer, canyoneering, hiking, backpacking, picnicking and camping are some of the activities popular with visitors. From time to time, a hiker gets lost or stuck on a mountain ledge, or may fall downhill. Some of the more extreme cases of emergency search-and-rescue efforts will often be given air time on Los Angeles television and radio newscasts. The Pacific Crest Trail passes along the mountain ridge. During the winter, many Southern California mountaineers climb a variety of snow routes and even some ice routes in the San Gabriel Mountains. Baldy Bowl is by far the most popular route, getting hundreds of climbers per season. There are many other routes, offering a variety of choices. Rock climbing is not as common in the San Gabriel Range as it is in neighboring areas, as this range is famous for loose rock. Various faults crisscross the range, making it one of the steepest and fastest-growing ranges in the world. Plate tectonic activity breaks up most rock, making it unsuitable for rock climbing. Williamson Rock was the most famous climbing area, until it was closed for climbing. There are many other craggy areas scattered about the range that provide mostly traditional climbing opportunities.

The name comes from the landfill's location along the banks of the Fresh Kills estuary in western Staten Island. The landfill opened in 1948 as a temporary landfill, but by 1955 it became the largest landfill in the world, and it remained so until its closure in 2001. At the peak of its operation, in 1986, Fresh Kills received 29,000 tons of residential waste per day. From 1991 until its closing it was the only landfill to accept New York City's residential waste. It consists of four mounds which range in height from and hold about 150 million tons of solid waste. The archaeologist Martin Jones characterizes it as \\"among the largest man-made structures in the history of the world.\\" In October 2008, reclamation of the site began for a multi-phase, 30-year site redevelopment. The landfill is eventually expected to be developed as Freshkills Park. History=Opening New York's municipal incinerators peaked in capacity with twenty-one plants in 1937 and declined during World War II when salvage and conservation programs reduced the use and discard of combustible materials. The result was the closing of nine of the city's incinerators and a sharp reduction in the combustion of waste by 1944. By 1946, only ten incinerators were in operation, with capacity having declined by half since 1937. This meant more solid waste for the city's eight landfills to handle. However, the two landfills in Brooklyn and the two in the Bronx had, respectively, just one and two years left before reaching capacity. Only one landfill, Edgemere Landfill in Queens, had a long-term future, and as such, an alternative site had to be found. In 1946, New York City purchased a site, which was considered worthless swampland in what was then a rural agricultural area in Staten Island, for a proposed three-year municipal waste dump, as a temporary solution to the closing of the Rikers Island Landfill. The plan was endorsed by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman, Robert Moses. He wanted the area to be developed as Staten Island's industrial base, as it was opposite the Arthur Kill from the heavy industry of New Jersey. Moses saw the project as key to the development of the island, and with it, the possibility of more parkland, highways, industry, and possibly even an airport. Staten Island residents and their representatives opposed the plan. Assemblyman Edmund P. Radigan introduced a secession bill in the Legislature.Proposal to Secede from City Assailed in the New York Times on January 12, 1947 (subscription required) A bill was passed (later vetoed by the governor) requiring all garbage to be incinerated before being placed in a landfill. Ellsworth B. Buck, called for the federal government to step in and stop the project. Cornelius Hall, when he was the city's public works commissioner, opposed the project, but when he became the Borough President of Staten Island, he surprised residents by backing the plan, saying: \\"I am firmly convinced that a limited landfill project can be undertaken at Fresh Kills, a project that would prove of great value to the island through the reclamation of valuable land from now worthless marshland. Hall intended the landfill to be part of a proposed belt highway along Staten Island's west shore, which was approved by Moses in exchange for his support of the landfill. Hall went on to say \\"I want [landfilling] operations limited to [a] period not to exceed three years ... I am going along with this proposal because I believe ... we are in a position to use this fill to our advantage, for the development of the West Shore of Staten Island, which is essential.\\". The talk of using Fresh Kills for only three years may have been a ploy to allow Hall to save face politically. As described in an inter-departmental report from 1946: \\"Because of the substantial sums involved in the preparation and acquisition of the [Fresh Kills] site, [in order to justify this expense] the City must dispose of refuse at this location for a number of years.\\" One of the first steps taken was the dredging of the marsh to allow the passage of the city's garbage scows. The landfill accepted its first scow in April 1948. Shortly before the landfill opened, an expansion of the landfill project was approved by the City Planning Commission, which called for a project organized in 13 sections. The landfill was planned to be structured like a layer cake, with a layer of garbage covered by a layer of ash (the remains of burnable trash from the city's incinerators), another layer of garbage, and then a layer of dirt to contain the smell. At the end of the landfill's usable life, new real estate would be created, allowing the landfill to top off at above sea level. The plan called for Fresh Kills to be used for 20 years, then developed as a multiuse area with residential, recreational, and industrial components. In 1950, the height was increased to . By 1955, Fresh Kills was the largest landfill in the world, serving as the principal landfill for household garbage collected in New York City. Operations A D7 Tractor with two Athey Wagons dumping, 1973. Operations during the 1960s were conducted in three locations named \\"Plant 1\\", \\"Plant 2\\", and \\"Brookfield Avenue.\\" Plant #1 was located at the site of an old factory on the south side of the junction of the Great Fresh Kills, and Little Fresh Kills. It was reachable via Muldoon Avenue. Plant #2 was located a bit upstream on the north side of Fresh Kills near where Richmond Creek branches off. It was reachable from Victory Boulevard. The Brookfield Avenue site was north of the Arthur Kill Road and Brookfield Avenue intersection. Plant 1 was the administrative headquarters, and also the leading repair facility. Plant 1 and Plant 2 were for marine unload operations. Barges arrived from the other boroughs (primarily Manhattan and Brooklyn). Refuse was picked up by a crane (called a \\"digger\\") using a clamshell bucket and deposited in a caterpillar-tracked side-dump vehicle called an \\"Athey wagon\\" (not related to the equipment of the same name used for oil drilling). Two wagons were then pulled to the active dumpsite by a tractor (Caterpillar D7, D8, D9) and emptied. The Plant 1 digger was electric, but the Plant 2 one was steam-powered. The diggers were supplemented by other cranes (mostly mounted on barges). A typical day would unload twelve barges (six at each plant). Operations were carried out from 8am to midnight six days a week. The midnight to 8 am shift was for maintenance. A wooden trestle bridge was built across Fresh Kills creek to expand the Plant 2 operating area. This bridge allowed dumping east to Richmond Avenue. As the actual dump site moved further from paved roads, it became more difficult for trucks to unload. The Brookfield Avenue site was opened in 1966 and used exclusively for trucks. During this period, the dump was in a state of flux. Original plans showed the dump with a twenty-year lifespan. One proposal for the West Shore Expressway bridge across Fresh Kills included a tide gate, which would have blocked Plant 2's marine access. The bridge, when finally built in 1959, actually enhanced operations. The bridge was finished long before the rest of the expressway and was used by workers to travel between the two plants. Issues Initially, the land where the landfill was located was a salt marsh in which there were tidal wetlands, forests, and freshwater wetlands. The subsoil was made up of clay, with sand and silt as the top layer of soil. The tidal marsh, which helped to clean and oxygenate the water that passed through it, was destroyed by the dump. The fauna were largely replaced by herring gulls. The native plant species were driven out by the common reed, a grass which grows abundantly in disturbed areas and can tolerate both fresh and brackish water. The stagnant, deoxygenated water was also less attractive to waterfowl, and their population decreased. Samuel Kearing, who had served as sanitation commissioner under Mayor John V. Lindsay, remembered in 1970 his first visit to the Fresh Kills project: > It had a certain nightmare quality. ... I can still recall looking down on > the operation from a control tower and thinking that Fresh Kills, like > Jamaica Bay, had for thousands of years been a magnificent, teeming, > literally life-enhancing tidal marsh. And in just twenty-five years, it was > gone, buried under millions of tons of New York City's refuse. Animals were also a problem. Feral dog packs roamed the dump and were a hazard to employees. Rats also posed a problem. Attempts to suppress the population with poison failed. The area was declared a wild bird sanctuary, and some hawks, falcons, and owls were brought in. The area became a popular spot for birdwatching. Because of the predatory birds, rat sightings, especially during the day, dropped dramatically. From 1987 through 1988, in an environmental disaster known as the syringe tide, significant amounts of medical waste from the Fresh Kills landfill, including hypodermic syringes and raw garbage, washed up onto beaches on the Jersey Shore, in New York City, and on Long Island. This event forced the closing of beaches on the Atlantic coast. After much deliberation, New York City was required to pay $1 million for past pollution damages as well as pay for the cleanup. No reparations were paid to the business owners on the Jersey Shore for revenues lost during the months of inactivity. Closing As a result of intense community pressure, a state law was passed in 1996 requiring that the landfill cease accepting solid waste by the end of 2001. By 1997, two of the four landfill mounds were closed and covered with a thick, impermeable cap. The landfill received its last barge of garbage on March 22, 2001. At its peak of operation in 1986-87, Fresh Kills received as much as 29,000 tons of trash per day. It was estimated that, if kept open, the landfill would have eventually reached a height of or more. At this height, it would have been taller than Todt Hill making it the highest point on the East Coast south of Mount Desert Island in Maine. Under local pressure from Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, and with the support of mayor Rudy Giuliani, New York state governor George Pataki, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the landfill site was finally closed on March 22, 2001, though it was temporarily reopened soon after for the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan (see below). The garbage once destined for Fresh Kills was shipped to landfills in other states, primarily in Pennsylvania, but also in Virginia and Ohio. Some garbage was also sent to New Jersey for incineration. September 11, 2001 and aftermath Worker combing through debris from the World Trade Center at the Fresh Kills landfill; Manhattan is visible in the distance After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fresh Kills was temporarily re- opened to be used as a sorting ground for roughly one-third of the rubble from Ground Zero. More than 1,600 personal effects were retrieved during this time. About 1.6 million tons of material obtained from Ground Zero was taken to the landfill for sorting. Thousands of detectives and forensic evidence specialists worked for over 1.7 million hours at Fresh Kills Landfill to try to recover remnants of the people killed in the attacks. A final count of 4,257 human remains was retrieved, but only 300 people were identified from these remains. A memorial was built in 2011, which also honors those whose identities were not able to be determined from the debris. The remaining waste was buried in a portion of the landfill; it is highly likely that this debris still contains fragmentary human remains. Freshkills Park project A depiction of the future Fresh Kills Park The Fresh Kills site is to be transformed into reclaimed wetlands, recreational facilities and landscaped public parkland, the most significant expansion of the New York City parks since the development of the chain of parks in the Bronx during the 1890s. The new park will be designed by James Corner Field Operations, the landscape architecture firm also responsible for the design of the High Line in Manhattan. In January 2005, Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro announced plans to open three roads leading out of the former landfill to regular traffic, as part of an effort to ease the road congestion. Construction on the actual park began in 2008. The three-phase development of the park, which will include a September 11 memorial, is expected to last 30 years. The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published for public review in May 2008. As of mid-2011, construction drawings for the first phase of development in the South Park section were completed. The Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for implementing the plan for turning the landfill into a park. They used a Draft Master Plan that integrated three aspects—programming, wildlife, and circulation—and proposed five main parks: the Confluence, North Park, South Park, East Park, and West Park. With an eventual size of , Freshkills Park will be three times the size of the 843-acre Central Park. It will consist of a variety of public spaces and facilities for a multitude of activity types. The site is large enough to support many sports and programs including nature trails, horseback riding, mountain biking, community events, outdoor dining, sports fields, and canoeing/kayaking. Schmul Park, the first section of Freshkills Park, opened to the public in 2012. Although the park is not scheduled for completion until 2037, the Parks Department reported that in 2010–11 two hundred species of wildlife had been seen in the former landfill. These included red-winged blackbirds, American goldfinches, red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, osprey, ring-necked pheasants, tree swallows, turkey vultures, and northern snapping turtles. Staten Island Transfer Station Staten Island Transfer Station occupies a small portion of the site of the former Fresh Kills Landfill near the old Plant #2 at . The transfer station—an integral part of New York City's Solid Waste Management Plan—is expected to process an average of 900 tons per day of Staten Island-generated residential and municipal waste. The waste is compacted inside the facility into sealed by intermodal shipping containers. These containers are then loaded, four containers each car, onto flatbed rail cars to be hauled by rail to a Republic Services landfill in South Carolina. The eight-mile (13 km) Staten Island Railway freight service, which connects the facility to the national rail freight network via the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, was reactivated on April 2007, after it had been closed in 1991.

James Porteous was born in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. His father, William Porteous, had been a wheelwright and blacksmith who built and repaired carriages, wagons and farm equipment. After learning his basic skills, James Porteous emigrated to the United States in 1873, at the age of 25, and settled in Santa Barbara, California. In 1877, he moved to Fresno and established a wagon shop, where he prospered, manufacturing buggies and heavy wagons. Having worked with farmers, Porteous recognised the dependence of the San Joaquin Valley on irrigation and the requirement for a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil, and he went about the task of devising an earth moving scraper for that purpose. Porteous invented an improvement on the simple buckboard, a horse-drawn earth scraper, and refined his Buck Scraper, as he first called it, through several design improvements. His ideas, combined with those of fellow-inventors William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, all of Selma, California led to the Fresno scraper (1883). Porteous purchased patents held by Deidrick and jointly by partners Dusy and McCall as he perfected his machine. The basic design forms the basis of most modern earth moving scrapers, having the ability to not only scrape and move a quantity of soil, but also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually. The blade scooped up the soil, instead of merely pushing it along, and ran along a C-shaped bowl which could be adjusted in order to alter the angle of the bucket to the ground, so that the dirt could be deposited in low spots. This design was so revolutionary and economical that it has influenced the design of modern bulldozer blades and earth-movers to this day. Porteous formed the Fresno Agricultural Works, which between 1884 and 1910 produced thousands of Fresno scrapers. The machines were used in agriculture and land leveling, as well as road and railroad grading and the general construction industry. They played a vital role in the construction of the Panama Canal and later served the US Army in World War I. It was one of the most important agricultural and civil engineering machines ever made. In 1991 the Fresno scraper was designated as an International Historic Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It was featured prominently in the Fresno Metropolitan Museum.

Patriarchal blessings are modeled after the blessing given by Jacob to each of his sons prior to his death. It is taught that they are gifts of knowledge and strength of one's coming challenges and blessings. In early Mormonism The first Latter Day Saint patriarchal blessings were performed by Joseph Smith Sr., the father of Joseph Smith, who ordained his father to the role of patriarch on December 18, 1833. Smith Sr. gave his son a blessing on December 9, 1834, prophesying that the younger Smith would establish Zion, subdue his enemies, enjoy his posterity to the latest generation, and \\"stand on the earth\\" to witness the Second Coming.Patriarchal blesing given by Joseph Smith Sr., Patriarch of The Church of the Latter Day Saints, to his son Joseph Smith Jr. on 9 December 1834. That same day, Joseph Smith Sr. gathered all of his children and their spouses together to give each of them Patriarchal blessings. Before Joseph Sr. died on September 14, 1840, he ordained his eldest living son, Hyrum Smith, to succeed him as Patriarch to the Church. From that time forward, Hyrum gave patriarchal blessings until his own death on June 27, 1844. In the LDS Church In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a patriarchal blessing is given when an authorized patriarch (a man ordained to the priesthood office of patriarch) places his hands on the head of the recipient and pronounces said blessing. The recipient must have previously received a recommendation for the blessing from his or her bishop. This is dependent on an interview by which the bishop determines the applicant's worthiness and readiness. The purpose of a patriarchal blessing is (1) to identify the tribe of Israel to which some people belong, others who do not are then \\"adopted\\" in and given the same blessings; (2) to bless the member with knowledge and the spiritual gifts that may be obtained by obedience to Gospel principles; (3) to give advice or help to the individual (often this includes foretelling of possible future events, opportunities, and temptations). Within the church, a patriarchal blessing is considered to be a revelation for the recipient, with the promises made in the blessing considered conditional upon the recipient's obedience to Gospel principles. A person is informed of the tribe of Israel to which they belong. This is done to acknowledge the fulfillment of the church doctrine that through baptism members become part of the house of Israel. Additionally, it is believed that each tribe differs slightly and a person may come to understand the unique circumstances of his or her life better by knowing to which tribe they belong. The differences between the tribes are generally acknowledged to arise from the differences in the blessings Jacob pronounced upon his sons and Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. A patriarchal blessing is usually pronounced upon a member only once. In certain rare circumstances, a person may receive permission to receive an additional patriarchal blessing. The blessing is usually performed in the home of the patriarch or of the seeker. In general, only close family members, such as parents or the person's spouse, are allowed to be present. The patriarch places his hands on the seated person's head and speaks the blessing aloud. A record of the blessing is made at the same time. Transcribed copies of all blessings are stored in church records and are considered by the church to be revelation. Members receive a copy of the blessing, and are advised to consult it throughout their lives. Since adherents believe the blessings are direct revelation from God, the church advises members to treat them as sacred, not to be shared casually with others. Any member found worthy and spiritually mature by their priesthood leader may receive a patriarchal blessing. Individuals who have been members from childhood generally ask to receive their patriarchal blessing as adolescents. According to former church president Ezra Taft Benson, \\"A patriarchal blessing is the inspired and prophetic statement of your life’s mission together with blessings, cautions, and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give.\\"Ezra Taft Benson, Ensign, May 1986, pgs. 43-44 Blessings given in the 19th century often made use of themes, such as millennialism and polygamy, that are not common in today's blessings. During his presidency, Joseph Fielding Smith advised patriarchs to be conservative in their blessings unless \\"especially inspired otherwise\\". Although they may not be ordained patriarchs, every Latter-day Saint father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood can pronounce blessings upon his child or spouse, as necessary. Such blessings do not reveal the Tribe of Israel to which a person belongs. The church encourages families to create their own records of such blessings, but does not accept them into the official church archives in Salt Lake City as they would a blessing from an ordained patriarch. Those who have received a patriarchal blessing are told to read it \\"humbly, prayerfully, and frequently.\\" Only by following the counsel in a patriarchal blessing can one receive the blessings contained therein. According to historian D. Michael Quinn, patriarchs were paid in the early days of the LDS Church. The practice of paying patriarchs diminished in the 20th century and was officially ended in 1943. \\"'Both the Presiding Patriarch and local stake patriarchs charged a fee. In the 1840s the fee was $1 per patriarchal blessing at Nauvoo; by the end of the nineteenth century it had increased to $2 per blessing. Joseph Smith Sr. gave patriarchal blessings without payment of a fee, but would not record them. 'Uncle' John Smith commented that he \\"lived very poor ever since we left Kirtland Ohio\\" (from January 1838 until January 1844). Then his nephew, Joseph Smith, ordained him a patriarch 'through which office I obtained a comfortable living.' \\"....Patriarchal blessing fees ended in 1902, although patriarchs were allowed to accept unsolicited donations. Not until 1943 did church authorities prohibit patriarchs from accepting gratuities for giving blessings.\\"D. Michael Quinn, \\"The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power,\\" Chap 6, Signature Books, 1997. Lineage As with the pre-1844 church led by Joseph Smith, an important part of patriarchal blessing in the LDS Church is the declaration of lineage.June 28, 1957, in a letter to all stake presidents. Quoted in Bruce R. McConkie's Mormon Doctrine (\\"Patriarchal blessings contemplate an inspired declaration of the lineage of the recipient...\\"). Members receiving the blessing are told to which of the twelve Israelite tribes they belong. Opinions differ as to whether the lineage is intended to mean literal ancestry, or whether the lineage is metaphorical or adoptive, as there are many recorded instances of children having a different lineage from their parents. Daniel H. Ludlow has said \\"in a patriarchal blessing, lineage is being declared ... when terms indicating direct descent are used, such as 'son of,' 'daughter of,' 'seed of,' 'blood of,' 'descendant of,' or 'from the loins of.'\\" Daniel H. Ludlow, \\"Of the House of Israel\\", Ensign, January 1991. The church also teaches that \\"[b]ecause each of us has many bloodlines running in us, two members of the same family may be declared as being of different tribes in Israel\\".\\"Patriarchal Blessings\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-11. In the early 19th and 20th centuries, members were more likely to believe they were literally descended from a certain tribe. After the priesthood ban, black people were still allowed patriarchal blessings but were denied declaration of lineage out of policy. However, the guidelines were inconsistent. In Brazil, this was interpreted to mean that if a patriarch pronounced a lineage, then the member was not a descendant of Cain and was therefore eligible for the priesthood, despite physical or genealogical evidence of African ancestry. After the 1978 revelation, patriarchs sometimes declared lineage in patriarchal blessings for black members, but sometimes they did not declare a lineage. Some black members have asked for and received new patriarchal blessings including a lineage. In 1961, the Church Historian's Office reported that other lineages had been given, including from Cain. In 1971, the Presiding Patriarch stated that non-Israelite tribes should not be given as a lineage in a patriarchal blessing. In a 1980 address to students at Brigham Young University, James E. Faust attempted to assure listeners that if they had no declared lineage in their patriarchal blessing, that the Holy Ghost would \\"purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham.\\" The overwhelming majority of blessings declare the recipient to be a member of the tribe of Ephraim or Manasseh. Ephraim is the dominant tribe declared for people of European descent and Manasseh dominates for Pacific Islanders and South Americans. Jews have typically been assigned to the tribe of Judah. In Community of Christ In Community of Christ, part of the Latter Day Saint movement, the term patriarchal blessing was renamed \\"evangelist's blessing\\" in 1985, to reflect the change in terminology from patriarch to the gender-neutral \\"Evangelist\\" when women were first ordained to offices of the Priesthood. An evangelist's blessing may be said for families, congregations, and individuals. In recent years, practices have changed so that the blessing, formerly performed only once in a person's life, can be given more than once, especially during times of great change or turmoil in an individual's life. Although tribal lineage was revealed in earlier years, that practice has decreased. Criticisms Some former Mormons and LDS Church critics have said that patriarchal blessings are similar to fortune telling, and that like fortune telling the practice unfairly gives members false information that members will often later use to make major life decisions. According to an article from Mormonism Research Ministry, the blessings' fulfillment are often conditioned on members' faithfulness to the church, helping keep members obedient to church leaders and blaming themselves rather than the patriarch when the promises are not fulfilled.

A hoe is an ancient and versatile agricultural and horticultural hand tool used to shape soil, remove weeds, clear soil, and harvest root crops. Shaping the soil includes piling soil around the base of plants (hilling), digging narrow furrows (drills) and shallow trenches for planting seeds or bulbs. Weeding with a hoe includes agitating the surface of the soil or cutting foliage from roots, and clearing soil of old roots and crop residues. Hoes for digging and moving soil are used to harvest root crops such as potatoes. Types Cultivating tool, a pull or draw hoe There are many kinds of hoes of varied appearances and purposes. Some have multiple functions while others have singular and specific functionality. here are two general types of hoe: draw hoes for shaping soil and scuffle hoes for weeding and aerating soil. A draw hoe has a blade set at approximately a right angle to the shaft. The user chops into the ground and then pulls (draws) the blade towards them. Altering the angle of the handle can cause the hoe to dig deeper or more shallowly as the hoe is pulled. A draw hoe can easily be used to cultivate soil to a depth of several inches. A typical design of draw hoe, the \\"eye hoe\\", has a ring in the head through which the handle is fitted. This design has been used since Roman times. A scuffle hoe is used to scrape the surface of the soil, loosen the top inch or so, and to cut the roots of, remove, and disrupt the growth of weeds efficiently. These are primarily of two different designs: the Dutch hoe and the hoop hoe. The term \\"hand hoe\\" most commonly refers to any type of light-weight, short-handled hoe, although it may be used simply to contrast hand-held tools against animal or machine pulled tools.

According to Hartzell (1987, p. 29), \\"The hoedag [was] originally called skindvic hoe... Hans Rasmussen, legendary contractor and timber farm owner, is credited with having invented the curved, convex, round-nosed hoedag blade which is widely used today\\" (emphasis added). * The mortar hoe is a tool specific to the manual mixing of mortar and concrete, and has the appearance of a typical square-bladed draw hoe with the addition of large holes in the blade. Scuffle hoes * The Dutch hoe is designed to be pushed or pulled through the soil to cut the roots of weeds just under the surface. A Dutch hoe has a blade \\"sharp on every side so as to cut either forwards and backwards\\". The blade must be set in a plane slightly upwardly inclined in relation to the dual axis of the shaft. The user pushes the handle to move the blade forward, forcing it below the surface of the soil and maintaining it at a shallow depth by altering the angle of the handle while pushing. A scuffle hoe can easily cultivate soil and remove weeds from the surface layer. * The hoop hoe, also known as the \\"action hoe\\", oscillating, hula, stirrup, pendulum weeder, or \\"swivel hoe\\") has a double-edge blade that bends around to form a rectangle attached to the shaft. Weeds are cut just below the surface of the soil as the blade is pushed and pulled. The back and forth motion is highly effective at cutting weeds in loose or friable soil. The width of the blade typically ranges between 3-7 inches. The head is a loop of flat, sharpened strap metal. However, it is not as efficient as a draw hoe for moving soil. * The collinear hoe or collineal hoe has a narrow, razor-sharp blade which is used to slice the roots of weeds by skimming it just under the surface of the soil with a sweeping motion; it is unsuitable for tasks like soil moving and chopping. It was designed by Eliot Coleman in the late 1980s. * The swoe hoe is a modern, one-sided cutting hoe, being a variant of the Dutch hoe.

The modern view is that, rather than nutrients being released, the crop simply benefits from the removal of competing plants. The introduction of the horse hoe, together with the better-known seed drill, brought about the great increase farming productivity seen during the British Agricultural Revolution. * Fork hoes, (also known as prong hoes, tined hoes or bent forks) are hoes that have two or more tines at right angles to the shaft.

The hand-plough (mr) was depicted in predynastic Egyptian art, and hoes are also mentioned in ancient documents like the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 18th century BC) and the Book of Isaiah (c. 8th century BC). The human damage caused by long-term use of short-handled hoes, which required the user to bend over from the waist to reach the ground, and caused permanent, crippling lower back pain to farm workers, resulted, after struggle led by César Chávez with political help from Governor Jerry Brown in the California Supreme Court declaring the short-handled hoe to be an unsafe hand tool that was banned under California law in 1975.

While not as accurate as the traditional trowel, the hoe is an ideal tool for cleaning relatively large open areas of archaeological interest. It is faster to use than a trowel, and produces a much cleaner surface than an excavator bucket or shovel-scrape, and consequently on many open-area excavations the once-common line of kneeling archaeologists trowelling backwards has been replaced with a line of stooping archaeologists with hoes.

American Flyer is a brand of toy train and model railroad manufactured in the United States.  The Chicago era, 1907–1938  Although best remembered for the S gauge trains of the 1950s that it made as a division of the A. C. Gilbert Company, American Flyer was initially an independent company whose origins date back nearly a half century earlier. Chicago, Illinois-based toymaker William Frederick Hafner developed a clockwork motor for toy cars in 1901 while working for a company called Toy Auto Company. According to the recollections of William Hafner's son, John, he had developed a clockwork train running on O gauge track by 1905. Hafner's friend, William Ogden Coleman, gained control of the Edmonds-Metzel Hardware Company, a struggling hardware manufacturer in Chicago, in 1906 or 1907. Hafner and Coleman began producing toy trains using Edmonds-Metzel's excess manufacturing capability after Hafner was able to secure $15,000 worth of orders. By 1907, two American retailers, G. Sommers & Co. and Montgomery Ward, were selling Hafner-Coleman aka Edmonds-Metzel trains. In 1908, Edmonds-Metzel adopted the American Flyer brand name for the trains, and by 1910, Edmonds- Metzel was out of the hardware business and changed its name to American Flyer Manufacturing Company. Initially American Flyer—aka \\"Chicago Flyer\\"—was something of a budget brand, undercutting the prices of Ives, which was at the time the market leader. The trains proved popular, and American Flyer was soon expanding its product line. However, the company's rapid growth led to strains in the relationship between Hafner and Coleman. In 1913, Hafner left the company. Believing he would be given a significant portion of the company if the trains proved successful, Coleman refused when Hafner asked to exercise this option. Hafner started the Hafner Manufacturing Company, which sold a line of trains called Overland Flyer. Sommers immediately stopped carrying the American Flyer trains in favor of Hafner's brand. Initially, the Hafner and American Flyer product lines were very similar, suggesting they may have been built using the same tooling. This suggests the possibility of the two companies continuing to collaborate. Hafner's business survived as a manufacturer of clockwork trains until 1951, when he sold his business to All Metal Products Company. American Flyer's business grew during World War I, which locked out the German manufacturers that had dominated the U.S. toy train market to that point. During this time, American Flyer also introduced bicycle and motorcycle toys, segmented its market by creating both a low- priced and a high-priced line, and began to depart from its earlier designs by William Hafner. In 1918, American Flyer introduced its first electric train, an O gauge model that was simply a windup model with an electric motor in place of the clockwork motor. This was a common practice at the time. The same year, William Coleman died and his son, William Ogden Coleman, Jr., took over the company. At that time the factory and administrative offices of the American Flyer Manufacturing Co. were located at 2219-2239 South Halsted Street in Chicago. The factory had its own railroad sidings and dock so cars could be slid inside the building for unloading/loading. In 1925, American Flyer began offering Wide gauge electric trains at a premium price, attempting to compete with Lionel Corporation at the high end of the market. Like most of its competition, American Flyer did well in the 1920s, selling more than half a million trains in its best years, but suffered in the Great Depression, during which the company's focus shifted back to the more economical O gauge trains. In 1928, American Flyer's competitor Ives went bankrupt. American Flyer and Lionel jointly purchased and operated Ives until 1930, when American Flyer sold its share to Lionel. During this time of joint operation, American Flyer supplied Ives with car bodies and other parts. During the early 1930s, American Flyer struggled under increased competition, especially at the low end of the market. In 1931, Flyer announced it would not produce an electric train set to sell for less than $4 like its competition had. However, within three months, it relented and released a train without transformer that sold for $3.95, and in 1932, it released a set with transformer that retailed for $3.50. Sales increased, but the company was not profitable. Expansion into other toy arenas also failed.  A. C. Gilbert Company, 1938–1966  In December, 1937, W.O. Coleman sold American (Chicago) Flyer to Alfred Carlton Gilbert, a former Olympic pole vaulter who first made a name for himself in the toy industry earlier in the century when he created and manufactured Mysto Magic sets for youthful magicians. Circa 1913, his A. C. Gilbert Company also became the makers of Erector Set metal construction toys, which were 'inspired' by the English-made Meccano sets of which it was a U.S. distributor. The two toy magnates were just finishing shooting on Gilbert's game reserve in New Haven when Gilbert casually mentioned he was thinking about manufacturing toy trains. Instead, Coleman said he'd give his struggling American Flyer Co. to Gilbert in return for a share of the profits. Gilbert quickly agreed. Gilbert soon moved the company from Chicago to New Haven, Connecticut, and re-designed parts of the product line. The initial changes included substitution of the 'slot & tab' couplers with link and pin semi- automatic ones on the higher priced 10\\" freight cars and steam engine tenders. Three significantly detailed & overall scale length O gauge steam engines were introduced in the 1938 catalog: Atlantic (4-4-2), Pacific (4-6-2-) and an 0-6-0 switcher. The years 1938 through 1941 saw the production of Gilbert's \\"Tru Model\\" 3/16\\" O gauge trains. The engines offered in this line were fairly accurate scale replicas of the locomotives they were modeled after. A Reading Lines Atlantic, Pennsylvania K5 Pacific, a NYC Hudson, a B&O; streamlined steamer (Royal Blue), a UP Northern (4-8-4) and an NKP 0-8-0 Switcher. This line would later become the postwar 3/16\\" scale or S gauge line with two rail tracks. Also, its HO product line was introduced in the 1938 catalog. The design of the initial version of the HO track was significantly different from that of typical electric trains: the rails were mounted on lithographed roadbed. Gilbert was not the first American company to offer 3/16\\" 'S' scale trains. The Cleveland (Ohio) Model & Supply Company had been offering theirs (known as \\"C-D\\") by '37. But the smaller scale (1:64) became much more prominent with its introduction in the 1939 catalog, which features World's Fair imagery on the yellow, black & white cover. The relatively expensive, heavy and highly detailed engines and cars had had diecast zinc alloy bodies. As were the HO rolling stock, the engines and cars were offered in completely manufactured and kit forms. Additional engines, cars and accessories were added in the 1940 catalog. These included less costly engines with tinplate tenders, and less costly freight and passenger cars, also made of painted tinplated steel. The 3/16 scale trains were designed to run on O gauge track whose curved sections had 20\\" radii (formed 40\\" circles). Importantly, the trains featured fully automatic coupling and uncoupling that were functionally comparable to Lionel's. Unlike Lionel's costly and sophisticated design (each truck contained a solenoid and electrical pickup shoe), the A.F. 'link & pin' (a.k.a. 'harpoon') couplers were gravity based. Except for updated versions of the 1937 whistling billboard and trackage, all of the products offered in the 1941 catalog had been designed under Gilbert's ownership. The 'Chicago' products had been expunged. The scale accuracy was emphasized in the catalogs and packaging. Already experiencing materials shortages (due to Lend Lease), no new products were introduced in the 1942 catalog, which was only slight different than the previous edition. Prices were printed on an accompanying unstapled sheet but not on the bound pages. Even the set numbers (i.e. 4117) were not changed. The cover of the '42 edition is distinguished from the '41 by a caveat about erratic availability printed in small red fonts. During Summer, 1942 Gilbert (as were many manufacturing companies) was compelled by Federal wartime restrictions to cease manufacturing (and even servicing!) its electric train and other metal consumer products. It did not again publish American Flyer catalogs until 1946. The manufacturing hiatus offered the company the opportunity to further differentiate the products from those of the market leaders (by sales volume) Marx and Lionel. By Summer, 1945 it was able to resume limited manufacturing of the 3/16s scale O gauge trains. While it did so, the same sized products were re-engineered to run on much more realistic two rail (with a \\"T\\" profile rail) track. The fine detail of the diecast engines, tenders and cars that had debuted in the '39 catalog reappeared. The engines and tenders continued to be made of diecast metal, but the cars' bodies were made out of plastic. Two pages of the spectacular 1946 catalog emphasize the running advantages of the lighter cars. Ironically, they soon realized that they had to add weight. Metal car bottoms & chassis were necessary to prevent the too-light cars from tipping over. The 'link & pin' automatic couplers that had been introduced on the 3/16s O products were reduced in size, with plastic replacing the sintered metal of the originals. They too, later had metal weights added because they would fail to descend to the locking position needed for cars to couple. The chugging mechanisms of the premium O gauge tenders were redesigned to also generate smoke, which was conveyed to the engines' smokestacks via a black rubber tube that protruded out of the rear of the cab so that it could connect to the front of the tender. Because of the relatively accurate scale of the rolling stock and two rail track, these trains (not yet referred to as \\"S\\" gauge by Gilbert) were significantly more realistic than their 3 rail O gauge counterparts. Gilbert apparently ceased offering O gauge rolling stock by '47, but did continue to offer O gauge parts. The product line continued to be refined and expanded. The chugger / smoker was redesigned and moved from the tenders into the engines. The advantages included eliminating the separate motor (power drain and cost) and ensuring precise (geared) synchronicity of the chugging with the rotation of the drive wheels. DC versions of the engines were offered in the 1949 line. Two different engines (the other AC) could be controlled with nominal independence on the same track. Diesels, not offered since 1940 were offered in the 1950 line. In 1946 Lionel also debuted its post war trains. They too featured smoking but also its ingeniously designed (also solenoid based) and realistic knuckle coupler. With the improved coupler, it also introduced its very realistic sintered metal trucks. In 1952, a few premium sets featured the A.F. version of the knuckle coupler and sintered truck. By the next year, the 'link & pin' coupler and stamped steel trucks had been discontinued. Gilbert offered conversion kits so that the new couplers could be mounted on the old trucks. This American Flyer S gauge 4-4-2 (Atlantic type) steam locomotive and tender dates from 1960. It is descended from the O gauge version #565Although popular, American Flyer was always the second- ranked brand to Lionel in terms of market share at the high end of the market. With Louis Marx and Company dominating the low end and a handful of other brands relegated to entry level of the market, Lionel and American Flyer shared premium status. A rivalry emerged between both companies' fans that continues today. Gilbert also renewed offering its HO trains shortly after the War, but aside from changing to DC motors and making the cars lighter by using plastic, the products were not updated to conform with the increasingly popular NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) coupler and track standards until 1951. Despite its relatively long experience with HO Gilbert's share of that market steadily waned. Cultural and technical changes, and competing interests (television, the space race, slot cars, etc.), soon relegated indoor larger-than-HO trains to an out-of-date perception. Additionally, the increased prevalence of discount stores ravaged the toy train companies' traditional distribution network (i.e. mom-and-pop hobby shops, and hardware and department stores). The discount stores demanded train sets at wholesale prices so low that the profit margins of the traditional manufacturers became unsustainable. Additionally, they did not offer the personal attention and repair services of traditional hobby shops. By trying to accommodate the demands of the retail discounters, Gilbert and other toy train manufacturers cheapened their lines. Their \\"Pikemaster\\" line exemplified the corruption of the products. This accelerated their downward economic spiral. Longtime train collectors and hobbyists were offended at this newer production, dismissing the new products as \\"cheap junk\\", an accurate description. These problems were compounded by the death of its founder, A.C. Gilbert in 1961. With the popularity of toy trains and construction toys declining, and without another successful product line to buoy the company's finances, Gilbert found itself in serious financial trouble. Finally, a majority of the company was sold by the family to a holding company, the Wrather Group, in 1962 with A.C. Gilbert, Jr., acting as CEO. Within a few months, though, A.C. Jr., died. The company continued to manufacture trains of limited appeal due to the diminished quality. Under the new ownership, the A.C. Gilbert Co. continued to struggle, although the new owners took a more aggressive approach to advertising and marketing than when the firm was headed by the more conservative A.C. Gilbert. It manufactured a wide variety of poorly designed and poorly conceived toys (dolls, racing sets, games) that sold slowly, if at all, and was nearly overwhelmed by store returns of defective merchandise. Gilbert took an especially hard hit when a majority of a poorly designed and manufactured red James Bond 007 slot car racing set flooded back as returns after component failures. [Because of the number of returns, these sets are rare and very collectible, some selling \\"pre-crash' for an average of $1,000 on eBay]. Additionally, the company sold many of its toy line products to discounters with a \\"100% sale guarantee.\\" When the merchandise didn't sell, it ended up back in Gilbert's warehouses. The company discontinued the American Flyer train line in 1966 and finally declared bankruptcy in 1967. http://www.shifrin.net/trains/History/history.htm Lionel, 1979–present In May 1967, Lionel Corporation announced it had purchased the American Flyer name and tooling even though it was teetering on the brink of financial failure itself. A May 29, 1967, story in The Wall Street Journal made light of the deal, stating, \\"Two of the best-known railroads in the nation are merging and the Interstate Commerce Commission couldn't care less\\". Former Lionel treasurer Robert A. Stein said Lionel did not initiate the deal; both companies had farmed out their accounts receivable departments to Walter Heller & Co., who initiated the transaction. While various accounts published over the years valued the deal at $150,000, Stein's recollection was that Lionel simply liquidated $300,000-$400,000 worth of American Flyer inventory for Heller in exchange for the tooling, which, by some accounts, sat unused and neglected in a parking lot for some period of time. Lionel Corporation never manufactured American Flyer trains. Within two years, Lionel Corp. was bankrupt itself and had sold its train lines to General Mills, including the unused American Flyer tooling. In 1979, General Mills' Lionel division started to reissue Flyer products under that name employing a mix of previously unused railroad heralds and traditional Gilbert American Flyer designs. In 1984, General Mills sold the Lionel Co. to Kenner, a toy manufacturer. One year later, the company was sold to Richard Kughn, a Detroit toy train collector who made his fortune selling and developing real estate. For over a decade, Kughn moved both the Lionel and American Flyer brands forward, getting a shot of momentum from a resurgence in the toy train hobby in the early 1990s. In 1996, Kughn sold a majority interest to Wellspring Partners LLD, a Chicago- based national turnaround firm headed by Martin Davis. Kughn retained a small percentage, and rock star Neil Young, another toy train buff, also became a minor investor. Young's contributions include designing a sound system for trains (RailSounds) in 1992, as well as the Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC), a unique radio control system. The new company is known as Lionel, LLC. The American Flyer brand name survives today under the guidance of Lionel, LLC, although Lionel's advertising and marketing emphasis seems to remain locked on promoting its own O and O27 gauge product lines. True American Flyer aficionados claim this narrow focus is a conflict of interest and prevents the growth of S Gauge among new train operators. Most of the American Flyer-branded product sold by Lionel, LLC today is reissues of 1950s designs utilizing refurbished old Gilbert tooling, decorated in traditional road names and paint schemes used by Gilbert, as well as an influx of some of today's modern railroad heralds. One complaint by longtime American Flyer devotees is that Lionel isn't creating Flyer products that appeal to the toy train masses—rather, focusing instead on a small market of Flyer collectors. However, winds of change are blowing. Each year since 2002 Lionel has increased the number of American Flyer offerings, a sign the demand for 3/16\\" S gauge is growing. In late 2004, Lionel finally debuted a new steam locomotive—a highly detailed, 2-8-2 Mikado in multiple road names. Utilizing all new tooling and issued under the American Flyer name, the Mike is the first original American Flyer steam locomotive design since the late 1950s. Complete with TMCC (Lionel's proprietary wireless remote control technology) and a superb sound chip/system (TrainSounds), the Mikados proved to be a hot seller and their success has led to future similar issues. In late 2006, Lionel began delivering an updated remake of its largest steam locomotive, the famous 4-8-4 Northern, as well as a gray Union Pacific Northern with smoke deflectors (elephant ears); both new versions have digital sounds. Due in late 2006 or early 2007 is a new high-detail Pacific (4-6-2) with both TMCC capability and RailSounds. Additionally, Lionel released, in 2006, the first newly tooled passenger fleet. These heavyweight style cars are neither a refashioning of older Flyer designs nor a repurposing of Lionel 027 rolling stock (as some earlier Lionel/Flyer freight cars had been.) Also in 2007 Lionel started to sell American Flyer track, the popular 19\\" radius curve remaining unavailable to this day. In 2008, Lionel released an American Flyer Big Boy with TMCC and Railsounds. The license to manufacture the track had been held by Maury Klein, whose K-Line brand of 0 gauge trains competed against Lionel in the toy train renaissance of the 1980s and 90's and into the 21st. century. When K-Line fell upon hard times in recent years, it was purchased by Lionel LLC, who then got the Flyer track as well as the tooling for two 0 gauge locomotive designs; the UP Big-Boy and the C&O; Allegheny. Both of these engines had been tooled to 1/60th. scale so that 0 gauge operators with small layouts and narrow radius curves would be able to enjoy what would otherwise be behemoth engines. Their closeness to 1/64th. scale, however, made these engines naturals for development into the American Flyer Line, particularly since Lionel already possesses tooling for these locomotives in their 0 scale product lines. After considerable delay the company finally delivered the Big Boy in December 2009. No offering has yet been made as to the Allegheny, though collectors and aficionados hold out hope that a sell-out success with the current offering will stimulate the company to proceed further. Lionel's investment in new tooling is being interpreted among many S-scalers as a sign of commitment by the manufacturer to their market segment, as well as the brand, the gauge, and the hobby in itself.

By July 1640, the Raritans were described as \\"a nation of savages who live where a little stream [the Raritan River] runs up about five leagues behind Staten Island.\\" At a peace conference with the Dutch in 1649, Pennekeck, sachem of Achter Col (Newark Bay), \\"said the tribe called Raritanoos, formerly living at Wisquaskeck had no chief, therefore he spoke for them, who would also like to be our friends...\\" Their intrusion was apparently contested unsuccessfully by Sawanoos (Southern) Lenape and Sanhicans.

Turkington has released a number of albums as Hamburger and has appeared as the character in various films, television shows, and other media. In 2015, the act inspired the feature-length film Entertainment, which stars Turkington as a \\"variant\\" of the Neil Hamburger character. Turkington developed the character in the 1990s and originally envisioned the concept as a \\"weird recording project\\". It originated from a prank call that appeared on the album Great Phone Calls Featuring Neil Hamburger (1992). He followed the LP with three more albums issued on Drag City Records before he began receiving offers to perform as the character for live shows. His albums Neil Hamburger Sings Country Winners (2009) and First of Dismay (2014) feature original songs and cover versions backed by \\"The Too Good For Neil Hamburger Band\\". Style Hamburger's live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets as well as barbs aimed at his ex-wife. The confrontational aspects of his act drew comparisons to Tony Clifton. One of his gags is \\"Zipper Lips\\", in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn't respond, Hamburger derides them for being a \\"zipper lips\\". A common phrase used by the comedian is \\"But that's my life!\\", which he uses when he mentions being humiliated or degraded for some reason. Career Turkington's first Neil Hamburger recordings were self-recorded, imagining an unfunny, poorly recorded self-released stand-up comedy act. Turkington used recordings to audience laughter that were intentionally out of sync with his jokes, to replicate the private pressing albums by outsider artists that he enjoyed. These early recordings found a cult audience, which led to record label Drag City issuing his album America's Funnyman in 1996. Several more albums were issued on the record label. After originally conceiving Hamburger to be a studio-only character, Turkington was convinced to perform as the character on stage. His first shows were supporting punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb, who flew Turkington from the United States to Australia especially for the performance. Neil Hamburger would later appear in the music videos for the songs \\"Ballchef\\" and \\"Punisher\\" from Frenzal Rhom's 2003 album Sans Souci. Turkington as Neil Hamburger in Portland, Oregon, 2004 Hamburger was a frequent guest on the Internet talk show Tom Green's House Tonight (2006–2013). In 2006, Hamburger started doing his own show called Poolside Chats with Neil Hamburger on The Channel at Tomgreen.com. Guests on his show have included Tim and Eric, Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, Buzz Osborne of The Melvins, and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. In 2006, Hamburger had a brief cameo appearance in the film Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. Over the next year, he opened for Tenacious D during their Pick of Destiny Tour. However, his performances incited mostly negative reactions, with booing and heckling ensuing in countries such as Ireland and England. His performance at Madison Square Garden was referred to by Sia Michel of The New York Times as likely \\"the greatest night of his career.\\" In 2008, Drag City released an album of country and western originals and covers recorded by Hamburger. During the sessions, Hamburger was backed by musicians including Prairie Prince of The Tubes and Todd Rundgren's band, David Gleason, Atom Ellis of Dieselhed and the New Cars, Rachel Haden from That Dog. In December 2010, Special Entertainment released an iPhone App called Shaky Advice from Neil Hamburger that functions much like a Magic 8 Ball, with 30 video clips of Hamburger giving comical advice. In 2015, the Neil Hamburger act was dramatized for the Rick Alverson film Entertainment. In it, the character is shown repeatedly on and offstage; as well as the life of a fictional portrayal of the man behind the act separate from the real Gregg Turkington. The film's script was written by Turkington, Alverson, and comedian Tim Heidecker, although the dialogue was improvised.

Established in 1991, today AUBG has about 1,000 students from over 40 countries on 5 continents (as of Fall 2019). Close to 50% of the students are international. AUBG is an education leader for the ninth consecutive year according to the national university rankings for 2019. The university is number one in the country in the professional fields Administration & Management, Political Science and Public Communications & Information Sciences. AUBG graduates have 0% unemployment rate in three of the disciplines (Political Science, Informatics & Computer Science and Public Communications & Information Sciences) and the highest average salaries in four of the disciplines (Administration & Management, Economics, Political Science and Public Communications & Information Sciences). AUBG is also number one in all five disciplines in terms of prestige and welfare and administrative services. The ranking shows that AUBG accepts the students with the highest diploma GPA in all five disciplines. History Founded in 1991, the American University in Bulgaria is the first American-style, liberal arts undergraduate education institution in Eastern Europe. The university is a cooperative venture established with the support of the U.S. and Bulgarian governments, the Open Society Institute, the City of Blagoevgrad, and the University of Maine. When it opened its doors in September 1991, AUBG welcomed a first-year class of 208 students and 16 full-time faculty members. Nowadays, around 1000 students from over 40 countries live and study in AUBG. By May 2019, twenty-four classes of around 5,000 students had graduated from AUBG. Mission The AUBG mission is \\"to educate students of outstanding potential in a community of academic excellence, diversity, and respect and to prepare them for democratic and ethical leadership in serving the needs of the region and the world.\\" The university fulfills its mission by providing scholarships and financial aid to deserving students from the region and beyond. The university has three sources of funding: its endowment (which came largely from gifts from the United States Agency for International Development and the Soros Foundation), gifts, and tuition. Friends from all over the world, among them, John Dimitry Panitza, Anna Tchaprachikoff, Minko Balkanski, Atanas Zamphiroff, the America for Bulgaria Foundation, have supported the university throughout the years. Accreditation Baccalaureate degrees conferred by AUBG are accredited in both Bulgaria and the United States. AUBG is institutionally accredited in the United States from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The university also issues a European Diploma Supplement (part of Europass), which confers automatic recognition of the AUBG degree throughout Europe.

Early life Lovelace was born circa 1621. He was the third son of Sir William Lovelace (1584–1627) and his wife Anne Barne of Lovelace Place, Bethersden and Woolwich, Kent. He was the younger brother of Richard Lovelace, the Cavalier poet. The Bethersden Lovelace lineage was founded in 1367 by John Lovelace, six generations before Francis, and has been confused over the years with the Hurley Lovelaces who were raised to the House of Lords. Career The five Lovelace brothers supported Charles I in the English Civil War. Charles was a Colonel in the Royalist army and was governor of Carmarthen Castle in Wales from June 1644 until it was surrendered to Parliamentary troops in October 1645 after a fierce battle in which one brother was killed. He and another brother, Dudley, migrated to Europe and served with the French army later in the 1640s. The brothers later supported Charles II, and spent time in exile like him, in his fight to be restored to the throne. Lovelace lived in Virginia where his sister, Anne Gorsuch, had migrated after marriage, from 1650 until after the colony was seized by the English Parliamentary commissioners in 1652 when the governor, Sir William Berkeley, dispatched him to France to inform Charles II. He returned to England in 1658, the year of Oliver Cromwell's death. In 1659, he was arrested and confined in the Tower of London until after the fall of the Parliamentary government and the restoration of Charles II in 1660. Charles gave his brother, the Duke of York (later to become King James II), rights to the colony of Nieuw Amsterdam when Richard Nicolls took it from the Dutch in 1667. Many English colonists did not like Nicolls because they thought Oliver Cromwell had been their savior. Governor of New York The Duke of York appointed Lovelace the second governor of the New York Colony in 1668 after the departure of Richard Nicolls. While in office he purchased Staten Island from the local Native Americans, among whom he sent Church of England missionaries, granted 'freedom of conscience' to the English, Dutch and Swedish populations of the colony, organised infantry and militia companies and expanded New York City's defences. During his time in NY, he ran and operated the King's House tavern (also known as Lovelace Tavern) in lower Manhattan. The tavern was built in 1670 in the Stadt Huys Block and rediscovered by archeologists in 1979–1980. Despite his defensive preparations, his administration was terminated by the temporary re-capture of the colony by the Dutch in 1673 when, for a brief period the Dutch Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the youngest seized New York City, to little opposition, and re-established Nieuw Amsterdam. At the time of the invasion, Lovelace was out of the colony, meeting with the Governor of Connecticut, John Winthrop Jr. in Hartford, Connecticut, in the course of planning the first postal system from New York to Boston. From 1673 to 1674, Dutch naval Captain Anthony Colve acted as military governor-general until England recovered the colony under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster in 1674. Return to England Lovelace, whose property in New York had been confiscated by the Dutch, was sent home in disgrace to England. The Duke of York, blaming Lovelace for the loss of his namesake colony, confiscated his plantation on Staten Island and his English estates for a £7,000 debt. In January 1675 he was committed to the Tower of London, where he was interrogated by commissioners. His answers were deemed unacceptable, but no further proceedings were brought against him. He contracted dropsy and, because of his health, was released in April. He went to live at Woodstock, Oxfordshire and died, in penury, by 22 December 1675 when administration of his estate was granted to his brother Dudley. The third new Governor of New York after Francis Lovelace was John Lovelace, 4th Baron Lovelace of Hurley – no kin to Francis of the Bethersden Lovelaces. Early genealogists confused Francis with an identically named son of Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace of Hurley, due to a pamphlet issued at the time of his appointment mistakenly asserting that he was the brother of the said Richard. The confusion has also spread to more modern historians. References ;Notes ;Sources * *Paltsis, Victor Hugo (ed.) (1910).

In 14 seasons in the National League (NL), he pitched for the Boston Beaneaters, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals. In 513 career games, Willis pitched 3,996 innings and posted a win–loss record of 249–205, with 388 complete games, 50 shutouts, and a 2.63 earned run average (ERA). Nicknamed the \\"Delaware Peach\\", he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995. Early life Willis was born on April 12, 1876 in Cecil County, Maryland. He moved to Newark, Delaware as a young boy, where he attended school. He attended high school at Newark Academy, and played both on the high school baseball team and in semi- pro baseball leagues throughout Delaware. Prior to joining the major leagues, Willis played football and baseball for University of Delaware, then known as Delaware College, despite never attending the college. This was due to their low enrollment at the time, which allowed them to add local talent to fill out their roster.Fleitz, 177 Willis began his professional baseball career in 1895 with the Harrisburg Senators of the Pennsylvania State League. After the team ceased operations in June, he moved to the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Virginia State League. The following year, he was promoted to the Syracuse Stars of the Eastern League. He finished the season with a 10–6 win-loss record, but had spent most of the season battling illness, which caused him to end his season in July. Willis returned to the Stars for the 1897 season and, after establishing a curveball in the offseason, finished the season with 21 wins, with Syracuse winning the league championship in the process. After the season ended, Willis was purchased by the Boston Beaneaters for Fred Lake and $1,000. The Beaneaters acquired Willis to fill the void left by Jack Stivetts, who was near retirement due to an arm injury.Fleitz, 178 Career Willis began his major league career with the Beaneaters on April 20, 1898 in a relief appearance against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing eight runs, three walks, and a wild pitch in an 18–2 loss while also hitting two batters. In his next appearance, he beat the Washington Senators, 11–4, in his first career start. He remained in the starting rotation throughout the season, but at times struggled with his control. In one game against the Philadelphia Phillies, opposing pitcher Red Donahue threw a no-hitter, while Willis allowed eight walks in a 5–0 loss.Fleitz, 179 He finished the season with 25 wins, 13 losses, a 2.84 ERA, 148 walks, and 160 strikeouts. He finished second in walks and third in strikeouts in the National League. Willis wearing a catcher's mask, circa 1900. Despite being a Hall of Fame pitcher, Willis holds the post-1900 record for most losses in a single season (29, in 1905). For the three seasons from 1903 to 1905, Willis compiled a dismal record with the Boston Beaneaters of 42 wins against 72 losses. However, his ERA during those three years averaged 3.02 and in two of those years his ERA was under 3.00. Despite Willis' performance on the mound during those three seasons, the Boston offense could only muster a combined .238 batting average over those seasons. When he changed teams to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 1906, whose offense had a combined batting average of .256 over the four years Willis was with the team, Willis compiled a record of 88–46. His ERA for those four years was 2.08. Willis was on one World Series championship team, the 1909 Pirates. He lost one game during the Series, pitching against Ty Cobb's Detroit Tigers. His final major league season was 1910, with the St. Louis Cardinals. Next season Willis pitched for a semipro team in his hometown Newark, Delaware. Later life After retirement, Willis purchased and operated the Washington House, a hotel in his hometown of Newark, Delaware. Willis died in 1947 and is interred in St. John Cemetery in Newark, Delaware. The National Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Vic Willis in 1995, as the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame had done in 1977. He was the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the 19th century.

The son of Hal Dale and the mare Adioo Volo, the horse named Adios was born on January 3, 1940, at Two Gaits Farm, in Carmel, Indiana. Trained and driven by Frank Ervin and for a while owned by Harry Warner of Warner Bros. film studio, Adios was a multiple world champion during his racing career. His pacing record at the Shelbyville, Indiana, fair stood for 43 years. Despite his racing success, he is most famous for his offspring, which included Adios Harry. In 1948, Adios was bought by harness racing driver, Delvin Miller, to stand in stud at his Meadow Lands farm near Washington, Pennsylvania. The horse proved to be a tremendous stud, considered by many to be the greatest in harness racing history. He sired eight Little Brown Jug winners, more than any other horse, and his sons, Adios Butler and Bret Hanover both became winners of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Adios died on June 22, 1965.This Week in Harness Racing, United States Trotting Association, Retrieved 26 January 2016 Before he died in 1965, Adios had sired 589 offspring. His name is synonymous with horse racing and can be found on consumer products and harness horse equipment. At his death, the horse was buried at Meadow Lands farm under his favorite apple tree near the paddock that had been his home for seventeen years. A race was named for him, held each year on the second Saturday in August at The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Meadow Lands, Pennsylvania. Since the first Delvin Miller Adios in 1967, it has evolved into one of the important events in the harness racing season. Adios Golf Club in Coconut Creek, Florida, was named after the horse by his owner and club founder Delvin Miller. The course was designed in 1982 by fellow founder Arnold Palmer. In 1977, a book was published by Marie Hill titled Adios: the big daddy of harness racing. Two Gaits Farm in Carmel, Indiana, where Adios was foaled, was purchased in 2011 by Jeffrey and Beth Weisgerber. Adios Pass, a nearby street, is named after the sulky champion.

It is northwest of Longreach. The main industries of the area are sheep and cattle raising. The town was named in 1876 by postmaster Robert Allen, after his place of birth, Winton, Dorset. Winton was the first home of the airline Qantas. Geography Winton lies on the north bank of the Western River, a braided river that often runs dry, made of many small channels, a landform that gives this region, the Channel Country, its name. The Western is joined from the north by Jessamine Creek and Mill's Creek, both braided streams. Mistake Creek, likewise a braided stream, empties into the Western from the south. The Western itself flows westwards, eventually emptying into the Diamantina River at one of only three major confluences on that river. This lies some 60 km downstream. This puts Winton in the Lake Eyre basin. The land in the area is mostly flat grassland, which lends itself rather well to pastoral activity, an industry of some local importance to this day. Winton lies at the junction of the Kennedy Developmental Road and the Landsborough Highway, the two of which run concurrently from Winton's south end as far as another junction a few kilometres west of town. Possible asteroid strike Map showing the rough extent of the crustal anomaly west of Winton that may be an ancient impact structure The Diamantina River's hook-shaped upper reaches have drawn scientific attention. In March 2015, Geoscience Australia reported that the river's course at and near its headwaters flows along the edge of a roughly circular crustal anomaly that might well be an impact structure. It is an area, as described by Richard Blewett, a senior official with Geoscience Australia, in diameter, characterized by geomagnetic anomalies, and Winton lies roughly 60 km beyond its eastern edge. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that recent seismic studies undertaken there indicated that long ago an asteroid or comet struck the area releasing energy equivalent to 650 million Hiroshima A-bombs (and thus roughly 41 zettajoules). The asteroid impact has not yet been confirmed, but this could be done with core samples from the ground in the central ring structure to a depth of hundreds of metres. The impact, if indeed this is the explanation for the anomaly, would have happened roughly 300 million years ago. Dinosaurs See also: Australian Age of Dinosaurs (museum); Lark Quarry Dinosaur Trackways (exhibit). The area surrounding the town has yielded a number of dinosaur fossils. In 2009, the discoveries near the town of three Early Cretaceous dinosaur genera, Australovenator, Wintonotitan and Diamantinasaurus, were announced. Australovenator wintonensis, the type specimen of that genus, is named after the town. The specimens were unearthed at the \\"Matilda site\\" not far northwest of town, on Elderslie Station (site's position roughly ), and at the \\"Triangle Paddock Site\\" right nearby. Another sauropod, Savannasaurus, was also found in this area, along with the as-of-yet unnamed \\"Elliot\\". The town also lent its name to the geological formation in which the fossils were found, the Winton Formation. Great Artesian Basin Winton is situated on the Great Artesian Basin and draws its water for use in the town. This water emerges at and is cooled in ponds in Corfield to before it is circulated through the tow. Sulphur gas gives the water an 'eggy' smell. As of 2018, Winton Shire Council is developing a geothermal power plant to replacing the water cooling process with one that converts the released heat into electricity. It is expected to generate 2000 megawatt hours per year. Street names The main streets in the town of Winton were named after the stations lying in the directions in which the streets were running. For instance, east and west — Elderslie, Vindex, Cork and Dagworth. Those facing the north were called Oondooroo, Manuka, Sesbania and Werna. Three of these stations, Dagworth, Vindex and Oondooroo, figure in the Waltzing Matilda story. History=Dispossession of Aboriginal land owners The traditional owners of the Winton area, the Koa people, consider Bladensburg National Park area (near Winton) to be a special part of their traditional country, and the park is also important to the Maiawali and Karuwali people. Jirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin. Skull Hole, on Surprise Creek, at Bladensburg Station about from Winton, was the site of a massacre of Aboriginal people in 1877. The Koa people have lodged an application to the Federal Court to have their native title legally recognised. This application (or \\"claim\\") was registered on 28 September 2015, by the National Native Title Tribunal. Early exploration In one of Australia's greatest mysteries, the Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt set off on an expedition with a group of men and animals from the Condamine River in the Darling Downs, bound for the Swan River Colony across the continent. He was last seen on 3 April 1848 at McPherson's Station, Coogoon, still on the Darling Downs. His whereabouts thereafter have always been unknown, but he and his men are believed to have met their end in the Great Sandy Desert. This expedition may have brought Leichhardt near Winton's future site. William Landsborough undertook extensive exploration of both the Western and Diamantina rivers in the 1860s, and it seems likely that he might have found himself at Winton's future site at least once, for it lies on the former. In 1866, Landsborough led another expedition up the Diamantina, which would have taken him to within 60 km of the actual site, albeit not right to it. The first European settlers in the area came in 1866, but many did not stay very long because a drought struck within a few years. The town's true birth came with a sequence of events, both natural and manmade, which gave rise to one new town in Central West Queensland, but also sowed the seeds for another's failure. Winton's founding and early days Robert Allen, a former police sergeant, left Aramac about 1875 and moved west to the Pelican Waterholes (about west of the town's current site), where he set up a shop and a public house the next year. The heavy rains that same year, however, brought Allen a great deal of woe, and he even \\"was compelled by floods to remain two days on the wall-plate of his building.\\" When the flooding had abated somewhat, Allen shifted what was left of his business to Winton's current site.Corfield's book Reminiscences of Queensland 1862–1899, 1921 Robert Allen is thus held to be the town's founder. Winton's entrenchment as this pioneering region's business hub was secured only by a quirk of fate, as William Henry Corfield's written record makes clear. He and some acquaintances set out to do business in an Outback town that had been surveyed and laid out by the Queensland colonial government, only to decide upon arrival in the district that it would be a better idea to found a town somewhat further east near the Pelican Waterholes, which was to become Winton. William Henry Corfield (1843–1927), later the mayor of Winton, had returned to Queensland in 1878 after suffering a bout of malaria, and wrote of his experiences as a pioneer in Central West Queensland in his book Reminiscences of Queensland 1862–1899, published in 1921: > Passing through Townsville, I met [Robert] Fitzmaurice, who told me that > carrying had fallen away between Cooktown and the Palmer, and that he had > left that district. He suggested that I should join with him in carrying to > the western country, and added that he had been informed by a squatter that > there was a good opening for a store at the Conn Waterhole, on the > Diamantina River. This is about forty miles [60 km] down the Western River > from where Winton now is. The Conn Waterhole to which Corfield referred is a body of water some down the Western River from Winton. It is the northernmost permanent waterhole in the Diamantina basin, and maps still identify it by that name today. Corfield made it clear where he meant to settle: > Our destination was Collingwood, more widely known as the Conn Waterhole, > where the Government Surveyor had laid out a township situated about 40 > miles [60 km] west of Winton. Another man of Corfield's acquaintance, named Thomas Lynett, had left Townsville for the same destination with backing from Burns, Philp and Co. to set up a shop at Collingwood, if he deemed the newly laid out town to be suitable upon his inspection. Apparently, though, he did not, deciding that the land there was too prone to flooding. He turned back, and eventually, he, Corfield, Fitzmaurice and Robert Allen, who was already at the more easterly site, agreed to establish a centre east of Corfield's original destination of Collingwood. This was Winton's beginning. Collingwood, however, whose site was the government's choice, never truly took root, and by 1900, it was a ghost town. At the Winton site, Corfield, Fitzmaurice, Lynett and Allen then discussed moving Allen's building northwards somewhat, back from the Western River on higher ground. Corfield wrote about the outcome: > We offered to do the work without cost, but Allen and Lynett decided to > remain where they were. We had to accept the position, and agreed to build > in line with the others. This formed the base upon which Mr. Surveyor Jopp > laid out the township afterwards. \\"Mr. Surveyor Jopp\\" was George Keith Jopp, a surveyor based in Blackall. His name was to be found on the \\"List of Surveyors licensed to act under the provisions and for the purposes of 'The Real Property Acts of 1861 and 1877'\\", which was published in Wright's Australian and American Commercial Directory and Gazetteer in 1881. Corfield's book also tells the locally well known story of how Winton got its current name: > The original name for the town – now known as Winton – was Pelican Water- > holes. Bob Allen, the first resident, whom I have mentioned, acted as post- > master. The mail service was a fortnightly one, going west to Wokingham > Creek, thence via Sesbania to Hughenden. There was no date stamp supplied to > the office, but by writing \\"Pelican Water-holes\\" and the date across the > stamps, the post mark was made, and the stamps cancelled. This was found to > be very slow and unsatisfactory. Allen was asked to propose a name, and he > suggested that the P.O. should be called \\"Winton.\\" This is the name of a > suburb of Bournemouth, Hampshire, England, and Allen's native place. Even though Bournemouth is nowadays generally held to be in Dorset, Corfield did not quite get the county wrong. Bournemouth is actually in the ceremonial county of Dorset, but Corfield named the historic county of Hampshire, which also includes Bournemouth. It is clear, however, that Corfield correctly identified Allen's birthplace. Business in those earliest days of the town's existence was hindered by the lack of a local bank. The nearest one was in Aramac, some away. There was also a drought then. Building materials had to be brought in from even farther away, for there was not a great deal of wood to be had in the Channel Country. Corfield travelled all the way to Townsville on Queensland's east coast to fetch them in. Law enforcement was also as non- existent as one might expect it to be in an early town in Central West Queensland. Corfield described that problem, too: > At this time Winton was the rendezvous of some of the worst characters of > the west; fights were frequent on the then unformed streets. The rowdies > threatened to take the grog in the store, and as there were no police nearer > than Aramac, I deemed it best to dispose of all the liquor to Allen, the > local publican, who jumped at the chance to obtain a supply. A few residents > formed themselves into a vigilance committee. The late Mr. J. A. Macartney > passed through to visit his property, Bladensburg Station, and seeing how > things were, wrote to the Home Secretary asking for police protection. He also described another problem – drug abuse: > When I returned Winton was entirely out of liquor, and Allen did a great > business in selling bottles of painkiller as a substitute. It was laughable > to see men take a bottle out of their pocket, saying, \\"Have a nip, mate, > it's only five shillings a bottle?\\" The North Gregory Hotel in Winton as it looked in 1879 Winton was gazetted as a township on 12 July 1879. The entry in the government gazette said that the land area involved was two square miles (roughly 5.2 km2), resumed from the Doveridge No. 4 and Vindex No. 1 North runs. In 1879, Julius von Berger, who had fled Schleswig-Holstein to escape Prussian rule, became the town's first dispensing chemist (pharmacist). In 1880, Sub-Inspector Fred Murray and Sergeant Feltham came to town from Blackall and set up Winton's first police station in a small rented building. Their equipment was rather primitive, though, and they had to make do with a hefty log and a chain as a police lockup. This was not always good enough: > One day Feltham went down to the store, leaving a prisoner chained up. > Shortly afterwards he was surprised when he saw his prisoner (who was a very > powerful man) marching into the public house carrying the log on his > shoulder, and call for drinks. It took three men to get him back to the > lock-up. Cobb & Co's stagecoaches were serving Winton by 1880 after having bought up a number of mail routes in Queensland. Mr. Robert Johnstone also arrived in Winton in 1880 to become the town's first police magistrate. He had been in the Australian native police and had been an associate of George Elphinstone Dalrymple in the latter's exploratory work. That same year, Mr. Johnstone also conducted the first sale of government land, one result of which was the acquisition of Thomas Lynett's property by the Queensland National Bank, thus giving Winton its first bank. The bank began business right away in Lynett's old coffee room, and pulled down his building to make way for something that would be more suitable for a bank. A man named Morgan started a blacksmith's shop in Winton after having worked at Ayrshire Downs Station. In 1881, Thomas McIlwraith, who was then Premier of Queensland and who would be knighted the following year, passed through Winton. His destination was Ayrshire Downs. Nevertheless, the town's whole population turned out, at night, at a waterhole almost 10 km from town to meet him and his wife. In 1882, a visiting clergyman, the first of any denomination, visited Winton. On the Sunday while he was in town, he held a church service in the billiard room at the hotel, after a blue blanket had been thrown over the pool table and a red one had been draped over the cue rack. William Corfield himself was later chosen to present the clergyman with remuneration in the form of \\"a purse of sovereigns\\". This presentation did not go off without incident, however. One local squatter caused himself quite a bit of pain – and the other men at the presentation quite a bit of laughter – when, during a prayer upon presentation of the gift, he knelt down in prayer only to wound his rear end with his own long-necked spurs. The clergyman, however, simply carried on with his prayer of thanks. In 1883, Winton's first district court was opened when Judge Miller and Crown Prosecutor Real came to town. By about this time, there was also a doctor in town, who sometimes had to deal with typhoid fever patients. Tenders were sought for building a hospital in Winton late in 1882. It seems, however, that the doctor tendered his resignation only three years later. A correspondent reported not long thereafter \\"Doctor Van Someron is to be our new surgeon, and I trust that we shall be able to keep him longer with us than his predecessors.\\" This suggests that Winton was not considered a choice location in the 1880s, at least not among those of the medical profession. By 1883, Winton was developing into a proper town with economic activity that was of benefit to all the settlers, both urban and rural, in the region. This would have struck most at the time as a great boon, but in William Corfield's wry assessment of Winton's progress: > Now that we had two banks, four hotels, a chemist, saddler, besides other > branches of industry, we felt that we were being drawn perilously within the > influences of civilisation and its drawbacks. By 1884, Winton and much of the surrounding area were in the grip of a serious drought that brought many people hardship. It had, however, ended by 1886. By this time, Winton had a weekly newspaper, the Winton Herald. It was owned by D. H. Maxwell, who had founded it in 1885 after coming from Aramac. Maxwell later died in an angling accident near Winton in 1894. He was found drowned from town. A school was being discussed in Winton by a school committee in 1885. It was soon afterwards a reality, despite the correspondent's misgivings about the bureaucracy involved. Pugh’s Queensland Almanac, Law Calendar, Directory, and Coast Guide for 1885 listed Winton's local professionals, including Julius von Berger, who was now joined by another pharmacist named A. Hurworth. The hospital's surgeon (also described in the almanac as the \\"Medical Man\\") was Dr. Wilson. The name Morgan by this time no longer figured among the town's blacksmiths (\\"J. Long, Ryan & Jensen\\"). T. B. Feltham had two mentions in the almanac for being both the bookseller-stationer and the tobacconist, and likewise founding townsman Thomas Lynett was listed twice for being both a shopkeeper and the innkeeper at the Royal Mail Hotel. The North Gregory Hotel was run by William Brown Steele by this time. He had bought it from William Henry Corfield after Corfield had bought his partner Robert Fitzmaurice's share of that business out after Fitzmaurice had returned from a six-month trip to Sydney to see about his failing eyesight. The prognosis was not good – Fitzmaurice was almost blind when he returned to Winton – and so he decided to sell up and leave town. Corfield, though, had no great interest in running a hotel and so sought out a buyer, and this turned out to be Steele. In 1886, luxuriant grass growth furnished fodder not only for livestock, but annoyingly also for wildfires. Several nearby stations were stricken, among them Vindex, Elderslie and Ayrshire Downs. Plans were being made to build a Catholic church in 1888. Against this was the state in which the Church of England in Winton then found itself. By 1890, its services were still being held in an all-purpose hall whose owner, William Steele, had the licence for it revoked that year, which was understandably an unwelcome hardship for the town's Anglicans. In 1889, work was in progress on Winton's first artesian bore. By mid-August, it had reached a depth of about 430 feet (or 131 m). Tenders were called that same year for another bank, this time the Bank of New South Wales. The same article mentioned that founding townsman Thomas Lynett had had to pay a fine of £1, along with 9s in costs (after having been summoned before the Police Magistrate), for a breach of the Licensing Act. At the races in Winton, Queensland, ca. 1890 In 1890, a local correspondent sang the praises of Winton's hospital and was clearly pleased at the staff there. \\"Winton is at last blessed with a good doctor,\\" he declared. Industrial unrest It was also in 1890 that trouble was brewing in Winton, and indeed in other parts of Australia. One report mentioned a robbery in which one man was relieved of £30 while the police seemed unable to catch the thief, and the correspondent commented \\"This game has been going on here for a very long time,\\" perhaps meaning to suggest police complicity in this and other crimes. More seriously, even though there was no real loss, was this incident, mentioned in the same report: > Somebody amused himself at the expense of the senior-constable of police, > telling him that the shearers and all union men would rush the town. The > senior-constable rushed away in hot haste to the barracks, and ordered the > police to get Martinis and revolvers in good going order, so as to shoot the > unionists down. The tensions between the shearers and their employers would soon come to a head, and this incident showed just how tense the situation had already become in Winton. Meanwhile, there was Ashton's Circus to enjoy. It came to this far- flung town in September 1890 and besides its regular performances, also did a benefit for the local hospital. The Great Shearers' Strike came in 1891, disrupting the wool industry for a while. Locally, work stoppages began very early that year. On 6 January that year, a small item – the quotation below is the article's full text – in The Australian Star (Sydney) announced the onset of management-labour troubles in the Winton area: > The station hands have left Vindex and Oondooroo stations in the Winton > districts in consequence of the new wages tariff formulated by the Pastoral > Employers' Association. Vindex lies not far east-southeast of Winton, and Oondooroo not far north. One of the \\"momentous decisions by the Federated Pastoralists\\" (the management side in the strike) on 18 March that same year was to declare a great number of stations in the Winton area \\"non-union\\", including Elderslie west of town, and also Ayrshire Downs on Wokingham Creek, Dagworth on the Diamantina River, Warnambool Downs south-southwest of town and Llanrheidol north of Middleton, about 150 km west of Winton. \\"This means that no loading consigned to those stations during this week will be allowed to be forwarded by union teams,\\" the article asserted. Later, on nearby Elderslie Station, which belonged to absentee landlord Sir Samuel Wilson at the time, the woolshed was burnt down on 8 October that year. A major sticking point in the 1891 strike throughout Queensland, and locally in Winton, was the issue of \\"freedom of contract\\". This would have empowered both pastoralists and the shearers whom they employed to enter into contractual employment arrangements free of any union involvement therein. This clearly did not sit well with the striking, unionized shearers. Polls held in striker camps throughout the colony yielded results that were heavily – sometimes unanimously – in favour of rejecting any such arrangement. The camp at Winton wired in to the union headquarters at Barcaldine not only the results of their poll, but also the comment \\"our decision is to fight to the last.\\" Nevertheless, the strikers eventually lost the battle by May 1891. However, management-labour troubles were soon to flare up again. In 1894, Winton once again found itself in the middle of a hotbed of discontent as the Second Shearers' Strike wore on. There were unfortunate incidents in the Winton area. At nearby Elderslie Station, a great haystack was set ablaze, while over at Dagworth Station, the shearing shed was burnt down by strikers armed with guns. Another woolshed was set afire at Manuka, about halfway between Winton and Hughenden. A map at the same source shows the \\"Scene of Recent Outrages\\" (the strikers did not have the press on their side), with Winton clearly marked. As in the last great strike, Winton hosted a strikers' camp, and its occupants were as adamant as before. After discussing \\"the telegram from Longreach declaring the strike off in that district,\\" the men apparently expressed \\"a determination to continue the fight to the bitter end.\\" Sir Hugh Nelson (centre, in white), then the Premier of Queensland, visited Winton in 1895. Here he is seen at the town's artesian bore. The next year – on 6 April 1895 to be precise – Sir Herbert Ramsay gave \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" its first public recital at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton. It was also in 1895 that Premier Sir Hugh Nelson visited Winton. William Henry Corfield, by now the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Gregory, accompanied the premier's party on the Winton stretch of his tour. A deputation at Winton was most anxious to let the premier know that a railway link with Hughenden was uppermost in the townsfolk's minds, and Mr. Corfield also presented Sir Hugh with a petition, signed by 376 constituents, asking \\"that a permanent survey of the line from Hughenden to Winton be made with a view of connecting the town with its natural port, Townsville.\\" Despite frequent complaints in 19th-century Winton about the dearth of water, an 1895 article mentions that gardeners were growing peaches, grapes and melons in town. Perhaps coincidentally, a famous botanist passed through Winton that year, Frederick Manson Bailey. Drought was indeed a serious problem in the region at various times, one that might have destroyed Winton, had one drought in 1895 been as dire an emergency as one geologist believed. Robert Logan Jack, FGS, FRGS, a Government Geologist for Queensland, wrote in that year of an eventuality in his Geological Survey, Bulletin no. 1, Artesian Water in the Western Interior of Queensland, that might have had not only this effect, but also the effect of saving the doomed town of Collingwood from what would turn out to be its actual fate. The drought striking the region had seriously depleted the waterhole on Mistake Creek, upon which Winton wholly depended for its water, leaving, Jack reckoned, only three weeks' to a month's supply of water for the town. He foresaw that it might become necessary to move Winton's whole population, along with their livestock, to the Conn Waterhole at Collingwood, 55 km to the west. This, however, never came about. Moreover, Winton's artesian bore was finally completed the next year, ending dependency on the climatic vagaries to which the region is subject, but only after two boring companies had been bankrupted by the project. The railway reached Winton in 1899 (which was likely the last nail in Collingwood's coffin), and Winton's artesian bore water was being piped from the wellhead in 1902, with water welling up from a depth of 4,010 feet (1 222 m) at the rate of 650,000 imperial gallons (roughly 3 000 000 L) daily. In 1899 and 1900, the town, and indeed the whole region, were suffering under a devastating drought. A correspondent, writing in January 1900 – midsummer – described horrendous conditions on the surrounding stations, some of which were deserted for want of water, others empty of livestock because their owners had had the animals sent out, and yet others that were heaped with dead livestock that had died of thirst. The animals in town were visibly suffering, too. \\"I could mention many more drought incidents,\\" the correspondent said, \\"but it is sickening to write of them.\\" The correspondent further wrote of the progress of artesian bores at the surrounding stations in some detail, summing it up with the possibly punning remark \\"This about completes the boring news for the week.\\" There was a slight respite by July – midwinter – which even saw some livestock sent back to their stations. However, the drought persisted throughout 1900 and affected most of Queensland, with a reporter in Maryborough noting on 29 December that year – well into the next summer – that it \\"in most places has been the worst experienced in the last 25 years.\\" He also said, \\"The closing days of the year, however, have refreshed the parched lands with welcome rains and inspired the hope that the drought is at last broken up, and that a genial season is awaiting us in the new year.\\" In 1899, the North Gregory Hotel, a fixture in town since 1879, burnt down for the first time, but a new North Gregory Hotel was up and running by the following January. The town's Anglicans celebrated the opening of Saint Paul's Church on 4 February 1900. Even before the end of the 19th century, the town's ethnic makeup consisted of more than members of groups from the British Isles. Besides the chemist from Schleswig-Holstein, Julius von Berger, there were people of Chinese origin in Winton, too. In 1896, a firm called Sun Kum Wah in Winton run by three Chinese men, Low Sow, Ah Shew and Sun Kum Fung, placed a notice in Queensland newspapers announcing the dissolution of this three-way partnership, and the apparent formation of a new, two-way one, without Sun Kum Fung. The company, however, kept its former name for at least ten more years, for the building in the flood photograph below is its place of business, with the name painted on the façade. In Robert Logan Jack's and Robert Etheridge's Geology and Palæontology of Queensland and New Guinea, a further reference is made to a Winton man named G. Cramieri, suggesting that there might have been at least one Italian family in Winton in 1892, when the book was published. Mr. Cramieri is mentioned alongside Julius von Berger (who apparently took an interest in palaeontology when he was not working as a pharmacist) as a contributor of fossils whose provenance Jack and Etheridge wished to acknowledge. Early 20th century The onset of the 20th century saw the proclamation of the Commonwealth. The flooding in Winton in 1906 broke records. Quite at odds with the usual weather complaint was what happened in Winton in 1906, for the problem then was not a dearth of rain, but a definite oversupply. In March of that year, a mailman returning to Longreach from Winton reported \\"very heavy rain\\" that week. The rainfall in the area between those two places in the first two months of 1906 was reckoned to be between 14 and 18 inches (roughly 356 to 457 mm) with consequent overflowing seen in the area's creeks and rivers. The Western was far from an exception to this, and the photograph at right shows what became of some of the town's buildings. In 1909, the telephone reached Winton and by October, it had 34 subscribers. By May 1911, improvements were being made to the post office to set the telephone exchange apart in its own section because it was becoming a \\"large and important branch\\". Indeed, there were then also plans to expand the exchange with the addition of a further switchboard to handle an expected 50 more subscribers. On Sunday 16 August 1914, Winton's townsfolk met at the Shire Hall to form a patriotic committee to recruit volunteers for the military to go and fight in the First World War, which had broken out less than three weeks earlier. Five hundred and eighteen men and women from Winton and the surrounding district served in that war, and their fallen comrades' names can now be found on Winton's war memorial on Vindex Street, outside the Shire Hall. Winton's contribution of personnel to the war effort was proportionally one of Australia's highest, and 101 of its townsmen fell in the Great War, including a farmhand from nearby Bladensburg Station named Colin Morgan-Reade, who fell at Gallipoli on 30 May 1915. His story served as a focus during Winton's observance of the centenary of that campaign in 2015. In 1916, the North Gregory Hotel burnt down for the second time. Between the World Wars In 1918, the Royal opened, and is still in business today. It is an outdoor cinema, one of only a few left in Australia. Qantas, now the flag carrier airline of Australia, was founded in Winton in 1920 In 1920, a new company was founded, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (now known as Qantas Airways), and for a while, it was headquartered in Winton. In 1927, Winton got electricity. This \\"electric light scheme became an accomplished fact\\" in January of that year, and by December, it had some 160 subscribers. As a business, it was only breaking even, and so it was hoped that there would be more subscribers in the New Year. The project's initial cost was £12,000. The Prime Minister also came to visit that year. On 2 August 1927, Mr. Stanley Bruce and his wife landed on a flight from Longreach in Winton. The town's chamber of commerce was ready with a deputation, who wished to discuss \\"health, railway communication links, and the export of stud sheep\\" with the Prime Minister, thus reflecting the day's issues of local concern. The deputation especially protested the stud sheep exports to Africa. Mr. Bruce told the deputation that his Ministry would not consider banning this practice unless the pastoral industry itself requested such action. To that end, he suggested that the deputation raise the issue with the pastoralists themselves. The Prime Minister left later that day for Hughenden, after having spent less than three hours in Winton. On 27 February 1928, a famous Australian pioneer aviator, Bert Hinkler, touched down at Winton on his way from Camooweal to Longreach; he also made intermediate stops at Cloncurry and McKinlay. Also in 1928, the Central Western railway line reached Winton from Longreach. This was the second railway to reach Winton after the line from Hughenden reached town in 1899. The newer line was hailed by one newspaper with the assertion that \\"It will allow capital that has been lying idle to become revenue producing, it will provide facilities for the transfer of rolling stock, it will provide quicker touch with markets and reduce transport costs, and it will insure the graziers and the State against the probable loss of millions of sheep in drought time.\\" Despite that reporter's rosy assessment of the boon that the new railway would be to Winton's economy, the 1930s brought Winton's wool industry hard times. A meeting of the local branch of the Graziers' Association of Central and Northern Queensland in 1938 wanted to make known to the general public that for roughly a decade by that time, the revenue brought on the market by wool was outstripped by the production cost, thus incurring loss. The meeting also declared itself in opposition to any plan to register .303 rifles, but decided that their use ought to be restricted to those 18 and over. The hard times apparently even affected telephone service. In 1936, the whole vast region west of Winton, all the way to Boulia, a distance of roughly 300 km, was served by a single party line – Winton 101 – which was leased from the Winton telephone provider by the Middleton Telephone Company, a private company based in Middleton, about halfway between Winton and Boulia. Only now, the line was falling into disrepair, with attendant unreliability in the service, and there were demands for it to be assumed by the government. The foreseen cost of doing this was then said to be £28,000. Elderslie Street about 1930. Clearly visible are the North Gregory Hotel as it looked then, and Corfield & Fitzmaurice General Merchants (although by this time, both its founders belonged to the town's history) Another public service was affected by these hard times, namely the ambulance brigade. A Mr. Charles Holland, from Ipswich, was the chosen one from among 25 applicants from all over Queensland to become Winton's new superintendent of ambulance services. He left Ipswich for Winton on 7 April 1930, only to be dismissed a mere six months later owing to the pitiful state of the Winton ambulance committee's finances. That same year, the Railway Department removed all stationmasters from its line between Winton and Hughenden, although the move apparently did not affect the stationmasters at those two towns. Work on dismantling a railway track that was to have been part of a considerable inland network was undertaken in 1931. The track only ever reached a short distance west of Winton. The work was partly a relief effort, with all the workmen involved in the job being drawn from the local unemployed. The two working railway links at Winton came in handy in 1932 when track washouts along the Queensland coast forced some travellers to take a long inland detour, by way of Winton. Winton railway station became very busy. On 24 May 1933, which was Empire Day, Winton was honoured with a viceregal visit in the person of Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland. He stayed in town overnight after having arrived by train from Hughenden with his wife, Lady Wilson and his entourage and taking part in a civic reception. His party left again by train the next morning bound for Longreach. On 3 October 1934, a Qantas plane bound for Winton from Longreach, the Atlanta (in some sources, Atalanta), a de Havilland DH.50, caught fire in the air near its destination and the pilot tried, unsuccessfully, to make an emergency landing not far west of town before the fire on board set the fuel tank off. Complicating matters just then was a dust storm, which made for very poor visibility, and which later also delayed the sighting of the wreck by searchers. The aircraft came down in a ball of fire, killing the pilot and his two business passengers, one of whom, a sandalwood buyer named William McKnoe, was from Winton. Modern road conditions apparently had yet to come to Winton in 1934. A visiting pastoral company general manager, commenting on roads in western Queensland in general said that the roads in the Shire of Cloncurry were the worst in the state, but added that among streets in the state's towns, Winton's were the worst in Queensland. A heatwave struck Winton the next month, with temperatures reaching a reported 113 °F (45 °C) on 24 November. On 5 August 1938, Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons visited Winton on an extended tour of Queensland, the first Prime Minister to visit the town since Stanley Bruce's visit in 1927. The chairman of the Shire Council, T. J. Shanahan, had a wish list for the Prime Minister. He asked for assistance from both state and federal levels for the wool industry, an \\"A class\\" radio station and a railway to the Barclay Tableland (which has never been built). Further deputations also asked for improvements to Winton's aerodrome and for national highways to be built in western Queensland. It was another nine years before Winton's demands for a radio station were met, and even then, the broadcasts were sent out from Longreach, not Winton. Nevertheless, there was proper wireless service beginning on 19 March 1947, when ABC's transmitter at Longreach came into service. Disaster struck Winton's business community in September 1938 when a fire tore through several buildings in the middle of town. Destroyed were the Royal Mail Hotel, the Olympia Picture Theatre (whose projection room was in the hotel), a building and a house owned by townsman Stanton Mellick, and a building owned by a man named William Thomson who operated a hardware and saddlery shop with his brother, James Thomson. Some of these buildings contained several businesses. The fire broke out in the cinema's spool room and spread quickly. Firefighters had to deal with low water pressure due to ongoing repairs. The damage caused by the fire was reckoned to be between £17,000 and £18,000. Nobody was injured. Second World War and later 20th century In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and Australia joined the Allies. There was a proposal, which met with great enthusiasm in Winton, to form a Western Battalion. A Colonel Hoad delivered a speech in June on the proposal at the Shire Hall before \\"a big crowd of young men\\", asking them to join up to show their support for the Western Battalion. Forty men responded by joining up on the spot. In June 1942, a United States Congressman stayed overnight at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton. This was an uncommon event in itself, especially during the Second World War, but it was made all the more so because he and a number of American military personnel – including two generals – had just survived an emergency landing of The Swoose at Carisbrooke Station, about 85 km southwest of Winton, and also because the Congressman happened to be Lyndon B. Johnson, who was later to become President of the United States. On 27 June 1946, there was a royal visit as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester came to visit Winton for half an hour. The 1946 North Gregory Hotel fire; silhouetted at right is the Corfield & Fitzmaurice Store. The aftermath On 7 August 1946, the North Gregory Hotel burnt down, for the third time, in a fire that also consumed several other nearby businesses. Firefighters' efforts were supplemented by a bucket brigade, but even so, the blaze took three hours to quench. The damage was set at £30,000. There was no mention of injuries. In 1951, Winton held its first rodeo and it was very popular and successful. It quickly became a yearly event, and three years later, 4,700 people came into the town – whose population was then about 1,300 – for the rodeo. There was not enough room for them all at the local hotels, and 600 of them slept on stretcher beds brought into town by local graziers. There was £1050 in prize money. In 1953, a replacement for the North Gregory Hotel – this one built of brick, not wood – was nearing completion. The task had been taken on by Winton Shire Council because nobody else could be found who was willing to build the replacement. The project's estimated cost was £120,000. As of May that year, the Council still had not decided whether to run the hotel itself or to lease it to another operator. The hotel was to have amenities that were then quite uncommon in Central West Queensland, including air conditioning in the bar, the dining room and the lounge. The town was seeking to provide other, more public amenities in the late 1940s and early 1950s as well, including a £100,000 sewerage scheme and a cooling tower for the artesian bore water, which came out of the ground quite hot. The expenditure of £17,000 on this was \\"essential if the water is to be 100 per cent. effective for fire-fighting.\\" The same 1948 news item that announced these proposals also mentioned a project for a \\"municipal hotel\\", needed after the North Gregory Hotel had burnt down, and the foreseen cost for that was \\"between £30,000 and £40,000\\". There were obviously some cost overruns (see above). In 1962, some fossilized dinosaur tracks were discovered at a quarry and are now on display at their original site in a climate-controlled building at Lark Quarry Dinosaur Trackways some southwest of Winton. On 22 September 1966, there was another aviation disaster near Winton. Ansett-ANA Flight 149, a Vickers Viscount aircraft, had taken off from Mount Isa on a 73-minute flight to Longreach, when it ran into trouble 44 minutes into the flight, once an engine fire broke out. The blaze quickly spread to the fuel tank, resulting in part of the left wing breaking away. This sealed the aircraft's fate. It crashed some west of Winton, at Nadjayamba Station, killing all 24 people on board. The crash site was not very far from where the 1934 Atlanta disaster had happened. On the 40th anniversary of the accident in 2006, a memorial was unveiled in the main street of Winton. In \\"1972/73\\", a new festival began in Winton, the Outback Festival. This is held every other year, in odd-numbered years, in September, and was originally conceived as something that would boost Winton's local economy, for the years leading up to the first Outback Festival had been drought years. In November 1974, Winton got its own television transmitter, ABWNQ-8. This broadcasts the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Queensland service, based in Brisbane. The tower stands about 20 km north of town. Another Prime Minister visited Winton in 1979, Malcolm Fraser. He used the occasion to make known his government's intention to undertake \\"an urgent inquiry on how to overcome worsening fuel shortages.\\" In April 1995, Winton marked the centenary of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" with a festival. Prime Minister Paul Keating and Queensland Premier Wayne Goss showed up for the festivities, and among other things, they unveiled a statue of Banjo Paterson. In 1998, the Waltzing Matilda Centre opened. In 1999, a huge Cretaceous sauropod about 95 million years old was unearthed near Winton. It was dubbed \\"Elliot\\". 21st century In 2002, a \\"non‐profit science initiative\\" named Australian Age of Dinosaurs was established whose aim is to expose Australian dinosaurs at a world-class museum. One project sought to contain the Lark Quarry Dinosaur Trackways near Opalton inside a climate-controlled building to preserve and display them, a project that has been accomplished. In 2009, three new dinosaur species were given their scientific nomenclature (with nicknames in round brackets). They are Australovenator wintonensis (\\"Banjo\\"), Diamantinasaurus matildae (\\"Matilda\\") and Wintonotitan wattsi (\\"Clancy\\"). At the , Winton had a population of 954. A cultural disaster struck Winton in June 2015 when the Waltzing Matilda Centre burnt down, destroying many artefacts. 2015 Waltzing Matilda Centre fire On the night of 17 June 2015, fire broke out in the Waltzing Matilda Centre, the building that housed town's information centre and a museum housing a collection of historic artifacts. Firefighters arrived within minutes to find the rear of the building engulfed in flames, the teams fought desperately to save the front of the building and any artifacts that hadn't already been destroyed. Despite all efforts, the entire structure was reduced to a smoldering wreck with little evidence of the building ever housing such a unique museum. The fire has been deemed unsuspicious and investigators are currently looking for clues to the cause of the blaze. The building was unoccupied at the time of the fire and there were no casualties. The rebuilt museum reopened in April 2018. Attractions=Waltzing Matilda Centre Winton is intimately involved in the story of the popular Australian folk song, \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", which had its first performance in the North Gregory Hotel in the town. The Waltzing Matilda Centre opened in 1998 and is the first museum dedicated to a song. The song was written by 'Banjo' Paterson whilst holidaying at a local property, Dagworth Station. The music for the song was arranged by Christina Macpherson, the sister of the station manager who was visiting at the same time. In 2012, to remind Australians of the song's significance, Winton organised the inaugural Waltzing Matilda Day to be held on 6 April, the anniversary of its first performance. Royal Theatre The historic Royal Theatre is one of the few remaining open-air picture theatres in Australia and home to the World's Largest Deckchair which was originally constructed in Victoria by the Freemasons Taskforce in 2002 and donated to Winton and the Royal Theatre by the members of that taskforce in April 2005. Outback Festival The Outback Festival has been recognized since 1991 winning many Outback Queensland Tourism accolades including the recent 2012 Winner of the Outback Queensland Tourism Awards for Festivals and Events and finalist at the Queensland Regional Achievement and Community Awards. The Festival being one of three chosen from over 90 Queensland organizations for the Community of Year Award. Featured events include the Quilton Australian Dunny Derby. The Outback Century Cycle Challenge is also held over this event period, attracting competitors from all over Australia for their one chance in every two years of mastering the outback course. Arno's Wall Arno's wall is a strange mixture of art and architecture. Cemented contents of the wall include rusted lawnmower parts, boat propellers, vintage typewriters and sewing machines and even a couple of complete motorbikes. A photograph of the wall by Gordon Undy is in the National Library of Australia digital collection.

New Dorp is bounded by Mill Road on the southeast, Tysens Lane on the southwest, Amboy and Richmond Roads on the northwest, and Bancroft Avenue on the northeast. It is adjacent to Oakwood to the southwest, Todt Hill to the northwest, Dongan Hills and Grant City, and Midland Beach and Miller Field to the southeast. New Dorp Beach, bordering to the east, is often listed on maps as a separate neighborhood from Mill Road to the shore of Lower New York Bay, but is generally considered to be a part of New Dorp. One of the earliest European settlements in the New York City area, New Dorp was founded by Dutch settlers from the New Netherland colony, and the name is an anglicization of , meaning \\"New Village\\" in Dutch. It was historically one of the most important towns on Staten Island, becoming a part of New York City in 1898 as part of the Borough of Richmond. In the 1960s New Dorp ceased to be a distinct town during New York City's suburbanization, where rapid housing development on Staten Island saw the town added to the city conurbation. Despite this, today New Dorp remains one of the main commercial and transport centers on Staten Island. New Dorp is often associated with the Vanderbilt family, who had a notable presence in the area and many of whom are buried in the neighborhood at the Moravian Cemetery, the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island. New Dorp is part of Staten Island Community District 2 and its ZIP Code is 10306. New Dorp is patrolled by the 122nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History Photograph of a cows standing on a dirt path at a farm in New Dorp, reflecting the area's former agricultural character. New Dorp was the location of the first county seat of Richmond County. Called Stony Brook, it was located approximately where Amboy Road experiences a sharp bend between the New Dorp and Oakwood train stations.Morris, Ira. Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, New York, Volume 1. 1898, page 40 In 1667, at the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Republic ceded their colony of New Netherland to England as a condition of the Treaty of Breda. The colony had been occupied by the English since 1664, and was re-branded as the Province of New York when it was granted as a proprietary colony to James, Duke of York. The areas of New Netherland already settled by the Dutch included the primary settlement of New Amsterdam (now renamed New York City) located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, and numerous additional lands around the city and along the Hudson River. This included Staaten Eylandt, later anglicized as \\"Staten Island\\", a sparsely populated island south-west of New York across Upper New York Bay. In 1670, the local Native Americans, mainly Raritans and other subgroups of the Lenape tribe, ceded all claims to Staten Island to the English in a deed to Governor Francis Lovelace. New Dorp was founded in 1671 following the English resurveying the pre-existing Dutch settlement of (now Old Town) and expanded the lots along the South Shore, which were then settled primarily by Dutch families. The new lots became known as (meaning \\"New Village\\" in the Dutch language), in contrast with (meaning \\"Old Village\\"), and later became anglicized as New Dorp. The new village developed into one of the largest and most important settlements on Staten Island, and during the American Revolution it became a center of activity when it was occupied by British forces in preparation to attack the American-occupied New York City. The Rose and Crown Tavern in New Dorp, owned by the uncle of Cornelius Vanderbilt, temporarily served as the local British military headquarters. In the late 19th century, New Dorp became the home to members of the prominent Vanderbilt family, many of whom are buried in the Moravian Cemetery, the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island. On January 1, 1898, New Dorp was consolidated as part of New York City along with the entirety of Staten Island as the Borough of Richmond. The Vanderbilt farm was later used by the U.S. Army as Miller Air Field, and in the 1970s became part of Gateway National Recreation Area. New Dorp continued to be one of the primary settlements on Staten Island until the 1960s, when the suburbanization of New York City began to expand into the island. The largely rural character of Staten Island was replaced with the massive development of suburban housing, causing separate towns such as New Dorp to be absorbed into New York City's conurbation and become one of many contiguous neighborhoods. New Dorp retained its distinct character as a town, and is one of the most thriving commercial centers on the Island which in the 1960s spread along Hylan Boulevard from New Dorp Lane and led to the construction of five shopping centers, anchored by supermarkets and department stores, with the largest being Hylan Plaza which opened in 1966. The 1960 New York mid-air collision, where 134 people were killed and held the highest death toll for a commercial aviation accident until 1968, occurred over New Dorp.  New Dorp Lane District  The New Dorp Lane District is an entity which is controlled by the merchants and operated by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation.

New Dorp Lane is known for its quaint small-town appeal which is the main draw for Staten Islanders. East of the Staten Island Railway, New Dorp Lane consists mainly of retail shops and restaurants. West of the Staten Island Railway, there are places of business that are mainly real-estate brokers, law offices, a funeral home, and Our Lady Queen of Peace Roman Catholic Church.

Hilling, earthing up or ridging is the technique in agriculture and horticulture of piling soil up around the base of a plant. It can be done by hand (usually using a hoe), or with powered machinery, typically a tractor attachment. Hilling buries the normally above-ground part of the plant, promoting desired growth. This may encourage the development of additional tubers (as with potatoes), force the plant to grow longer stems (leeks), or for some crops (chicory, leeks, asparagus etc.) this blanching technique keeps the stems or shoots pale and tender, or influences their taste. Hilling may also be used to stabilize the stems of crops which are easily disturbed by wind. Examples A common application of hilling is for potatoes. The tubers grow just below the surface, and can produce chlorophyll and solanine if exposed to light (green potatoes). Solanine is toxic in large doses, and can result in nausea, headache, and in rare cases, death. By hilling one or more times during the growing season - effectively, burying the potatoes in an additional few inches of soil - yield is improved, and the harvest remains edible.

It is an enhanced version of Pokémon Red and Blue, loosely based on the anime and is part of the first generation of the Pokémon video game series. Along with the release of Pokémon Yellow, a special edition yellow Pokémon-themed Game Boy Color was also released. It was first released in Japan on September 12, 1998, in North America and Australia in 1999 and in Europe in 2000. The Nintendo Switch games Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! are remakes of Pokémon Yellow and were released worldwide in 2018, the 20th anniversary of Pokémon Yellows launch in Japan. Gameplay In-game screenshot of Pokémon Yellow played on a Game Boy Color, with the main character's Pikachu following behind The player's Pikachu engaged in a battle with an Eevee Pokémon Yellow is an enhanced version of the Game Boy games Pokémon Red and Blue. Like its predecessors, it is a third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and a menu interface, in which the player configures their party of Pokémon, items, or gameplay settings. The player uses their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During battle, the player may select one of up to four moves for their Pokémon to use, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have health points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level dictates its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned. Catching Pokémon is another essential element of the gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures. Pokémon Yellow allows players to trade Pokémon between two cartridges via a Game Link Cable, including the previous games Pokémon Red and Blue. This method of trading must be done to fully complete the Pokédex, since each of the games has version- exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. Pokémon Yellow features several enhancements and changes. Including the below-mentioned inclusion of Pikachu as the only available Pokémon to start with, Pikachu is given both a voice and a personality unique from other Pokémon. It follows the player on the overworld, and can be examined by speaking to it by pressing A when the overworld character is facing Pikachu. While it initially has an indifferent opinion of the player, it can grow to love or hate them based on the player's actions; leveling up will keep Pikachu happy, while fainting frequently will make it unhappy. This enhanced feature would be used again in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver, and Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, the remakes of Pokémon Yellow. There is an area in Pokémon Yellow that features a \\"Surfing Pikachu\\" mini-game. In order to play it, players must have a Pikachu who can learn \\"Surf\\", a Water-based attack. At the time, players could only accomplish this by winning a contest to get a \\"Surfing Pikachu\\". However, if players use their Pikachu from Yellow in Pokémon Stadium and beat a certain mode under the proper circumstances, they are rewarded with the move Surf, which can be used both in battle, out of battle, and in the above-mentioned mini-game. Pokémon Yellow has slightly improved graphics from its predecessors and can print Pokédex entries onto stickers using the Game Boy Printer. Plot Like Pokémon Red and Blue, Yellow takes place in the Kanto region, which features habitats for 151 Pokémon species. The objectives remain the same as well, though some differences exist along the way. For example, in the beginning, the player is not given an option of choosing one of three starter Pokémon. Instead, a wild Pikachu that Professor Oak catches becomes the player's starter Pokémon, while the rival character takes an Eevee. The plot is loosely based on the Indigo League saga of the anime, and features characters that were not featured in the game or have been enhanced to resemble their designs used in the anime, including Jessie, James, Meowth, Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. Similar to the anime, Pikachu refuses to evolve. Players are also given the opportunity to obtain the original three starters. As players quest on, they gradually progress catching Pokémon for the Pokédex which they use to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four, all the while battling Team Rocket, a gang devoted to using Pokémon in order to make themselves more powerful. By the time of the encounter with the Elite Four the player has had the opportunity to capture 149 types of Pokémon; in the post-game, after the Elite Four has been defeated, the player may enter Cerulean Cave, where Mewtwo, the final Pokémon in regular gameplay, can be found, battled and captured. The last Pokémon in the Pokédex, Mew, cannot be captured during ordinary gameplay, though exploiting bugs in the game makes this possible. Development Pokémon Yellow first began development after the completion of the Japanese- only version of Pokémon Blue, which itself followed the Japanese-only versions of Pokémon Red and Green. It was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy handheld game console. Pokémon Pink On April 11, 2020, references to an unknown 'Pink' build for Pokémon Yellow were discovered in its source code after a source code leak, leading many fans to believe that a companion version was meant to be released alongside Yellow. However, it is unknown whether or not there were any plans for a 'Pink' version or what Pokémon would have been its mascot, although it is speculated to be either Jigglypuff or Clefairy. Release Pokémon Yellows release was made to coincide with the release of Pokémon: The First Movie. Future Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later commented that people likely felt Yellow to be unnecessary due to the upcoming release of Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were scheduled to be released in the same year. It was released in Japan on September 12, 1998, in Australia on September 3, 1999, in North America on October 19, 1999, and in Europe on June 16, 2000. A Pikachu-themed Game Boy Color bundle was released in North America on October 25, 1999. To promote the release of Pokémon Yellow, Volkswagen and Nintendo collaborated to create a yellow Volkswagen New Beetle with some its features inspired by Pikachu. Nintendo World Report listed Pokémon Yellow as one of the notable handheld releases in 1999. Pokémon Yellow was the final Nintendo-published title released for the original Game Boy in North America and Europe. Virtual Console During the Nintendo Direct presentation on November 12, 2015, it was announced that Pokémon Yellow, alongside Red and Blue, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console service on February 27, 2016 to mark the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon franchise. In addition to retaining their original graphical and musical formats, all three games feature local wireless functionality to enable trading and battling with other players due to the 3DS' usage of wireless communication. The game would also be bundled with a special yellow version of the Nintendo 2DS in Japan. While the international versions of the game would be a Game Boy Color title, the Japanese version was only released in its black and white Game Boy format since it was originally released in Japan about a month before the Game Boy Color in that region. The Game Boy Printer features do not work on the 3DS Virtual Console version of Pokémon Yellow. The Virtual Console version is compatible with Pokémon Bank, allowing players to transfer their captured creatures to Pokémon Sun and Moon. Reception=Critical reception Pokémon Yellow has been well received by critics, holding an aggregate score of 85% from GameRankings based on 16 reviews, making it the fifth highest-rated Game Boy game of all time. Nintendo Power gave it an 8 out of 10, while Game Informer gave it a 6.5 out of 10. Electric Playground gave it a 7.5 out of 10. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune recommended Yellow as a good game for children. RPGFan called it \\"so revoltingly addictive that any player of it has no choice but to 'catch 'em all'\\". They also called Yellow \\"insulting\\" in how limited the additions from Red and Blue were. IGNs Craig Harris praised the game's mechanics, commenting that Yellow was the best game of the three to start with. He gave it a perfect score. GameSpots Cameron Davis called it a \\"stopgap\\" to appease players until the release of Gold and Silver, commenting that \\"the new challenges are enough to fill the hole - but only just\\". GameDailys Chris Buffa listed it as one of the best Pokémon games, commenting that while it was a rehash, there was enough that was new to warrant playing. Allgames Brad Cook commented that for those who didn't play Red and Blue, Yellow was good; but otherwise, he advised that they wait until Gold and Silver. The Daily Telegraphs Steve Boxer commented that while it had good gameplay mechanics, it was held back by the lack of features. He described Nintendo's actions as avaricious, commenting that Yellow \\"marks the point where Pokémon ceases to become a game and becomes a marketing exercise/obsession-satisfier\\". Pokémon Yellow received two nominations for \\"Game of the Year\\" and \\"Console Game of the Year\\" during the 3rd Annual AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards). Sales Before its release, Nintendo anticipated that it would make them $75 million in the 1999 holiday season. The Pokémon Yellow Game Boy Color bundle was predicted to be the second most popular toy of the holiday season. Nintendo executive George Harrison predicted that Yellows sales would exceed 3 million in sales, and would also surpass Donkey Kong 64 in the process, another title anticipated to sell well by Nintendo. In North America the game received roughly 150,000 pre-orders. The bundle debuted at #2 in video game sales and claimed the #1 spot a week later. For the month of December, Yellow was surpassed by both Donkey Kong 64 and Gran Turismo 2. The standard cartridge sold over 600,000 units in its first week and more than one million copies by the next week, becoming the fastest selling handheld game of all time when it was released. Yellow was also the fastest selling Pokémon title in the United Kingdom. Pokémon: The First Movie, a film released around the same time as Yellow, was expected to give it a sales boost. A Nintendo spokesman attributed the high demand for the Game Boy Color during the Christmas season of 1999 to Yellow. Gwenn Friss of the Cape Cod Times called it one of the hottest items of the 1999 Christmas season, comparing it to popular Christmas toys from previous years such as Furby and Tickle me Elmo. Thomas Content of USA Today reiterated the comparison, commenting that it was \\"poised to stomp\\" them. He added that it, along with Red and Blue, were responsible for the boost of Game Boy sales from 3.5 million in 1998 to 8 million in 1999. The Idaho Statesman called it the \\"hottest new title for the Game Boy Color\\". Yellow was the third best-selling video game in North America in 1999, with the other four spots occupied by other Pokémon titles. The demand for Yellow resulted in Target to issue an apology for not being able to meet the \\"unprecedented demand\\". A survey conducted by CNET also found that none of the stores it contacted had Yellow in stock. A spokesperson for FuncoLand attributed a drop in sales to shortages of both the Game Boy Color and Pokémon Yellow. Legacy=Remakes and are enhanced remakes of Pokémon Yellow Version, released in November 2018 for the Nintendo Switch. They were aimed at newcomers to the Pokémon series, and incorporate mechanics from Pokémon Go. The games take place in the Kanto region and include only the original 151 Pokémon from the first generation of Pokémon. The ability for Pokémon to accompany the protagonist in the overworld returns, a feature last seen in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver on the Nintendo DS. However, whereas only one Pokémon could be chosen to follow the protagonist previously, they will additionally be accompanied by the starter Pikachu or Eevee in Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee!, respectively. They have combined global sales of over 10 million copies.

In 1959 AEI decided to remove those brands and consolidate both as AEI brands, resulting in internal problems and a fall in sales and market value. The abandonment of two well known trademarks and the replacement with the unfamiliar AEI branding lost the company significant work to competitors and resulted in a market weakening of the company. These problems paved the way for a takeover in 1967 with the recently restructured General Electric Company plc (GEC) under Arnold Weinstock. The following year GEC merged with English Electric. GEC later went through substantial restructuring, including in 1989 forming GEC ALSTHOM and Cegelec Projects. GEC ALSTHOM was created from the GEC's Power and Transport businesses (originally AEI (previously BTH and Metrovick) and English Electric) and the French Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE). The merger was to enable both companies a gain a greater export potential into Europe. The GEC facilities in Rugby were split into GEC Alstom and Cegelec Projects, but in 1998 the two companies were reunited under the Alstom banner.

The growing season is that portion of the year in which local conditions (i.e. rainfall, temperature, daylight) permit normal plant growth. While each plant or crop has a specific growing season that depends on its genetic adaptation, growing seasons can generally be grouped into macro-environmental classes. Geography Geographic conditions have major impacts on the growing season for any given area. Latitude is one of the major factors in the length of the growing season. The further north one goes, the angle of the Sun gets lower in the sky. Consequently, sunlight is less direct and the low angle of the Sun means that soil takes longer to warm during the spring months, so the growing season begins later. The other factor is altitude, with high elevations having cooler temperatures which shortens the growing season compared with a low-lying area of the same latitude. Season extension In agriculture, season extension is anything that allows a crop to be cultivated beyond its normal outdoor growing season. Examples include greenhouses, polytunnels, row cover, and cloches.  Locations = North America  The continental United States ranges from 49° north at the US-Canadian border to 25° north at the southern tip of the US-Mexican border. Most populated areas of Canada are below the 55th parallel. North of the 45th parallel, the growing season is generally 4-5 months, beginning in late April or early May and continuing to late September-early October, and is characterized by warm summers and cold winters with heavy snow. South of the 35th parallel, the growing season is year-round in many areas with hot summers and mild winters. Cool season crops such as peas, lettuce, and spinach are planted in fall or late winter, while warm season crops such as beans and corn are planted in late winter to early spring. In the desert Southwest, the growing season effectively runs from October to March as the summer months are characterized by extreme heat and arid conditions, making it inhospitable for plants not adapted to this environment. Certain crops such as tomatoes and melons originated in subtropical or tropical regions, consequently they require hot weather and a growing season of eight months or more. In colder climate areas where they cannot be directly sowed in the ground, these plants are usually started indoors in a greenhouse and transplanted outside in late spring or early summer. Europe The Pyrenees and Alps effectively divide Europe into two different regions. The Mediterranean, which is below the 45th parallel, has growing seasons of six months or more and is characterized by hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation mainly falls between October and March, with the summer being dry. In the southern Mediterranean, the growing season is year-round. Mediterranean vegetation is often evergreen due to the mild winters. Northern Europe ranges from the 45th parallel up past the Arctic Circle. The growing seasons are shorter due to the lower angle of the Sun and generally range from five months to as little as three in Scandinavia and Russia. The Atlantic coast of Europe is moderated considerably by humid ocean air, thus winters are mild and it is rare to see freezing weather or snow. Summers are also mild and as a consequence, many heat-loving plants such as corn will not grow in northern Europe. Further inland, away from the ocean, winters become considerably colder. Despite the short growing season in Scandinavia and Russia, the extreme length of daylight during summer (17 hours or more) allows plants to put on significant growth. Tropics and deserts In some warm climates, such as the subtropical savanna and Sonoran Deserts or in the drier Mediterranean climates, the growing season is limited by the availability of water, with little growth in the dry season. Unlike in cooler climates where snow or soil freezing is a generally insurmountable obstacle to plant growth, it is often possible to greatly extend the growing season in hot climates by irrigation using water from cooler and/or wetter regions. This can in fact go so far as to allow year-round growth in areas that without irrigation could only support xerophytic plants. Also in these tropical regions; the growing season can be interrupted by periods of heavy rainfall, called the rainy season. For example, in Colombia, where coffee is grown and can be harvested year-round, they don’t see a rainy season. However, in Indonesia, another large coffee-producing area, they experience this rainy season and the growth of the coffee beans is interrupted.

He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1852 and again from 1858 to 1859. Background and education Eglinton was born in Palermo, Sicily, the son of Major-General Archibald Montgomerie, Lord Montgomerie (30 July 17734 January 1814), the eldest son of Hugh Montgomerie, 12th Earl of Eglinton. His mother was Lady Mary Montgomerie (died 1848), daughter of General Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton. He was educated at Eton. As a pastime he enjoyed playing golf. One of his playing partners was James Ogilvie Fairlie. Political career Eglinton was a staunch Tory. In 1846, he was a whip in the House of Lords; on 28 May 1846, he spoke against the Corn Importation Bill; in May 1848 he opposed the Jewish Disabilities Bill. In February 1852, he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under the Earl of Derby. He retired with the ministry in the following December. When Derby returned to office in February 1858 he was again appointed Lord-Lieutenant, and he discharged the duties of this post until June 1859. In this year he was created Earl of Wintoun, an earldom which had been held by his kinsfolk, the Setons, from 1600 until 1716, when George Seton, 5th Earl of Wintoun, was deprived of his honours for high treason. Anstruther gives the date for this creation as 1840.Anstruther, Page 83 The Earl's kinswoman, Georgina Talbot, in celebration of the restoration of the title, gave the slightly altered name 'Winton' then in Hampshire now Winton, Dorset to a residential development in Bournemouth, which she was creating at this time.'The Lives and Times of the Mayors of Bournemouth', Bournemouth Council, 2000 He died at Mount Melville House, near St. Andrews, on 4 October 1861, and was buried in the family vault at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, on 11 October 1861. Horse racing Lord Eglinton's main object of interest for some years was the turf; he kept a large racing stud and won success and reputation in the sporting world. His most successful horse was The Flying Dutchman which won The Derby and St Leger Stakes in 1849. The Eglinton Tournament In 1839, Lord Eglinton's name became more widely known in connection with the Eglinton Tournament. This took place at Eglinton castle and is said to have cost him £30,000 or £40,000. Contemporary ridicule is better remembered today than it successes. It was partly spoiled by the unfavourable weather, the rain falling in torrents, but it was a real tournament, participants having attended regular training during the course of the year prior and lances being broken in the orthodox way. Prince Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) and Lady Seymour, a granddaughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the wife of Lord Seymour, afterwards 12th Duke of Somerset, took part. A list of the challengers with an account of the jousts and the mêlée will be found in the volume on the tournament written by the Reverend John Richardson, with drawings by James Henry Nixon (1843). It was also described in Disraeli's Endymion. Family Lord Eglinton married, firstly, Theresa Howe Cockerell, née Newcomen, widow of Captain Richard Howe Cockerell RN (1798–1839, buried Park St, Calcutta). Mrs Cockerell was an illegitimate daughter (out of 8 children)Genealogical entry for Newcomen of Thomas Gleadowe-Newcomen, 2nd Viscount Newcomen (1776–1825) and his long-term mistress Harriet Holland, on 17 February 1841. Theresa Newcomen was born in Calcutta in 1809, and died on 16 December 1853 at Eglinton Castle. They had the following children: * Archibald Montgomerie, 14th Earl of Eglinton (3 December 184130 August 1892) * Lady Egidia Montgomerie (c. 184313 January 1880) * Hon. Seton Montolieu Montgomerie (15 May 184626 November 1883) who left daughters * George Montgomerie, 15th Earl of Eglinton (23 February 184810 August 1919), ancestor of the present Earl According to Eglinton's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, as cited here, this marriage was the great mistake of his life. However, his stepdaughter Anna Theresa Cockerell (1836–1912), aided by her mother's second marriage, went on to marry Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 19th Earl of Shrewsbury. After Theresa's death in December 1853, her widower married, secondly, the Hon. Adela Caroline Harriett, daughter of Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex, in 1858. They had the following children: * Lady Sybil Amelia Montgomerie (died 3 February 1932) * Lady Hilda Rose Montgomerie (died Bangors, Iver, Buckinghamshire, 18 June 1928), married Tonman Mosley, 1st Baron Anslow. Lady Adela died in December 1860, aged only 32. Lord Eglinton survived her by less than a year and died in October 1861, aged 49. He was succeeded by his eldest son Archibald.

He was in the original Broadway casts of Bye Bye Birdie, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and Hello, Dolly!. He's best known for his television work on Match Game. One of his last works was an auto-biographical one-man play Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly that was filmed as an independent movie. Early life Reilly was born in The Bronx, the son of Charles Joseph Reilly, an Irish Catholic commercial artist, and Signe Elvera Nelson, a Swedish Lutheran. When young, he often made his own puppet theater to amuse himself, and his mother often told him to \\"save it for the stage\\". At age thirteen, he survived the 1944 Hartford circus fire which killed 167 people in Connecticut, and he never sat in an audience again throughout the remainder of his life. Because of the event's trauma, he rarely attended theater, stating that the large crowds reminded him of what happened that day.Dinner for Five, episode #3.9 (June 4, 2004). As he often stated on the Johnny Carson show and other such venues, that even as the director of a play or stage production he preferred to sit at the back of the house or the back of a balcony near the exits to preview his work including one time where his leading lady’s costume caught fire but on recounting this episode to Johnny assured him “but you know, these things always work out ok”. Reilly developed a love of opera and wanted to become an opera singer. He entered the Hartt School of Music as a voice major, but eventually abandoned this pursuit when he realized that he lacked the natural vocal talent to have a major career. However, opera remained a lifelong passion, and he was a frequent guest on opera-themed radio programs, including the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. He directed opera productions for the Chicago Opera Theater, Dallas Opera, Portland Opera, San Diego Opera, and Santa Fe Opera. He was good friends with opera singers Renée Fleming, Rod Gilfry, Roberta Peters, and Eileen Farrell. Career=Stage Reilly made his film debut with an uncredited role in A Face in the Crowd (1957), directed by Elia Kazan, although most of his early career was spent on the stage. He was a regular and popular performer in comic roles for several summer seasons in the 1950s at the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri. Reilly appeared in many Off Broadway productions. His big break came in 1960 with the enormously successful original Broadway production of Bye Bye Birdie. In the groundbreaking musical, Reilly had a small onstage part and was the standby for Dick Van Dyke in the leading role of Albert Peterson. In 1961, Reilly was in the original cast of another big Broadway hit, the Pulitzer prize-winning musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. For his memorable origination of the role of Bud Frump, Reilly earned a 1962 Tony Award for featured actor in a musical. In 1964, Reilly was featured in the original cast of Hello, Dolly!, another enormous success on Broadway. For originating the role of Cornelius Hackl, Reilly received a second nomination for a Tony Award for performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical. Television Reilly kept active in Broadway shows but he became better known for his TV work, appearing regularly on television in the 1960s. He appeared as one of the What's My Line? Mystery Guests and as a panelist on this program. In 1965, he made regular appearances on The Steve Lawrence Show, which aired for a single season. Television commercials that he made throughout the 1960s and 1970s included Excedrin and Bic Banana Ink Crayons. From 1968 to 1970, he appeared as the constantly flustered bumbler Claymore Gregg on the television series The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also appeared as a regular on The Dean Martin Show and had multiple guest appearances on various television series, including McMillan & Wife, The Patty Duke Show, Here's Lucy, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, The Love Boat, and Love, American Style. In 1971, he appeared as the evil magician Hoodoo in Lidsville, a children's program on ABC. Arnie, 1971. Reilly was also a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, appearing more than 100 times. He was a lively and reliable talk-show guest and lived within blocks of the Burbank studios where The Tonight Show was taped, so he was often asked to be a last-minute replacement for scheduled guests who did not make it to the studio in time. Reilly was a fixture on game shows, primarily due to his appearances as a regular panelist on Match Game. He was one of the longest-running guests, and often engaged in playful banter with fellow regular Brett Somers (the two generally sat next to each other on the show—Somers in the upper middle seat and Reilly in the upper right seat). He typically offered sardonic commentary and peppered his answers with homosexuality-themed double entendres which pushed the boundaries of 1970s television standards. During the taping of Match Game '74, Reilly left for a short time to film Hamburgers (1974). From 1975 to 1976, he starred in another live-action children's program titled Uncle Croc's Block, with Jonathan Harris. He was often a guest celebrity on the 1984 game show Body Language, including one week with Lucille Ball and another week with Audrey Landers. Later career From 1976, Reilly primarily taught acting and directing for television and theater, including directing Julie Harris (with whom he had acted in Skyscraper in 1965–66), who was portraying Emily Dickinson in her one-woman Broadway play The Belle of Amherst, by William Luce. In 1979, he directed Ira Levin's play Break a Leg on Broadway. Despite the previous year's success of Levin's Deathtrap, Break a Leg closed after one performance. Within days, Reilly appeared on The Tonight Show, joking and speaking at length about the show's failure, saying, \\"So [a play] can open and last six years, eight years... or two hours and five minutes.\\" Reilly earned a 1997 Tony Award nomination as Best Director of a Play for the revival of The Gin Game, starring Julie Harris. In 1990, he directed episodes of Evening Shade. Reilly also made guest appearances in the 1990s on The Drew Carey Show, The Larry Sanders Show, Family Matters, Second Noah, and as eccentric writer Jose Chung in the television series The X-Files (\\"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\\"), Millennium (\\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\\"), and occasionally as the voice of the Dirty Bubble in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants before he was replaced by Tom Kenny. Reilly was nominated for Emmy Awards in 1998 and 1999 for his performances in The Drew Carey Show and Millennium, respectively. Reilly was a longtime teacher of acting at HB Studio, the acting studio founded by Herbert Berghof and made famous by Berghof and his wife, the renowned stage actress Uta Hagen. His acting students included Lily Tomlin, Bette Midler, and Gary Burghoff.Gary Burghoff states it on Match Game 77 (Episode 1023) Reilly had a voice role in three films by Don Bluth: All Dogs Go to Heaven as Killer in 1989, Rock-a-Doodle as Hunch in 1991, and A Troll in Central Park as King Llort in 1994. In each one, he played the villain's dim- witted sidekick. Personal life Magazine and newspaper profiles of Reilly throughout the 1970s and 1980s did not mention his personal life or sexuality. Many years after the cancellation of Match Game, he revealed his homosexuality in his theatrical one-man show Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly. Much like fellow actor and game-show regular Paul Lynde of the same era, despite Reilly's off-camera silence, he gave signals on-camera of a campy persona. In many episodes of Match Game, he lampooned himself by briefly affecting \\"YO!\\" in a deep voice and the nickname \\"Chuck\\" and self-consciously describing how \\"butch\\" he was. Many years after his game show career ended, he mentioned in a 2002 interview with Entertainment Tonight that he felt no need to explain his jokes about Chuck and that he never purposely hid being gay from anyone. Patrick Hughes, a set decorator and dresser, was Reilly's domestic partner; the two met backstage while Reilly appeared on the game show Battlestars, although their partnership was not revealed publicly. They lived together in Beverly Hills. Reilly did appear on several episodes of the game show Tattletales with actress Elizabeth Allen as a couple, though their 'relationship' was never discussed on the air. Despite sporting what appeared to be a full head of hair for most of the prime of his television career, Reilly was in fact bald, wearing a toupée throughout most of his appearances in the 1970s and 1980s. During the taping of Match Game '74, his toupée became a joke when Reilly had to go to New York City to have his toupée adjusted. During the taping of several episodes, Reilly was seen wearing different hats because his toupée was back in New York waiting for him to be fitted. This was the start of the long-running jokes on Match Game about his hair. He abandoned the toupée in the late 1990s and appeared bald in public for the rest of his life. He dramatized the experience in his stage show The Life of Reilly. In one episode of Match Game '78, he took off his toupee and gave it to a bald contestant by putting it on his head. One can briefly see Reilly's bald head before he covers it up with a hat. Final years and death Reilly spent his later life primarily touring the U.S. directing theater and opera, and offering audiences a glimpse into his background and personal life with a critically acclaimed one-man play chronicling his life, titled Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly. In 2004, his final two performances of his play in North Hollywood, California were recorded as the basis of an autobiographical independent film titled The Life of Reilly. Reilly was stricken with respiratory problems while filming The Life of Reilly, and retired from directing and performing immediately after the final day of shooting. The movie premiered in March 2006 at the South by Southwest film festival, and Reilly's performance in the film received great acclaim. Reilly canceled his personal appearance at South by Southwest due to illness, and by the time the film premiered, he had been hospitalized. Reilly died of complications from pneumonia at the UCLA Medical Center on May 25, 2007, and his body was cremated. That weekend, the Game Show Network dedicated its programming to Reilly, airing some of his funniest episodes of Match Game.

(2005) – Dirty Bubble In popular culture For Big Lizard in My Backyard, their 1985 debut album, Philadelphia punk band The Dead Milkmen recorded a song titled \\"Serrated Edge\\" that features numerous absurd references to Reilly as a Jesus figure and orgy centerpiece. In 2001, Reilly was the subject of a sketch on Saturday Night Live, spoofing Inside the Actors Studio, and was portrayed by Alec Baldwin. A later Baldwin character, the Generalissimo from 30 Rock, mentions both Julie Harris and The Belle of Amherst, directed by Reilly as noted above. A 2008 parody of Match Game on Saturday Night Live included Fred Armisen playing a Reilly-like character. In the sketch, the host is found murdered moments before the show's taping; the subsequent on-air police investigation reveals that he had been having a clandestine homosexual affair with the Reilly character. Baldwin briefly reprised his portrayal of Reilly in the 30 Rock episode \\"Live from Studio 6H\\" (West Coast airing), appearing on the \\"joke wall\\" in a parody of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic wrote and recorded a tribute song titled \\"CNR\\", jokingly caricaturing Reilly with parodies of the internet phenomenon Chuck Norris Facts, with absurdities like winning the Tour de France \\"with two flat tires and a missing chain\\", or how \\"every day he'd make the host of Match Game give him a two hour piggyback ride\\". This was part of Yankovic's digital Internet Leaks EP, and was included on the 2011 CD release Alpocalypse. The music video was released by JibJab on August 4, 2009. In season two, episode one of The Life and Times of Tim, one character observes another acting a line from their play and says, \\"I saw Charles Nelson Reilly do that, and you did it better.\\" ReferencesExternal links   The Final Taxi podcast on Charles Nelson Reilly * Charles Nelson Reilly on DVD, plus Alec Baldwin's SNL impression  Interview with Charles Nelson Reilly by Bruce Duffie, April 17, 1988 (Mostly about directing opera, and stories about opera singers) Category:1931 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Male actors from Hartford, Connecticut Category:American male comedians Category:American male film actors Category:American male musical theatre actors Category:American male stage actors Category:American male television actors Category:American male voice actors Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Swedish descent Category:Broadway actors Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Gay actors Category:Infectious disease deaths in California Category:LGBT comedians Category:LGBT directors Category:LGBT entertainers from the United States Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:People from the Bronx Category:University of Hartford Hartt School alumni Category:Tony Award winners Category:LGBT people from Connecticut Category:Comedians from New York (state) Category:20th- century American male actors Category:21st-century American male actors Category:20th-century American comedians Category:21st-century American comedians Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Charles Nelson Reilly"},{"id":"432148","text":"Todt Hill ( ) is a hill formed of serpentine rock on Staten Island, New York. It is the highest natural point in the five boroughs of New York City and the highest elevation on the entire Atlantic coastal plain from Florida to Cape Cod. The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt, although much of the surrounding area is developed and residential. It is considered one of the most exclusive and most expensive areas of Staten Island. History The name Todt comes from the German word for \\"dead\\" and may refer to the cemetery (the present Moravian Cemetery, opened in 1740 and now the island's largest cemetery) on the southwestern foot of the ridge near the town of New Dorp that has been in use since colonial days. An alternate explanation is that the name was given by early Dutch settlers because of treeless rocky exposures on the hilltop, caused by the soil of the Staten Island Serpentinite locality. At the beginning of the 20th century, many houses designed by the architect Ernest Flagg were built in the area. A significant part of Todt Hill is now included in the Staten Island Greenbelt. Geography The term Todt Hill is now often used to include the upscale developments in the hills along the eastern side of the ridge, which most island geographers classify as part of the neighborhood of Dongan Hills. Two small, natural ponds are found on Todt Hill, and a Roman Catholic priory is located near the summit. Staten Island Academy, a private school, moved its campus to Todt Hill in the 1960s. There is a golf course adjoining the Moravian Cemetery, each of which has a man-made pond. Otherwise the hill is either parkland or private homes. There is no public transit available on Todt Hill, and most of the streets, including Todt Hill Road, the neighborhood's main thoroughfare, lack sidewalks. Demographics Todt Hill consists of the two census tracts 177 and 181 (though census tract 177 incorporates part of Emerson Hill). According to the 2010 census, the demographics of Todt Hill were 80% non Hispanic White, 1% Black, 11% Asian, and 1% Multiracial. Hispanics of any race made up 7% of the population. The median household income of the area is roughly $120,000. Todt Hill is one of Staten Island's most affluent areas. As of 2011, the population of the district is about 11,000 inhabitants. The population density was approximately 1,400 people per square kilometer. Notable residents *The late Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano lived there, in a house noted for its intended resemblance to the White House. His family continued to live on Todt Hill after his death, but moved in 2000. *Mob Wives reality television star, Drita D’avanzo, grew up in the Todt Hill Houses. *Former New York Mets relief pitcher John Franco currently lives on the hill. *The Corleone family compound from The Godfather was filmed on Todt Hill. *Frank Matthews, a notorious drug kingpin in the 1970s, lived on Todt Hill. *Frank Cali, acting boss of the Gambino crime family, was killed outside his home in Todt Hill on March 13, 2019. Transportation Todt Hill is served by multiple bus routes on Richmond Road, including the local buses, and the express bus.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Barnstaple (Devon) in 1852, and again in 1857, and for Ludlow (Shropshire) in 1863 and for Kidderminster (Worcestershire) in 1874. Origins He was the eldest son and heir of Sir James Fraser, 3rd Baronet, a colonel of the 7th Hussars, who had served on Wellington's staff at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Biography Fraser was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A. and M.A. In 1847 he was appointed an officer in the 1st Life Guards, but retired with a captain's rank in 1852. He then set about entering parliament, and the ups and downs of his political career were rather remarkable. He was returned for Barnstaple in 1852, but the election was declared void on account of bribery, and the constituency was disfranchised for two years. At the election of 1857 Sir William, who had meantime been defeated at Harwich, was again returned at Barnstaple. He was, however, defeated in 1859, but was elected in 1863 at Ludlow. This seat he held for only two years, when he was again defeated and did not re-enter parliament until 1874, when he was returned for Kidderminster, a constituency he represented for six years, when he retired. He was a familiar figure at the Carlton Club, always ready with a copious collection of anecdotes of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli and Napoleon III. William Fraser was a member of the Society of Dilettanti (1857) and the author of the book \\"Members of the Society of Dilettanti, 1736–1874, edited by Sir William Frazer\\", Chiswick Press. Bibliography Books written by him include: *Words on Wellington (1889) *Disraeli and His Day (1891) *Hic et Ubique (1893) *Napoleon III. (1896) *Waterloo Ball (1897). A book on the Duchess of Richmond's ball. Death He died in Westminster on 17 August 1898, aged 72.Chisholm, 1911 Bequests Fraser bequeathed a large fortune to be accumulated in trust during twenty-one years for the benefit of his nephew, Sir Keith Alexander Fraser, eldest son of General James Keith Fraser, formerly colonel of the 1st Life Guards, who succeeded him in the baronetcy. By his will dated 1 December 1886, and proved in October 1898, he further bequeathed a splendid collection of Gillray's caricatures to the House of Lords, a similar collection of H.B.'s caricatures, and a unique set of portraits of former speakers to the House of Commons; the chairs of Thackeray and Dickens respectively to the Travellers' and Athenæum Club, Nelson's sword to the United Service Club, Byron's sofa to the Garrick, the manuscript of Gray's 'Elegy' to Eton College library, and the Duke of Marlborough's sword to the Scots Guards at St. James's Palace. The chief portion of Sir William Fraser's library was sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby, 22 to 30 April 1901, and one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two lots fetched £20,334 18s., or more than twice what Fraser had given for them. The chief items were extra-illustrated books and books with autograph inscriptions by distinguished persons. NotesReferences * * Further reading * *Fraser, William Augustus (1902).

Playing for the St. Louis Cardinals (1924–1931) and Cincinnati Reds (1932–1935, 1937), Hafey was a strong line- drive hitter who batted for a high average on a consistent basis. Hafey was part of two World Series championship teams (in 1926 and 1931) as a Cardinal and also made history with the first hit in an All-Star game, starting in left field and batting cleanup for the National League in the 1933 game. He was selected by the Veterans Committee for the Baseball Hall of Fame in . In 2014, the Cardinals inducted him into their team hall of fame. Early life Hafey was born on February 12, 1903 in Berkeley, California. He attended Berkeley High School. The St. Louis Cardinals signed Hafey out of high school as a pitcher. However, Cardinals business manager Branch Rickey noticed Hafey's hitting abilities and decided that Hafey should become an outfielder. Career=St. Louis Cardinals Hafey played in the minor leagues for the Fort Smith Twins of the Western Association in 1923. He moved to the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League the next year, hitting .360 before being called up to the Cardinals near the end of the season. He split time between the Cardinals and Syracuse Stars in 1925. He spent the 1926 season with the Cardinals, but he played only 78 games. Hafey was the first major success of Rickey's expansive farm system, breaking through in 1927 when he led the National League in slugging. Hafey, however, had suffered multiple beanings in 1926. He developed sinus trouble and his vision deteriorated, and Hafey began to wear eyeglasses while playing. Although Specs Toporcer was the first baseball player to wear glasses, Hafey was the most prominent; he is one of two Hall of Famers with eyeglasses, Reggie Jackson being the other. Because his vision became so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of glasses. In the field, Hafey was known for having a \\"rifle arm.\\" He had a power peak, averaging 27 home runs and 114 RBI from 1928 to 1930. In July 1929, Hafey tied a National League record with ten hits in ten consecutive at-bats. In August 1930, he hit for the cycle. In 1931, Hafey won one of the closest races for a batting title in history, hitting .349 to beat New York's Bill Terry by just .0002, and teammate Jim Bottomley by .0007. The title was only secured by a hit in Hafey's final at-bat of the season. Hafey was fifth in the voting for the 1931 MVP award. When Hafey's Cardinals faced Al Simmons' Athletics in the 1931 World Series, it marked just the second time that two reigning batting champions had opposed one another in the Fall Classic. Although the soft-spoken Hafey was overshadowed by some of his raucous Cardinals teammates, he was frequently at odds with management. Hafey's 1931 and 1932 seasons both began late due to salary disputes. Cardinals general manager Rickey fined Hafey for being late and out of shape in 1931. In 1932, coming off his batting title, Hafey demanded that the previous year's fine be added to his 1932 salary. When Rickey refused, Hafey bolted from St. Louis' spring training camp. Rickey responded by trading Hafey to the last-place Cincinnati Reds. Cincinnati Reds Hafey was happy to join the Reds, who gave him the raise he had sought, but his career faltered. His vision was still erratic, and his persistent sinus condition cost him half of the 1932 season, though he hit .344. In 1933, he was chosen for the inaugural All Star Game, recording the first-ever All-Star hit. Although he maintained a solid batting average as a Red, his offensive production decreased. In June 1935, suffering from sinus problems and influenza, he returned to his ranch near Berkeley and his relatives there said that he would not return to baseball that season. The team wanted team surgeons to perform sinus surgery, but Hafey planned to have a procedure performed by his own doctor. He tried a minor league comeback in 1936, but he gave that up in April because he was experiencing vision problems and dizzy spells still attributed to sinusitis. Hafey announced that he would attempt another comeback with the Reds in February 1937. Not long after that, Hafey abandoned that comeback due to a salary dispute. In May, he announced that he would work out with a Pacific Coast League team to work his way back to the Cardinals. He hit .261 in 89 major league games that year. He was released before the 1938 season by general manager Warren Giles when they could not agree to contract terms. He finished his career batting .317, with 164 home runs and 833 RBI. Hafey played in four World Series, hitting .205 in 92 plate appearances. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hafey in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. They cited what they called \\"the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome,\\" where a player of truly exceptional talent might rank with the all- time greats on merit, despite a career sharply curtailed by injury. Honors Hafey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Hafey as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor.\\"Bill James Answers All Your Baseball Questions\\", an April 2008 entry from the Freakonomics blog In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Hafey among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

It is designed to emulate NeXTSTEP's GUI as an OpenStep-compatible environment. Window Maker is part of the GNU Project.  Overview  Window Maker has been characterized as reproducing \\"the elegant look and feel of the NeXTSTEP GUI\\" and is noted as \\"easy to configure and easy to use.\\" A graphical tool called Wprefs is included and can be used to configure most aspects of the UI. The interface tends towards a minimalist, high performance environment directly supporting XPM, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF and PPM icons with an alpha-channel and a right-click, sliding-scrolling application menu system which can throw off pinnable menus, along with window-icon miniaturization and other animations on multiple desktops. Menus and preferences can be changed without restarting. As with most window managers it supports themes and many are available. Owing to its NeXT inspiration, Window Maker has a dock like macOS, but Window Maker's look and feel hews mostly to that of its NeXT forebear.  Architecture  Window Maker has window hints which allow seamless integration with the GNUstep, GNOME, KDE, Motif and OpenLook environments. Significantly it has almost complete ICCCM compliance and internationalization support for at least 11 locales. Window Maker uses the lightweight WINGs widget set which was built specifically for Window Maker as a way to skirt what its developers said would have been the \\"overkill\\" (or bloat) of using GNUstep. WINGs is common to other applications including a login display manager called WINGs Display Manager (WDM) and many dockapps. Window Maker dock and clip applets are compatible with those from AfterStep's wharf.  History  Window Maker was written from scratch primarily by Brazilian programmer Alfredo Kojima as a window manager for the GNUstep desktop environment and originally meant as an improved take on the AfterStep window manager's design concept. The first release was in 1997. For a time it was included as a standard window manager in several Linux distributions and is also available in the FreeBSD and OpenBSD ports collection. Since the goal of the project has been to closely emulate the design of the defunct NeXTstep and OpenStep GUIs, further development has been light. In late 2007 the widely available, stable release version was at 0.92 from July 2005 with subsequent maintenance updates having been made to some distribution packages and ports. In late June 2008 a post on the project's website said active development would resume, noting, \\"...we are working very hard to revitalize Window Maker's presence on X Window (and perhaps beyond) desktops... We expect to once again provide the de-facto minimalist yet extremely functional window manager to the world.\\" On 29 January 2012, Window Maker 0.95.1 was released, making it the first official release in almost seven years. This was followed by a number of releases; the latest release was 0.95.9, released on 4 April 2020.Window Maker: News  Name  The program's original name was WindowMaker (camelcased and without the space) but a naming conflict arose with an older product called Windowmaker from Windowmaker Software Ltd, a UK company producing software for companies that manufacture windows and doors. A 1998 agreement between the developers of Window Maker and Windowmaker Software specified that Window Maker (in the X sense) should never be used as a single word.  Usage  Though adhering closely to the NeXT interface, the default appearance can be confusing to someone expecting a Microsoft Windows-style taskbar and start menu. All applications can be accessed by right-clicking on the desktop background to access the fully configurable main menu. The menu can also be displayed using the keyboard, with for the application menu and for a window menu. Manjaro OpenRC desktop with wmaker Window Maker can be configured by double-clicking the screwdriver icon on the dock. An icon depicting a computer monitor is used to launch a command-window and a paperclip icon is used to cycle between workspaces. Any icon in Window Maker, including application icons, can be easily changed. Icons representing running applications appear at the bottom of the screen (the user can extend application windows to cover these). By default, the dock appears at upper right. Icons can be dragged onto the dock to make them permanent. The edge of an icon can be right-clicked to adjust its settings. A separate, dockable application called wmdrawer features a slide-out drawer which can hold application and file launching icons.  Basic apps  WPrefs graphical configuration tool While any X application can be docked in Window Maker, the archetypical WM dockable applications are called dockapps. These tend to be clocks and system monitoring applications. There are many clock implementations, including wmcalclock, wmtime, wmclock (a NeXTStep-like calendar clock clone) and wmclockmon. Monitoring applets include wmload, wmavgload, wmmon, wmnet and wmnd. Many other dockapps are available, typically ones intended to interact with other \\"full fledged\\" applications. The WPrefs configuration tool enables tuning of most Window Maker preferences. wmakerconf was developed to provide more configuration options, notably theme customization. Configuration files are typically stored in ~/GNUstep/. The background can be changed from the command line with \`wmsetbg -s -u [filename.jpg]\` (wmsetbg stands for \\"window maker set background\\"). FSViewer is a separate, configurable Miller Columns file browser developed for Window Maker in 1998 by George Clernon as a visual and functional analogy to NeXTstep's Workspace Manager. In 2002, it was adapted to later versions of the WINGs libraries and Window Maker by Guido Scholz. aterm is an rxvt based terminal emulator developed for Afterstep mainly for visual appeal, featuring a NeXTstep style scrollbar (which matches Window Maker's look and feel) along with pseudo-transparency.  Menu  The application menu can be edited graphically with much versatility. The configuration is recorded in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMRootMenu as a text file which can be easily read and edited (in versions after 0.94.0 it can also be automatically generated from a list of installed applications using a program called wmgenmenu). Menu items can be set to: *Launch a program or application with or without a filename and other arguments *Launch a command line interface with or without further arguments *Run a WM command, such as exiting a Window Maker session or listing windows and workspaces *List a submenu containing any of the above tasks Many Linux distributions define their own applications menu for Window Maker. This cannot usually be edited using the configuration tool (which will instead offer to replace it with a generic default menu which can be edited). Mascot Amanda the Panda, mascot of Window Maker.

Formed in 1993 in London, England, Spring Heel Jack began their career exploring drum and bass and jungle, but have since branched out into free improvisation and jazz, collaborating with many musicians from Europe and the United States. History John Coxon (2007) Ashley Wales (2007) Wales was formerly a composer of contemporary classical music and leader of the band Crazy About Love, while Coxon was a successful remixer and producer (most notably for Betty Boo) prior to their joining forces. Their first three drum and bass albums released during the 1990s earned positive reviews for their innovative take on the genre. They also co-wrote and produced the 1996 track \\"Walking Wounded,\\" a major UK hit for Everything But The Girl featuring Ben Watt who had earlier been sacked from Crazy About Love. The cinematic Disappeared (2000) marked a transition for Wales and Coxon, and featured the British saxophonist John Surman, whose appearance was a harbinger of later changes. Masses (2001), the first of several albums for the cross- genre Blue Series on Thirsty Ear, was an even more radical departure. Collaborators included saxophonists Evan Parker, John Tchicai and Tim Berne; bassist William Parker; trumpeters Roy Campbell, Kenny Wheeler and Wadada Leo Smith; trombonist Paul Rutherford; drummer Han Bennink; pianist Matthew Shipp; and guitarist Jason Pierce In 2006 Coxon and Wales began to operate a record label, Treader, releasing CDs by themselves and other associated artists, including some of their recent collaborators.

Reasons for applying mulch include conservation of soil moisture, improving fertility and health of the soil, reducing weed growth and enhancing the visual appeal of the area. A mulch is usually, but not exclusively, organic in nature. It may be permanent (e.g. plastic sheeting) or temporary (e.g. bark chips). It may be applied to bare soil or around existing plants. Mulches of manure or compost will be incorporated naturally into the soil by the activity of worms and other organisms. The process is used both in commercial crop production and in gardening, and when applied correctly, can improve soil productivity. Uses Many materials are used as mulches, which are used to retain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and for aesthetics. They are applied to the soil surface, around trees, paths, flower beds, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, and in production areas for flower and vegetable crops. Mulch layers are normally or more deep when applied. They are applied at various times of the year depending on the purpose. Towards the beginning of the growing season, mulches serve initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat which is lost during the night. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. As the season progresses, mulch stabilizes the soil temperature and moisture, and prevents the growing of weeds from seeds. In temperate climates, the effect of mulch is dependent upon the time of year they are applied and when applied in fall and winter, are used to delay the growth of perennial plants in the spring or prevent growth in winter during warm spells, which limits freeze thaw damage. The effect of mulch upon soil moisture content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere preventing sunlight from reaching the soil surface, thus reducing evaporation. However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from light rains. In order to maximise the benefits of mulch, while minimizing its negative influences, it is often applied in late spring/early summer when soil temperatures have risen sufficiently, but soil moisture content is still relatively high. However, permanent mulch is also widely used and valued for its simplicity, as popularized by author Ruth Stout, who said, \\"My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both sides of my vegetable and flower garden all year long. As it decays and enriches the soils, I add more.\\"Stout, Ruth. Gardening Without Work. Devon-Adair Press, 1961. Reprinted by Norton Creek Press, 2011, pp. 6-7.  Materials  Materials used as mulches vary and depend on a number of factors. Use takes into consideration availability, cost, appearance, the effect it has on the soil--including chemical reactions and pH, durability, combustibility, rate of decomposition, how clean it is--some can contain weed seeds or plant pathogens. A variety of materials are used as mulch: * Organic residues: grass clippings, leaves, hay, straw, kitchen scraps comfrey, shredded bark, whole bark nuggets, sawdust, shells, woodchips, shredded newspaper, cardboard, wool, animal manure, etc. Many of these materials also act as a direct composting system, such as the mulched clippings of a mulching lawn mower, or other organics applied as sheet composting. * Compost: fully composted materials are used to avoid possible phytotoxicity problems. Materials that are free of seeds are ideally used, to prevent weeds being introduced by the mulch. * Old carpet (synthetic or natural): makes a free, readily available mulch. * Rubber mulch: made from recycled tire rubber. * Plastic mulch: crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. This method is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year (disposal of plastic mulch is cited as an environmental problem). * Rock and gravel can also be used as a mulch. In cooler climates the heat retained by rocks may extend the growing season. In some areas of the United States, such as central Pennsylvania and northern California, mulch is often referred to as \\"tanbark\\", even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word \\"mulch\\" is used specifically to refer to very fine tanbark or peat moss. Organic mulches Coconut mulch Organic mulches decay over time and are temporary. The way a particular organic mulch decomposes and reacts to wetting by rain and dew affects its usefulness. Some mulches such as straw, peat, sawdust and other wood products may for a while negatively affect plant growth because of their wide carbon to nitrogen ratio,http://www.eau.ee/~agronomy/vol07Spec1/p7sI53.pdf because bacteria and fungi that decompose the materials remove nitrogen from the surrounding soil for growth.http://joa.isa- arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID;=3111&Type;=2 Organic mulches can mat down, forming a barrier that blocks water and air flow between the soil and the atmosphere. Vertically applied organic mulches can wick water from the soil to the surface, which can dry out the soil. Mulch made with wood can contain or feed termites, so care must be taken about not placing mulch too close to houses or building that can be damaged by those insects. Some mulch manufacturers recommend putting mulch several inches away from buildings. Commonly available organic mulches include: =Leaves= Leaves from deciduous trees, which drop their foliage in the autumn/fall. They tend to be dry and blow around in the wind, so are often chopped or shredded before application. As they decompose they adhere to each other but also allow water and moisture to seep down to the soil surface. Thick layers of entire leaves, especially of maples and oaks, can form a soggy mat in winter and spring which can impede the new growth of lawn grass and other plants. Dry leaves are used as winter mulches to protect plants from freezing and thawing in areas with cold winters; they are normally removed during spring. =Grass clippings= Grass clippings, from mowed lawns are sometimes collected and used elsewhere as mulch. Grass clippings are dense and tend to mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction. Rotting fresh grass clippings can damage plants; their rotting often produces a damaging buildup of trapped heat. Grass clippings are often dried thoroughly before application, which militates against rapid decomposition and excessive heat generation. Fresh green grass clippings are relatively high in nitrate content, and when used as a mulch, much of the nitrate is returned to the soil, conversely the routine removal of grass clippings from the lawn results in nitrogen deficiency for the lawn. =Peat moss= Peat moss, or sphagnum peat, is long lasting and packaged, making it convenient and popular as a mulch. When wetted and dried, it can form a dense crust that does not allow water to soak in. When dry it can also burn, producing a smoldering fire. It is sometimes mixed with pine needles to produce a mulch that is friable. It can also lower the pH of the soil surface, making it useful as a mulch under acid loving plants. However peat bogs are a valuable wildlife habitat, and peat is also one of the largest stores of carbon (in Britain, out of a total estimated 9952 million tonnes of carbon in British vegetation and soils, 6948 million tonnes carbon are estimated to be in Scottish, mostly peatland, soils) =Wood Chips= Wood chips are a byproduct of the pruning of trees by arborists, utilities and parks; they are used to dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather coarse after chipping and tend to be used as a mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. The decay of freshly produced chips from recently living woody plants, consumes nitrate; this is often off set with a light application of a high-nitrate fertilizer. Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used to mulch trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors. Woodchip mulch is a byproduct of reprocessing used (untreated) timber (usually packaging pallets), to dispose of wood waste by creating woodchip mulch. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Woodchip mulch is often used under trees, shrubs or large planting areas and can last much longer than arborist mulch. In addition, many consider woodchip mulch to be visually appealing, as it comes in various colors. Woodchips can also be reprocessed into playground woodchip to be used as an impact- attenuating playground surfacing. =Bark chips= Bark chips Bark chips of various grades are produced from the outer corky bark layer of timber trees. Sizes vary from thin shredded strands to large coarse blocks. The finer types are very attractive but have a large exposed surface area that leads to quicker decay. Layers two or three inches deep are usually used, bark is relativity inert and its decay does not demand soil nitrates. Bark chips are also available in various colors. =Straw mulch / field hay / salt hay= Permaculture garden with a fruit tree, herbs, flowers and vegetables mulched with hay Straw mulch or field hay or salt hay are lightweight and normally sold in compressed bales. They have an unkempt look and are used in vegetable gardens and as a winter covering. They are biodegradable and neutral in pH. They have good moisture retention and weed controlling properties but also are more likely to be contaminated with weed seeds. Salt hay is less likely to have weed seeds than field hay. Straw mulch is also available in various colors. =Pine straw= Needles that drop from pine trees are termed pine straw. It is available in bales. Pine straw has an attractive look and is used in landscape and garden settings. On application pine needles tend to weave together, a characteristic that helps the mulch hold stormwater on steeper slopes. This interlocking tendency combined with a resistance to floating gives it further advantages in maintaining cover and preventing soil erosion. The interlocking tendency also helps keep the mulch structure from collapsing and forming a barrier to infiltration. Pine straw is reputed to create ideal conditions for acid-loving plants. Pine straw may help to acidify soils but studies indicate this effect is often too small to be measurable. =Biodegradable mulch= Biodegradable mulches are made out of plant starches and sugars or polyester fibers. These starches can come from plants such as wheat and corn. These mulch films may be a bit more permeable allowing more water into the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of herbicides used and manual labor farmers may have to do throughout the growing season. At the end of the season these mulches will start to break down from heat. Microorganisms in the soil break down the mulch into two components, water and carbon dioxide, leaving no toxic residues behind. This source of mulch is even less manual labor since it does not need to be removed at the end of the season and can actually be tilled into the soil. With this mulch it is important to take into consideration that it's much more delicate than other kinds. It should be placed on a day which is not too hot and with less tension than other synthetic mulches. These also can be placed by machine or hand but it is ideal to have a more starchy mulch that will allow it to stick to the soil better. =Cardboard / newspaper= Cardboard or newspaper can be used as semi-organic mulches. These are best used as a base layer upon which a heavier mulch such as compost is placed to prevent the lighter cardboard/newspaper layer from blowing away. By incorporating a layer of cardboard/newspaper into a mulch, the quantity of heavier mulch can be reduced, whilst improving the weed suppressant and moisture retaining properties of the mulch.Patrick Whitefield, 2004, The Earth Care Manual, Permanent Publications, However, additional labour is expended when planting through a mulch containing a cardboard/newspaper layer, as holes must be cut for each plant. Sowing seed through mulches containing a cardboard/newspaper layer is impractical. Application of newspaper mulch in windy weather can be facilitated by briefly pre-soaking the newspaper in water to increase its weight. SyntheticRubber=Plastics= Plastic mulch used in large-scale commercial production is laid down with a tractor-drawn or standalone layer of plastic mulch. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where raised beds are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and seedlings are transplanted through it. Drip irrigation is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water. ;Polypropylene and polyethylene mulch:Polypropylene mulch is made up of polypropylene polymers where polyethylene mulch is made up of polyethylene polymers. These mulches are commonly used in many plastics. Polyethylene is used mainly for weed reduction, where polypropylene is used mainly on perennials. This mulch is placed on top of the soil and can be done by machine or hand with pegs to keep the mulch tight against the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of work a farmer may have to do, and the amount of herbicides applied during the growing period. The black and clear mulches capture sunlight and warm the soil increasing the growth rate. White and other reflective colours will also warm the soil, but they do not suppress weeds as well. This mulch may require other sources of obtaining water such as drip irrigation since it can reduce the amount of water that reaches the soil. This mulch needs to be manually removed at the end of the season since when it starts to break down it breaks down into smaller pieces. If the mulch is not removed before it starts to break down eventually it will break down into ketones and aldehydes polluting the soil. This mulch is technically biodegradable but does not break down into the same materials the more natural biodegradable mulch does. ;Carpet:Synthetic carpet that is composed of artificial fibers may be removed after planting to prevent fibers taking a long time to decompose, whereas carpet made from natural fibers may be kept in place, blocking competition from weeds. Rain is absorbed by carpet and then slowly released into the soil, reducing watering needs. =Colored mulch= Some organic mulches are colored red, brown, black, and other colors using synthetic additives. Isopropanolamine, specifically 1-Amino-2-propanol or monoisopropanolamine, may be used as a pigment dispersant and color fastener in these mulches. Types of mulch which can be dyed include: wood chips, bark chips (barkdust) and pine straw. Colored mulch is made by dyeing the mulch in a water-based solution of colorant and chemical binder. When colored mulch first entered the market, most formulas were suspected to contain toxic substances, heavy metals and other contaminates. Today, \\"current investigations indicate that mulch colorants pose no threat to people, pets or the environment. The dyes currently used by the mulch and soil industry are similar to those used in the cosmetic and other manufacturing industries (i.e., iron oxide)\\", as stated by the Mulch and Soil Council. Colored mulch can be applied anywhere non-colored mulch is used (such as large bedded areas or around plants) and features many of the same gardening benefits as traditional mulch, such as improving soil productivity and retaining moisture. As mulch decomposes, just as with non-colored mulch, more mulch may need to be added to continue providing benefits to the soil and plants. However, if mulch is faded, spraying dye to previously spread mulch in order to restore color is an option. Anaerobic (sour) mulch Organic mulches often smell like freshly cut wood but sometimes they start to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage. This happens when material with ample nitrogen content is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets of increased decomposition. When this occurs, the process may become anaerobic and produce phytotoxic materials in small quantities. Once exposed to the air, the process quickly reverts to an aerobic process, but the anaerobic metabolites may be present for a period of time. Plants low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible, and phytotoxicity from the produced chemicals may prevent germination of some seeds. Groundcovers (living mulches) Groundcovers are plants which grow close to the ground, under the main crop, to slow the development of weeds and provide other benefits of mulch. They are usually fast-growing plants that continue growing with the main crops. By contrast, cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides. However, live mulches also may need to be mechanically or chemically killed eventually to prevent competition with the main crop.Brandsaeter et al. 1998, Tharp and Kells, 2001 Some groundcovers can perform additional roles in the garden such as nitrogen fixation in the case of clovers, dynamic accumulation of nutrients from the subsoil in the case of creeping comfrey (Symphytum ibericum), and even food production in the case of Rubus tricolor.Jacke and Toensmeier, Edible Forest Gardening, vol. II On- site production Owing to the great bulk of mulch which is often required on a site, it is often impractical and expensive to source and import sufficient mulch materials. An alternative to importing mulch materials is to grow them on site in a \\"mulch garden\\" – an area of the site dedicated entirely to the production of mulch which is then transferred to the growing area. Mulch gardens should be sited as close as possible to the growing area so as to facilitate transfer of mulch materials.

Lewis, who introduced it in his 1916 article The Atom and the Molecule. Lewis structures extend the concept of the electron dot diagram by adding lines between atoms to represent shared pairs in a chemical bond. Lewis structures show each atom and its position in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another (pairs of dots can be used instead of lines). Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pairs of dots, and are placed next to the atoms. Although main group elements of the second period and beyond usually react by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have achieved a valence shell electron configuration with a full octet of (8) electrons, hydrogen (H) can only form bonds which share just two electrons.  Construction and electron counting  The total number of electrons represented in a Lewis structure is equal to the sum of the numbers of valence electrons on each individual atom. Non-valence electrons are not represented in Lewis structures. Once the total number of available electrons has been determined, electrons must be placed into the structure according to these steps: # The atoms are first connected by single bonds. # If t is the total number of electrons and n the number of single bonds, t-2n electrons remain to be placed. These should be placed as lone pairs: one pair of dots for each pair of electrons available. Lone pairs should initially be placed on outer atoms (other than hydrogen) until each outer atom has eight electrons in bonding pairs and lone pairs; extra lone pairs may then be placed on the central atom. When in doubt, lone pairs should be placed on more electronegative atoms first. # Once all lone pairs are placed, atoms (especially the central atoms) may not have an octet of electrons. In this case, the atoms must form a double bond; a lone pair of electrons is moved to form a second bond between the two atoms. As the bonding pair is shared between the two atoms, the atom that originally had the lone pair still has an octet; the other atom now has two more electrons in its valence shell. Lewis structures for polyatomic ions may be drawn by the same method. When counting electrons, negative ions should have extra electrons placed in their Lewis structures; positive ions should have fewer electrons than an uncharged molecule. When the Lewis structure of an ion is written, the entire structure is placed in brackets, and the charge is written as a superscript on the upper right, outside the brackets. A simpler method has been proposed for constructing Lewis structures, eliminating the need for electron counting: the atoms are drawn showing the valence electrons; bonds are then formed by pairing up valence electrons of the atoms involved in the bond-making process, and anions and cations are formed by adding or removing electrons to/from the appropriate atoms. A trick is to count up valence electrons, then count up the number of electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers and the answer is the number of electrons that make up the bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms' octets. Another simple and general procedure to write Lewis structures and resonance forms has been proposed.  Formal charge  In terms of Lewis structures, formal charge is used in the description, comparison, and assessment of likely topological and resonance structuresMiessler, G. L. and Tarr, D. A., Inorganic Chemistry (2nd ed., Prentice Hall 1998) , pp. 49–53 – Explanation of formal charge usage. by determining the apparent electronic charge of each atom within, based upon its electron dot structure, assuming exclusive covalency or non- polar bonding. It has uses in determining possible electron re-configuration when referring to reaction mechanisms, and often results in the same sign as the partial charge of the atom, with exceptions. In general, the formal charge of an atom can be calculated using the following formula, assuming non- standard definitions for the markup used: :C_f = N_v - U_e - \\\\frac {B_n} 2 where: * C_f is the formal charge. * N_v represents the number of valence electrons in a free atom of the element. * U_e represents the number of unshared electrons on the atom. * B_n represents the total number of electrons in bonds the atom has with another. The formal charge of an atom is computed as the difference between the number of valence electrons that a neutral atom would have and the number of electrons that belong to it in the Lewis structure. Electrons in covalent bonds are split equally between the atoms involved in the bond. The total of the formal charges on an ion should be equal to the charge on the ion, and the total of the formal charges on a neutral molecule should be equal to zero.  Resonance  For some molecules and ions, it is difficult to determine which lone pairs should be moved to form double or triple bonds, and two or more different resonance structures may be written for the same molecule or ion. In such cases it is usual to write all of them with two-way arrows in between (see Example below). This is sometimes the case when multiple atoms of the same type surround the central atom, and is especially common for polyatomic ions. When this situation occurs, the molecule's Lewis structure is said to be a resonance structure, and the molecule exists as a resonance hybrid. Each of the different possibilities is superimposed on the others, and the molecule is considered to have a Lewis structure equivalent to some combination of these states. The nitrate ion (NO3−), for instance, must form a double bond between nitrogen and one of the oxygens to satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen. However, because the molecule is symmetrical, it does not matter which of the oxygens forms the double bond. In this case, there are three possible resonance structures. Expressing resonance when drawing Lewis structures may be done either by drawing each of the possible resonance forms and placing double-headed arrows between them or by using dashed lines to represent the partial bonds (although the latter is a good representation of the resonance hybrid which is not, formally speaking, a Lewis structure). When comparing resonance structures for the same molecule, usually those with the fewest formal charges contribute more to the overall resonance hybrid. When formal charges are necessary, resonance structures that have negative charges on the more electronegative elements and positive charges on the less electronegative elements are favored. Single bonds can also be moved in the same way to create resonance structures for hypervalent molecules such as sulfur hexafluoride, which is the correct description according to quantum chemical calculations instead of the common expanded octet model. The resonance structure should not be interpreted to indicate that the molecule switches between forms, but that the molecule acts as the average of multiple forms.  Example  The formula of the nitrite ion is . # Nitrogen is the least electronegative atom of the two, so it is the central atom by multiple criteria. # Count valence electrons. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons; each oxygen has 6, for a total of (6 × 2) + 5 = 17. The ion has a charge of −1, which indicates an extra electron, so the total number of electrons is 18. # Connect the atoms by single bonds. Each oxygen must be bonded to the nitrogen, which uses four electrons—two in each bond. # Place lone pairs. The 14 remaining electrons should initially be placed as 7 lone pairs. Each oxygen may take a maximum of 3 lone pairs, giving each oxygen 8 electrons including the bonding pair. The seventh lone pair must be placed on the nitrogen atom. # Satisfy the octet rule. Both oxygen atoms currently have 8 electrons assigned to them. The nitrogen atom has only 6 electrons assigned to it. One of the lone pairs on an oxygen atom must form a double bond, but either atom will work equally well. Therefore, there is a resonance structure. # Tie up loose ends. Two Lewis structures must be drawn: Each structure has one of the two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the nitrogen atom. The second oxygen atom in each structure will be single-bonded to the nitrogen atom. Place brackets around each structure, and add the charge (−) to the upper right outside the brackets. Draw a double-headed arrow between the two resonance forms. 500px  Alternative formations  A skeletal diagram of butane Chemical structures may be written in more compact forms, particularly when showing organic molecules. In condensed structural formulas, many or even all of the covalent bonds may be left out, with subscripts indicating the number of identical groups attached to a particular atom. Another shorthand structural diagram is the skeletal formula (also known as a bond-line formula or carbon skeleton diagram). In a skeletal formula, carbon atoms are not signified by the symbol C but by the vertices of the lines. Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are not shown—they can be inferred by counting the number of bonds to a particular carbon atom—each carbon is assumed to have four bonds in total, so any bonds not shown are, by implication, to hydrogen atoms. Other diagrams may be more complex than Lewis structures, showing bonds in 3D using various forms such as space-filling diagrams.  Usage and limitations  Despite their simplicity and development in the early twentieth century, when understanding of chemical bonding was still rudimentary, Lewis structures capture many of the key features of the electronic structure of a range of molecular systems, including those of relevance to chemical reactivity. Thus, they continue to enjoy widespread use by chemists and chemistry educators. This is especially true in the field of organic chemistry, where the traditional valence-bond model of bonding still dominates, and mechanisms are often understood in terms of curve-arrow notation superimposed upon skeletal formulae, which are shorthand versions of Lewis structures. Due to the greater variety of bonding schemes encountered in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, many of the molecules encountered require the use of fully delocalized molecular orbitals to adequately describe their bonding, making Lewis structures comparatively less important (although they are still common). It is important to note that there are simple and archetypal molecular systems for which a Lewis description, at least in unmodified form, is misleading or inaccurate. Notably, the naive drawing of Lewis structures for molecules known experimentally to contain unpaired electrons (e.g., O2, NO, and ClO2) leads to incorrect inferences of bond orders, bond lengths, and/or magnetic properties. A simple Lewis model also does not account for the phenomenon of aromaticity. For instance, Lewis structures do not offer an explanation for why cyclic C6H6 (benzene) experiences special stabilization beyond normal delocalization effects, while C4H4 (cyclobutadiene) actually experiences a special destabilization. Molecular orbital theory provides the most straightforward explanation for these phenomena.

Design and construction The Attack class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the Ton class minesweepers on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea's Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

Cimiez (; Italian:Cimella) is an upper class neighborhood in Nice, southern France. The area contains the Musée Matisse and the ruins of Cemenelum, capital of the Ancient Roman province Alpes Maritimae on the Ligurian coast. Cemenelum was an important rival of Nice, continuing to exist as a separate city till the time of the Lombard invasions. The ruins include an arena, amphitheater, thermal baths, and paleochristian basilica. Queen Victoria at Cimiez, by Jean Baptiste Guth, June 1897 During the Belle Epoque, Cimiez became the favourite holiday resort for the Kings and Queens of Europe: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, and Leopold II stayed in Cimiez. Close to the ruins is the Excelsior Régina Palace where Queen Victoria spent part of her long visits to the French Riviera. From 1974 to 2010, the Nice Jazz Festival was held on the grounds of the Roman Ruins in July each year (since 2011 the festival moved to the Place Masséna). Also here can be found the Cimiez Monastery and church that have been used by the Franciscan friars since the 16th century. The church with a baroque altar from the seventeenth century and a marble cross from 1477 houses the paintings Pietà (triptych from 1475), Crucifixion (1512) and Deposition (1515) by the Italian medieval artist Ludovico Brea. On display are also more than 300 documents and works of art from the 15th to 18th centuries. Buried in the cemetery near the monastery are the painters Henri Matisse and Raoul Dufy, alongside the winner of the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature, Roger Martin du Gard.

Another, older version of the coat of arms omits the thistle. The Porteous family is a Scottish Borders armigerous family. History The earliest records for members of the Porteous family in Peeblesshire date back to the early part of the fifteenth century. The earliest possible reference, according to Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh, is to a Guillaume Porteuse (later William Porteous), who arrived from Normandy c 1400 under the patronage of the wealthy Fraise family (later to become the Frasers). They had already settled in parts of lowland Scotland, having been granted lands by the King. The early meaning of the name Porteuse (from the French) was indeed possibly of 'courier' or 'messenger'. But in Scotland, they turned their hand to other trades. In the days when the glens and hamlets of Tweeddale and, later, Annandale were much more densely populated than today, they seem to have pursued various occupations - from millers and blacksmiths to ministers of religion. The home of early members of the Porteous family for many hundreds of years was Hawkshaw in Peeblesshire. The link to modern day families is as yet unproven. There is some doubt as to how long the family had held the ancestral family home, but it is certain that there a castle of sorts at Hawkshaw, probably built as no more than a small fortified keep, and intended as a watch tower where a signal fire could be lit to warn of approaching danger. A line of these so-called Peel towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source, as a response to the dangers of invasion from the English borders. Hawkshaw was one of over two dozen of these in Peeblesshire alone. During the eighteenth century there began a massive migration of families from Scotland, initially to England and Ireland - and eventually to the New World and the newly discovered countries of the British Empire. The reasons for this were many - and changed considerably during the following three hundred years. The historical background was turbulent and Scotland saw many changes which led to emigration of large numbers of both Highland and Lowland families. The Lowland Clearances (1760-1830), especially, resulted in a massive movement of poor Scots from the Lowlands to the growing industrial centres of Glasgow and northern England - to Newcastle, Liverpool and eventually to London and other large cities and ports. Families were tempted by the offer of employment in the fast-growing industries which had burgeoned with the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the promise of a higher standard of living. The subsequent depopulation of the Lowlands and the Highland Potato Famine of 1836-37 added to those who chose to leave. Over 1.7 million people left Scotland from 1846 to 1852, primarily going to Nova Scotia and Canada. They left in vast numbers to seek better fortune on the other side of the Atlantic.The Emigrant Ships.

Montreal Gazette, January 31, 1999. A member of the group, who identified himself only as Pope-Tart, told the Montreal Gazette in 1999 that the group's core philosophy was \\"You work for us. You can't be too big for your britches or you'll get a pie in the face.\\" History The group was founded by several former members of the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, including François Gourd. They initially convened in 1995 to offer a $400 reward to anybody from across Canada who successfully pied Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, but after nobody accepted the offer at the time they began to plan their own pieings. Other figures pied by the group included Jean Charest,\\"Mario Dumont et Jean Charest entartés\\". Radio-Canada, April 13, 2003. Mario Dumont, Stéphane Dion,\\"Cream and punishment\\". The Globe and Mail, April 18, 2000. Allan Rock,\\"Chrétien gets pie in face\\". The Globe and Mail, August 17, 2000.

Quebec politicians were the most common targets, although the group also pied Sylvester Stallone during a 1998 promotional tour.

Members of the Ursus arctos (brown bear) species can reach masses of . The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) and the Kodiak bear are North American subspecies of the brown bear. A great Golden Bear was reported in the area of Turner, Kansas. According to John Gardiner in 1831, it was feared and admired by the local Indian population. The bear lived south of the river in the hills west of the Methodist Mission. According to legend, it was the largest bear that any of the natives had ever seen. It would raid the settlements of the area folks and feasted on the animals owned by the local population (the Shawnee tribe). Many of the Indians wanted to kill the bear for the pride of such a feat and the capture of its hide (the fur was most sought after). The Golden Bear was seen several times by the ferry crew on the Old Grinter Ferry during the 1830s and 1840s. Both the Shawnee and the Wyandot gathered a hunting party, but were unsuccessful in tracking the bear down. The \\"Golden Bear\\" became the mascot for Turner High School and was adopted by the community in 1886. Two members of the community, Warren Hewitt and Jule Gaignet, submitted the icon and it won the majority of support in a contest. Reportedly, the two youths had heard of the bear from stories told by their grandparents. This icon is based on legends of that golden bear. Western New England College adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot in the early 1950s. University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta also has the Golden Bear as its mascot.

Genetically, North American brown bears are closely related; in size and coloring, the California grizzly bear was much like the Kodiak bear of the southern coast of Alaska. In California, it was particularly admired for its beauty, size, and strength. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Flag Republic, a moniker that was attached to the short- lived attempt by a group of American settlers to break away from Mexico in 1846. Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state flag of California, and then California was known as the \\"Bear State.\\"  Nomenclature  A 1953 researcher stated, \\"The specific status of North American brown bears (or grizzly bears) is one of the most complex problems of mammalian taxonomy. The difficulty stems directly from the work of Merriam (1918), who concluded that there are 86 forms of grizzlies (and brown bears) in North America.\\" North American brown bears were taxonomically grouped as a species apart from other bear species, until DNA testing revealed that they should properly be grouped in the same species as the other brown bears. Grizzlies living in California had been classified by Merriam into many subspecies, but the only genetically anomalous grouping in North America is the ABC Islands bears.  History and extinction  An illustration of a bear bullfight by HM Stoops. Published in The San Francisco Call on January 15, 1911. Prior to Spanish settlement in the second half of the 1700s, it is estimated that 10,000 grizzly bears inhabited what is modern-day California. It is thought that the bears lived across almost the entirety of the state, save its most southeastern and northeastern corners. The bears ate a diverse diet from California’s varied climates, ranging from plant sources like grasses, seeds, and berries, to animal sources such as deer, fish, and carrion—including beached whale carcasses. Europeans' first recorded encounters with California grizzly bears are found in diaries kept by several members of the 1769 Portola expedition, the first European land exploration of what is now the state of California. Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (oso) trace their origins back to that first overland expedition (e.g. Los Osos). As the settled frontier of New Spain was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The ranchers’ domesticated livestock were easy prey for the grizzly bears roaming freely across the state. By eating their livelihood and scaring them, the grizzlies became enemies of the rancheros. Vaqueros hunted the grizzlies, often roping and capturing them to be pitted against other animals in public battles. These bear-baiting events flourished as popular spectacles in 19th century California. Bloody fights that pitted bears against bulls often inspired betting as to whether the bear or the bull would win. One persistently popular, but false\\"Bull, n1 III.8.a.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 20 January 2015. phrase origin story related to these fights stems from famous 19th-century newspaperman Horace Greeley. While visiting California Greeley allegedly witnessed such a fight, and supposedly gave the modern stock market its \\"bear\\" and \\"bull\\" nicknames based on the fighting styles of the two animals: the bear swipes downward while the bull hooks upward. In truth, the phrase’s origins predate Greeley's 1859 journey to California by at least 100 years, but the myth of the California connection persists. Monarch, a preserved specimen, on display at the California Academy of Sciences In 1866, a grizzly bear described as weighing as much as was killed in what is present-day Valley Center, California. The incident was recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, and it was the biggest bear ever found in California. Lovett Smith witnessed the bear’s killing on her family's ranch when she was six years old. (Other sources confirm her account of the bear, but differ as to its exact size.) Her telling of that bear is part of the oral history of “Bear Valley,” the original name for Valley Center. Less than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848, almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed. One prospector in Southern California, William F. Holcomb (nicknamed \\"Grizzly Bill\\" Holcomb), was particularly well known for hunting grizzly bears in what is now San Bernardino County. The last hunted California grizzly bear was shot in Tulare County, California, in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced. Two years later in 1924, what was thought to be a grizzly was spotted in Sequoia National Park for the last time and thereafter, grizzlies were never seen again in California.  Reintroduction  California still has habitat that can sustain about 500 grizzlies. In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received and rejected a petition to reintroduce grizzly bears to California. In 2015, the Center for Biological Diversity launched a petition aimed at the California state legislature to reintroduce the grizzly bear to the state. The California grizzly bear has been considered as a possible candidate for attempts at de- extinction, through the proposed use of back-breeding, cloning and genetic engineering to recreate extinct species.  Symbolism  Flag of California The California grizzly bear is one of the state's most visible and enduring symbols, adorning both the state flag and seal. The Bear Flag first flew in 1846 as a symbol of the short-lived California Republic. A second version was adopted as the state flag by the state legislature in 1911. The bear symbol became a permanent part of the state seal in 1849. The California grizzly bear was designated the official state animal in 1953. The bear is celebrated in name and as mascot of the sports teams of the University of California, Berkeley (the California Golden Bears), and of the University of California, Los Angeles (the UCLA Bruins) and in the mascot of University of California, Riverside (Scottie the Bear, dressed in a Highland kilt). The California Maritime Academy operates a training ship named Golden Bear.

The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8 puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8 puzzle or 9 puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15 puzzle or 16 puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space. The n puzzle is a classical problem for modelling algorithms involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration. Note that both are admissible, i.e. they never overestimate the number of moves left, which ensures optimality for certain search algorithms such as A*.  Solvability  A solved 15 puzzle used a parity argument to show that half of the starting positions for the n puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. This is done by considering a function of the tile configuration that is invariant under any valid move, and then using this to partition the space of all possible labeled states into two equivalence classes of reachable and unreachable states. The invariant is the parity of the permutation of all 16 squares plus the parity of the taxicab distance (number of rows plus number of columns) of the empty square from the lower right corner. This is an invariant because each move changes both the parity of the permutation and the parity of the taxicab distance. In particular, if the empty square is in the lower right corner then the puzzle is solvable if and only if the permutation of the remaining pieces is even. also showed that the converse holds on boards of size m×n provided m and n are both at least 2: all even permutations are solvable. This is straightforward but a little messy to prove by induction on m and n starting with m=n=2. gave another proof, based on defining equivalence classes via a hamiltonian path. studied the analogue of the 15 puzzle on arbitrary finite biconnected graphs. He showed that, except for polygons, and one exceptional graph on 7 vertices, it is possible to obtain all permutations unless the graph is bipartite, in which case exactly the even permutations can be obtained. The exceptional graph is a regular hexagon with one diagonal and a vertex at the center added; only of its permutations can be obtained. For larger versions of the n puzzle, finding a solution is easy, but the problem of finding the shortest solution is NP-hard. It is also NP-hard to approximate the fewest slides within an additive constant, but there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation.Daniel Ratner, Manfred K. Warmuth. Finding a Shortest Solution for the N × N Extension of the 15-PUZZLE Is Intractable. National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1986. For the 15 puzzle, lengths of optimal solutions range from 0 to 80 single-tile moves (there are 17 configurations requiring 80 moves)Richard E.

Domain of the Cube Forum the 8 puzzle always can be solved in no more than 31 single-tile moves or 24 multi-tile moves (integer sequence A087725). The multi-tile metric counts subsequent moves of the empty tile in the same direction as one. The number of possible positions of the 24 puzzle is ≈ which is too many to calculate God's number. In 2011, lower bounds of 152 single-tile moves or 41 multi-tile moves had been established, as well as upper bounds of 208 single-tile moves or 109 multi-tile moves.\\"24 puzzle new lower bound: 152\\".

The transformations of the fifteen puzzle form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed);Jim Belk (2008) Puzzles, Groups, and Groupoids, The Everything SeminarThe 15-puzzle groupoid (1), Never Ending BooksThe 15-puzzle groupoid (2), Never Ending Books this groupoid acts on configurations.  Alternate proof  In an alternate view of the problem, we can consider the invariant to be the sum of the parity of the number of inversions in the current order of the 15 numbered pieces and the parity of the difference in the row number of the empty square from the row number of the last row. (Let's call it row distance from the last row.) This is an invariant because each column move, when we move a piece within the same column, changes both the parity of the number of inversions (by changing the number of inversions by ±1, ±3) and the parity of the row distance from the last row (changing row distance by ±1); and each row move, when we move a piece within the same row, does not change any of the two parities. Now if we look at the solved state of the puzzle, this sum is even. Hence it is easy to prove by induction that any state of the puzzle for which the above sum is odd cannot be solvable. In particular, if the empty square is in the lower right corner (even anywhere in the last row) then the puzzle is solvable if and only if the number of inversions of the numbered pieces is even. History Sam Loyd's unsolvable 15 puzzle, with tiles 14 and 15 exchanged. This puzzle is not solvable as it would require a change of the invariant to move it to the solved state. U.S. Political cartoon about finding a Republican presidential candidate in 1880 The puzzle was \\"invented\\" by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York, who is said to have shown friends, as early as 1874, a precursor puzzle consisting of 16 numbered blocks that were to be put together in rows of four, each summing to 34. Copies of the improved Fifteen Puzzle made their way to Syracuse, New York, by way of Noyes' son, Frank, and from there, via sundry connections, to Watch Hill, Rhode Island, and finally to Hartford (Connecticut), where students in the American School for the Deaf started manufacturing the puzzle and, by December 1879, selling them both locally and in Boston, Massachusetts. Shown one of these, Matthias Rice, who ran a fancy woodworking business in Boston, started manufacturing the puzzle sometime in December 1879 and convinced a \\"Yankee Notions\\" fancy goods dealer to sell them under the name of \\"Gem Puzzle\\". In late January 1880, Dr. Charles Pevey, a dentist in Worcester, Massachusetts, garnered some attention by offering a cash reward for a solution to the Fifteen Puzzle. The game became a craze in the U.S. in February 1880, Canada in March, Europe in April, but that craze had dissipated by July. Apparently, the puzzle was not introduced to Japan until 1889.The Cube: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Best-Selling Puzzle Noyes Chapman had applied for a patent on his \\"Block Solitaire Puzzle\\" on February 21, 1880. However, that patent was rejected, likely because it was not sufficiently different from the August 20, 1878 \\"Puzzle-Blocks\\" patent (US 207124) granted to Ernest U. Kinsey.The 15 Puzzle, by Jerry Slocum & Dic Sonneveld, 2006.  Sam Loyd  Sam Loyd's 1914 illustration of the unsolvable variation Sam Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented the puzzle, for example writing in the Cyclopedia of Puzzles (published 1914): \\"The older inhabitants of Puzzleland will remember how in the early seventies I drove the entire world crazy over a little box of movable pieces which became known as the '14-15 Puzzle'.\\"Cyclopedia of Puzzles, p. 235 However, Loyd had nothing to do with the invention or initial popularity of the puzzle, and in any case, the craze was in 1880, not the early 1870s. Loyd's first article about the puzzle was published in 1886 and it was not until 1891 that he first claimed to have been the inventor.Barry R. Clarke, Puzzles for Pleasure, pp.10-12, Cambridge University Press, 1994 . Some later interest was fuelled by Loyd offering a $1,000 prize for anyone who could provide a solution for achieving a particular combination specified by Loyd, namely reversing the 14 and 15, called by Loyd the 14-15 puzzle. This was impossible, as had been shown over a decade earlier by , as it required a transformation from an even to an odd permutation. Miscellaneous The Minus Cube, manufactured in the USSR, is a 3D puzzle with similar operations to the 15 puzzle. Bobby Fischer was an expert at solving the 15-Puzzle. He had been timed to be able to solve it within 25 seconds; Fischer demonstrated this on November 8, 1972, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

Stanley Porteus was born in 1883 at Box Hill, Victoria, Australia, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, where he went to school. After marriage, Porteus studied at the University of Melbourne. He was the initial head teacher at Victoria's first Education Department sponsored school for feeble-minded children. Having the task of selecting students for his small school, Porteus devised a new intelligence test of his own, the Porteus Maze Test, a non-verbal intelligence test. The test was originally used to identify children in need of special education, though it is still in use today for other purposes. In 1918 Porteus was invited to join the Vineland Training School in New Jersey, United States, moving there to become Director of Research. This invitation came at a good time, as his full-time employment as a head teacher with the Victorian Education Department was souring and although he had no university degree, the new job launched him into a lifelong academic career. In 1922 he moved to Hawaii where he founded the Psychological and Psychopathic Clinic at the University of Hawaii, eventually becoming professor of clinical psychology and its director and Dean of the Psychology Department in 1925. The author of many papers and books, Porteus also created a racial hierarchy of intelligence using his maze device which he believed was \\"a valid, culture-free measure of general intelligence--despite the fact that among his South African samples one group that already knew a 'labyrinth game' outscored all neighboring groups that did not know the game\\" (Cole 56). His theories about the superior intelligence of white races has led to recent controversy, including protests by students at the University of Hawaii. Porteus was an early contributor to Mankind Quarterly, helped William Shockley organize the Foundation for Education on Eugenics and Dysgenics, and served on the executive committee of the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics. He died in 1972 at Honolulu, where the University social sciences building, Porteus Hall, was named after him in 1974. However, university students mounted a full-scale protest at Porteus' perceived \\"blatantly racist theories\\" and eventually, in 1998, the authorities relented and his name was removed from the building.

Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, it describes itself as a \\"people's think tank and education-for-action center\\".2001 Progress Report , Food First News and Views, Winter 2002, Volume 25, Number 84. Accessed online 21 September 2006. The specific self-description comes from \\"About Food First\\" in that issue; see page footer for alternative name; Oakland address is on same page. Its mission is “to eliminate the injustices that cause hunger”. According to the Food First website, its main goal is to forge food sovereignty for human rights and sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has three programs of development: building local agri-foods systems, farmers forming food sovereignty, and democratizing development. The organization is meant to offer policy analysis on poverty, agriculture, and development, and is highly critical of the policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The organization focuses on the Green Revolution which was supported in the 1970s and which did not produce the development people hoped for. Instead it put in place a system that has high input-costs, but does not produce a yield much higher than traditional farming methods. There has been a recent resurgence of Green Revolution ideas, especially with the large-scale support of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and high- yield-variety agriculture. Food First claims that these policies will only further global inequalities, and has produced several policy briefs stating that the way to establish fair and effective development is through local sustainable agriculture. In 1987, the organization received the Right Livelihood Award \\"for revealing the political and economic causes of world hunger and how citizens can help to remedy them.\\" History and organizational structure The organization began in 1975 as the Institute for Food and Development Policy (IFDP). The institute was founded by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, and actually began in New York in Lappe’s basement before relocating to San Francisco, and then later to Oakland where it is still located. In 1977 the IFDP published its first work, Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity, and has since continued publishing policy briefs and analysis on the world food system and the inequalities that are caused by it. Today's Food First is managed by a board of trustees that has five members with backgrounds in different non-profit organizations. They have a shared vision of creating a more grass-roots based system of economic development through the endorsement of local and sustainable agriculture systems. The organization's president is Joyce E. King, whose work in sociology has focused on “women's participation in grass roots social change movements in Africa, South America and France”. In addition to the Board of Trustees, Food First has six staff members who work on the organization's policy briefs. The staff's executive director is Eric Holt-Gimenez, who has published several books on global inequalities and the global food system, including Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice, which outlines seven steps to solving the world food crisis. Finally, the organization benefits from the support of the general public through interns and volunteers who contribute to the process of policy research. Food First is a think-tank composed of many individuals from many different backgrounds, who share the organization's aim of eliminating global inequalities through the rethinking of the world's emphasis on industry-based economics, and shifting the paradigm towards a more inclusive form of economic development. Programs and guiding philosophy The organization has three programs that it implements in order to achieve this aim: # Tackling class and racial inequalities in the agri-foods industry. There is a form of structural racism in the United States, as one study found “there were 30% fewer supermarkets in low-income areas than in higher-income areas, and these low-income areas had 55% less grocery store square footage than their wealthier income counterparts. The study also found that the levels of unmet food demand in these communities were as high as 70%”. Without an accessible availability of cheap, healthy foods, low-income communities show high levels of diabetes and heart problems. Food First attempts to counter this structural racism by providing information and analysis, helping spread awareness and debate, and by helping create a national coalition of urban communities of color for food security. By studying international economic development and U.S. inequalities and development, Food First is taking a holistic approach that aims to change the way that we view the relationship between access to food and economic development. # Helping farmers form food sovereignty by creating projects such as The Campesino in Mexico and Central America, and by working with Via Campesina. These groups focus on farmer alternatives to the corporate agrifoods industry, helping farmers educate each other on strategies for alternatives. Food First’s strategy emphasizes the farmer’s sovereignty and acknowledges their self-determination. They believe a main flaw of the Green Revolution of the past and of the new Green Revolution is that the transnational institutions that implemented it failed to consult the people that would be affected by it the most, small farmers. Placing power and sovereignty in the hands of the disenfranchised is crucial for development. # Empowering farmers by giving them a voice. This program focuses on the structural causes of hunger and poverty, supporting advocacy groups that are against the agrifoods industry and are in support of consumer-led alternatives that allow for \\"justice, equity and ecological sustainability\\". Food First helps through projects such as No Full Tanks with Empty Bellies: The Food and Fuel Sovereignty Campaign. This project aims to inform the public about the negative impacts caused by bio-fuels. The spread of advocacy is Food First’s key role, providing information that is essential for awareness, debate, and change. Lack of food sovereignty, poverty, and hunger, are all interrelated structural problems that take a collective effort to change; Food First aims to bring this collective together to spark this change. Food First believes that world hunger is not an inevitable phenomenon that occurs simply because there is not enough food produced worldwide. Instead, it argues that there is an enormous surplus of food produced by corporate agri-businesses based in wealthy developed nations, and this enormous surplus of food is a reflection on broader global inequalities that deeply impact and harm marginalized third-world countries worldwide. While challenging the idea that world hunger exists because there is simply not enough food produced or available, Holz-Gimenez and Patel explain that, “…according to the FAO, with record grain harvests in 2007, there was more than enough food in the world to feed everyone-at least 1.5 times current demand”. Food First argues that world hunger is not caused by food production shortages, and in fact points the blame to systemic causes such as speculation on the market, investments in large-scale GMO farms that have higher input-costs, and the bio-fuels market. By illustrating these ideas, Food First tries to bring to the table a new approach to global hunger that they believe has been largely ignored. Food First supports a \\"bottom-up\\" approach to solving world hunger, asserting the ability of all countries to feed their own people if they focus on agriculture for subsistence rather than for export. Food First strongly opposes the policies of they deem to be free market institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. , it is active in the campaign against the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.

G. Daily, Mark Holton, Diane Salinger, and Judd Omen. Reubens also co-wrote the script with Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol. Described as a \\"parody\\" or \\"farce version\\" of the 1948 Italian classic Bicycle Thieves, it is the tale of Pee-wee Herman's nationwide search for his stolen bicycle. After the success of The Pee-wee Herman Show, Reubens began writing the script to Pee-wee's Big Adventure when he was hired by the Warner Bros. film studio. The producers and Reubens hired Burton to direct when they were impressed with his work on the short films Vincent and Frankenweenie. Filming took place in both California and Texas. The film was released on August 9, 1985, grossing over $40 million in North America. It eventually developed into a cult film and has since accumulated positive feedback. The film was nominated for a Young Artist Award and spawned two sequels, Big Top Pee-wee (1988) and Pee-wee's Big Holiday (2016). Its financial success, followed by the equally successful Beetlejuice in 1988, prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton as the director for the 1989 film Batman. Plot Pee-wee Herman has a heavily accessorized bicycle that he treasures and that his neighbor and enemy, Francis Buxton, covets. A bike shop employee, Dottie, has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate it. Pee-wee's bike is stolen while he is shopping at a mall. The police tell Pee-wee that they cannot help him find his bike. Pee-wee thinks Francis took it, and confronts him. Francis' father convinces Pee-wee that Francis did not steal the bike. Pee-wee then offers a $10,000 reward for his bike. Francis, who did indeed pay to have a friend steal the bike, is frightened by Pee-wee's relentlessness and then pays to have it sent away. After holding an unsuccessful meeting to locate the bike, Pee-wee angrily rejects Dottie's offers of help. Desperate, he visits \\"Madam Ruby\\", a phony psychic. Ruby, inspired by the Al and Moe's Bargain Basement shop across the street, tells Pee-wee that his bike is in the basement of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. Pee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive named Mickey and from Large Marge, the ghost of a deceased truck driver. At a truck stop, Pee-wee discovers his wallet is missing and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting Paris. As they watch the sunrise at a dinosaur museum, Pee-wee encourages her to follow her dreams, but Simone tells him about her jealous and large boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy arrives and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train and meets Hobo Jack. Pee-wee eventually arrives at the Alamo, but learns at the end of a guided tour that the building does not have a basement. At a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him that she and Andy broke up and she is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up finding his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie at the bike shop and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes his attack. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a rodeo bull rider. Forced to ride for real, Pee-wee does well but receives a concussion. Pee-wee enters a biker bar to make a phone call, but the outlaw motorcycle club threatens to kill him after he accidentally knocks over their motorcycles. Pee-wee makes a last request, dancing to the song \\"Tequila\\". His dance wins over the bikers, who give him a motorcycle for his journey, which he crashes immediately afterwards. Pee-wee wakes up in a hospital and learns from a television news report that his bike is being used as a prop in a movie starring a bratty child named Kevin Morton. Pee-wee sneaks into Warner Bros. Studios and takes the bike. He is chased by security across the studio lot and through several sets before escaping. Later, Pee-wee discovers a burning pet shop and rescues the animals. Although the firefighters declare Pee-wee a hero, the police arrest him for his disruption at the studios. The president of Warner Bros., Terry Hawthorne, decides to drop the charges and return Pee- Wee's bike, in exchange for the rights to adapt his story into a movie. Later at a drive-in theater, Pee-wee and Dottie attend the premiere of the resulting movie, a James Bond-style film starring James Brolin as \\"P.W. Herman\\" and Morgan Fairchild as Dottie. The two must retrieve a sport bike called the X-1, which contains an important microfilm and has been stolen by the Soviets. Pee- wee has a cameo appearance as a hotel bellhop, though his voice has been dubbed. At the drive-in, Pee-wee gives refreshments to all the people he met along his journey. Pee-wee also encounters Francis, who tells reporters that he is Pee-wee's best friend who taught him how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee's bike, but accidentally catapults himself into the air using one of the bicycle's gadgets. As Pee-wee leaves the drive-in, Dottie asks why he is not staying for the rest of the movie. Pee-wee answers, \\"I don't have to see it, Dottie. I lived it.\\" He and Dottie then ride off together at the movie screen in silhouette. Cast * Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman * E. G.

Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) as the Biker Mama of Satan's Helpers. James Brolin portrays \\"P.W. Herman\\" and Morgan Fairchild is Dottie in the in-movie production about Pee-wee's life. Heavy metal band Twisted Sister, and veteran comedy star Milton Berle cameo as themselves. The film contains numerous \\"conceptual continuity\\" links to other Tim Burton films and other productions: * Several cast members from The Pee-wee Herman Show (who would go on to appear in Pee-wee's Playhouse) have cameo roles in the film. John Moody (Mailman Mike in The Pee-wee Herman Show) appears as the bus clerk, in the movie studio sequence, Lynne Marie Stewart (Miss Yvonne) plays the Mother Superior, John Paragon (Jambi the Genie) plays the high-voiced studio extra in red armor from whom Pee-wee asks directions and the reporter interviewing Francis in the final scene at the drive-in is played by Phil Hartman (Cap'n Carl). * Jan Hooks (who played Tina) was a fellow member of The Groundlings comedy troupe with Reubens, Hartman and Paragon, and went on to co-star in Saturday Night Live with Hartman. She also had a cameo role as a publicist in Burton's Batman Returns. * Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger (Simone) were reunited in the opening sequence of Burton's Batman Returns, in which they portrayed the parents of the Penguin. They would reunite again in Pee-wee's Big Holiday. Production One of the prop bicycles used in the film on display at Bicycle Heaven The success of The Pee-wee Herman Show prompted Warner Bros. to hire Paul Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna with Pee-wee Herman in the Hayley Mills role. Reubens claims that Pollyanna is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike to get around the backlot, and so he requested one of his own. This inspired Reubens to start on a new script.Paul Reubens, Tim Burton, audio commentary, 2000, Warner Bros. Having left Walt Disney Productions and with Frankenweenie receiving positive reviews within film studios, Tim Burton was looking for a full-length film to direct. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wee's Big Adventure saw Burton's work on Vincent and Frankenweenie, they decided to hire Burton for their film. Burton felt he connected with Reubens' personality and the humor of the Pee-wee Herman Show.Salisbury, Burton, p.43–4 After hiring Burton to direct, Reubens, Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol reworked the script again.Salisbury, Burton, p.47 The team purchased Syd Field's Screenplay and wrote the script as faithful as to what the book advised. \\"It’s a 90-minute film, it’s a 90-page script,\\" Reubens explained. \\"On page 30 I lose my bike, on page 60 I find it. It's literally exactly what they said to do in the book...There should be like a MacGuffin kind of a thing, something you’re looking for, and I was like, 'Okay, my bike.'\\" Filming locations included Glendale, Pomona, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Burbank, Cabazon (at the Cabazon DinosaursFamous Movie Locations: Wheel Inn Restaurant from Pee-wee's Big Adventure (Cabazon, California) , by Kim Potts, Aug 10, 2010, Moviefone. Retrieved 2011-08-21.), Port Hueneme, California, and San Antonio, Texas. Burton and Reubens had tensions with Warner Bros. studio executives over the shooting schedule.Salisbury, Burton, p.49 Burton hired CalArts classmate Rick Heinrichs for scenes involving stop-motion animation. Large Marge's claymation transformation was created by The Chiodo Brothers. Soundtrack To compose the film score, Burton brought in Danny Elfman, who had previously composed the music for Forbidden Zone and who was at the time lead singer/songwriter of the new wave band Oingo Boingo. He relished the opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted it to be taken as the work of a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician. Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on. Elfman's original score draws inspiration from film composers Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann, Alt URL with the main title music paying homage to Rota's \\"Carlotta's Galop\\" from Fellini's 8½, and the tracks \\"Stolen Bike\\" and \\"Clown Dream\\" paying homage to music from Herrmann's scores for Psycho and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad respectively. \\"Studio Chase\\" pays homage to Miss Gulch's theme in The Wizard of Oz. In 1986 Varèse Sarabande released an album on record, cassette and compact disc featuring cues from the movie and 1986's Back to School, also scored by Elfman. While both films had their original scores recorded in Hollywood, the album recording was made in London and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by John Coleman. In 2010 many of the original tracks were subsequently released by Warner Bros. Records as part of The Danny Elfman & Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box. This was the first major studio film for Elfman as composer, and he would go on to collaborate on nearly all of Burton's films,Salisbury, Burton, p.48 excluding Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. \\"Clown Dream\\" is also used in the video game Grand Theft Auto V. It is also often used as the opening music during Primus concerts. The film also features \\"Burn in Hell\\" by Twisted Sister and \\"Tequila\\" by The Champs. Reception Pee-wee's Big Adventure opened on August 9, 1985 in the United States in 829 theaters, accumulating $4,545,847 over its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically.  Critical response  Pee-wee's Big Adventure received generally positive reviews at the time of the film's release, before eventually developing into a cult film.Salisbury, Burton, p.50 As of May 2020, Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of 46 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.85/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure brings Paul Reubens' famous character to the big screen intact, along with enough inspired silliness to dazzle children of all ages\\". By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 47 from 14 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film was nominated with a Young Artist Award for Best Family Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical). Christopher Null gave positive feedback, calling it \\"Burton's strangest film.\\" Variety compared Paul Reubens to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, while Empire called the film \\"a one-comic masterpiece\\" and \\"a dazzling debut\\" for Burton. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com explained \\"Everything about Pee-wee's Big Adventure, from its toy-box colors to its superb, hyper-animated Danny Elfman score to the butch-waxed hairdo and wooden-puppet walk of its star and mastermind is pure pleasure.\\" Burton was offered the opportunity to direct Big Top Pee-wee, but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, Beetlejuice. Positive reviews of Beetlejuice and the financial success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure prompted Warner Bros. to offer Burton the director's helm for Batman.Tim Burton, Batman audio commentary, 2005, Warner Bros. Roger Ebert never officially reviewed Pee-wee's Big Adventure but in 1987 it topped his list of Guilty Pleasures and he did mention it in his review of Big Top Pee-wee, saying the sequel was not as magical as the first. The second paragraph of that review contrasted the two films explaining what he liked in Big Adventure that he didn't like in Big Top. Gene Siskel, however, gave Pee-wee's Big Adventure, a rare zero star rating in his print review, writing that he had enjoyed Herman's guest spots on Late Night with David Letterman but \\"Obviously, Pee-Wee is tolerable only in Pee-Wee doses ... You have to be a lot funnier on the big screen than on the tube to sustain a feature-length story.\\"Siskel, Gene (August 12, 1985). \\"Pee-Wee Herman gets laughs to match his name\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 5, p. 5. Siskel included the film in his unranked year-end list of the worst movies of 1985.Siskel, Gene (December 22, 1985). \\"Siskel's top 10 Movies of the year\\".

David Ansen of Newsweek described the film as \\"Mattel Surrealism, a toy-store fantasia in primary colors and '50s decor. Whoever proposed teaming up Pee-wee (a.k.a. Paul Reubens) with 26-year-old director Tim Burton knew what they were doing ... Together they've conspired to make a true original — a live-action cartoon brash enough to appeal to little kids and yet so knee-deep in irony that its faux naivete looks as chic as the latest retrofashions.\\"Ansen, David (August 26, 1985). \\"Hollywood's Silly Season\\". Newsweek. p. 62. Home video Warner Home Video released Pee-wee's Big Adventure on DVD in May 2000.

The group was formed by Alan Thornett and other members of the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) after their expulsion from that group in 1974.  Origins  Thornett and his comrades had questioned what they saw as a sectarian turn of the WRP. They argued that this turn would isolate the WRP and that it was necessary to turn back to Trotsky's Transitional Programme. They wrote a number of documents to argue their case and as a result were expelled. A minor controversy surrounded these documents when some WRP members alleged that Thornett was not their author, but that in fact they were written by members of the Bulletin Group, who were supporters of Pierre Lambert and therefore strongly opposed by the WRP. The WSL was founded in 1975 with a leadership grouped around Thornett, Tony Richardson and John Lister. Terry Eagleton was a well-known member. Unlike the WRP, whose politics it inherited, it covered Irish politics, women's struggles and broke with the homophobia characteristic of Gerry Healy. The group also concluded that Cuba had been a deformed workers state since the revolution of 1959. It published the weekly paper Socialist Press and a number of issues of a theoretical journal Trotskyism Today. In its first few years the WSL attempted to capitalise on its existing base in industry and expand outwards from its base in Oxford. Despite having more realistic perspectives than the WRP, it was never able to group more than 150 members. Many people who left the WRP simply left revolutionary politics, and as the level of industrial struggle slackened in the late 1970s the WSL lost members and internal factional struggles began. The first factional struggles were the result of the development of a small group of supporters of the American Spartacist League. Spartacist London had been founded in 1975 by American, Canadian and Australian Spartacists with the intention of engaging other Trotskyist groups in debate. As both they and the WSL have a common past in the International Committee of the Fourth International they paid great attention to the WSL. The result was that they recruited a number of WSL members to their views and these formed the Leninist Faction in 1977. The Leninist Faction would split to join the London Spartacists in forming the Spartacist League in 1978. This factional struggle had its sequel in 1979 when another group of WSL members were similarly won to the Spartacists this time calling themselves the Trotskyist Faction. In 1978 the United Secretariat of the Fourth International invited the WSL to submit material to the USec's 1979 Eleventh World Congress. It did so in July 1978 with The Poisoned Well, a critical analysis of the development of USec which was republished in Trotskyism Today. Meanwhile, 1979 saw the election of a Conservative Government and the beginnings of a major offensive against the trade unions. This also had a reaction in the Labour Party which swung to the left and began to attract the attention of Trotskyist groups including the WSL.  Failed Fusion  By 1980 the WSL was essentially working within the Labour Party which caused a degree of internal differentiation within its membership as to how to relate to the Labour Left around Tony Benn, which they saw as reformist. The presence of another Trotskyist group in the Labour Party, the International-Communist League, also posed problems and the possibility of the two groups merging was raised. Those members of the WSL most opposed to any fusion of the group with the I-CL tended to be those involved with the group's \\"open\\" work around unemployment which was then a massive question in Britain. The WSL launched a short-lived National Unemployed Workers Movement at this time which despite its name was actually more concerned with unemployed youth than workers thrown out of the factories. The fusion of the two groups was achieved in July 1981 with the fused group maintaining the name Workers Socialist League, often called the 'new' WSL, with Socialist Organiser as its paper (although theoretically SO was a \\"broad\\" paper and not that of the WSL or I-CL before it). The WSL remained affiliated to the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee, a small international tendency of groups led by the WSL. Its other affiliates were to be found in Denmark, Italy, Greece, the USA and among Turkish exiles. The only group affiliated which supported the former I-CL was to be found in Australia. Within the new WSL disputes broke out immediately. Although there were many issues involved in the internal debates the Falklands War was paramount. Traditionally, Trotskyists defend countries oppressed by imperialism in any military conflict, calling this military support which is differentiated from political support. The reaction from some Trotskyists in Britain was to give such support to Argentina when war broke out, ignoring historical claims to the islands or the question of who began the war. The I-CL disagreed with this view and took a dual defeatist position on the war on the grounds that Argentina was not a semi-colony of imperialism, and also called for self determination for the Falkland Islanders. This position caused disputes within the group, mostly with members of the old WSL. By the summer of 1982 clear but informal factional lines had developed in the WSL. One group was the former I-CL around Sean Matgamna, a second around Alan Clinton and a smaller third group was composed of part of the old WSL. Most of the parties in the TILC supported the third group, which in January 1983 constituted itself as the Internationalist Tendency (IT). The small IT group came to disagree with both the other groups on many important issues, including the Labour Party, Northern Ireland and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The IT had 38 members most from the old WSL but including I-CLers with its main support in Leicester and Nottingham. It was led by Mike Jones and Pete Flack. In March 1983 the IT declared that it was now a faction, thus becoming the Internationalist Faction (IF), and it adopted a number of documents in which their criticisms of the leadership was stepped up. But there were by now tensions in the IF as some members became sympathetic to Workers Power and left to join that group. Others sympathised with the international tendency around the Workers' Party (Argentina), the Latin American Tendencia Cuarta Internacional (TCI). The next stage in the developing split was the April 1983 TILC meeting at which the WSL delegates voted to prevent Chilean sympathisers from affiliating to the TILC. The WSL then walked out after a resolution calling on Alan Thornett to fight Sean Matgamna's \\"revisionism\\". The IF, who sympathised with the TILC, were then expelled from the WSL, and formed the Workers Internationalist League. The WSL was a little smaller after the expulsion of the IF and still split between the supporters of Sean Matgamna and Alan Thornett. Thornett's supporters stopped paying subscriptions to the group and called several special conferences. Later, in 1984, Matgamna's supporters formally expelled Thornett's supporters.What really happened in the 'Thornett' split following the fusion of the I-CL and the WSL in 1981?, Alliance for Workers' Liberty  Socialist Group  Matgamna's supporters continued with the WSL and Socialist Organiser but soon dropped the name WSL in favour of Socialist Organiser Alliance, while Thornett's depleted followers founded a new smaller group called the Socialist Group, which was to publish a magazine called Socialist Viewpoint until it fused with the International Group in 1987, to form the International Socialist Group.

The Isle of Man is a small island nation in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Ireland (and not part of the United Kingdom). A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called in Ramsey. This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture, after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974. Musicians of the Manx musical revival include King Chiaullee, Skeeal, The Mannin Folk, Mactullagh Vannin, Moot and many others. Culture Vannin provides a central resource for Manx music and dance through the manxmusic.com website, which has links to most performers. Other artists who have produced CDs include Emma Christian ( – Beneath the Twilight), (voice, harp and recorder), and harpist and producer Charles Guard (Avenging and Bright), formerly an administrator at Culture Vannin. Many of the web entries about Manx music stem from Cliff McGann's 1996 article which is now somewhat out of date. Early history Little can be determined about the character of music on the Isle of Man prior to the 15th century. There are many carved crosses from this era, but they depict a total of two musicians, one lur player and a harpist. Songs from this era may have had Scandinavian origins; some also bear similarities to Irish and Scottish music. The song (the Manx sword dance) is very similar to a lullaby from the Hebrides and is also said to have been a ritual dance during the Scandinavian era. The earliest written evidence describes fiddle music and a variety of folk dances. There was no harp tradition as was otherwise prevalent in Celtic music. English folk songs were very popular, later including broadside ballads, jigs and reels. Also extant were traditional Gaelic psalm-singing and other church music. According to Fenella Bazin, \\"...[E]vidence from written sources shows that the Manx were enthusiastic dancers and musicians, often appearing in the ecclesiastical courts on charges on making music on Saturday nights or after church on Sundays.\\" A traditional Manx melody is Mylecharane (The Manx National Air). Carvals In 1891, Manx antiquarian and folklorist Arthur William Moore published a collection of Manx Carols. The carval is related to the medieval English carol and sung to popular Manx tunes. These carols were formerly sung in the parish churches on Christmas Eve, or Oie'l Verrey (a corruption of Oie Feaill Voirrey (the eve of Mary's Feast, ie Christmas Eve), as it was called. It was the custom for the people on this night to bring their own candles, so that the church was brilliantly illuminated. Decorations mainly consisted of branches of holly and festoons of ivy. After the prayers were read and a hymn sung, the parson usually went home, leaving the clerk in charge. Then each one who had a carol to sing would do so in turn, so that the proceedings were continued till a very late hour, and sometimes also became of a rather riotous character, as it was a custom for the female part of the congregation to provide themselves with peas, which they flung at their bachelor friends. On the way home a considerable proportion of the congregation would probably visit the nearest inn, where they would partake of the traditional drink on such occasions, viz. hot ale, flavoured with spice, ginger, and pepper.Moore, A.W., Carvalyn Gailkagh (Manx Carols), 1891 It was traditional to sing Arrane Oie Vie (Good-night Song) on the way home. Ruth Keggin, singer-songwriter and activist. Ballads The ballad Ushtey Millish 'sy Garee relates to the old practice of summoning a jury of 24 men to decide questions connected with water-courses, boundaries, etc. and is dated to sometime prior to 1777. A bardoon was a locally composed song about the loss of a loved one at sea.Miller, Stephen. \\"The Tipsy Fiddler; Molly Charane George Borrow in the Isle of Man (1855), Kiall Manninagh Jiu Yn Chenn Dolphin (The Old Dolphin) is a tale about a shipwreck.Moore, A.W., Manx Ballads & Music, G & R Johnson, Douglas, Isle of Man, 1896 19th century Church music is the most documented Manx music of the 19th century. Lining out was a common technique, as it was throughout Great Britain and Ireland. West gallery musicians performed for special occasions, using locally composed or well-known compositions. Organs were a later importation that became standard in most of the island's churches. The first mention of an organ on the island is associated with St George's church, Douglas in September 1781. The first collection of Manx church songs was printed in 1799, and was followed by many other collections, though it was not until the 1870s and 1880s that Manx music began to be published in any great quantity, as drawing-room ballads, religious songs, and choral arrangements all became popular. The proliferation of this music coincided with a boom in the tourism industry for the island, and Manx music-hall and dance-hall songs and dances saw increased demand. Manx language songs, in particular, benefited from the Gaelic revival from the 19th century onwards.Guard, Charles. The Manx National Songbook, Vol. 2, Shearwater Press, 1980, 20th century A notable musical episode in the Isle of Man was the imprisonment between 1940 and 1941 of many German musicians of Jewish extraction in Hutchinson Internment Camp on the island. These included Hans Gál (who composed there works for performance by the camp orchestra), Egon Wellesz, and Marjan Rawicz. Though West Gallery music continued into the 1950s, by the 20th century instrumental music accompanied most worship on the Isle of Man. Later in the 20th century, Manx church musical traditions slowly declined. The legacy of immigration, from England and elsewhere, has brought in many new styles of music to the island. Future Culture Vannin has a dedicated Manx Music Development Team comprising a Manx music specialist, who works with the island's Department of Education, Sport and Culture to encourage the development of Manx music in the school curriculum, and a Manx Music Development Officer, who works to promote Manx music and dance in the wider community. CDs by bands, soloists and Gaelic choirs are produced. Manx Music Festival The Manx Music Festival is an annual music festival held at the end of each April in Douglas. It was founded in 1892 after music classes were included in the Fine Arts and Industrial Guild, after which the festival gets its colloquial name of \\"The Guild\\". Local people and visitors are invited to take part in various singing, instrumental, drama and public speaking classes. At the close of the festival, winners of the individual voice categories compete to win the Cleveland Medal, first donated in 1923 by the Cleveland Manx Society. The first performance of the Manx National Anthem occurred at The Guild in 1907, accompanied by Harry Wood's Orchestra. Special projects In November 2014 Culture Vannin, a government sponsored entity, brought together musicians from Norway and the Isle of Man to produce the Norwegian-Manx Collaboration featuring traditional music and providing an educational tour around the Isle of Man. The collaboration featured Manx musicians Tom Callister, Ruth Keggin and David Kilgallon, as well as Norwegian musicians Erlend Apneseth and Margit Myhr.

This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect. Stark received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1897 under the supervision of Eugen von Lommel, and served as Lommel's assistant until his appointment as a lecturer at the University of Göttingen in 1900. He was an extraordinary professor at Leibniz University Hannover from 1906 until he became a professor at RWTH Aachen University in 1909. In 1917, he became professor at the University of Greifswald, and he also worked at the University of Würzburg from 1920 to 1922. A supporter of Adolf Hitler from 1924, Stark was one of the main figures, along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard, in the anti- Semitic Deutsche Physik movement, which sought to remove Jewish scientists from German physics. He was appointed head of the German Research Foundation in 1933 and was president of the Reich Physical-Technical Institute from 1933 to 1939. In 1947 he was found guilty as a \\"Major Offender\\" by a denazification court. Biography=Early years Born in Schickenhof, Kingdom of Bavaria (now Freihung), Stark was educated at Bayreuth Gymnasium (secondary school) and later in Regensburg. His collegiate education began at the University of Munich, where he studied physics, mathematics, chemistry, and crystallography. His tenure at that college began in 1894; he graduated in 1897, with his doctoral dissertation titled Untersuchung über einige physikalische, vorzüglich optische Eigenschaften des Rußes (Investigation of some physical, in particular optical properties of soot).Entry in the catalogue of the Bavarian State Library, MunIch. Opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de. Retrieved on 2012-07-27. Career Stark worked in various positions at the Physics Institute of his alma mater until 1900, when he became an unsalaried lecturer at the University of Göttingen. An extraordinary professor at Hannover by 1906, in 1908 he became professor at RWTH Aachen University. He worked and researched at physics departments of several universities, including the University of Greifswald, until 1922. In 1919, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields\\" (the latter is known as the Stark effect). From 1933 until his retirement in 1939, Stark was elected President of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, while also President of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. It was Stark who, as the editor of the Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik, asked in 1907, then still rather unknown, Albert Einstein to write a review article on the principle of relativity. Stark seemed impressed by relativity and Einstein's earlier work when he quoted \\"the principle of relativity formulated by H. A. Lorentz and A. Einstein\\" and \\"Planck's relationship M0 = E0/c2\\" in his 1907 paper in Physikalische Zeitschrift, where he used the equation e0 = m0c2 to calculate an \\"elementary quantum of energy\\", i.e. the amount of energy related to the mass of an electron at rest. While working on his article, Translated in Schwartz, H. M. (1977) Einstein's comprehensive 1907 essay on relativity, parts I, II, III , American Journal of Physics, June, September and October, 1977. Einstein began a line of thought that would eventually lead to his generalized theory of relativity, which in turn became (after its confirmation) the start of Einstein's worldwide fame. This is ironic, given Stark's later work as an anti-Einstein and anti-relativity propagandist in the Deutsche Physik movement.Norton, John D. \\"Einstein and Nordström: Some Lesser- Known Thought Experiments in Gravitation\\", John Earman, Michel Janssen, John D. Norton (eds.), Birkhäuser, 1993, pp. 3–29 (p. 6). Stark published more than 300 papers, mainly regarding electricity and other such topics. He received various awards, including the Nobel Prize, the Baumgartner Prize of the Vienna Academy of Sciences (1910), the Vahlbruch Prize of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences (1914), and the Matteucci Medal of the Rome Academy. Probably his best known contribution to the field of physics is the Stark effect, which he discovered in 1913. In 1970 the International Astronomical Union honored him with a crater on the far-side of the moon, without knowing his Nazi activities. In the wake of George Floyd's killing and subsequent anti-racism protests, planetary scientist Charles Wood (chair of IAU's The Task Groups for Lunar Nomenclature) has recommended to the group that the name of Stark should be quickly replaced. He married Luise Uepler, and they had five children. His hobbies were the cultivation of fruit trees and forestry. He worked in his private laboratory, which he set up using his Nobel prize money, on his country estate in Upper Bavaria after the second world war. There he studied the deflection of light in an electric field.Johannes Stark – Biography. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-27. Affiliation with Nazism From 1924 onwards, Stark supported Hitler. During the Nazi regime, Stark attempted to become the Führer of German physics through the Deutsche Physik (\\"German physics\\") movement (along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard) against the \\"Jewish physics\\" of Albert Einstein and Werner Heisenberg (who was not Jewish). After Werner Heisenberg defended Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, Stark wrote an angry article in the SS newspaper Das Schwarze Korps, calling Heisenberg a \\"White Jew\\". On August 21, 1934, Stark wrote to physicist and fellow Nobel laureate Max von Laue to toe the party line or else. The letter was signed off with \\"Heil Hitler.\\"Reisman, Arnold (2006) Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision . In his 1934 book Nationalsozialismus und Wissenschaft (English: \\"National Socialism and Science\\") Stark maintained that the priority of the scientist was to serve the nation—thus, the important fields of research were those that could help German arms production and industry. He attacked theoretical physics as \\"Jewish\\" and stressed that scientific positions in Nazi Germany should only be held by pure-blooded Germans. Writing in the official SS magazine Das Schwarze Korps, Stark argued that even if racial antisemitism was triumphant, it would only be a 'partial victory' if 'Jewish' ideas were not similarly defeated: \\"We also have to eradicate the Jewish spirit, whose blood can flow just as undisturbed today as before if its carriers hold beautiful Aryan passes\\".Stone, Dan \\"Nazi Race Ideologues\\", in Patterns of Prejudice, Volume 50, Issue 4-5 (2016), p. 452. In 1947, following the defeat of Germany in World War II, Stark was classified as a \\"Major Offender\\" and received a sentence of four years' imprisonment (later suspended) by a denazification court.

The ship's company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the Attack-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing. Aitape was one of the five Attack-class patrol boats of the RAN PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force's (PNGDF) Maritime Element on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions from the RAN. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus. She served until 1982, when she was paid off to act as a source of spares for the other Attack-class patrol boats in PNGDF service. In 1995, she was sunk in shallow waters as dive wreck south east of Port Moresby.

Its range is primarily in the Southwestern United States and northern and central Mexico. Some mammalogists classify it as conspecific with the swift fox, V. velox, but molecular systematics imply that the two species are distinct. It has also been called an American Fennec fox due to its large ears. Range The northernmost part of its range is the arid interior of Oregon. Its eastern limit is southwestern Colorado. It can be found south through Nevada, Utah, southeastern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and into western Texas.ADW: Vulpes macrotis: Information. Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu (2008-04-05).

Subspecies San Joaquin kit fox at the California Living Museum in Bakersfield The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) was formerly very common in the San Joaquin Valley and through much of Central California. Its 1990 population was estimated to be 7,000. This subspecies is still endangered, after nearly 50 years of being on the Endangered Species List. Officially this subspecies was listed March 3, 1967.http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A006 On September 26, 2007, Wildlands Inc. announced the designation of the 684 acre (277 ha) Deadman Creek Conservation Bank, which is intended specifically to protect habitat of the San Joaquin kit fox.Kit fox Gets Some Protection, In California, Environmental News Network, September 27, 2007 However, the population continues to decline mostly due to heavy habitat loss. Other factors include competition from red foxes, and the extermination of the wolf from California has left the coyote as the dominant meso-predator in kit fox territory, bringing an imbalance in ecosystem relationships. Appearance The kit fox is one of the smallest species of the family Canidae found in North America (except for specially bred domestic dog breeds like teacup Yorkshire.) It has large ears, between , that help the fox lower its body temperature and give it exceptional hearing (much like those of the fennec fox). This species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the male being slightly larger. The average species weight is between . The body length is . The tail adds another to its length. It usually has a gray coat, with rusty tones, and a black tip to its tail. Unlike the gray fox, it has no stripe along the length of its tail. Its color ranges from yellow to gray, and the back is usually darker than the majority of its coat; its belly and inner ears are usually lighter. It has distinct dark patches around the nose. Diet The kit fox is mostly a nocturnal animal, but sometimes ventures out of its den during the day. It usually goes out to hunt shortly after sunset, mostly eating small animals such as kangaroo rats, cottontail rabbits, black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), meadow voles, hares, prairie dogs, insects, lizards, snakes, fish, and ground-dwelling birds. It will scavenge carrion. While primarily carnivorous, if food is scarce, it has been known to eat tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum), cactus fruits (Carnegiea gigantea) and other fruits. Different kit fox families can occupy the same hunting grounds, but do not generally go hunting at the same time. The Kit Fox experiences a very interesting, but rare, tooth malformation that causes Bigeminy: a heart rhythm problem. This is caused by the fusion of a maxillary third premolar tooth and an adjoining supernumerary tooth which makes a single tooth with two cusps and three roots. Habitat Kit foxes favor arid climates, such as desert scrub, chaparral, and grasslands. Good examples of common habitats are sagebrush Artemisia tridentata and saltbrush Atriplex polycarpa. They can be found in urban and agricultural areas, too. They are found at elevations of above sea level. Mating The kit fox is a socially monogamous species.Ralls, Katherine, Brian Cypher, and Linda K. Spiegel. \\"Social monogamy in kit foxes: formation, association, duration, and dissolution of mated pairs.\\" Journal of Mammalogy 88.6 (2007): 1439-1446. Male and female kit foxes usually establish monogamous mating pairs during October and November. Polygamous mating relationships have been observed. Pairs can change year to year. They mate from December to February, when they use larger family dens. Litters are born throughout March and April, usually containing one to seven pups, and average four pups. The gestation is 49 to 55 days. Pups do not leave the den until they are four weeks old. They are weaned after about eight weeks and become independent at five to six months old. They become sexually mature at 10 months. Both parents take part in raising and protecting their young. The average lifespan of a wild kit fox is 5.5 years. In captivity, they can live 12 years. One Californian study of 144 kit fox pups showed a 74% mortality rate in pups within the first year.\\"Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis): A Technical Conservation Assessment\\", 2006 References 10\\\\.

Once one has eaten at the hearth of Yomi it is (mostly) impossible to return to the land of the living. Yomi in Japanese mythology is comparable to Hades or Sheol and is most commonly known for Izanami's retreat to that place after her death. Izanagi followed her there and upon his return he washed himself, creating Amaterasu, Susanoo, and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto in the process. This realm of the dead seems to have geographical continuity with this world and certainly cannot be thought of as a paradise to which one would aspire, nor can it appropriately be described as a hell in which one suffers retribution for past deeds; rather, all deceased carry on a gloomy and shadowy existence in perpetuity, regardless of their behavior in life. Many scholars believe that the image of Yomi was derived from ancient Japanese tombs in which corpses were left for some time to decompose. The kanji that are sometimes used to transcribe Yomi actually refer to the mythological Chinese realm of the dead called Diyu or Huángquán (, lit. \\"Yellow Springs\\"), which appears in Chinese texts as early as the eighth century BCE. This dark and vaguely defined realm was believed to be located beneath the earth, but it was not until the Han Dynasty that the Chinese had a clearly articulated conception of an underworld below in contrast with a heavenly realm above. The characters are jukujikun, i.e. were used without regard to the actual meaning of the word Yomi, which is unknown. With regard to Japanese mythology, Yomi is generally taken by commentators to lie beneath the earth and is part of a triad of locations discussed in Kojiki: , , and or . Yomi has also often been associated with the mythological realm of , also known as . Yomi is ruled over by Izanami no Mikoto, the Grand Deity of Yomi (Yomo-tsu-Ōkami ). According to Kojiki, the entrance to Yomi lies in Izumo province and was sealed off by Izanagi upon his flight from Yomi, at which time he permanently blocked the entrance by placing a massive boulder (Chigaeshi no ōkami ) at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi (Yomotsu Hirasaka or ). Upon his return to Ashihara- no-Nakatsukuni, Izanagi noted that Yomi is a \\"polluted land\\" (kegareki kuni). This opinion reflects the traditional Shinto association between death and pollution. Later Susanoo takes this position over. Christian uses Some Japanese Christian texts use to refer to what is called Hell in the English versions.

Zeitshur. 13, p.1069 cited in Freund, Jan (2000) Stochastic Processes in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Springer, p.59 It was popularised by American Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman in a physics lecture at the California Institute of Technology on May 11, 1962, during his Messenger Lectures series The Character of Physical Law in Cornell University in 1964 and in his text The Feynman Lectures on Physics as an illustration of the laws of thermodynamics. The simple machine, consisting of a tiny paddle wheel and a ratchet, appears to be an example of a Maxwell's demon, able to extract useful work from random fluctuations (heat) in a system at thermal equilibrium in violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Detailed analysis by Feynman and others showed why it cannot actually do this. The machine The device consists of a gear known as a ratchet that rotates freely in one direction but is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a pawl. The ratchet is connected by an axle to a paddle wheel that is immersed in a fluid of molecules at temperature T_1. The molecules constitute a heat bath in that they undergo random Brownian motion with a mean kinetic energy that is determined by the temperature. The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle. Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction. The ratchet's motion then can be used to do work on other systems, for example lifting a weight (m) against gravity. The energy necessary to do this work apparently would come from the heat bath, without any heat gradient (i.e. The motion leeches energy from the temperature of the air.) Were such a machine to work successfully, its operation would violate the second law of thermodynamics, one form of which states: \\"It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.\\" Why it fails Although at first sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman demonstrated that if the entire device is at the same temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work. The reason is that since the pawl is at the same temperature as the paddle, it will also undergo Brownian motion, \\"bouncing\\" up and down. It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up. Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction. Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature T_2 of the ratchet and pawl is the same as the temperature T_1 of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense. A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by Magnasco. If, on the other hand, T_2 is less than T_1, the ratchet will indeed move forward, and produce useful work. In this case, though, the energy is extracted from the temperature gradient between the two thermal reservoirs, and some waste heat is exhausted into the lower temperature reservoir by the pawl. In other words, the device functions as a miniature heat engine, in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Conversely, if T_2 is greater than T_1, the device will rotate in the opposite direction. The Feynman ratchet model led to the similar concept of Brownian motors, nanomachines which can extract useful work not from thermal noise but from chemical potentials and other microscopic nonequilibrium sources, in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics. Diodes are an electrical analog of the ratchet and pawl, and for the same reason cannot produce useful work by rectifying Johnson noise in a circuit at uniform temperature. Millonas as well as Mahato extended the same notion to correlation ratchets driven by mean-zero (unbiased) nonequilibrium noise with a nonvanishing correlation function of odd order greater than one. History The ratchet and pawl was first discussed as a Second Law-violating device by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900. In 1912, Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski gave the first correct qualitative explanation of why the device fails; thermal motion of the pawl allows the ratchet's teeth to slip backwards. Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, showing that if the temperature of the paddle T1 was greater than the temperature of the ratchet T2, it would function as a heat engine, but if T1 = T2 there would be no net motion of the paddle. In 1996, Juan Parrondo and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the quasistatic approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency. Magnasco and Stolovitzky (1998) extended this analysis to consider the full ratchet device, and showed that the power output of the device is far smaller than the Carnot efficiency claimed by Feynman. A paper in 2000 by Derek Abbott, Bruce R. Davis and Juan Parrondo, reanalyzed the problem and extended it to the case of multiple ratchets, showing a link with Parrondo's paradox. Brillouin paradox: an electrical analogue of the Brownian ratchet. Léon Brillouin in 1950 discussed an electrical circuit analogue that uses a rectifier (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet. The idea was the diode would rectify the Johnson noise thermal current fluctuations produced by the resistor, generating a direct current which could be used to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an electromotive force that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations. Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor. Granular gas Researchers from the University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have constructed a Feynman–Smoluchowski engine which, when not in thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work by means of a granular gas,\\"Classical thought experiment brought to life in granular gas\\", Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter, Utrecht, 18 June 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-24. which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. Because the ratchet's gear and pawl mechanism, as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation. The experiment was filmed.

The division was present at the Peninsular War, the Crimean War, the First World War, and during the Second World War and was finally disbanded in 1960. Napoleonic Wars The British 1st Division was originally formed in 1809 by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington for service in the Peninsula War, drawing initially from two British brigades and one Hanoverian brigade of the King's German Legion. During the Peninsula War, it was involved in most of the engagements between the Allies and France including the Battle of Talavera in 1809, the Battle of Salamanca in 1812, the Siege of Tarragona in 1813, the Battle of Vitoria in 1813, the Siege of San Sebastián in 1813, the Battle of the Pyrenees in 1813, the Battle of the Bidassoa in 1813 and the Battle of Toulouse in 1814.

The British guns were distracted into an artillery duel with French guns and this allowed a second attack by General de Brigade Baron Soye's 2nd Brigade of the 6th Division. They managed a small breach on the south side but could not exploit it. An attack by elements of the 1st Brigade of the 6th Division on the north side was more successful. This attack lead to one of the most famous skirmishes in the Battle of Waterloo – Sous-Lieutenant Legros, wielding an axe, managed to break through the north gate. A desperate fight ensued between the invading French soldiers and the defending Guards. In a near-miraculous attack, Macdonell, a small party of officers and Corporal James Graham fought through the melee to shut the gate, trapping Legros and about 30 other soldiers of the 1st Legere inside. All of the French who entered, apart from a young drummer boy, were killed in a desperate hand-to-hand fight.

Most of the conflict took place on the Crimean Peninsula, with additional actions occurring in western Turkey, and the Baltic Sea region. The Crimean War is sometimes considered to be the first \\"modern\\" conflict and \\"introduced technical changes which affected the future course of warfare\\".Royle. Preface The Division, which now consisted of the Guards Brigade and the Highland Brigade, was involved in the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854), which is considered to be the first battle of the Crimean war. They were next in action during the Battle of Balaclava. The battle started with a successful Russian attack on Ottoman positions. This led to the Russians breaking through into the valley of Balaklava (anglicised as \\"Balaclava\\"), where British forces were encamped. The Russian advance was intended to disrupt the British base and attack British positions near Sevastopol from the rear. An initial Russian advance south of the southern line of hills was repulsed by the British. A large attacking force of Russian cavalry advanced over the ridgeline, and split into two portions. One of these columns drove south towards the town of Balaklava itself, threatening the main supply of the entire British army. That drive was repulsed by the muskets of the 93rd (Highland) Regiment, which had been formed into a lone line of two rows by its commander, Sir Colin Campbell. This action became known in history as \\"The Thin Red Line\\", this battle was also well known for the Charge of the Light Brigade. The division was also involved in the Battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854).

Long.Amery Vol II, p 114.Miller pp 76–83.Hall pp 2, 51–2. The British commander, Sir Redvers Buller, had intended to march with the whole army corps across the Orange River to Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State, but by the time the troops reached Cape Town the Boers had seized the Orange River crossings and begun sieges of Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking. Buller was forced to split his forces, sending divisions to relieve Ladysmith and Kimberley. Methuen and 1st Division were assigned to the relief of Kimberley, but the situation at Ladysmith deteriorated, and Buller diverted Hildyard's 2nd Brigade and Long's artillery to that sector.Amery Vol II, p 283. The division that Methuen assembled at Orange River Station in November 1899 comprised Colville's Guards Brigade and a 'scratch' brigade numbered 9th under Maj-Gen S.R. Fetherstonehaugh, with the 9th Lancers and a brigade division of RFA under Col Hall. Methuen could also call on the 3rd (Highland) Brigade under Maj-Gen Andrew Wauchope (diverted from 2nd Division), in reserve at De Aar.Miller pp 79–83.

They followed up and attacked again at Graspan (25 November) and at Modder River (28 November), again forcing the Boers from their positions but without landing a decisive punch. After receiving reinforcements, Methuen attacked at Magersfontein (11 December 1899). Despite the heavy artillery preparation and night approach, the attack failed. Together with failed attacks on the other fronts at Stormberg and Colenso, the news of Magersfontein led to the political crisis of Black Week in Britain.

Behind the screen provided by 1st Division, the newly arrived commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts, assembled a large army to renew the offensive. After the disaster it had suffered at Magersfontein, where Wauchope was killed, the Highland Brigade and its new commander, Brig-Gen Hector MacDonald, refused to serve under Methuen, and Roberts transferred them to a new 9th Division under Colville. He also sacked Babington from command of the cavalry. And when Roberts advanced in February 1900, he stripped the Guards Brigade from 1st Division to join a new 11th Division under Pole-Carew and took much of the artillery and transport, This left Methuen and a reduced 1st Division to cover Roberts's lines of communication.Miller pp. 174–80. Following the Battle of Paardeberg (18–27 February), the reliefs of Kimberley and Ladysmith, and the fall of Bloemfontein, Roberts reorganised his force to pursue the defeated Boers. Methuen was tasked with clearing the country along the Vaal River on the Boers' flank and driving towards Mafeking, which was still besieged. On 5 April Methuen led out his Mounted Infantry under Brig-Gen Lord Chesham, with the Kimberley Mounted Corps and 4th Battery RFA, and caught a Boer Commando led by a French volunteer, the Comte de Villebois-Mareuil. At the small Battle of Boshof, the Imperial Yeomanry (in action for the first time) surrounded the Boers and then closed with the bayonet.

Methuen's 1st Division became known as the 'Mobile Marvels' and the 'Mudcrushers' because of their prodigious marches. They also acquired the nicknames 'The Salvation Army' and 'Beechams' (from Beecham's Pills, a popular cure-all) because they relieved so many outposts and besieged garrisons.Miller p 188-9. With 9th Brigade and the Imperial Yeomanry, Methuen's Column took part in the operations of June 1900 to trap the elusive Boer leader Christiaan de Wet. Advancing along the Kroonstad railway, they encountered de Wet at Rhenoster River. After a heavy artillery bombardment, the Loyal North Lancashires broke through the Boer lines and many Boers surrendered. But de Wet got away with most of his mounted men and Methuen's troops were too exhausted to pursue. The frustrating pursuit of de Wet and other Boer leaders went on for months. After July 1900 1st Division existed only on paper, and Methuen's Column consisted of an ad hoc brigade of raw recruits – 'colonel's work', Methuen described it.Miller pp. 189–92. Prior to First World War With the return of the troops from South Africa at the end of the Boer War, 1st Division was reformed at Aldershot as part of the 1st Army Corps, with two brigades (the 1st Guards brigade and 2nd Infantry Brigade, comprising eight battalions), 'fairly well organized for mobilization'.Dunlop p 218. Under Lord Haldane's 1907 reforms, which laid down plans for the despatch of a British Expeditionary Force in case of war, 1st Division was one of the two permanent divisions in Aldershot Command that would constitute I Corps.Col John K. Dunlop, The Development of the British Army 1899–1914, London: Methuen, 1938.

(Brigades consisted of four battalions Actual units within this structure varied as battalions, batteries and RE companies rotated between home and overseas stations.) First World War British Trench First World War The division was a permanently established Regular Army division that was amongst the first to be sent to France at the outbreak of the First World War. It served on the Western Front for the duration of the war. On 31 October 1914 divisional commander General Samuel Lomax was seriously wounded by an artillery shell and died on 10 April 1915 never having recovered from his wounds.Davies and Maddocks 1995, p. 83 After the war the division was part of the occupation force stationed at Bonn. The division's insignia was the signal flag for the 'Number 1'. During the war, the division was involved in the following battles: Battle of Mons, First Battle of the Marne, First Battle of the Aisne, First Battle of Ypres, Battle of Aubers Ridge, Battle of Loos, Battle of the Somme, Battle of Pozières, Third Battle of Ypres, Battle of Épehy. World War I order of battle The division comprised the following infantry brigades: ; 1st Brigade: * 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards (left 25 August 1915) * 1st Battalion, Scots Guards (left 25 August 1915) * 1st Battalion, Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) * 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers (left 14 September 1914) * 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders (from 5 September 1914) * 1/14th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (London Scottish) (from 7 November 1914, left February 1916) * 10th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (from 20 August 1915, disbanded 14 February 1918) * 8th (Service) Battalion, Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Royal Berkshire Regiment) (from 20 August 1915, left 2 February 1918) * 1st Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 November 1915) * 1st Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 January 1916, moved to 1st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 February 1918) * 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (from 7 February 1918) Originally called the '1st (Guards) Brigade' because it contained the 1st battalions of the Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards. When the Guards Division was created in August 1915 and these two battalions departed (both for 2nd Guards Brigade), the brigade was renamed as 1st Brigade. ; 2nd Brigade: * 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment * 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (left 7 February 1918) * 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment * 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps * 1/5th (Cinque Ports) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment (from 21 February, left 20 August 1915) * 1/9th Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (from 13 March, left 12 November 1915) * 1/5th Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) (from 21 October 1915, left 7 January 1916) * 2nd Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 November 1915) * 2nd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 January 1916, moved to 1st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 February 1918) ; 3rd Brigade: * 1st Battalion, Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment) (left 8 November 1914) * 1st Battalion, South Wales Borderers * 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Welsh Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers (from 9 November 1914, left February 1918) * 1/6th (Glamorgan) Battalion, Welsh Regiment (from 23 October 1915, became divisional pioneer battalion 15 May 1916) * 1/4th (Denbighshire) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (from 7 November 1914, left 1 September 1915) * 1/9th Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (from 12 November 1915, left 7 January 1916) * 3rd Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 November 1915) * 3rd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 January 1916, moved to 1st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 February 1918) Second World War Major-General Harold Alexander with King George VI inspecting men of the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment in France, 1939. Men of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, 1st Division, working on their Bren gun carriers at Ston de Banchy, France, 2 May 1940. Some of the men are painting formation signs on the vehicles. At the start of Second World War, the 1st Infantry Division was stationed at Aldershot and commanded by Major General the Hon. Harold Alexander (who had assumed command in 1938). The division was sent to France in mid-September 1939, arriving there on 20 September,Joslen, pp. 35–36 where it formed part of Lieutenant General Sir John Dill's I Corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The division, unlike in the First World War, was not immediately engaged in fighting, and was to remain in France for the next few months until evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo in June 1940. North Africa In late February 1943, the 1st Division, now commanded by Major General Walter Clutterbuck, left the United Kingdom, destined for North Africa to take part in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign. The division, arriving there on 9 March, was initially under the direct command of the British First Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson, who had commanded the division in the retreat to Dunkirk until May 1941. Soon, the division, which had been stationed in the Medjez-Bou Arada sector,Blaxland77, p. 227 became part of Lieutenant General Charles Allfrey's V Corps The division was engaged mainly in patrolling and began preparations for an offensive to end the war in North Africa. On the night of 20/21 April the division took part in the Battle of the Medjez Plain, where it was pitted against the Hermann Göring Division which, with the commander having anticipated an offensive, had launched his own offensive with the intention of spoiling the Allied attack.Blaxland77, p. 235 The offensive, however, was soon repulsed (although an entire company of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment had been overrun) with the aid of the divisional artillery (which had been moved forward for the upcoming battle) and Churchill tanks of the 142nd (Suffolk) Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (142 RAC), part of the 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 1st Division suffered only 106 casualties.Blaxland77, p. 236 Men of the 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters firing a captured German MG42 machine gun, 27 April 1943. The next few days saw the 1st Division engaged in particularly hard fighting, with the 2nd Brigade, attacking a ridge known as Gueriat el Atach. The attack failed, at a cost of over 500 casualties, with the supporting 142 RAC losing 29 of 52 tanks, mainly from enemy Tiger tanks.Blaxland77, p. 242 Among those killed were Lieutenant Willward Alexander Sandys-Clarke of the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroism in stalking and destroying an enemy machine gun. The ridge was taken the next day, 24 April, by the 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters, of the 3rd Brigade.Blaxland77, p. 243 Two days later, the 24th Guards Brigade moved to an attack an objective named Bou Aoukaz. No opposition was encountered, aside from mines, and they were ordered by Division HQ to assault Bou Aoukaz on the afternoon of 27 April. The Bou was taken, but with heavy casualties to the 1st Irish and 5th Grenadiers, mostly from enemy shells and mortar. It was discovered that the Germans had retreated, being apparently amazed at the tenacity of the Guards.Blaxland77, p. 244 The 1st Scots Guards had been ordered to assault the Bou from the left flank. However, a machine gun had held them up, which was taken out by Captain Charles Lyell and four guardsmen. They were then fired on by an 88mm gun, which was silenced by Captain Lyell, who was killed while bayoneting the 88 crew, with the survivors fleeing. Captain Lyell was posthumously awarded the VC. The Bou was taken but soon given up, due to a communications issue.Blaxland77, p. 245 The Scots Guards renewed the assault upon the Bou the following day, only to be repulsed. The day afterwards, the enemy, realising how vital the Bou was, being the key to Tunis, launched a huge counterattack, which fell upon the 24th Brigade. It was during this period that the division earned its third VC, belonging to Lance Corporal John Kenneally of the 1st Irish Guards. Fighting continued for the next few days until mid-May, when the Axis forces in North Africa finally surrendered, prompting General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied 18th Army Group (and who had previously commanded the 1st Division), to cable to Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, \\"Sir, it is my duty to report that the Tunisian campaign is over. All enemy resistance has ceased. We are masters of the North African shores.\\"Blaxland77, p. 263 Italy The division, commanded from October 1943 by Major General Ronald Penney, arrived on the Italian Front in December 1943, initially to serve under command of General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army but soon became part of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark.Blumenson, p. 113 Operation Shingle was an Allied amphibious landing against Axis forces in the area of Anzio and Nettuno, Italy. The operation was intended to outflank German forces at the Winter Line and enable an attack on the Italian capital of Rome. The resulting combat is commonly called the Battle of Anzio. The division came under the command of the U.S. VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas. The landings began on 22 January 1944. Although resistance had been expected, as seen at the Salerno landings during September 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory Luftwaffe strafing runs.Atkinson p.205 By midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. A mere 13 Allied troops were killed, and 97 wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as POWs.CMH Publication 72-19, p9 The British 1st Division penetrated 2 miles (3 km) inland, the U.S. Army Rangers captured Anzio's port, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion captured Nettuno, and the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division penetrated 3 miles (5 km) inland.Zabecki, p. 1666 Men of the 2/7th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment carry out maintenance on a Vickers machine gun at Anzio, Italy, 21 February 1945. There was, however, to be severe fighting throughout the next few weeks as the Germans launched several fierce counterattacks in an attempt to drive the Allied force back into the sea. Testimony to this was when, on 17 February, the GOC, Major General Ronald Penney was wounded by shellfire and command of the 1st Division was taken by Major General Gerald Templer of the recently arrived 56th (London) Infantry Division, who took command from 18 to 22 February, when Penney resumed command.Mead, p. 343 Because of the fighting seen by the division throughout February and March, the 24th Guards Brigade was withdrawn from the division, due to a lack of Guards replacements (even at this stage of the war the Guards were the only infantry regiments in the British Army to receive drafts of replacements from their own regiment), and replaced by the 18th Infantry Brigade from the 1st British Armoured Division, which was in North Africa at the time.Sheehan, p. 159 Operation Diadem was the final battle for Monte Cassino the plan was the U.S. II Corps on the left would attack up the coast along the line of Route 7 towards Rome. The French Expeditionary Corps (CEF) to their right would attack from the bridgehead across the Garigliano into the Aurunci Mountains. British XIII Corps in the centre right of the front would attack along the Liri valley whilst on the right 2nd Polish Corps would isolate the monastery and push round behind it into the Liri valley to link with XIII Corps. I Canadian Corps would be held in reserve ready to exploit the expected breakthrough. Once the German Tenth Army had been defeated, the U.S. VI Corps would break out of the Anzio beachhead to cut off the retreating Germans in the Alban Hills.Sheehan, p. 186 As the Canadians and Polish launched their attack on 23 May, Major General Lucian Truscott, who had replaced Lucas as commander of U.S. VI Corps, launched a two pronged attack using five (three American and two British) of the seven divisions in the bridgehead at Anzio. The German 14th Army facing this thrust was without any armoured divisions because Kesselring had sent his armour south to help the German 10th Army in the Cassino action. The 18th Infantry Brigade, which was temporarily attached to the division from February to August, returned to command of the 1st British Armoured Division and were replaced by the 66th Infantry Brigade became a part of the division for the rest of the war. Men of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment march into Rome, 8 June 1944. 1st Reconnaissance Regiment, 23 June 1944. A Humber Mk IV armoured car passes the saluting base. In the fighting for the Anzio beachhead, 8,868 officers and men of the British 1st Infantry Division were killed, wounded or missing in action. The division, commanded from July 1944 by Major General Charles Loewen, subsequently went on to fight on the Gothic Line until being withdrawn from Italy in January 1945.Bidwell and Graham, p. 368 =Order of battle= See list of component units of British 1st Infantry Division. Post war After the war, the division only remained in Palestine for a short time. It was transferred to Egypt for a few months before going back to Palestine in April 1946. Two years later, as the British mandate over Palestine ended, the division returned to Egypt, also spending periods in Libya up until 1951. In October of that year, as British forces pulled out of Egypt outside of the Suez Canal Zone, the division garrisoned that small area. After British forces withdrew from Egypt, the division returned to the UK for a short while in 1955 and 1956. In 1960, it was disbanded before being reformed as the 1st Division based in Verden an der Aller in Germany as part of British I Corps in the British Army of the Rhine.British Army Units Commanders Commanders since 1902 have been:Army Commands GOC 1st Division * 1902–1906 Lieutenant-General Arthur Paget * 1906–1910 Lieutenant-General James Grierson * 1910–1914 Lieutenant-General Samuel Lomax * Nov 1914 – Dec 1914 Major-General David Henderson * 1914–1915 Major-General Richard Haking * 1915–1916 Major-General Arthur Holland * 1916–1919 Major- General Peter Strickland * 1919–1923 Major-General Guy Bainbridge * 1923–1926 Major-General Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd * 1926–1928 Major-General Cecil Romer * 1928–1929 Major-General John Duncan * 1929–1930 Major-General Felix Ready * 1930–1934 Major-General Wentworth Harman * 1934–1936 Major-General John Kennedy * 1936–1938 Major-General Clement Armitage * 1938–1940 Major- General Harold Alexander * 1940–1941 Major-General Kenneth Anderson * May–Nov 1941 Major-General Edwin Morris * 1941–1943 Major-General Walter Clutterbuck * 1943–1944 Major-General Ronald Penney * 1944–1946 Major-General Charles Loewen * 1946–1947 Major-General Richard Gale * 1947–1950 Major-General Horatius Murray * 1950–1952 Major-General Francis Matthews * 1952–1955 Major-General Thomas Brodie * 1955 Major-General Rodney Moore * 1956–1959 Major-General Guy Gregson * 1959–1960 Major-General Reginald Hobbs See also * List of component units of British 1st Infantry Division * List of higher formations British 1st Infantry Division served under * List of military divisions * List of British divisions in World War I * List of British divisions in World War II * British Army Order of Battle (September 1939) FootnotesSources * Amery, L.S., (ed), (1906) The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899–1902, London: Sampson Low, Marston, Vol II 1902; Vol IV.

Biography Biggle was born in 1923 in Waterloo, Iowa. He served in World War II as a communications sergeant in a rifle company of the 102nd Infantry Division; during the war, he was wounded twice. His second wound, a shrapnel wound in his leg received near the Elbe River at the end of the war, left him disabled for life. After the war, Biggle resumed his education. He received an A.B. Degree with High Distinction from Wayne State University and M.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan. Biggle taught at the University of Michigan and at Eastern Michigan University in the 1950s. He began writing professionally in 1955 and became a full-time writer with the publication of his novel, All the Colors of Darkness in 1963; he continued in the writing profession until his death. Career Biggle was celebrated in science fiction circles as the author who introduced aesthetics into a literature known for its scientific and technological complications. His stories frequently used musical and artistic themes. Such notables as songwriter Jimmy Webb and novelist Orson Scott Card have written of the tremendous effect that his early story, \\"The Tunesmith\\", had on them in their youth. Among Biggle's enduring science fiction creations were the matter- transmission trouble-shooting team of Jan Darzek/Effie Schlupe, and the Cultural Survey, featured in novels and magazine stories, through which Biggle explored issues of multi-culturalism and technology. In the field of mystery writing, Biggle's Grandfather Rastin stories appeared for many years in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. He loved writing historical fiction set in late Victorian and Edwardian England. He wrote a series of new Sherlock Holmes stories from the perspective of Edward Porter Jones, an assistant who began his association with Holmes as a \\"Baker Street Irregular\\"; several stories, including \\"The Quallsford Inheritance\\" and \\"The Glendower Conspiracy\\", feature Jones and Holmes. These were followed by a series of stories featured in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine starring Biggle's Victorian sleuth, Lady Sara Varnley. Both Biggle's science fiction and mystery stories have received international acclaim, being nominated for the 1962 Hugo for short fiction, and also for the Locus Readers awards in 1972, 1973, and 1974. He published two-dozen books as well as magazine stories and numerous articles. His last novel was The Chronocide Mission. He was writing almost to the moment of his death. \\"I can write them faster than the magazines can publish them,\\" he once said, and indeed, magazines continued to publish backlogged stories of his well after his death. Few of his works have been in print since the early 2000s, but most of his novels are available as e-books.https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8332791.Lloyd_Biggle_Jr_ Biggle was the founding Secretary-Treasurer of Science Fiction Writers of America and served as Chairman of its trustees for many years. In the 1970s, he founded the Science Fiction Oral History Association, which built archives containing hundreds of cassette tapes of science fiction notables making speeches and discussing aspects of their craft. He numbered many of these science fiction notables among his friends, and his article in the July/August 2002 Analog Magazine, \\"Isaac Asimov Remembered\\", was based in part on his personal recollections of that celebrity.

The word 'Tara' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'tṛ', meaning to cross.David Gordon White The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India, (Kindle Locations 1613–1615). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. \\"This coastal location reminds us of what may have been Tārā’s original role: she was a goddess of navigation, of sea crossings— tārā is generated from the verb tṛ, to cross over the sea.\\" In many other contemporary Indian languages, the word 'tara' also means star. Origin A version speaks of Tara's demon-slaying form; a demon called Hayagriva wrought havoc everywhere, banishing the devas from Amaravati and robbing them of their possessions. The devas approached Brahma, who in turn lead them to Kali. Kali created another goddess, Tara, from her third eye and sent her to defeat Hayagriva. In the ensuing battle, Tara slew Hayagriva. A version from the Kalika Purana associates Tara with Matangi. According to this version, when the devas were defeated by the demons Sumbha and Nisumbha, they sought refuge in the Himalayas and began to propitiate Devi. At that time, Shiva's wife (in her dark-skinned form, Matangi) saw the devas and asked whom they were propitiating. Before the devas could answer, the fair-complexioned Mahasaraswati emerged from Matangi's body and replied that the devas were propitiating her. Since Mahasaraswati manifested from Matangi's body, the fair-complexioned, eight-armed goddess came to be known as Kaushiki (meaning \\"sheath\\"). In turn, Matangi's dark complexion caused her to be known as Kali and Ugratara. In another (less popular) version, the Earth’s landmass was created from fragments of Madhu and Kaitabh's bodies. This did not cause the birth of life because there was nothing other than water and landmass on Earth. Hence, creation was still incomplete. After water and Earth, the Sun was required to provide life force. To create the same, Mahashakti had taken the form of Tara and Mahadev had taken the form of Lord dakhineshar. He and Goddess Tara were the reasons they had brought the sun into existence. Without the eternal sun, the Earth was just a mere orb covered in ice on which life could not have survived. That is why Devi Tara had appeared from whom the sun had to arise and supply light and energy to Earth. Tara has the capability to produce light, energy and heat. When the power met with the power of Akshobhya, their combined power became the source of the sun. When the combined powers of Lord Akshobhya and Devi Tara got integrated in the sea, many pulsating energy orbs were created, in which it led to the expansion of energy. Goddess Tara created a tremendous air flow from her breath which hit the energy bodies and led to their union. Then the increasing source of energy inside the water started assuming the appearance of the eternal sun. Thus, the eternal sun appeared by the combined powers of Goddess Tara and Lord Akshobhya. Surya thanks Akshobhya and Taradevi for giving birth to him. Tara tells him that he has been born to give his life-giving sun rays to the world and give life to all beings. She requests Lord Surya to stay at his place and provide heat, light and life sustaining energy to the Earth. He will lead to the creation of day and night and will lead to the circle of seasons on Earth. She advises him to leave and carry out his duties of giving life to everyone. Lord Surya assured both that he will fulfill his purpose as given by them both to keep balance in the universe according to the laws of nature and not go against any law as he knows from the knowledge that they both have implanted inside him, which may put the universe in a catastrophe. Next, Tara had assumed the form of Goddess Shodashi to provide all forms of greenery and plants to the world. Devi Shodashi then placed a bamboo inside the earth and poured one drop of water from her waterpot, this gave birth to all plant life and then all forests, trees, plants and nature grew. Iconography Kali and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine Shiva in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a garland of severed human heads. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in Pratyalidha posture (in which the left foot is forward). Her Bhairava (consort) is Akshobhya, a Bodhisattva who is in the form of a cobra coiled around Tara's matted hair. She wears a crown made of skulls of five meditating Buddhas. Tara has eight forms called Ashta Tara and the names are Ekajata, Ugratara, Mahogra, Kameshwari, Chamunda, Neela Saraswati, Vajra, and Bhadrakali. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or Tantrika because of her maternal instincts. Like Kali, furthermore, Tara in her Hindu context enjoys demons blood. In her hymn of a hundred names from the Mundamala-tantra, she is called \\"She Who Likes Blood\\", \\"She Who Is Smeared with Blood\\" and \\"She Who Enjoys Blood Sacrifice\\". Tara can be distinguished visually from Kali primarily via her implements. Four armed, she carries a sacrificial sword, a severed head or skull cup, a blue lotus and a flaying knife. Kali never holds a lotus or a flaying knife. Tarapith temple Maa Tara Temple The murti at the Tara Ma mandir in the village of Tarapith, a highly important Tantric site for Bengali Shaktas (and highly contested as to whether or not it is truly a Shakti Pitha; scholarly evidence points towards yes), is mostly covered by Garlands of flowers. Some people believe that eyeball of Sati fell here thus this pith is called tara pith because Bengali people named eyeball as chokher moni and another name of moni is chokher tara. There are two Tara images in the sanctum. The stone image of Tara depicted as a mother suckling Shiva – the \\"primordial image\\" (seen in the inset of the fierce form of the image of Tara) is camouflaged by a three feet metal image, that the devotee normally sees. It represents Tara in her fiery form with four arms, wearing a garland of skulls and a protruding tongue. Crowned with a silver crown and with flowing hair, the outer image wrapped in a sari and decked in marigold garlands with a silver umbrella over its head. The forehead of the metal image is adorned with red sindoor (vermilion). Most devotees will not have a chance to see the actual stone image, as there are only 15 or so minutes of Darshan or viewing of the stone at 4:30 am when the temple opens and only the first lucky few will be admitted into the inner shrine (the Garbhagriha) to see the stone. Goddess Tara, Bihar c. 9th century. Unlike most Indian villages and towns, the smashan or cremation ground is not situated on the periphery of the village. As cremation grounds are seen to be polluting, most Indian smashans are located far from the center of town. Both the Tarapith mandir and smashan are very close (within 100 yards or so) to the center of the town and near Dwarka River. It is said that Tara Ma's footprints are preserved in the smashan; this is a common theme in Hinduism, where deities or their especially holy followers are said to leave their footprints in rocks. Many Sadhus and Tantrikas live in the smashan, some with permanent huts as residences. The smashan is filled with dogs, traditionally polluting animals who were said to share food with the Vamamarga saint Bamakhepa, whose samādhi or tomb is located next door to the main Tarapith temple. Tara in Buddhism Tara () in Buddhism, is a female Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism who appears as a female Buddha in Vajrayana Buddhism. She is known as the \\"mother of liberation\\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. Some researchers believe Paranasabari is another name for Hindu Goddess Tara.

At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical. The marginal rate of substitution is one of the three factors from marginal productivity, the others being marginal rates of transformation and marginal productivity of a factor. As the slope of indifference curve Under the standard assumption of neoclassical economics that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an indifference curve (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the implicit derivative. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is quantified, the marginal rate of substitution of good or service Y for good or service X (MRSxy) is also equivalent to the marginal utility of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally, :MRS_{xy}=-m_\\\\mathrm{indif}=-(dy/dx) \\\\, :MRS_{xy}=MU_x/MU_y \\\\, It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an indifference curve), the marginal utility of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up. For example, if the MRSxy = 2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X. As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution. Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve, :\\\\ MRS_{xy} \\\\geq 0 Simple mathematical analysis Assume the consumer utility function is defined by U(x,y), where U is consumer utility, x and y are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via partial differentiation, as follows. Also, note that: :\\\\ MU_x=\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x :\\\\ MU_y=\\\\partial U/\\\\partial y where \\\\ MU_x is the marginal utility with respect to good x and \\\\ MU_y is the marginal utility with respect to good y. By taking the total differential of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results: :\\\\ dU=(\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x)dx + (\\\\partial U/\\\\partial y)dy , or substituting from above, :\\\\ dU= MU_xdx + MU_ydy , or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good x, :\\\\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x\\\\frac{dx}{dx}+ MU_y\\\\frac{dy}{dx}, that is, :\\\\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x + MU_y\\\\frac{dy}{dx}. Through any point on the indifference curve, dU/dx = 0, because U = c, where c is a constant. It follows from the above equation that: :: 0 = MU_x + MU_y\\\\frac{dy}{dx}, or rearranging :-\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest. That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities: :\\\\ MRS_{xy}= MU_x/MU_y.\\\\, . \\\\---- When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line, therefore, with m representing slope: :\\\\ m_\\\\mathrm{indif}=m_\\\\mathrm{budget} :\\\\ -(MRS_{xy})=-(P_x/P_y) :\\\\ MRS_{xy}=P_x/P_y Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line, :\\\\ MU_x/MU_y=P_x/P_y :\\\\ MU_x/P_x=MU_y/P_y This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer's budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility). Using MRS to determine Convexity When analyzing the utility function of consumer's in terms of determining if they are convex or not. For the horizon of two goods we can apply a quick derivative test to determine if our consumer's preferences are convex. :\\\\ \\\\frac{dMRS_{xy}}{dx}<0 \\\\text{ Strict Convexity of Utility Function} :\\\\ \\\\frac{dMRS_{xy}}{dx}=0 \\\\text{ Weak Convexity of Utility Function} :\\\\ \\\\frac{dMRS_{xy}}{dx}>0 \\\\text{ Non Convexity of Utility Function} For more than two variables, the use of the Hessian matrix is required.

He wrote the Preamble to the United States Constitution and has been called the \\"Penman of the Constitution.\\"Documents from the Constitutional Convention and the Continental Congress. Library of Congress. In an era when most Americans thought of themselves as citizens of their respective states, Morris advanced the idea of being a citizen of a single union of states. He was also one of the most outspoken opponents of slavery among all of those who were present at the Constitutional Convention. He represented New York in the United States Senate from 1800 to 1803. Morris was born into a wealthy landowning family in what is now New York City. After attending King's College (now Columbia), he studied law under Judge William Smith and earned admission to the bar. He was elected to the New York Provincial Congress before serving in the Continental Congress. After losing re-election to Congress, he moved to Philadelphia and became the assistant U.S. superintendent of finance. He represented Pennsylvania at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where he advocated a strong central government. He served on the committee that wrote the final draft of the United States Constitution. After the ratification of the Constitution, Morris served as Minister Plenipotentiary to France. He criticized the French Revolution and the execution of Marie Antoinette. Morris returned to the United States in 1798 and won election to the Senate in 1800, affiliating with the Federalist Party. He lost re-election in 1803. After leaving the Senate, he served as chairman of the Erie Canal Commission. Early life Coat of Arms of Gouverneur Morris Morris was born on January 31, 1752, the son of Lewis Morris Jr. (1698–1762) and his second wife, Sarah Gouverneur (1714–1786). Morris' first name derived from his mother's surname; she was from a Huguenot family that had first moved to Holland, and then to New Amsterdam. According to Abigail Adams, Morris' first name was pronounced \\"governeer\\". In Dutch and in French, Gouverneur means \\"Governor\\". Morris' half-brother Lewis Morris was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Another half-brother, Staats Long Morris, was a loyalist and major-general in the British army during the American Revolution, and his grandfather, Lewis Morris, was the chief justice of New York and British governor of New Jersey. His nephew, Lewis Richard Morris, served in the Vermont legislature and in the United States Congress. His grandnephew was William M. Meredith, United States Secretary of the Treasury under Zachary Taylor. Morris' father, Lewis Morris, was a wealthy landowner and judge. Gouverneur Morris was born on the family estate, Morrisania, on the north side of the Harlem river, which was at the time in Westchester County, but is now part of the Bronx. Morris, a gifted scholar, enrolled at King's College, now Columbia University in New York City, at age 12. He graduated in 1768 and received a Master's degree in 1771. He studied law with Judge William Smith and attained admission to the bar in 1775. Career On May 8, 1775,ANB \\"Gouverneur Morris\\" Morris was elected to represent his family household in southern Westchester County (now Bronx County), in the New York Provincial Congress. As a member of the congress, he, along with most of his fellow delegates, concentrated on turning the colony into an independent state. However, his advocacy of independence brought him into conflict with his family, as well as with his mentor, William Smith, who had abandoned the patriot cause when it pressed toward independence. Morris was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1777–78. After the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, the British seized New York City. His mother, a loyalist, gave his family's estate, located across the Harlem River from Manhattan, to the British for military use. Continental Congress Morris was appointed as a delegate to the Continental Congress and took his seat in Congress on 28 January 1778. He was selected to a committee in charge of coordinating reforms of the military with George Washington. After witnessing the army encamped at Valley Forge, he was so appalled by the conditions of the troops that he became the spokesman for the Continental Army in congress and subsequently helped enact substantial reforms in its training, methods, and financing. He also signed the Articles of Confederation in 1778, and was its youngest signer. In 1778, when the Conway Cabal was at its peak, some members of the Continental Congress attempted a no-confidence vote against George Washington. If it had succeeded, then George Washington would have been court- martialed and dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. At that time, Gouverneur Morris cast the decisive tie-breaking vote in favor of keeping George Washington as Commander-in-Chief.\\"The True George Washington\\", written by Paul Leicester Ford, published by J. Lippincott, the printing of the year 1900 Lawyer and merchant Wooden leg of Gouverneur Morris. New- York Historical Society. In 1779, he was defeated for re-election to Congress, largely because his advocacy of a strong central government was at odds with the decentralist views prevalent in New York. Defeated in his home state, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to work as a lawyer and merchant. In 1780, Morris had a carriage accident in Philadelphia, and his left leg was amputated below the knee. Despite an automatic exemption from military duty because of his handicap and his service in the legislature, he joined a special \\"briefs\\" club for the protection of New York City, a forerunner of the modern New York Guard.  Public office  Robert Morris. Charles Willson Peale, 1783. In Philadelphia, he was appointed assistant superintendent of finance of the United States, serving under Robert Morris. He was selected as a Pennsylvania delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. During the Convention, he was a friend and ally of George Washington and others who favored a strong central government. Morris was elected to serve on a committee of five (chaired by William Samuel Johnson) who drafted the final language of the proposed constitution. Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her 1966 book Miracle at Philadelphia, called Morris the committee's \\"amanuensis,\\" meaning that it was his pen that was responsible for most of the draft, as well as its final polished form.Bowen, Catherine Drinker. Miracle at Philadelphia. 1986 edition. p. 236. It is said by some that Morris was \\"an aristocrat to the core,\\" who believed that \\"there never was, nor ever will be a civilized Society without an Aristocracy\\". It is also alleged that he thought that common people were incapable of self-government because he feared that the poor would sell their votes to the rich and that voting should be restricted to property owners. Duff Cooper wrote of Morris that although he \\"had warmly espoused the cause of the colonists in the American War of Independence, he retained a cynically aristocratic view of life and a profound contempt for democratic theories.\\" Morris opposed admitting new western states on an equal basis with the existing eastern states, fearing that the interior wilderness could not furnish \\"enlightened\\" national statesmen.Bowen. p. 178. Madison's summary of Morris' speech at the Convention, on 11 July 1787, said that his view \\"relative to the Western Country had not changed his opinion on that head. Among other objections it must be apparent they would not be able to furnish men equally enlightened, to share in the administration of our common interests.\\" His reason given for that was regional: \\"The Busy haunts of men not the remote wilderness, was the proper school of political Talents. If the Western people get the power into their hands they will ruin the Atlantic interests.\\" In this fear, he turned out to be in the minority. Jon Elster has suggested that Morris' attempt to limit the future power of the West was a strategic move designed to limit the power of slaveholding states, because Morris believed that slavery would predominate in new Western states.Jon Elster, Securities Against Misrule, (2013), pp. 79–80 At the convention he gave more speeches than any other delegate, a total of 173. As a matter of principle, he often vigorously defended the right of anyone to practice his chosen religion without interference, and he argued to include such language in the Constitution. Views on slavery Hintermeister, 1925. Gouverneur Morris was one of the few delegates at the Philadelphia Convention who spoke openly against domestic slavery. According to James Madison, who took notes at the Convention, Morris spoke openly against slavery on 8 August 1787, saying that it was incongruous to say that a slave was both a man and property at the same time: :He [Morris] never would concur in upholding domestic slavery. It was a nefarious institution. It was the curse of heaven on the states where it prevailed. Compare the free regions of the Middle States, where a rich & noble cultivation marks the prosperity & happiness of the people, with the misery & poverty which overspread the barren wastes of Va. Maryd. & the other States having slaves. ... Proceed southwardly, and every step you take, through the great regions of slaves, presents a desert increasing with the increasing proportion of these wretched beings. :Upon what principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in the representation? Are they men? Then make them citizens, and let them vote. Are they property? Why, then, is no other property included? The Houses in this city [Philadelphia] are worth more than all the wretched slaves which cover the rice swamps of South Carolina. According to Madison, Morris felt that the U.S. Constitution's purpose was to protect the rights of humanity and that to promote slavery was incongruous with it: :The admission of slaves into the Representation when fairly explained comes to this: that the inhabitant of Georgia and S. C. who goes to the Coast of Africa, and in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity tears away his fellow creatures from their dearest connections & damns them to the most cruel bondages, shall have more votes in a Govt. instituted for protection of the rights of mankind, than the Citizen of Pa. or N. Jersey who views with a laudable horror, so nefarious a practice. Minister Plenipotentiary to France Gouverneur Morris portrait bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon, 1789, Paris. He went to France on business in 1789 and served as Minister Plenipotentiary to France from 1792 to 1794. His diaries during that time have become a valuable chronicle of the French Revolution, capturing much of the turbulence and violence of that era, as well as documenting his affairs with women there. Unlike Thomas Jefferson, Morris was far more critical of the French Revolution and considerably more sympathetic to the deposed queen consort, Marie Antoinette.Antonia Fraser, Marie Antoinette: The Journey, (2002), p. 476; Vincent Cronin, Louis and Antoinette, (1974), p. 295. Commenting on her grandfather's sometimes Tory-minded outlook of the world, Anne Cary Morris said, \\"His creed was rather to form the government to suit the condition, character, manners, and habits of the people. In France this opinion led him to take the monarchical view, firmly believing that a republican form of government would not suit the French character.\\"Anne Cary Morris, ed.,\\"The Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris; Minister of the United States to France; Member of the Constitutional Convention, etc.,\\" (1888), Vol. I, p. 15. The \\"French character\\" in the Age of Revolution was one of two socio-political extremes: absolutism and autocracy. Morris was \\"the only foreign representative who remained in his post throughout the worst days of the Terror.\\" On one occasion, when Morris \\"found himself the centre of a hostile mob in favour of hanging him on the nearest lamp-post, he unfastened his wooden leg, brandished it above his head, and proclaimed himself an American who had lost a limb fighting for liberty\\", upon which \\"[t]he mob's suspicions melted into enthusiastic cheers\\" (even though, as noted above, Morris had in fact lost his leg as a result of a carriage accident). While Morris was minister, Marquis de Lafayette, who had been an important participant in the American Revolution, was exiled from France and his family imprisoned, and Thomas Paine, another important figure, was arrested and imprisoned in France. Morris' efforts on their behalf have been criticized as desultory and insufficient. After a change of the French government, and after Morris was replaced as minister, his successor, James Monroe, was able to secure Paine's release. United States Senate He returned to the United States in 1798 and was elected in April 1800, as a Federalist, to the United States Senate, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Watson. He served from May 3, 1800 to March 3, 1803 and was defeated for re-election in February 1803. Later career On 4 July 1806, he was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. After leaving the U.S. Senate, he served as Chairman of the Erie Canal Commission from 1810 to 1813. The Erie Canal helped to transform New York City into a financial capital, the possibilities of which were apparent to Morris when he said \\"the proudest empire in Europe is but a bubble compared to what America will be, must be, in the course of two centuries, perhaps of one.\\" He was one of the three men who drew up the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which laid out the Manhattan street grid.Morris, Gouverneur, De Witt, Simeon, and Rutherford, John (March 1811) \\"Remarks Of The Commissioners For Laying Out Streets And Roads In The City Of New York, Under The Act Of April 3, 1807\\". Accessed May 7, 2008. Morris was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Personal life Morris's home in 1897 Until he married late in life, Morris' diary tells of a series of affairs. His lovers included the French novelist Adelaide Filleul and the American poet and novelist Sarah Wentworth Apthorp Morton. In 1809, at age 57, he married 35-year-old Ann Cary Randolph (1774–1837), nicknamed \\"Nancy\\", who was the daughter of Ann Cary and Thomas Mann Randolph Sr., and the sister of Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. was the husband of Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph. Nancy lived near Farmville, Virginia, with her sister Judith and Judith's husband Richard Randolph on a plantation called Bizarre. In April 1793, Richard Randolph and Nancy were accused of murdering a newborn baby which was said to be Nancy's; presumably she had been having an affair with Richard. Richard stood trial; he was defended by Patrick Henry and John Marshall, who obtained an acquittal. Richard Randolph died suddenly in 1796; both sisters were suspected, but nothing was proven.Kirschke, Gouverneur Morris, p. 263 Nancy remained at Bizarre after her brother-in-law's death but was asked to leave by Judith in 1805.Kierner, Scandal at Bizarre, pp. 91–92 Nancy traveled north and lived in Connecticut before agreeing in 1809 to work as a housekeeper for Morris, whom she had known previously. They soon decided to marry; Morris was apparently undisturbed by the rumors that had caused Nancy to leave Virginia.Kirschke, Gouverneur Morris, pp. 263–264 By all accounts, their marriage was a happy one; they had a son, Gouverneur Morris Jr., who went on to a long career as a railroad executive. Morris died on November 6, 1816, after causing himself internal injuries and an infection while using a piece of whalebone as a catheter to attempt clearing a blockage in his urinary tract. He died at the family estate, Morrisania, and was buried at St. Ann's Church in The Bronx.Lehman College Art Gallery Descendants Morris's great-grandson, also named Gouverneur Morris (1876–1953), was an author of pulp novels and short stories during the early twentieth century. Several of his works were adapted into films, including the famous Lon Chaney film The Penalty in 1920. Legacy Morris established himself as an important landowner in northern New York, where the Town of Gouverneur and Village of Gouverneur in St. Lawrence County are named after him. In 1943, a United States liberty ship SS Gouverneur Morris was launched. She was scrapped in 1974.

They are named after the German statistician Ernst Engel (1821–1896), who was the first to investigate this relationship between goods expenditure and income systematically in 1857. The best-known single result from the article is Engel's law which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment. Shape Graphically, the Engel curve is represented in the first quadrant of the Cartesian coordinate system. Income is shown on the horizontal axis and the quantity demanded for the selected good or service is shown on the vertical. The shapes of Engel curves depend on many demographic variables and other consumer characteristics. A good's Engel curve reflects its income elasticity and indicates whether the good is an inferior, normal, or luxury good. Empirical Engel curves are close to linear for some goods, and highly nonlinear for others. For normal goods, the Engel curve has a positive gradient. That is, as income increases, the quantity demanded increases. Amongst normal goods, there are two possibilities. Although the Engel curve remains upward sloping in both cases, it bends toward the X-axis for necessities and towards the Y-axis for luxury goods. For inferior goods, the Engel curve has a negative gradient. That means that as the consumer has more income, they will buy less of the inferior good because they are able to purchase better goods. For goods with a Marshallian demand function generated from a utility function of Gorman polar form, the Engel curve is a straight line. Many Engel curves feature saturation properties in that their slope tends toward infinity at high income levels, which suggests that there exists an absolute limit on how much expenditure on a good will rise as household income increases. This saturation property has been linked to slowdowns in the growth of demand for some sectors in the economy, causing major changes in an economy's sectoral composition to take place. Other properties When considering a system of Engel curves, the adding-up theorem dictates that the sum of all total expenditure elasticities, when weighted by the corresponding budget share, must add up to unity. This rules out the possibility of saturation being a general property of Engel curves across all goods as this would imply that the income elasticity of all goods approaches zero starting from a certain level of income. The adding-up restriction stems from the assumption that consumption always takes place at the upper boundary of the household's opportunity set, which is only fulfilled if the household cannot completely satisfy all its wants within the boundaries of the opportunity set. Other scholars argue that an upper saturation level exists for all types of goods and services. Applications In microeconomics Engel curves are used for equivalence scale calculations and related welfare comparisons, and determine properties of demand systems such as aggregability and rank. Engel curves have also been used to study how the changing industrial composition of growing economies are linked to the changes in the composition of household demand. In trade theory, one explanation of inter- industry trade has been the hypothesis that countries with similar income levels possess similar preferences for goods and services (the Lindner hypothesis), which suggests that understanding how the composition of household demand changes with income may play an important role in determining global trade patterns. Engel curves are also of great relevance in the measurement of inflation, and tax policy. Problems=Low explanatory power Heteroscedasticity is a well known problem in the estimation of Engel curves: as income rises the difference between actual observation and the estimated expenditure level tends to increase dramatically. Engel curve and other demand function models still fail to explain most of the observed variation in individual consumption behavior. As a result, many scholars acknowledge that influences other than current prices and current total expenditure must be systematically modeled if even the broad pattern of demand is to be explained in a theoretically coherent and empirically robust way. For example, some success has been achieved in understanding how social status concerns have influenced household expenditure on highly visible goods. Accounting for their shape No established theory exists that can explain the observed shape of Engel curves and their associated income elasticity values. Ernst Engel himself argued that households possessed a hierarchy of wants that determined the shape of Engel curves. As household income rises some motivations become more prominent in household expenditure as the more basic wants that dominate consumption patterns at low-income levels, such as hunger, eventually become satiated at higher income levels.

He was one of the leading U.S. critics of the 20th century who analyzed the contemporary cultural, social, and political implications of literature. With his wife Diana Trilling (née Rubin), whom he married in 1929, he was a member of the New York Intellectuals and contributor to the Partisan Review. Personal and academic life Lionel Mordecai Trilling was born in Queens, New York, the son of Fannie (née Cohen), who was from London, and David Trilling, a tailor from Bialystok in Poland. His family was Jewish. In 1921, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, and, at age 16, entered Columbia University, thus beginning a lifelong association with the university. He joined the Boar's Head Society and wrote for the Morningside literary journal. In 1925, he graduated from Columbia College, and, in 1926, earned a Master of Arts degree at the university (his master's essay was entitled Theodore Edward Hook: his life and work). He then taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and at Hunter College. In 1929 he married Diana Rubin, and the two began a lifelong literary partnership. In 1932 he returned to Columbia to pursue his doctoral degree in English literature and to teach literature. He earned his doctorate in 1938 with a dissertation about Matthew Arnold that he later published. He was promoted to assistant professor the following year, becoming Columbia's first tenured Jewish professor in its English department. He was promoted to full professor in 1948. Trilling became the George Edward Woodberry Professor of Literature and Criticism in 1965. He was a popular instructor and for thirty years taught Columbia's Colloquium on Important Books, a course about the relationship between literature and cultural history, with Jacques Barzun. His students included Lucien Carr, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Steven Marcus, John Hollander, Richard Howard, Cynthia Ozick, Carolyn Gold Heilbrun, George Stade, David Lehman, Leon Wieseltier, Louis Menand, Robert Leonard Moore Author of Compendiary (2 v., 2007–2009) and Norman Podhoretz. Trilling was the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University for academic year 1969–70. In 1972, he was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities to deliver the first Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, described as \\"the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.\\"Jefferson Lecturers at NEH Website (Retrieved January 22, 2009). Trilling was a senior Fellow of the Kenyon School of English and subsequently a senior Fellow of the Indiana School of Letters. Partisan Review and the \\"New York Intellectuals\\" In 1937, Trilling joined the recently revived magazine Partisan Review, a Marxist, but anti-Stalinist, journal founded by William Philips and Philip Rahv in 1934.Longstaff, S. A. “New York Intellectuals”, Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism. The Partisan Review was associated with the New York Intellectuals – Trilling, his wife Diana Trilling, Lionel Abel, Hannah Arendt, William Barrett, Daniel Bell, Saul Bellow, Richard Thomas Chase, F. W. Dupee, Leslie Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Clement Greenberg, Elizabeth Hardwick, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Hilton Kramer, Steven Marcus, Mary McCarthy, Dwight Macdonald, William Phillips, Norman Podhoretz, Harold Rosenberg, Isaac Rosenfeld, Delmore Schwartz, and Susan Sontag – who emphasized the influence of history and culture upon authors and literature. The New York Intellectuals distanced themselves from the New Critics. In his preface to the essays collection, Beyond Culture (1965), Trilling defended the New York Intellectuals: \\"As a group, it is busy and vivacious about ideas, and, even more, about attitudes. Its assiduity constitutes an authority. The structure of our society is such that a class of this kind is bound by organic filaments to groups less culturally fluent that are susceptible to its influence.\\" Critical and literary works Trilling wrote one novel, The Middle of the Journey (1947), about an affluent Communist couple's encounter with a Communist defector. (Trilling later acknowledged that the character was inspired by his Columbia College compatriot and contemporary Whittaker Chambers ). His short stories include \\"The Other Margaret.\\" Otherwise, he wrote essays and reviews in which he reflected on literature's ability to challenge the morality and conventions of the culture. Critic David Daiches said of Trilling, \\"Mr. Trilling likes to move out and consider the implications, the relevance for culture, for civilization, for the thinking man today, of each particular literary phenomenon which he contemplates, and this expansion of the context gives him both his moments of his greatest perceptions, and his moments of disconcerting generalization.\\" Trilling published two complex studies of authors Matthew Arnold (1939) and E. M. Forster (1943), both written in response to a concern with \\"the tradition of humanistic thought and the intellectual middle class which believes it continues this tradition.\\"Trilling, Lionel, et al., The Situation in American Writing: A Symposium Partisan Review, Volume 6 5 (1939). His first collection of essays, The Liberal Imagination, was published in 1950, followed by the collections The Opposing Self (1955), focusing on the conflict between self- definition and the influence of culture, Freud and the Crisis of Our Culture (1955), A Gathering of Fugitives (1956), and Beyond Culture (1965), a collection of essays concerning modern literary and cultural attitudes toward selfhood. In Sincerity and Authenticity (1972), he explores the ideas of the moral self in post-Enlightenment Western civilization. He wrote the introduction to The Selected Letters of John Keats (1951), in which he defended Keats’s notion of negative capability, as well as the introduction, “George Orwell and the Politics of Truth,\\" to the 1952 reissue of George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia. In 2008, Columbia University Press published an unfinished novel that Trilling had abandoned in the late 1940s. Scholar Geraldine Murphy discovered the half-finished novel among Trilling's papers archived at Columbia University.\\"Synopses & Reviews\\": The Journey Abandoned Powell's Books, 2008. Retrieved 2008-05-27. Trilling's novel, The Journey Abandoned: The Unfinished Novel, is set in the 1930s and involves a young protagonist, Vincent Hammell, who seeks to write a biography of an older poet, Jorris Buxton. Buxton's character is loosely based on the nineteenth century Romantic poet Walter Savage Landor. Writer and critic Cynthia Ozick praised the novel's \\"skillful narrative\\" and \\"complex characters\\", writing, \\"The Journey Abandoned is a crowded gallery of carefully delineated portraits whose innerness is divulged partly through dialogue but far more extensively in passages of cannily analyzed insight.\\" Politics Trilling's politics have been strongly debated and, like much else in his thought, may be described as \\"complex.\\" An often-quoted summary of Trilling's politics is that he wished to:1974 foreword to The Liberal Imagination, quoted and cited as \\"often repeated\\" in Of ideologies, Trilling wrote, \\"Ideology is not the product of thought; it is the habit or the ritual of showing respect for certain formulas to which, for various reasons having to do with emotional safety, we have very strong ties and of whose meaning and consequences in actuality we have no clear understanding.\\" Politically, Trilling was a noted member of the anti- Stalinist left, a position that he maintained to the end of his life.Writing in the 1974 foreword to his 1950 collection The Liberal Imagination, (shortly before his 1975 death) he wrote that the essays were \\"with reference to a particular political-cultural situation, ... [namely] the commitment that a large segment of the intelligentsia of the West gave to the degraded version of Marxism known as Stalinism.\\" Liberal In his earlier years, Trilling wrote for and in the liberal tradition, explicitly rejecting conservatism; from the preface to his The Liberal Imagination, 1950 (emphasis added to the much-quoted last line): Neoconservative Some, both conservative and liberal, argue that Trilling's views became steadily more conservative over time. Trilling has been embraced as sympathetic to neoconservativism by neoconservatives (such as Norman Podhoretz, the former editor of Commentary). However, this embrace was unrequited, Trilling criticized the New Left (as he had the Old Left) but did not embrace neoconservativism. His wife, Diana Trilling, claimed that neoconservatives were mistaken in thinking that Trilling shared their views. “I am of the firmest belief that he would never have become a neoconservative,” she announced in her memoir of their marriage, “The Beginning of the Journey,” “nothing in his thought supports the sectarianism of the neoconservative.\\"\\"Regrets Only: Lionel Trilling and his discontents\\" by Louis Menand, The New Yorker, September 22, 2008 The extent to which Trilling may be identified with neoconservativism continues to be contentious, forming a point of debate.Rodden, 2000 Moderate Trilling has alternatively been characterized as solidly moderate, as evidenced by many statements, ranging from the very title of his novel, The Middle of the Journey, to a central passage from the novel: writes \\"several reviewers quoted [this passage] as Trilling's central point\\" Along the same lines, in reply to a taunt by Richard Sennett, \\"You have no position; you are always in between,\\" Trilling replied, \\"Between is the only honest place to be.\\"Quoted in Sennett essay in Works by Trilling Fiction * * (Selected by Diana Trilling and published posthumously.) * (Published posthumously) Non-fiction and essays * (Based on Trilling's Ph.D. thesis.)   * (A collection of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures given at Harvard in 1969.) * * (Published posthumously) * (Published posthumously.) * (Published posthumously.) * *Adam Kirsch, ed.

Its plot follows a group of teenagers in South Florida who enact a murder plot against their mutual friend who has emotionally, physically, and sexually abused them for years. The film is based on the murder of Bobby Kent, and its screenplay was adapted by David McKenna (under the pseudonym Zachary Long) and Roger Pullis from the book Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge by Jim Schutze. Filming took place in southern Florida in the summer of 2000. Bully was given a limited release in the United States on July 14, 2001, and met with mixed critical responses, though many critics noted the film's disturbing and straightforward handling of youth crime and murder. Plot South Florida high school dropouts Ali Willis and Lisa Connelly befriend Bobby Kent and Marty Puccio, employees at a local deli. The four all go out on a double date. While in a parked car, Ali performs oral sex on Bobby, while Lisa and Marty have sex in the back seat. Lisa later learns she is pregnant, but is afraid that the child is Bobby's instead of Marty's, since Bobby raped her after beating Marty unconscious. Bobby emotionally and physically abuses Marty, who puts up with his violent tendencies. On one occasion, Bobby rapes Ali while trying to force her to watch gay male pornography with him. Lisa later tells Marty that everyone suspects Bobby is attracted to him. Marty reveals to Lisa that the abuse has been going on since they were boys, starting with Marty taking drugs at an early age, which Marty thinks that Bobby has been using to take advantage of him. Marty and Bobby later go to a gay bar, where Marty is told to strip down to his underwear and dance for money, while Bobby takes pleasure in his humiliation. Lisa eventually proposes that the group murder Bobby. Ali recruits her new boyfriend, the pot-smoking and acid-dropping Donny, and her troubled friend, Heather Swallers, who has recently been released from rehab; Lisa recruits her cousin, the shy and nerdy Derek Dzvirko. They initially plan to kill Bobby with a gun stolen from Lisa's mother. Ali and Lisa take Bobby to the Everglades, with the plan that Lisa will shoot him while he has sex with Ali, but Lisa finds herself unable to do it. Realizing they need help, the group hire a supposed \\"hitman\\", Derek Kaufman, who is in actuality a tough- talking young man several years older than them. With Kaufman's help, they orchestrate a new plan: They all drive to a remote canal, where Ali again lures Bobby with sex. Heather haphazardly initiates a signal to begin the murder, and Donny stabs Bobby in the back of the neck. Horrified by the violence, Ali, Heather, and Dzvirko run back to Ali's car. Bobby begs for mercy, but Marty stabs him in the stomach, disemboweling him, before slitting his throat. Kaufman proceeds to bludgeon Bobby with a baseball bat. Lisa witnesses it all, never turning away. They dump Bobby, still clinging to life, in the swamp, leaving him to drown, and presume alligators will consume his corpse. Marty later realizes that he left the sheath to his diving knife at the canal. They go to retrieve the sheath, and check on the corpse, which is now being eaten by crabs. Lisa, Dzvirko, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong, since they did not directly participate in Bobby's actual death. Lisa decides to dispose of the knife, which is the only evidence linking them to the crime. Unable to maintain the secret, Dzvirko and Lisa reveal to their other friends what they've done, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip to the media, alerting them to Bobby's death. Lisa calls Kaufman and speaks to his younger brother, who says that Kaufman has already been arrested for the murder. Eventually, all the teenagers turn themselves in, with the exception of Marty, who is subsequently arrested. Some time later, the group appear in court, wearing prison jumpsuits, with Lisa visibly pregnant by this time. Marty and Donny begin to argue, leading the others to join in as they each respectively deny their culpability in front of an onlooking courtroom. Title cards reveal their convictions, with Derek Kaufman, Donny, and Lisa receiving life sentences, Ali receiving 40 years, Derek Dzvirko receiving 11, Heather receiving seven, and Marty being sentenced to death. CastProduction=Basis The film is based on the July 15, 1993 murder of Bobby Kent at a remote area in Weston, Florida, south of Alligator Alley.State of Florida vs. Marty Puccio, CASE NO. 86,242 (official court documents). Florida State University Archives Four of the convicted teens, known as the Broward County Seven, were released after serving brief prison terms. Today, only three are still serving prison sentences. The book, Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge by Jim Schutze was released in 1998. The film includes two title cards that reveal how several of the perpetrators appealed their sentences and the results of those actions. The actual co-perpetrators of the murder were convicted and sentenced as follows: * Martin Joseph \\"Marty\\" Puccio, Jr. First-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Sentenced to death by electrocution on July 27, 1995; commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years on November 20, 1997. Currently incarcerated at the Desoto Annex in Arcadia, Florida. * Heather June Swallers Second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first- degree murder. Was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on May 12, 1995; she received a lighter sentence than the others because, unlike Derek Dzvirko, she did not attempt to lie on the witness stand. Released February 14, 1998. * Derek George Dzvirko Second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first- degree murder. He was originally sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on May 12, 1995 but received four extra years for trying to lie on the witness stand. Released October 1, 1999. * Alice Jean \\"Ali\\" Willis (aka Alice Jean Chapman, Alice Jean Slay) Second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. Sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment on May 19, 1995; reduced on appeal to 17 years for the murder charge and 15 years for the conspiracy charge. Released on Supervised Probation September 16, 2001 (the movie notes she will be under those probationary terms for 40 years). Currently residing in Belpre, Ohio. Probation set to terminate September 15, 2041. * Donald Daniel \\"Donny\\" Semenec, Jr. Second-degree murder. Sentenced to life in prison on May 17, 1995. Two weeks after his conviction in the murder of Bobby Kent, Donny received another 14-month sentence for bringing drugs into jail and cocaine possession stemming from a 1994 case. Currently incarcerated at the Lake Correctional Institution in Clermont, Florida. * Derek Leon Kaufman First- degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Sentenced to life plus 30 years' imprisonment on June 12, 1995. On November 15, 1994, Kaufman received a 30-month sentence for trafficking in stolen property, stemming from a February 1993 case. , he was incarcerated at the Mayo Correctional Institution in Mayo, Florida. * Lisa Marie Connelly Second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Sentenced to life plus five years' imprisonment on July 21, 1995; reduced on appeal to 22 years. Released on February 3, 2004. Lisa delivered her and Puccio's daughter in the Broward County Jail during her incarceration. Filming Principal photography of Bully began August 21, 2000, in southern Florida. Critical reception Bully received mixed reviews from critics and has a \\"Rotten\\" rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews with an average score of 5.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states \\"With its lingering shots of naked teenage bodies, Bully feels more sordidly exploitative than realistic.\\" The film holds a score of 45 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 26 critics indicating 'Mixed or average reviews'.\\"Bully\\". Metacritic. Retrieved November 30, 2014. Roger Ebert was one of the film's notable admirers and gave the film four out of four stars and stated in his review \\"Larry Clark's Bully calls the bluff of movies that pretend to be about murder but are really about entertainment. His film has all the sadness and shabbiness, all the mess and cruelty and thoughtless stupidity of the real thing...If the director doesn't have a strong personal feeling about material like this, he shouldn't be making movies about it...Clark is not some objectified, outside adult observer making an after-school special, but an artist who has made a leap into this teenage mindscape...I believe Bully is a masterpiece on its own terms, a frightening indictment of a society that offers absolutely nothing to some of its children—and an indictment of the children, who lack the imagination and courage to try to escape. Bobby and his killers deserve one another.\\"Roger Ebert (July 20, 2001). \\"Bully\\". Soundtrack * JT Money feat.

Along with flourishing traditional forms such as the bombard-binou pair and fest-noz ensembles incorporating other additional instruments, it has also branched out into numerous subgenres.  Traditional Breton music  The Goadec sisters Traditional Breton folk music includes a variety of vocal and instrumental styles. Purely traditional musicians became the heroes of the roots revival in the second half of the 20th century, notably the Goadec sisters (Maryvonne, Thasie, and Eugénie). At the end of the 19th century, the vicomte Theodore Hersart de la Villemarqué's collection of largely nationalistic Breton songs, Barzaz Breiz, was also influential, and was partially responsible for preserving Breton traditions.See Fest Noz Spezet.  Vocal music  Les Traines Meuriennes singing call and response at Mill Góll 2007 in Rennes Kan ha diskan (roughly translated as call and response singing) is probably the most common type of Breton vocal music, and is the most typical style to accompany dance music. It has become perhaps the most integral part of the Breton roots revival, and was the first genre of Breton music to gain some mainstream success, both in Brittany and abroad. The lead singer is the kaner, and the second singer is the diskaner. The kaner sings a phrase, and the diskaner sings the last few lines with the kaner, then repeats it alone until the same last few lines, when the kaner again joins in. The phrase's repetition is changed slightly in each execution. Kan ha diskan can be songs about any subject, but must meet one of a number of a meters used in folk dances, mostly line or round. Vocables, or nonsense syllables (typically tra la la la leh no), are sometimes used to drag out lines. Usually a kan ha diskan lasts from 5 to 20 minutes. In addition to the Goadecs, the singer Loeiz Ropars was largely responsible for maintaining kan ha diskan's vitality in the middle of the 20th century, and the 1960s and 1970s revivalists drew largely on his work. They also venerated performers like Ar breudeur Morvan and Les soeurs Goadec/Ar c'hoarezed Goadeg. During the folk revival, aspiring musicians sought out elder teachers from whom to learn kan ha diskan, generally being viewed as successful when the student can act as diskaner to their mentor. Teachers of this era included Marcel Guilloux and Yann-Fanch Kemener. It was, however, Ropars who adapted the fest-noz, a \\"night party\\" in rural communities, for a new type of fest-noz (amplification for the singers), and set the stage for the folk revival.  Kantikoù (hymns)  (\\"canticle\\") is a type of hymn that is vocal but includes accompaniment from a variety of instruments, commonly including the harp, pipes and organ. Modern performers include Anne Auffret and the choir Ensemble Choral du Bout du Monde.  Gwerzioù and sonioù (laments and ballads)  Denez Prigent, a gwerz singer Gwerzioù and sonioù are the two primary classifications of Breton unaccompanied folk song. Vocals for both types are usually by a soloist. A gwerz is a lament characterized by a gloomy tone and subject matter. A Gwerz typically describes tragic events such as murders, deaths, wars, forced emigration or lost love. Performers in this field include Jean Le Meut from Vannes, whose songs are mostly of the sonioù variety, and are typically pastoral songs concerning love and marriage. More contemporary singers include Iffig Troadeg, who focuses on lyrically shocking gwerzioù, Patrick Marie, Marthe Vassalo, Klervi Rivière, Mathieu Hamon, Annie Ebrel, Erik Marchand and Denez Prigent.  Chants de marins (sailor songs)  The chants de marins, are shanties, ballads about shipwrecks, sailing and loss of life, often accompanied by instruments such as the fiddle and accordion. Although it is not exclusively Breton, the large number of sailors in this region have given this form of musical expression a high-profile. The best known modern performers are Djiboudjep and Cabestan, along with numerous but less known bands as Tonnerre de Brest, L'Echo, Les Boucaniers or Taillevent. There are new composers too : Michel Tonnerre is a well-known modern composer of Chants de marins ; some of his compositions are as famous as ancient songs (Quinze marins, Satanicles, Vire au cabestan, Mon petit garçon). There is an annual Chants de marins contest in the small town of Paimpol, in north Brittany, where the most famous shantymen of the world meet. At any harbour festival in Brittany Chants de marins can usually be heard.  Instrumental music  Since the Breton folk music revival, Scottish bagpipes and Irish harps have been added to the Breton repertoire, though Brittany retains its own unbroken piping traditions as well as mainstay instruments such as the bombard. = Celtic harp = Alan Stivell, Breton harpist Though the harp had been common in Brittany in the Middle Ages, the instrument had disappeared by the 18th century, at least in its specific repertoire and making. Early in the 20th century, a Breton harpist Paul Diverres living in Wales came several times to play in Brittany. Just before and after the second World war, Gildas Jaffrenou built a harp from the 14th century plans for the Brian Boru model. But this was not enough for a revival. In 1952–1953, Jord Cochevelou, built a first Breton new-Celtic harp. Since then and during the 50s, the Celtic harp or Breton harp has taken its place back into Breton music thanks to Jord and his son Alan Cochevelou; Alan was the first person to play it in public and became world-famous under his stage name Alan Stivell. Modern Breton performers include Myrdhin, An Triskell, Kristen Nogues and Dominig Bouchaud. = Violon = The violon (which can mean either fiddle or violin) is an instrument played across France. Perhaps because of this wide-ranging appeal and lack of regional uniqueness, the instrument was somewhat ignored during the Breton folk revival in the mid-20th century. However, the instrument remains a common part of Breton folk bands today. The violon has been played in Brittany since at least the 17th century, and was possibly the most widespread instrument in the land by the early 20th century. It was only a few decades later, however, that the accordion nearly wiped the violon out, and most fiddlers joined Irish bands, moved into jazz or otherwise left the instrument. The violon survived, however. Alan Stivell has used the fiddle and electric violin in his arrangements and compositions since his first album in 1970, inviting different fiddlers for his tours and records. It opened the way for a new generation of performers including Christian Lemaitre, Jackie Molard and the six-violin band Archétype. = Clarinet (treujenn-gaol) = The clarinet was invented in Germany in the 18th century. It evolved from earlier single reed instruments such as the renaissance chalumeaux, or shalmei. Clarinets were quickly incorporated into orchestras, from where they moved into marching bands and the amateur musicians in them. By the 19th century, the clarinet had entered a number of folk traditions and spread to many parts of the world. In Brittany the instrument is called a treujenn-gaol (Breton), which translates as cabbage stalk. The traditional Breton clarinet usually has only 13 keys (though sometimes as few as six), in contrast to the more common 'Boehm' instrument used in jazz, classical music and other fields. This is because classical musicians discarded the clarinets with fewer keys in favor of more complex and state-of-the-art pieces. After a decline in use in traditional music, the instrument came back, notably in the music of the bagad and paired with the accordion. In Breton music, two clarinetists typically play together, though they also play in ensembles with accordions and violins. The clarinet is a common part of Breton jazz bands, along with saxophones and drums, playing both jazz and traditional songs. The best-known Breton clarinetists are probably Erik Marchand, a former member of both Quintet Clarinettes and Gwerz, Gallo musician Yves LeBlanc, and Christian Duro, who plays in the group Termajik. The bands Darhaou, Tonnerre de Brest, L'Echo, Cabestan and Strobinell have also used clarinets. = Guitar = Dan Ar Braz. Perhaps the earliest popularizer of Breton guitar was Dan Ar Braz, who continues to be an influential figure in a somewhat jazzy, easy-listening vein. In the traditional music world, Soïg Siberil emerged as the pre-eminent master of 'open tuning' in bands such as Gwerz and Kornog, developing a complex accompaniment and solo technique easily comparable to artists such as John Renbourn or Pierre Bensusan. Another guitarist of note is Gilles Le Bigot, who performed with Kornog as well and has been a mainstay of the Breton super- group Skolvan for more than 20 years. Other notable Breton guitarists include Jacques Pellen, Pat O'May, Nicolas Quemener, Fabrice Carre, Roland Conq and Arnaud Royer, who has developed a unique and complex self-accompaniment technique based on sampling and then playing along with loops of his own work. = Wooden flute = The wooden transverse flute entered Brittany only relatively recently, popularized by Jean Michel Veillon. Veillon has been a member of a number of prominent bands, including Pennoù Skoulm, Barzaz, Den and Kornog, as well as producing some influential solo albums. Other performers include Youenn Le Cam of Pevar Den, Jean Luc Thomas of Kej, Yannig Alory of Carré Manchot, Yann Herri Ar Gwicher of Strobinell and Hervé Guillo of Storvan, and also Gilles Lehart, who is one of Brittany's most respected wooden flute makers. = Accordion = The accordion only arrived in large numbers in the country in about 1875, but its popularity grew quickly. Among the reasons for this were the instrument's cheapness and durability, and could be played solo, and was easier to learn. Perhaps the most important reason, though, was the instrument's association with 'kof ha kof' couples dancing like waltzes and mazurkas, which stood in stark contrast to the line and round dances familiar in Breton folk; the perceived sexuality of the instrument's common dances may have made it more attractive. By the 1920s, the instrument was more popular than any other. In the 1930s, chromatic accordions arrived in Brittany and jazz-influenced bands with saxophones, drum kits and banjos were formed. Contemporary accordionists include Cocktail Diatonique, Regis Huiban, Bruno Le Tron, Patrick Lefebvre, Yann Dour, Yann-Fañch Perroches and Alain Pennec. = Bagpipes = A bagad from Quimper There are two types of bagpipes indigenous to Brittany. The veuze is very similar to other western European bagpipes such as the Gaita from Galicia and Asturies, while the biniou kozh (old biniou in Breton) is much smaller and is used to accompany the bombarde. The biniou, which plays exactly one octave above the bombarde, and bombarde duo (soner ar couple) are an integral and common part of Breton folk music, and was used historically for dance music. The two performers play alternate lines that intersect at the end, in a similar manner to the Kan ha Diskan style of singing; the bombarde does not usually play every line of the tune, however, usually instead playing every other line, or three out of four lines in a dance tune. The Highland bagpipe, which was imported in the late 19th century, is often called binioù braz, sometimes pib-veur (the large biniou, the large pipe). The image to the right shows the binioù braz, or highland bagpipes, with bombardes in the hands of the men in the background.  Veuze  The veuze has a chanter of conical bore fitted with a double reed and a drone fitted with one reed, both attached to a mouth-inflated bag. Its sound and design is similar to Flemish pipes and Galician gaita. In the 20th century, the term veuze came to be applied to the diatonic accordion, which had been recently imported, and the use of the bagpipes declined. Though still not common, it has rebounded since the Breton folk revival.  Binioù bras  Konan Mevel, bagpiper of Tri Yann (band from Nantes) The binioù bras (literally the \\"big binioù\\"), or Great Highland bagpipe, was imported in the late 19th century, and became popular in the 1930s. It is now used in solo performances, along with a bombarde in a duo, and as part of the bagad, a kind of pipe band. The idea of bagad comes from the World War 2: Breton soldiers saw pipe bands in Scotland, and brought the idea and instrument back with them to Brittany. There, they added bombardes along with the bagpipes drums and called the ensemble bagad (which means \\"company\\" in Breton). Those ensembles gained in popularity in the 1950s, just before the folk revival began and remain very popular to this day.  Binioù kozh  The binioù kozh is more traditional and predates the introduction of the highland bagpipes to Brittany. It was originally designed from the veuze in order to play in a higher register. Its pitch is higher and its chanter smaller than any other European bagpipe. Originally, it was common in the Breton-speaking area. It is often played as part of a duo with the bombarde, for dance accompaniment. = Bombard = The bombard (Breton, Fr. bombarde) is a conical-bore double-reed instrument similar to the oboe, and like an oboe uses reeds made of cane. In its most primitive form the bombard has six open holes and possibly a seventh that is often closed with a key. It has a range of just over an octave. Bombards come in a number of keys, based on region or intended use. B-flat is a popular choice for those playing in a Bagad alongside the binioù braz (Scottish Highland pipes). In the contemporary setting bombards may also have complex simple system key-work enabling significant chromatic possibilities. In Breton, the bombard is also known as the talabard, and a bombard player as a talabarder. The bombard has been in use since the 15th century, and has traditionally been played as part of a duo with the binioù kozh since the French Revolution. Later, in the 19th century, the binioù braz (highland bagpipe) was introduced to Brittany. Biniou and bombarde duos include Jean Baron and Christian Anneix, Youenn Le Bihan and Patrick Molard, and Pierre Crépillon and Laurent Bigot. In recent years the bombard has been paired and recorded with other instruments not traditionally associated with Breton folk music, such as the organ. Sacred music is well served by the clear, strong sound of the bombard, in combination with the traditional organ. The late Jegat and Yhuel are renowned for this use of the bombard. = Piston = Breton musician, teacher, and luthier Youenn Le Bihan invented the piston in 1983. The piston is a contemporary development of the hautboy or baroque oboe, influenced by the bombard. It is typically rooted in the key of D and features simple system key-work to expand its range. The tone of the piston stands in a warm and rich middle ground between the trumpet-like tone of the bombard and that of the baroque oboe.  Breton pop music  Undoubtedly the most famous name in modern Breton music is Alan Stivell, who popularized the Celtic harp first in the fifties and sixties and on a wider level since the 1970s, with a series of albums including most famously Renaissance de la Harpe Celtique (1971). His first harps were built by his father; the Celtic harp was long forgotten in Brittany before. He began playing the bombarde in 1955, a double- reeded shawm (or oboe) and later the Scottish bagpipe and became pipe-major. Alan Stivell began (in the mid 60s) recording Breton folk, Celtic harp and other Celtic music, mixing influences from American rock and roll and the main musical genres. February 28, 1972 marks the unprecedented performance of the Breton musician, on the Olympia music hall in Paris, broadcast live on one of only three radio networks in France (seven million listeners on Europe 1 radio). Tri Martolod, Suite Sudarmoricaine, An Alarc'h, Pop Plinn were become famous hymns. The Olympia album were sold a staggering 1,500,000 copies. If his work as composer, producer, author has been very important, so has been his work of promotion and communication to the major audiences, in Brittany, France, Europe and the English-speaking countries. Stivell's most important contribution to the Breton music scene, however, has probably been his importation of rock and other American styles, as well as the formation of the idea of a Breton band. From the album Reflets to the new one Explore, without forget Chemins de Terre (1973), Alan Stivell has made 22 albums and toured all over the world, influencing many musicians everywhere, experimenting many different fusions (Rock, Jazz-rock, Blues, Symphonic, Indian, African, Electro, Hip-hop, etc.). Inspired by Alan Stivell, a very large Breton scene grew up, especially after his Olympia concert in 1972. It was a true revolution: hundred of bands, thousand of musicians, of Festoù-noz, etc. grew in the year after. Bands like Kornog and Gwerz arose, adapting elements of the Irish and Scottish Celtic music scene. Soldat Louis at the Festival des Terre- Neuvas in Bobital, France, 2007 The most famous group of Breton musicians after Alan Stivell is Tri Yann, from Nantes (their original name is Tri Yann an Naoned, literally \\"the Three Johns from Nantes\\"). They formed in 1972 and still remain very popular, describing themselves as producing progressive rock-folk-celto-medieval music. They have produced some musical gems, now standards, like \\"Les filles des Forges\\", \\"Les prisons de Nantes\\", \\"La Jument de Michao\\", \\"Pelot d'Hennebont\\", and new interpretation of Irish music, like \\"Cad é sin don té sin\\", \\"Si mort a mors\\" (originally An Cailín Rua), \\"La ville que j'ai tant aimée\\" (from \\"The town I loved so well\\"), \\"Mrs McDermott\\" (from the 17th-century Irish harpist Ó Carolan) and \\"Kalonkadour\\" (from \\"Planxty Irwin\\"). Another famous band is Soldat Louis, from Port Louis, across the harbour from the city of Lorient. More rock-oriented, they play modern compositions about Brittany and life on the sea (\\"Du rhum, des femmes\\", \\"Martiniquaise\\", \\"Pavillon noir\\"). Also from the 80s, Ar Re Yaouank played lively driving folk rock songs with pro-Breton themes. Red Cardell cross over roots musics from Brittany, Ukraine or North Africa with Rock and French realistic song. Many times they play on stage with guests as Dave Pegg (Fairport Convention, Jethro Tull), Jimme O'Neill (The Silencers), Dan Ar Braz, Dr Das (Asian Dub Foundation) or Stéfane Mellino (Les Négresses Vertes)... Their album \\"soleil blanc\\" have been recorded and mixed by the English producer Clive Martin (Queen, Sting, David Byrne...) Similarly, EV combined Finnish influences in their Breton folk-rock style, calling it Celto- Finnic rock. Gérard Jaffrès at the Festival des Terre-Neuvas in Bobital, France, 2008 Since then, a new scene of Breton songwriters appeared in Brittany (Gérard Jaffrès, Nolwenn Korbell, Dom Duff). Les Ramoneurs de menhirs do Celtic punk, playing original songs, traditional ones and cover versions mostly in Breton. Besides folk-rock, recent groups have included, as well as Alan Stivell, world music influences into their repertoires – especially younger groups such as Wig-a-Wag. Hip hop with a Celtic flavour has been espoused by groups such as Manau from Paris. The band Merzhin uses traditional Celtic instruments along with electric guitars and bass. Their melodies and harmonies are inspired by Celtic music as well as by modern rock and roll. In the USA, the group Trouz Bras(\\"Big Noise\\") is led by Welshman Ray Price. The group is based in Rhode Island and features bombarde and Breton bagpipes. In Seattle, Washington a Fest Noz group called Sonerion features piston, bombard, guitar/bouzouki, accordion, and bass. In Austin, Texas, Poor Man's Fortune is well known for performing Breton music featuring biniou, bombarde, accordion, subois (similar to the \\"piston\\"), violin, flute and biniou braz. Brittany hosts many annual rock and pop festivals, not related to traditional music. The biggest in Brittany and France, and one of the most important in Europe, is the Festival des Vieilles Charrues (held in late July in Carhaix, Finistère). See also the Route du Rock (mid-August, Saint-Malo) and the Transmusicales of Rennes, held in early December. For its 2014 edition, the Festival des Vieilles Charrues (The festival of old plows) announces its new creation: The Celtic Social Club, a supergroup of seven Breton musicians and others, which included Jimme O'Neill (The Silencers), Ronan Le Bars (Héritage des Celtes) and the three members of Red Cardell.  Chanteurs engagés  A chanteur engagé (literally [ideologically] engaged singer) is a singer that is roughly analogous to a singer of protest songs. These songs are usually nationalistic, and are celebrations of Breton culture. This is mostly a modern tradition, though some older songs of this type are known and the tradition stretches into the ancient past of Brittany. Chanteurs engagés are often also singers of more traditional material. The first chanteur engagé to be quoted is the maverick Glenmor (1931–1996), or to give him his real name, Emile Le Scanf (or Milig Ar Scañv in Breton). He had some influence, mainly in the Breton movement and around, and on some newcomers as the best known, Gilles Servat, whose \\"La Blanche Hermine\\" has been a popular Breton anthem since the 1970s.  Gallo  Bébert Huchait et les Vilaïnes Bétes singing in Gallo at Mont Dol in 2007 Though the Breton folk revival focused on songs in Breton, the Pays Gallo area of eastern Brittany has seen a more limited revival in repertoire in Gallo and produces singers and groups including Hamon-Martin Quintet, Ôbrée Alie, Yann Dour, while various bands, such as Tri Yann, perform a selection of Gallo songs.

Founded by royal charter in 1571, the school occupied several sites in Southwark, before establishing a more permanent location on Tooley Street in 1893. The school moved to the suburb of Orpington in 1968. It has admitted girls to its sixth form since 1998. The school is consistently one of the top achieving state schools in the UK. It was the Sunday Times State School of the Year in 2008 and in 2011 was ranked as the fourth best performing state school in the country at A-level by the Financial Times. The school is highly selective at both initial entry and for entry to the sixth form, but it has been criticised for policies that led to students being excluded from the sixth form for not achieving high grades. In 2017, parents threatened legal action against the policies applied by headteacher Aydin Önaç (who subsequently resigned), and the London Borough of Bromley instituted an inquiry whose highly critical report was published in July 2018. General information The school is a beneficiary of the St Olave's and St Saviour's Schools Foundation. Its historic sister school is St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School in New Kent Road. Established in 1903, as a girls grammar school, this is now a non-selective girls' school. St Olave's now also has a strong relationship with Newstead Wood School, a selective girls' school situated about 1.5 miles away. It also has strong links with other schools through the Woodard Foundation. Until the scheme was discontinued in 2010, St Olave's was designated as a science, mathematics and computing specialist school. The school later applied for academy status; in 2015 this was reported to be 'on hold' pending resolution of governance issues between the Diocese of Rochester, the school and the Department for Education. Members of the school are known as Olavians, and alumni as Old Olavians. There are four houses: Bingham, Cure, Harvard and Leeke. These exist for the purposes of the classes and house competitions in the Lower School (Year 7 to 9) and for games competition in Year 10. AdmissionsYear 7 entry= The school is heavily oversubscribed (more than 10 applicants per place in 2008). Entry had for some years solely been determined by a pair of competitive papers in English and Mathematics; however, due to the demand for entry to the school, a two-stage entrance process now exists. Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning (which had formed the 3rd entrance paper until the Autumn 2007 exams, for entry September 2008) now forms part of Stage 1, a single multiple-choice paper which will also include English and Maths. Those who pass this first paper will then take Stage 2, the traditional pair of English and Maths papers. Marks for the two stages are then standardised and aggregated; the candidates with the top 124 aggregate marks are offered places in Year 7. =Sixth form= Competition for sixth form places is also high. Pupils are selected for the sixth form on the basis of their excellent GCSE results, and some pupils have been expelled for under- achievement. In 2017 parents claimed this practice was illegal, and petitioned for judicial review (see 'Controversies' below). It has been suggested that this is a common practice across the country for schools attempting top placement in exam league tables. Choristers St Olave's exclusively provides Choristers for the Choir of the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, London, which is the Chapel of the Royal Victorian Order and of the Duchy of Lancaster. Until the school relocated to Orpington, it used to provide the choir for Southwark Cathedral from its connection to the St Saviour's foundation. However, the Charity Commissioners required that activities and intended beneficiaries related to Southwark had to be continued to be provided for by the Foundation, which supports the Cathedral choir today. History=St Saviour's Grammar School A new lease for the parish church of St Saviour’s dated 16 June 1559 included a pledge to start a school within two years. Within a few weeks a school for boys was functioning in temporary accommodation. On 24 November 1560 the four first wardens of the school were elected, and on 4 March 1561 a lease was handed over to the wardens for a new schoolhouse: a building in the Green Dragon, formerly Cobham’s Inn. A licence/charter for St Saviour’s Grammar School was obtained in 1562. In 1676 the building in the Green Dragon was destroyed in the Great Fire of Southwark—the City of London fire was in 1666—and a new building was built on the same site. In 1839 the school site was required for the enlargement of the Borough Market and a third building was built in Sumner Street in 1839. It was smaller than the previous one due to a decline in numbers. St Saviour’s Grammar School agreed to amalgamation with St Olave’s in 1896. At the same time the creation of a new school for girls was envisaged, and this came into being in 1903 and was named St Saviour’s and St Olave’s Grammar School for Girls.Carrington, R. C. Two Schools: A History of the St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School Foundation (London, 1971). St Olave’s Grammar School Henry Leeke, a Southwark brewer, left a will (13 April 1560) which gave £8 a year towards the founding and maintenance of a new free school. If the parish of St Olave’s failed to create such a school within two years, St Saviour’s parish was to have the money. In November 1560, notice to quit was given to tenants of the rooms which were to be used for the school, and in July 1561 the church wardens of St Olave’s were ordered to receive Leeke’s legacy, and \\"prepare\\" a schoolmaster by Michaelmas Day. Assuming that everything went to schedule, the school began teaching on Michaelmas Day 1561. On 25 July 1571 letters patent were obtained which established the school as a grammar school. The charter stipulated that the school be called: The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth of the Parishioners of the Parish of Saint Olave in the County of Surrey. Initially the school was housed in the old Vestry Hall of the church and its adjoining premises (on the west side of Churchyard Alley, a narrow lane off the south side of Tooley Street, running parallel with Borough High Street). In the seventeenth century St Olave's Headmaster Robert Browne was imprisoned for non-conformism. Although the school was untouched by the Great Fire of Southwark, major renovation and extension was undertaken in 1676 after the fire. In 1829 the school had to move because its site was needed for the approach to the new London Bridge, which was built about west of the old bridge. A new building was built in Bermondsey Street, with the first stone being laid on 17 November 1834. However this building did not last long due to the rapid expansion of the railways, which wanted the land, and another building at Green Bank, in Back Street (later renamed Queen Elizabeth Street) was built in 1855. This new building was soon deemed to be unsuitable due to the fact that it was designed for a system of teaching which fell out of favour, and had almost no provision for classrooms. Clock tower of the former school building on Queen Elizabeth Street Another building was put up in stages on the same site, while the old building was dismantled. Work was begun in 1892 and completed in 1894. The new building was designed by Edward William Mountford, the architect of the Old Bailey, and it is this building which still stands in Queen Elizabeth Street near the approach to Tower Bridge (also completed in 1894). The Queen Elizabeth Street building was abandoned by the school in 1968, when it moved to Orpington. During World War II the former St Saviour's building in Sumner Street was damaged by bombing. Consequently, in 1952 the historic foundation stone was moved from Sumner Street to the Queen Elizabeth Street site. When the school was relocated to Orpington in 1968, the stone was taken to the new site.The history section draws its information mostly from Two Schools by Dr Roger Clifford Carrington, a former headmaster. The school was at the centre of controversy in 1996 when Labour Party Shadow Cabinet minister Harriet Harman sent her son to the school, despite her party's opposition to grammar schools and the fact that the school was located at some considerable distance from where she lived. On 11 May 2016 a petition was set up by students objecting to new, harder sixth form entry requirements; it gained over 1,000 signatures in two days. Then in August 2017, parents were informed that sixteen children were no longer welcome to continue into year 13, as their year 12 results were too poor. This caused a group of parents to take the school to court for excluding the pupils unlawfully. On 1 September, the school made a statement that the excluded pupils would be allowed to return to school for Year 13. The chair of the governors resigned due to lack of time. It emerged that headteacher Aydin Önaç and bursar Alan Wooley had set up a business earlier in 2016, with the knowledge of the governors, where they were registered as the sole shareholders. The company filed three applications to hold trademarks related to St Olave’s school. The governors decided the format of the business did not follow good practice. On 19 October 2017 the new chair of governors, Dr Paul Wright, announced that the headteacher had been suspended \\"without prejudice\\" while an inquiry (\\"in respect of concerns that have been raised over recent weeks\\") by the London Borough of Bromley took place. Some parents used the annual general meeting of the school's parents' association in early November to campaign for Önaç's reinstatement, but the following week, on 17 November, the school announced Önaç would be leaving the school in December 2017, \\"for personal reasons\\". Freedom of Information requests revealed that 72 students had been forced out of the school during their A-level studies since Önaç became head in the 2010-2011 academic year. The report of Bromley council's independent inquiry, led by educationalist Christine Whatford, was published in July 2018, and accused St Olave's of illegally treating its students as \\"collateral damage\\" in the pursuit of its own interests. It called for a root and branch makeover at the school after exposing multiple cases of maladministration, said Bromley council and the Diocese of Rochester should apologise to affected parents, and urged the school to scrap its policy of restricting access to the upper sixth form, it questioned Önaç’s claims that he did not know the exclusions were potentially illegal. The report criticised the school's financial management and the way which five governors who disagreed with the head were removed, and found the Head unconstitutionally interfered with the management of the PA (Parents Association)\\" It criticised the head and bursar's establishment of the companies to manage school trademarks.

It includes wasps, bees, and ants, and consists of many families. It contains the most advanced hymenopterans and is distinguished from Symphyta by the narrow \\"waist\\" (petiole) formed between the first two segments of the actual abdomen; the first abdominal segment is fused to the thorax, and is called the propodeum. Therefore, it is general practice, when discussing the body of an apocritan in a technical sense, to refer to the mesosoma and metasoma (or \\"gaster\\") rather than the \\"thorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\", respectively. The evolution of a constricted waist was an important adaption for the parasitoid lifestyle of the ancestral apocritan, allowing more maneuverability of the female's ovipositor. The ovipositor either extends freely or is retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defense and paralyzing prey. Larvae are legless and blind, and either feed inside a host (plant or animal) or in a nest cell provisioned by their mothers. The Apocrita have historically been split into two groups, Parasitica and Aculeata. The Aculeata is a clade and the name is in standard use. \\"Parasitica\\" is not a clade, as it is paraphyletic: the clade would contain the Aculeata. \\"Parasitica\\" is therefore a rankless grouping in present classifications, if it appears at all. The Parasitica comprise the majority of hymenopteran insects, with members living as parasitoids. Most species are small, with the ovipositor adapted for piercing. In some hosts, the parasitoids induce metamorphosis prematurely, and in others it is prolonged. There are even species that are hyperparasites, or parasitoids on other parasitoids. The Parasitica lay their eggs inside or on another insect (egg, larva or pupa) and their larvae grow and develop within or on that host. The host is nearly always killed. Many parasitic hymenopterans are used as biological control agents to control pests, such as caterpillars, true bugs and hoppers, flies, and weevils. The Aculeata are a monophyletic group that includes those species in which the female's ovipositor is modified into a stinger to inject venom. Groups include the familiar ants, bees, and various types of parasitic and predatory wasps; it also includes all of the social hymenopterans. Among the nonparasitic and nonsocial Aculeata, larvae are fed with captured prey (typically alive and paralyzed) or may be fed pollen and nectar. The social Aculeata feed their young prey (paper wasps and hornets), or pollen and nectar (bees), or perhaps seeds, fungi, or nonviable eggs (ants).  Extant families and superfamilies  The Apocrita contains a large number of families. Some traditional taxa such as the Parasitica (containing many families of parasitoid wasps) have been found on molecular analysis to be paraphyletic. Parasitoidism evolved once, and it is found today across most Apocritan families, though it has been secondarily lost several times. The phylogenetic tree gives a condensed overview of the phylogeny, illustrated with major groups. The tree is not fully resolved. *Suborder Apocrita **(unranked) Aculeata ***Superfamily Apoidea (bees and sphecoid wasps) ****Family Ampulicidae (cockroach wasps) ****Family Andrenidae (mining bees) ****Family Apidae (carpenter bees, digger bees, cuckoo bees, bumble bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and honeybees) ****Family Colletidae (yellow-faced bees and plasterer bees) ****Family Crabronidae (sand wasps, bee wolves, etc.) ****Family Halictidae (\\"sweat bees\\") ****Family Heterogynaidae ****Family Megachilidae (leaf-cutting bees) ****Family Melittidae ****Family Stenotritidae ****Family Sphecidae (digger wasps) ***Superfamily Chrysidoidea ****Family Bethylidae ****Family Chrysididae (cuckoo wasps) ****Family Dryinidae ****Family Embolemidae ****Family Plumariidae ****Family Sclerogibbidae ****Family Scolebythidae ***Superfamily Vespoidea ****Family Bradynobaenidae ****Family Mutillidae (velvet ants) ****Family Pompilidae (spider wasps) ****Family Rhopalosomatidae ****Family Sapygidae ****Family Scoliidae ****Family Sierolomorphidae ****Family Tiphiidae ****Family Vespidae (paper wasps, potter wasps, hornets, pollen wasps, yellowjackets) ***Superfamily Formicoidea ****Family Formicidae (ants) **(unranked) Parasitica ***Superfamily Ceraphronoidea ****Family Ceraphronidae ****Family Megaspilidae ***Superfamily Chalcidoidea ****Family Agaonidae (fig wasps) ****Family Aphelinidae ****Family Chalcididae (chalcid wasps) ****Family Encyrtidae ****Family Eucharitidae ****Family Eulophidae ****Family Eupelmidae ****Family Eurytomidae (seed chalcids) ****Family Leucospidae ****Family Mymaridae (fairyflies) – the smallest of all insects ****Family Ormyridae ****Family Perilampidae ****Family Pteromalidae ****Family Rotoitidae ****Family Signiphoridae ****Family Tanaostigmatidae ****Family Tetracampidae ****Family Torymidae ****Family Trichogrammatidae ***Superfamily Cynipoidea ****Family Austrocynipidae ****Family Cynipidae (gall wasps) ****Family Figitidae ****Family Ibaliidae ****Family Liopteridae ***Superfamily Diaprioidea ****Family Austroniidae ****Family Diapriidae ****Family Maamingidae ****Family Monomachidae ***Superfamily Evanioidea ****Family Aulacidae ****Family Evaniidae (ensign wasps) ****Family Gasteruptiidae ***Superfamily Ichneumonoidea ****Family Braconidae ****Family Ichneumonidae (ichneumon wasps) ****Family TrachypetidaeD.L.J.

She was the first submarine to serve in the RAN, and was lost at sea with all hands near what is now East New Britain, Papua New Guinea, on 14 September 1914, after less than seven months in service. Search missions attempting to locate the wreck began in 1976. The submarine was found during the 13th search mission near the Duke of York Islands in December 2017. Design and construction The E class was a version of the preceding D-class submarine enlarged to accommodate an additional pair of broadside torpedo tubes.Harrison, Chapter 4: Pre-1914 Saddle Tank Types D & E Classes.

The complement consisted of 34 men: officers and ratings.Gillett, Australian & New Zealand Warships, 1914–1945, p. 47. The boat had two propellers, each of which was driven by an eight-cylinder, diesel engine as well as a electric motor. This arrangement gave the E-class submarines a maximum speed of while surfaced and when submerged. They carried approximately of fuel oil, which provided a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged. AE1 had four 18-inch torpedo tubes, one each in the bow and stern, plus two on the broadside, one firing to port and the other to starboard. The boat carried one spare torpedo for each tube. No guns were fitted. AE1 was built by Vickers Limited at Barrow-in-Furness, England, having been laid down on 14 November 1911 and launched on 22 May 1913 and commissioned into the RAN on 28 February 1914.HMAS AE1 www.navy.gov.au Retrieved 23 December 2017 After commissioning, AE1, accompanied by , the other of the RAN's first two submarines, reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914. Officers for the submarines were Royal Navy (RN) personnel, while the ratings were a mix of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN.Navy to hunt for lost sub, in The Sydney Morning Herald. Deployment and loss AE1 with other Australian vessels off Rabaul on 9 September 1914 At the outbreak of World War I, AE1, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant, was part of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force sent to attack German New Guinea. Along with AE2, she took part in the operations leading to the occupation of the German territory, including the surrender of Rabaul on 13 September 1914. The submarine's involvement was recognised in 2010, following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, with the retroactive award of the honour \\"Rabaul 1914\\".Royal Australian Navy, Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle HonoursRoyal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours At 07:00 on 14 September, AE1 departed Blanche Bay, Rabaul, to patrol off Cape Gazelle with . When she had not returned by 20:00, several ships were dispatched to search for her. No trace of the submarine was found, and she was listed as lost with all hands. The disappearance was Australia's first major loss of World War I. After the discovery of the submarine in December 2017, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, retired, said the likely cause of its loss was a diving accident. He added: On 14 September 2018, a team of researchers headed by the National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption concluded their investigation into the sinking of AE1. They concluded that a ventilation valve, which was likely open to make the tropical conditions a little more bearable while the submarine was cruising on the surface near the Duke of York Islands, was insecure when the submarine dived causing a flood of the submarine's engine room and total loss of control of the AE1. The submarine subsequently sank below 100 metres and imploded, killing everyone on board instantly. Searches for wreck Beyond the search immediately after the submarine's disappearance, there were no concentrated efforts to locate the wreck of AE1 until the 1970s, when John Foster, a RAN officer working in Port Moresby, became interested in the story. After researching wartime records, Foster persuaded the RAN to deploy the survey ship HMAS Flinders in 1976. Flinders found one potential sonar contact, but did not have a sophisticated enough side-scan sonar to make a determination either way. During a deployment to Papua New Guinea in 1978, Flinders conducted several ad-hoc searches, again with no useful result. In 1990, while sailing between New Britain and New Ireland, Jacques Cousteau diverted his ship, Calypso, to investigate the potential contact found in 1976. His original plan was to investigate up close with a submersible, but mechanical issues prevented it, and Calypso instead performed a magnetometer search of the area, finding no wrecks.Hunter, The Search for AE1 Continues Map of the region where AE1 was lost in September 1914 Foster had continued archive research into AE1s disappearance, supplemented with visits to Rabaul and nearby islands to see if references to the submarine appeared in any community's oral histories. By 2002, he was focused on the waters off Mioko Island in the Duke of York Islands group: a priest from a Catholic mission had stated that members of the community had spotted a wrecked submarine on Wirian Reef while diving for shells. Attempts to dive the reported site of the wreck in 2002 and early 2003 were unsuccessful: the former was called off due to high shark presence, the latter expedition also was hampered by shark activity and found no wreck at the reported location. A third expedition in November 2003, supported by the Maritime Museum of Western Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, conducted searches off Mioko and nearby islands, again with no success.Green, The search for the AE1 Further oral evidence supporting the wreck of AE1 being off Mioko was learned during one of the 2003 expeditions: Foster discovered that the Tolai people had a legend of a \\"devil fish\\" appearing offshore on the day that AE1 disappeared. In February 2007, a new effort to locate the submarine was mounted by the RAN, when the survey ships and attempted to locate the submarine off East New Britain. Benalla located an object on Wirian Reef of the appropriate dimensions using sonar on 1 March, but was unable to verify the nature of the object due to a damaged magnetometer.Australian Associated Press, Missing WWI sub may have been found The minehunter was sent to investigate the object further in late 2007. Sonar and remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) imagery of the object revealed shape and dimensions similar to the submarine, but subsequent analysis by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation identified the object as a rock formation.Resurface of mystery, in Navy News Foster organised another search in May 2009, partially funded by Channel Seven's Sunday Night, based on claims by a Rabaul-based salvage diver that he had seen the wreck in Simpson Harbour back in 1971, in proximity to the wreck of the Japanese merchant ship Keifuku Maru. Diver searches of the site specified by the salvager failed to find either wreck. A follow-up search later that year by the Western Australian Maritime Museum found that Keifuku Maru had been buried under of rock during the 1994 Rabaul caldera eruption, but found no evidence of AE1, buried or otherwise. John Foster died in 2010 with the search for AE1 continued by others. During early 2012, the minehunter and the survey ship detected a potential wrecked submarine in Simpson Harbour. Although initially suspected to be AE1, the wreck was determined to be a World War II-era Japanese midget submarine.Coutts, Submarine wreckage located in Rabaul harbour Resolution later conducted sonar surveys of areas in which AE1 may have been lost, with no wrecks found. Between 6 and 9 September 2014, Yarra conducted searches around the Duke of York Islands, prior to a memorial service for the centenary of the submarine's disappearance.Barlass, A century on and a sonar blip: has navy found WWI submarine? Although numerous sonar \\"contacts of interest\\" were made during the search, including one which was singled out for further investigation, all were found to be natural terrain.Australian Associated Press, Possible clue found in hunt for AE1 sub In September 2015, plans for a new search were announced by Find AE1 Limited. The search off Mioko Island was carried out in November, and was conducted by a mining survey ship towing a multibeam echosounder array. At the time of the search, Find AE1 stated that if the attempt was unsuccessful, they planned to petition the Australian government to bring in the search equipment used during the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The 2015 search was ultimately unsuccessful.McPhedran, Best shot at solving mystery of lost submarine AE1 with hi-tech search off Papua New Guinea Several factors have been identified as having hampered the efforts to find AE1. The volcanic nature of the region resulted in a rugged and highly variable underwater topography, with a high frequency of wreck-like acoustic anomalies. Much of the region is deep water, which limited the techniques and tools that could be used to locate and verify the wreck. Volcanic activity was also identified as a factor, due to the disruption it causes to local magnetic fields, affecting the operations of magnetometers. There were concerns that eruptions and underwater earthquakes may have caused the underwater landscape to change, or break up or bury the wreck. Additionally, the search areas contained large numbers of shipwrecks due to heavy military activity around New Guinea during World War II, along with the disposal of ships in later years. Discovery In December 2017, another search – the 13th – was conducted using the survey ship , off the Duke of York Islands. This expedition was funded by the Commonwealth Government and the Silentworld Foundation with additional assistance from the Submarine Institute of Australia and the Australian National Maritime Museum. As a result of this effort, the submarine was found at a depth of and was seen to be well preserved and in one piece. was enlisted to survey the wreckage. During the survey, it was discovered that the submarine's rear torpedo tube was fully opened. The exact location of the wreck was not announced by the Australian government at the time of discovery, in order to protect it from \\"unauthorised salvage attempts\\". The government's stated position is that the wreck will be treated as a war grave. Memorials In 1933, a stained-glass window commemorating the losses of AE1 and AE2 was added to the naval chapel at Garden Island in Sydney. In September 2015, a floating sculpture to commemorate AE1 was unveiled outside the Australian National Maritime Museum.Fletcher, Remembering AE1: '...the ocean bed their tomb The sculpture takes the form of a stainless steel wreath, in diameter, which projects patterns of light onto the water at night. In 2008 a memorial plaque was dedicated to HMAS AE1 at the Tasmanian Seafarers' Memorial at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania, commemorating the loss of L.S. Cyril Lefroy Baker RAN, Telegraphist, the first Tasmanian killed in his country's service in World War I.

A risk neutral party's decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier. For example, if offered either \\\\$50 or a 50\\\\% chance each of \\\\$100 and \\\\$0, a risk neutral person would have no preference. In contrast, a risk averse person would prefer the first offer, while a risk seeking person would prefer the second. Theory of the firm In the context of the theory of the firm, a risk neutral firm facing risk about the market price of its product, and caring only about profit, would maximize the expected value of its profit (with respect to its choices of labor input usage, output produced, etc.). But a risk averse firm in the same environment would typically take a more cautious approach.Sandmo, Agnar. \\"On the theory of the competitive firm under price uncertainty,\\" American Economic Review 61, March 1971, 65-73.

Basil Blackwell, 1991, )Merton, Robert. \\"An analytic derivation of the efficient portfolio frontier,\\" Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 7, September 1972, 1851-1872. a risk neutral investor who is able to choose any combination of an array of risky assets (various companies' stocks, various companies' bonds, etc.) would invest exclusively in the asset with the highest expected yield, ignoring its risk features relative to those of other assets, and would even sell short the asset with the lowest expected yield as much as is permitted in order to invest the proceeds in the highest expected-yield asset. In contrast, a risk averse investor would diversify among a variety of assets, taking account of their risk features, even though doing so would lower the expected return on the overall portfolio. The risk neutral investor's portfolio would have a higher expected return, but also a greater variance of possible returns. The risk neutral utility function Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of expected utility. Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first derivative. The utility function whose expected value is maximized is concave for a risk averse agent, convex for a risk lover, and linear for a risk neutral agent. Thus in the risk neutral case, expected utility of wealth is simply equal to the expectation of a linear function of wealth, and maximizing it is equivalent to maximizing expected wealth itself.

One of two submarines ordered for the fledgling navy, AE2 was built by Vickers Armstrong in England and was commissioned into the RAN in 1914. Together with her sister submarine, , the boat then sailed to Australia in what was, at the time, the longest voyage ever undertaken by a submarine. After the start of World War I, AE2 was sent to German New Guinea with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, then spent time patrolling around Fiji. With no need for submarines in the Pacific or Indian theatres, AE2 was towed to the Mediterranean, and arrived off Egypt in early 1915. The boat was assigned to the Dardanelles Campaign, and was the first submarine to successfully penetrate the waterway and enter the Sea of Marmara. With orders to \\"run amok\\" inside Turkish territory, AE2 operated for five days before mechanical faults forced her to the surface, where she was damaged by the torpedo boat . The submarine was scuttled by her crew, all of whom were captured. AE2 was the only RAN vessel lost to enemy action during World War I. The Rahmi M. Koç Museum began searching for the wreck in 1995, and found it in 1998. After another expedition in 2008, the Australian and Turkish Governments decided to leave the boat in place.

No guns were fitted. Construction and service AE2 was laid down on 10 February 1912 by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness, England, and launched on 18 June 1913. She was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth, England, on 28 February 1914 under the command of Lieutenant Henry H.G.D. Stoker, RN. Accompanied by her sister boat, , the other of the RAN's first two submarines, AE2 reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914, manned by Royal Navy (RN) officers with a mixed crew of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN. The journey was, at the time, \\"the longest submarine transit in history\\", and 60 of the 83 days of the voyage were spent at sea. Outbreak of World War I On the outbreak of World War I in September 1914, the two submarines were assigned to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force as it captured German New Guinea.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 36 During the capture of New Guinea, AE1 disappeared without a trace. After the German surrender, AE2 spent three weeks patrolling around Fiji with the battlecruiser , then returned to Sydney on 16 November for maintenance and repairs.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 44 As AE2 was the only submarine in the region and the German threat to Australia had disappeared, Stoker suggested that the boat be transferred to Europe. Both the RAN and the British Admiralty agreed, and on 31 December, she left Albany with AIF Convoy 2 (under the tow of SS Berrima). The submarine was the only warship assigned to the sixteen-ship convoy, as after the Battle of Cocos resulted in the destruction of the last active German ship in the Indian or Pacific Oceans, the Admiralty felt no need to protect shipping in the Indian Ocean.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 115 AE2 arrived in Port Said, Egypt, on 28 January 1915, and was ordered to join the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla, and proceeded to take part in patrols in support of the Dardanelles Campaign.White, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 129 Dardanelles Campaign On 10 March, the submarine ran aground off Mudros when returning from a patrol, as the harbour lights used to aid navigation had been switched off in AE2s absence, which Stoker was not prepared for. The submarine was towed to Malta for repairs and returned to operation in April.White, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, pp. 129–30 The aim of the Dardanelles Campaign was to knock Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, out of the war and open up supply lines to the Russian Empire via the Black Sea. Attempts to open the Dardanelles through naval power were unsuccessful: three Allied battleships were sunk, and another three crippled, during a surface attack; although the British submarine was able to enter the strait and sink the modernised ironclad , two failed attempts to traverse the waterway and enter the Sea of Marmara resulted in the loss of and the to mines and strong currents.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 44–45Preston, Submarine Warfare, p. 34 Plans were made to capture the Turkish defences by a land attack, with landings at Cape Helles and Anzac Cove. Despite the failures of E15 and Saphir, Stoker planned his own attempt, which was approved by the Allied fleet's commander, Vice Admiral John de Robeck.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 45 HMAS AE2 AE2s first attempt was made early on 24 April, but the boat only made it into the strait before the forward hydroplane coupling failed, making the submarine impossible to control underwater and forced Stoker to retreat.White, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 130 At 02:30 on the following day, Stoker made a second attempt. The submarine was spotted by shore artillery and fired on from about 04:30; Stoker ordered the boat to dive to avoid the shells and to traverse the first minefield. AE2 spent the next hour picking her way through the mines' mooring cables: defensive wires that had been welded to the submarine in Malta prevented the mooring cables from catching. By 06:00, AE2 reached Chanak, and proceeded to torpedo a Turkish gunboat believed to be a Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser while simultaneously taking evasive actions to avoid an enemy destroyer.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy, 1914–1918, p. 242 The submarine ran aground beneath a Turkish fort, but the fort's guns could not be lowered enough to fire, and AE2 was able to free herself within four minutes. Shortly after, the submarine's periscope was sighted by a Turkish battleship firing over the peninsula at the Allied landing sites; this prompted the ship to stop firing and withdraw. AE2 advanced toward the Sea of Marmara, and at 08:30, Stoker decided to rest the boat on the ocean bottom and wait until nightfall before continuing. At around 21:00, AE2 surfaced to recharge her batteries, and Stoker radioed his success back to the fleet; the first Allied vessel to transit the Dardanelles.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 119 Stoker had orders to \\"generally run amok\\", and with no enemies in sight, he ordered the boat to enter the Sea of Marmara. Although the landing at Cape Helles was going well at the time Stoker reported in, the landing at Anzac Cove was not as successful, and the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood was pushing for reembarkation of his troops. Some sources identify AE2 as one of the factors leading to Birdwood's decision to commit to the attack, although the Australian War Memorial claims there \\"is no real evidence\\" to support this.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 46 The submarine made appearances across the Sea of Marmara over the following five days to give the impression of multiple boats, and several attacks against Turkish ships were made, although all failed because of increasing mechanical problems. News of the submarine's successes was spread to the soldiers ashore to improve morale.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 46 On 29 April, AE2 met , one of several submarines that had entered the Dardanelles following the Australian boat's successful attempt. The submarines arranged a rendezvous for the next morning. When AE2 reached the rendezvous point on 30 April, smoke from the torpedo boat Sultanhisar was sighted, so the submarine dove and moved to investigate. At 10:30, about a mile from the torpedo boat, AE2 inexplicably rose and broke the surface. While diving to evade, the boat passed below her safe diving depth; frantic attempts to correct this caused the submarine's stern to break the surface. Sultanhisar immediately fired on the submarine, puncturing the pressure hull in three places near the engine spaces. Stoker ordered the boat's company to evacuate, and scuttled AE2 at 10:45'. All personnel survived the attack and were captured by Sultanhisar, although four died from illness while in captivity. AE2s achievements showed others that the task was possible, and within months Turkish shipping and lines of communication were badly disrupted, with supplies and reinforcements for the Turkish defence of Gallipoli forced to take underdeveloped overland routes. AE2 was the only RAN vessel to be lost as a result of enemy action during World War I, and along with sister boat AE1, the total of the RAN's operational losses in the war.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 128 Search and discovery A replica of AE2s conning tower at the Western Australian Maritime Museum Since 1995, Selçuk Kolay, director of the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul, had searched for the remains of AE2. In 1996, he discovered what he believed to be the wreck lying in of water. With the assistance of an Australian diving team, it was determined in October 1997 that the wreck was that of an old steamer. After a further thorough side-scan sonar and magnetometric survey of the reported scuttling site of the AE2, Kolay located the submarine in June 1998, lying in of water. The wreck was first dived in July, while subsequent dives by an Australian team in October were able to confirm the wreck as being AE2. The Australian government makes no claim to the shipwreck, and the submarine is not a war grave. On 9 September 2007, Australian and Turkish naval authorities began an undersea investigation to determine if AE2 could be raised and restored. Such a plan would see the submarine transferred to a viewing tank at Çanakkale. As part of the inspection, a drop camera was inserted through the submarine's open hatch and into the control room. The survey team discovered that the wreck of AE2 had suffered further damage since the 1998 inspection dives. The bow portion of the external hull casing had been destroyed and the rear of the conning tower now showed significant damage. Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck. Moving the submarine to a viewing tank, or alternately relocating the wreck to shallower water, were advised against because of the AU$80–100 million cost of such projects. Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of sacrificial anodes to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect unauthorised access and potential damage. In March 2010, following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, AE2 was retroactively awarded the honours \\"Rabaul 1914\\" and \\"Dardanelles 1915\\". An ROV exploration of the wreck by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation took place in June 2014. Several significant discoveries were made, including confirmation of the existence of a portable wireless telegraph pole and antenna wire. During the exploration, sacrificial anodes were fitted to the wreck, and the location was marked with a buoy to minimize damage by passing ships. Legacy In 2009, Edith Cowan University was commissioned by the National Archives of Australia to research and produce a computer game/simulation called AE2 Commander, funded under the $15,000 Ian Maclean Award. As well as being a realistic WWI submarine simulation, it is investigating how original archival sources can be used as part of computer simulation and serious gaming. An initial version of the AE2 Commander game and website went live on 17 April 2011. The game presents a combination of digitised documents from the collections of the National Archives of Australia and Australian War Memorial along with the embodiment of various archival sources in the setting and narrative of the game. Commemorative bronze plaques have been installed along sites associated with AE2s voyage from Australia to the Dardanelles. A Defence Housing estate under construction in Ermington, New South Wales on the site of a former naval ammunition store is to be named AE2. In recent years, AE2 has been referred to as the Silent ANZAC.

Built at Philadelphia in 1795, she was captured by Tripolitan corsairs in 1802, and sold to the commercial agent of the Bey of Tunis. She was purchased on 27 April 1805 by Captain James Barron at Trieste. In June 1805 Franklin was ordered to Syracuse, Sicily, where she was placed in charge of Lieutenant Jacob Jones to accommodate officers seized from the frigate Philadelphia, and recently released from a Tripolitan prison. From July to September she served as storeship for the Mediterranean Squadron and on the 24th departed for the United States with General William Eaton, U.S. Navy Agent to the Barbary Powers, embarked. Following an overhaul at Washington Navy Yard she voyaged to New Orleans, Louisiana with crew and supplies for that station. Again in December 1806 she carried a company of Marines and munitions for the New Orleans station. There she was turned over to the Navy Agent for disposal and on 21 March 1807 was sold.

The ship was launched in 1864, partially constructed from parts of the previous . Commissioned in 1867, Franklin served as the flagship of the European Squadron in 1867–1871. The vessel was decommissioned that year. Re-activated in 1873, the vessel joined the North Atlantic Squadron and served until 1877 when the vessel was decommissioned again and used as a receiving ship at Norfolk, Virginia. The vessel remained in this capacity until 1915 when she was stricken and sold. Service history USS Franklin figurehead, c. 1853, by Woodbury Gerrish The ship was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, in 1854, and built in part of materials salvaged from the previous . For a time housed over, she was launched on 17 September 1864, commissioned on 3 June 1867 at Boston, Massachusetts. Prior to her launching, Woodbury Gerrish was commissioned to build a figurehead for her. Following decommissioning the figurehead was donated to the U.S. Naval Home in Philadelphia, who then passed it onto The Franklin Institute in 1938. On 28 June 1867 sailed from New York City as flagship of Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, who assumed command of the European Squadron. Relieved by , she arrived back in New York on 10 November 1868. Franklins second tour in the European Squadron, beginning on 28 January 1869, was as flagship for Rear Admiral William Radford. She served with the squadron until 30 September 1871 when she sailed for the United States. On 13 November 1871 she was decommissioned at Boston. Recommissioned on 15 December 1873, Franklin operated in the North Atlantic Squadron. On 11 April 1874, she stood out to sea to join the European Squadron as flagship until 14 September 1876. On 9 January 1876, while Franklin was at Lisbon, Portugal, Ordinary Seaman Edward Maddin and Seaman John Handran jumped overboard and rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which they were later awarded the Medal of Honor. In the aftermath of the Salonika Incident, the US Ambassador, Horace Maynard, requested Franklin sailed to the Aegean Sea to protect US interests and citizens. Franklin was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 March 1877 and recommissioned the same day as receiving ship for Naval Station Norfolk, On 21 October 1907 her cutter, Cutter No. 2, with a launch lashed to the starboard side, was in a collision with a barge under tow by the tow steamer Pioneer at Norfolk resulting in the capsizing of the cutter and launch. The cutter sank and one occupant of the launch drowned. Franklin continued in this service until 14 October 1915, which marked her final decommissioning. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 October 1915 and sold.
