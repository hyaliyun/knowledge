It is in the family Cyprinidae which consists of freshwater carps and minnows. Cyprinidae is the largest fish family which consists of about 369 genera and 3,018 species. Its distribution has been decreasing due to the removal of aquatic plants in order to create swimming beaches and boating access in freshwater lakes and is now mostly found in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Distribution The pugnose shiner is a non-abundant species of Notropis and within the United States, it is distributed across parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It is native to North America and its historic range was from eastern Ontario and Western New York to North Dakota, Illionios, Indiana, and Ohio, ending in the St. Lawrence River drainage. The population that was once in North Dakota is now thought to be extirpated due to tributy and uprooted vegetation within the freshwater lakes and streams.Also can be found in Orlando Florida the St. John chain. This minnow can also be found in a few areas of Canada but those ranges have also decreased throughout time so now the Canadian population mostly lies within Ontario. Pugnose shiner (Notropis anogenus) Distribution map Description The pugnose shiner is a type of minnow that can live for up to 3 years and is able to reach sizes between 20-60mm, although it is about 47mm on average. It has a lateral dark stripe on the side of its body that runs from the tip of the caudal fin, through the eye, and to the nose tip. It has a small, terminal mouth angled upwards, giving it the pug-nose appearance. The abdominal region is yellow, and it has a clear-colored tail fin. Each fish has about 34-37 round, silver cycloid scales covering its body which has a fusiform shape to help the pugose shiner swim against the constant stream currents. The pelvic fins are in the abdominal position. Because it is a ray-finned species, the fin rays are used as elements to support the skeletal features. The pugnose shiner has an 8-rayed dorsal fin on top of the dusky-colored back, a feature separating it from the pugnose minnow. This fish is also the only Minnesota Notropis species that has a darkly pigmented peritoneum. Ecology Although it is not an abundant species, the pugnose shiner can be found inhabiting weedy, clear lakes and slow-moving streams throughout its temperate, freshwater range. When temperatures are warmer, this fish is found in shallow water but when it cools down in the winter months, it is found in waters as deep as 2 meters. The pugnose shiner is a great indicator for healthy ecosystems because it is very sensitive to its environment because it is intolerant to turbidity. Their diets tend to consist of filamentous algae and cladocera (water fleas), eggs, insects, worms, and anything else under 2mm. Their predators consist of any omnivorous fish that is larger than this shiner. They are mid to low level consumers and therefore take little part in the transfer of nutrients. Reproduction The pugnose shiner reaches sexual maturity between the ages of 1 and 2 for both the male and female genders. They are an oviparous species and spawning and fertilization occur in summer between May and July. The female distributes her eggs in shallow water in areas of dense vegetation in which she lays between 530 and 1275 eggs. Once the eggs are fertilized, they generally hatch within one or two days. This species does not spend energy in parental investment so after the eggs are laid and fertilized, the male and female leave the eggs. In pugnose shiners, sexual dimorphism occurs and they have a polygynandrous mating system, meaning that both males and females have multiple mates. Sexes are physically different in that the males' pelvic fins go beyond the anal openings while the females' don't. Conservation status The conservation status of the pugnose shiner has been changing quite a bit in the past few years. This is partly because its status is dependent on where the species population is. In Canada, the pugnose shiner is currently listed as endangered but the status varies by state in the United States. This species has been declining through the upper midwest because of turbidity, decreasing vegetation, and invasive species within its home. There are multiple subpopulations of pugnose shiner but there is limited connection between the different populations because of low dispersal potential. It was listed as Near Threatened in 2010 but as of 2014, the pugnose shiner has been of Least Concern status. It has patterns of population decline so it is continually on concern conservation attention. Etymology The pugnose shiner genus name Notropis comes from Greek descent and it is a name given to shriveled-like specimens. It translates to the words \\"back keel\\". The species name anogenus is also from Greek descent and it translates to \\"without a chin\\".

Morton was raised with strong Puritan influences in England and attended Oxford (1649-1652). As a result of the English Revolution, he was arrested and excommunicated for promoting progressive education (he was the teacher of Daniel Defoe), forcing his immigration to relative safety in Massachusetts Bay Colony (1685-1686), although he was soon arrested for sedition (and then acquitted) in Boston. His system of vernacular teaching at Harvard was basically Scholastic/Aristotelian with modern flavors of John Wallis, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, and even Ren√© Descartes. His works include discussions of astrology and alchemy, and (as a minister) he was known to have some interest in witchcraft.Godbeer, R. The Devil's Dominion: Magic and Religion in Early New England.

As a result, Compendium Physicae is now considered to be semi-scientific, and although the work contains then-modern references to Galileo, Torricelli, and gravity, his ancient/medieval Aristotelian approach was eventually replaced by Newtonian mechanics (Principia was also published in 1687).Robbins, A.B. History of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers. Gateway Press, 2001. Life He was born at Pendavy, Egloshayle, in Cornwall, and baptised there on 15 February 1627, the eldest son of Nicholas Morton, who married, on 11 May 1616, Frances, only daughter of Thomas Kestell of Pendavy. He was probably the Charles Morton, undergraduate of New Inn Hall, Oxford, who submitted on 4 May 1648 to the jurisdiction of the parliamentary visitors. On 7 September 1649 he was elected a scholar of Wadham College, and he graduated B.A. 6 November 1649, M.A. 24 June 1652, being also incorporated at Cambridge in 1653. At Oxford he was known as a mathematician and highly thought of by John Wilkins. In 1655 Morton was appointed to the rectory of Blisland in Cornwall, but he was ejected after the 1662 Act of Uniformity, whereupon he retired to a small tenement, his own property, in St Ive. He lost property through the Great Fire of London, and went to London to support himself. Morton was probably the ‚ÄòCharles Morton, presbyterian,‚Äô who in 1672 was licensed for a room in his dwelling-house in Kennington. A few years later he ran at Newington Green, in those days a village north of London, the leading school for Dissenters, \\"probably on the site of the current Unitarian church\\".The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16 by Alex Allardyce. Newington Green Action Group: 2008. p7. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography judges Morton's \\"probably the most impressive of the dissenting academies [prior to 1685], enrolling as many as fifty pupils at a time\\". The ODNB goes on to describe its advanced and varied curriculum (religion, classics, history, geography, mathematics, natural science, politics, and modern languages) and a well-equipped laboratory, and even \\"a bowling green for recreation\\". Lectures were given in English, not Latin, and Daniel Defoe, one of Morton's students, praised its attention to the mother tongue. Many dissenting ministers, including John Shower, Samuel Lawrence, Thomas Reynolds, and William Hocker, were educated by Morton. Another of his pupils was Samuel Shute.Dictionary of National Biography, article on Shute. Such schools were both controversial and outside the letter of the law. Samuel Wesley the elder, a contemporary of Defoe's, described his teacher \\"as universal in his learning\\",Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Morton. but in 1703 attacked the dissenting academies, including Morton's, in his ‚ÄòLetter from a Country Divine'. A pamphlet war ensued, with the academies defended by the Rev. Samuel Palmer in ‚ÄòA Defence of the Dissenters' Education in their Private Academies,‚Äô to which Wesley replied in ‚ÄòA Defence of a Letter on the Education of Dissenters,‚Äô 1704, and Palmer retorted with ‚ÄòA Vindication of the Learning, Loyalty, Morals of the Dissenters. In answer to Mr. Wesley,‚Äô 1705. Legal actions from the bishop's court made Morton decide to emigrate. He arrived in New England in July 1686 with his wife, his pupil, Samuel Penhallow, and his nephew, Charles Morton, M.D. Another nephew had preceded them in 1685. It had been proposed that Morton should become the principal of Harvard College, but another person was appointed before his arrival. He was, however, made a member of the corporation of the college and its first vice- president, and he drew up a system of logic and a compendium of physics, which were for many years two of its text-books. Lectures on philosophy which he read in his own rooms were attended by several students from the college, and one or two discontented scholars desired to become inmates of his house, but these proceedings gave offence to the governing body. Morton was also inducted as minister of the first church in Charlestown, New England, on 5 November 1686, and was the first clergyman of the town who solemnised marriages. He was prosecuted for alleged seditious expressions in a sermon preached on 2 September 1687, but was acquitted. His name is the second of the petitioners to the council on 2 October 1693 for some encouragement to a system of propagating Christianity among the Native Americans, and his was the senior signature to an association for mutual assistance among the ministers of New England. He acted with those who urged the prosecutions for witchcraft at Salem, Massachusetts. About 1694 Morton's health began to fail. He died at Charlestown on 11 April 1698, and was buried on 14 April, his funeral being attended by the officers of Harvard College and its students. By his will, dated November 1697, he left money to Harvard; his houses and lands at Charlestown and in Cornwall with the rest of his property passed to his two nephews, Charles and John Morton, and his niece in equal shares. An epitaph was written for him by the Rev. Simon Bradstreet, his successor in the ministry. Works He was the author of the English language Compendium Physicae (1687), an early American textbook on astronomy and physics.Compendium Physicae. Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, Vol XXXIII, 237pp, 1940. The textbook was also known as [A] System of Physicks, and was among the most important texts in natural philosophy in early America, used to teach science and the scientific method to students at both Harvard and Yale from the late 1680s through the late 1720s.http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.530.Sy8-ead.xml;query=;brand=default Morton's later treatise, which posited that birds migrated to the moon, was the earliest treatise on bird migration in England. Compendium Physicae was probably completed prior to his immigration to America (around 1680), and all extant original copies (roughly 20) are traced to Harvard or Yale. Samuel Eliot Morison's transcription of 'Compendium Physicae' is published in \\"Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts\\" vol. 33 (Boston: 1940). A Logick System is transcribed by Rick Kennedy in \\"Aristotelian and Cartesian Logic at Harvard,\\" \\"Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts\\" vol. 67 (Boston: 1995).

It is precisely the water flow and preferred clarity of water that makes survival difficult. Since the popeye shiner lives in pristine clear water, any contamination may adversely affect this property and subsequently diminish the ability of these fish to thrive. Industrialization may lead to sedimentation as well as siltation due to increased runoff as a result of agricultural practices. Over time, the erosion will create an unsuitable habitat for the popeye shiner, and species abundance will decrease. Another source of habitat destruction includes pollution. Based on the size of the streams the popeye shiner inhabits, it has likely been exposed to more of these negative impacts than other fish. Similarly, the rate at which these bodies of water flow is in jeopardy. Popeye shiners inhabit slowly or moderately flowing rivers or creeks. The industrial practice of building dams may result in a modification of the flow, and, like increased siltation, transform rivers into unsuitable habitats for the popeye shiner.

This could potentially be due to destruction of their preferred habitat, as industrialization (i.e. logging, damming, strip mining) continues, although a better culprit may be due to the influx of invasive species.Simon, TP. 2006. Biodiversity of fishes in the Wabash River: status, indicators and threats. Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, 115(2), 136-148. Very little is being done to manage the Popeye shiner.

In Indiana, an influx of three species of Asian carp‚Äîgrass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), bighead carp (Hypothalmichthys nobilis), and silver carp (Hypothalmichthys molitrix)‚Äîlikely contributed to the total extirpation of the Popeye shiner.

This fish is a slender, slivery minnow with a dusky lateral stripe and a maximum total length of about 80 mm. Its distinct characteristic is its large-diameter eyes. It is a common species in upland streams of the middle Mississippi River system. Bigeye shiners prefer warm, quiet pools with clear water and silt-free substrates. Siltation, channelization, and gravel dredging are all threats to bigeye shiner populations.Rice, Daniel, Mark Barnes, and George Phinney. 1998. A review and recent records of the bigeye shiner, Notropis boops (Cyprinidae), in Ohio. \\"Ohio Journal of Science\\" 98(3):42-51. During spawning season, typically late April to August, bigeye shiners have several clutches of eggs. State agencies and the EPA have both played a role in the surveying of bigeye shiner populations. Populations have decreased in Ohio due mostly to habitat destruction. In addition to habitat destruction by humans, habitat alteration of the small streams and dried pools has also had a significant effect on abundance. Rivers and streams should not be channelized or modified in any way, which is becoming an increasingly popular trend in urban locations. Agricultural areas and properties within the watershed should adhere to regulations to prevent runoff into the streams. Distribution The bigeye shiner is a common species in upland streams of the middle Mississippi River system, including the eastern highlands of Kentucky, Tennessee, and northern Alabama, the Ozark and Ouachita highlands of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, and subhighland regions of northern Louisiana and southeastern Kansas. In Ohio, siltation of stream bottoms and higher water turbidity that accompanied agricultural development of the lowland parts of the state may have eliminated remaining relict populations and threatened established, larger populations. Dams also can separate populations and ultimately fragment the habitat to where a population can no longer survive. Dams are also responsible for temperature and flow variability, sediment accumulation, and altered dissolved oxygen. Overall, habitat fragmentation and destruction are responsible for the extirpation of Notropis boops in many waterways.  Ecology  Bigeye shiners inhabit flowing, usually clear and rocky, pools of creeks and small to medium rivers. The benthic environment includes a substrate of gravel, rock, or sand. They are often found near emergent vegetation along the stream margin. Higher- gradient streams are typically ideal because they carry silt out of pools more effiencently than low-gradient streams. Being benthopelagic, the bigeye shiner lives and feeds near both the bottom of the river and near the surface. The bigeye shiner is a sight feeder; it preys mostly on small insects hovering at the water surface. It also preys on small aquatic invertebrates. Because the bigeye shiner relies on sight to find prey, the water quality is important. Turbidity and siltation are major threats to their success.  Life history  Most of these fish spawn during their second summer, with only a few surviving to spawn the following season. Egg diameter frequencies suggest that individuals spawn more than one clutch per season.Lehtinen, Steven and Echelle, Anthony. 1979. Reproductive cycle of Notropis boops in Brier Creek, Marshall County, Oklahoma. American Midland Naturalist 102(2):237-243. Several variables play a role in when the spawning season occurs for N.boops. Temperature and rainfall are both the major contributing factors to their reproductive cycles. They spawn from June into August in Kansas and Missouri. Some males with breeding tubercles and females with mature eggs have been present from April into August. This occurrence is more popular in southern populations of Notropis boops. Increased sediment from agricultural runoff or the installation of dams has affected their ability to successfully reproduce.  Current management  Currently, very little management of the bigeye shiner is occurring. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species,International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of threatened Species http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/full/202292/0 the species is of relatively low conservation concern and does not require significant additional protection or major management, monitoring, or research action.

(2000) American Aquarium Fishes. Texas: Texas A&M; University Press. p. 99 This shiner can be found in a few streams located in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. It inhabits rocky pools of clear headwaters, creeks and small rivers. Adults range in length from 40 to 55 mm (1.6 to 2.2 in).Self, R. and Bettinger, J. (2015). Supplemental Volume: Species of Conservation Concern; Redlip shiner [Pamphlet]. SC: South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.  Description  The redlip shiner is characterized by bright red lips with a similar coloration in the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. The body is slender and compressed, with the dorsal fin origin slightly behind pelvic fin origin.Burr, B. and Page, L. (1991). Peterson Field Guides: Freshwater Fishes. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company pp. 141-142 The muzzle is acuminate and greater than the interorbital width. The maxillary extends beyond anterior rim of orbit and the premaxillaries are opposite of the middle of the pupil.Everman, B. W. and Jordan, D.S. (1963) The Fishes of North and Middle America (Vol. 1). Jersey City: T.F.H. Publications. p. 287 They have large eyes and a slightly subterminal mouth. The pharyngeal tooth count for the redlip shiner is 2, 4-4, 2.Samuel, E. (1969) How to Know the Freshwater Fishes. Dubuque: Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers. p. 117 The length of the body, not including the caudal fin, is four times the length of the head and five and a half times the body depth. These shiners have around 34-37 lateral scales and seven rows of scales between the base of the dorsal fin and lateral line. There is also an average of 14-18 scales before the dorsal fin. The lateral line is strongly decurved and a thin golden band is present along its upper margin. A wider and silver band, located along the flank, stretches from the head and ends at a dark caudal spot. N. chiliticus usually have eight or nine anal rays. An olivaceous color is dominant in redlip shiners, along with scattered black blotches on the side of the body. Mature males become very colorful during breeding season. They obtain a scarlet-red color in their eyes and on their underbelly, while their heads become a bright yellow-gold. Males' fins also become a bright yellow-gold color and the red of their lips seems more pronounced during this time.  Habitat & Distribution  The redlip shiner occupies flowing pools of clear headwaters, creeks, and small rivers of the Piedmont and Appalachian Mountains. It is believed to be established in the New River drainage and Cape Fear drainage in North Carolina and Virginia. This shiner has a very limited distribution in South Carolina, which is the southernmost extreme portion of its range. It is thought that Notropis chiliticus, along with several other Notropis species, might have been introduced in areas such as the PeeDee drainage. Though this is a possibility, the historical absence of redlip shiners in these areas may be due to inadequate sampling.Hocutt, C. H. and Wiley, E. O. (1986) The Zoogeography of North American Freshwater Fishes. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. pp. 166, 193 N. chiliticus prefers cold to cool water temperatures and areas with sand-gravel or rubble bottom.  Behavior & Reproduction  The redlip shiner breeds at 53 to 62 ¬∞F (11.6 to 16.6 ¬∞C). Males will aggregate over nests of Nocomis leptocephalus. The female initiates spawning by swimming over a nest until she is pursued. The nest is built in small pits and once the male drives the female to the nest, clasping occurs. Near these functional nests are artificial nests that are not used by the fish. This suggests that the presence of live Nocomis leptocephalus is attractive to N. chiliticus. This behavior towards Nocomis has also been observed in other species of Notropis. Redlip shiners reach maturity in 1 to 2 years and spawn around the month of May.Jenkins, R.E and N.M. Burkhead (1993) Freshwater Fishes of Virginia. Bethesda: American Fisheries Society N. chiliticus are often found in groups of a dozen or more in the middle of the water column. They are often mixed with Luxilus cerasinus and other minnows.

It is a part of the Global War on Terror. Government crackdown against al-Qaeda cells began in 2001, escalating steadily until 14 January 2010, when Yemen declared open war on al-Qaeda. In addition to battling al-Qaeda across several provinces, Yemen was forced to contend with a Shia insurgency in the north and militant separatists in the south. Fighting with al-Qaeda escalated further during the course of the 2011 Yemeni revolution, with Jihadists seizing most of the Abyan Governorate and declaring it an Emirate. A second wave of violence began in early 2012, with militants claiming territory across the southwest amid heavy combat with government forces. On 16 September 2014, a full-scale civil war erupted after Houthi fighters stormed Sana'a and ousted interim President Hadi, fracturing the Yemeni government between the UN recognized government of President Hadi and the Houthis' newly formed Supreme Political Council. The full-scale civil war led to a rise of Islamist Groups (Al-Qaeda, ISIS), insurgencies (Houthis) and call for separation of South Yemen. Background Prior to hostilities, Yemen had already come under pressure to act against al-Qaeda, since attacks on its two main allies, Saudi Arabia and the United States, were primarily conducted by militants based in Yemen Previous attacks linked to al-Qaeda in Yemen include the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, the 2008 American Embassy attack, and several other attacks against foreign tourists. Yemen had intensified operations against al-Qaeda in late 2009, when a Yemen-based wing of the group claimed to be behind the failed 25 December 2009 attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner, itself a retaliation against an attack against a training camp in Abyan on 17 December, resulting in the deaths of multiple civilians. News reports have indicated substantial American involvement in support of Yemeni operations against al-Qaeda since late 2009, including training, intelligence sharing, \\"several dozen troops\\" from the Joint Special Operations Command, and limited direct involvement in counter-terrorism operations.

According to ABC News, American cruise missiles were also part of the raids.

Several militants including local leaders of Al Qaeda were killed during the clashes. On 25 August 2010, Yemeni authorities claimed to regain control of the southern town of Lawdar, a great part of which was in the grip of suspected Al-Qaeda militants during days of clashes with the army. =Further attacks in Zinjibar= On 25 August 2010, gunmen on motorcycles attacked a military patrol in Yemen's restive south on Wednesday, killing four soldiers and wounding one, a security official said. The official said an early investigation indicated the attackers were members of al-Qaida, which lately appears to have stepped up high-profile attacks in the south of this impoverished country. He did not provide details. The attack occurred in the Abyan provincial capital of Zinjibar and brought to 53 the number of soldiers killed by al-Qaida since May, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. =Battle of Huta= On 20 September 2010, a number of militants attacked and took control of the village of Hota in the southern parts of the country, prompting the Army to counter-attack. This happened as the top U.S. counterterrorism advisor John O. Brennan was on a visit to Yemen and discussed cooperation in the fight against Al-Qaeda, according to the White House. Brennan met President Ali Abdullah Saleh and delivered a letter from Obama expressing U.S. support for a \\"unified, stable, democratic and prosperous Yemen\\", National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement. \\"President Saleh and Mr Brennan discussed cooperation against the continuing threat of Al-Qaeda, and Mr Brennan conveyed the United States' condolences to the Yemeni people for the loss of Yemeni security officers and citizens killed in recent Al-Qaeda attacks, \\" Hammer said. Al-Qaeda militants besieged in the southern Yemeni town of Hota were reportedly using residents as human shields in the second major clash between them and troops in recent weeks. According to officials \\"al-Qaeda elements are preventing residents from leaving Hota, to use them as human shields\\". On 24 September 2010, the government siege of al-Hota ended after security forces took control of the town in the southern province of Shabwa.FACTBOX-Security developments in Yemen Reuters Revolution (2011) *8 January 2011: Armed suspected al-Qaeda militants attacked a Yemeni army checkpoint in Lahj killing 4 soldiers a day after 12 soldiers were killed in an ambush in Lawdar. *6 March 2011: Armed suspected Al Qaeda gunmen shoot dead 4 soldiers from the elite Republican Guard as they passed in a truck near Marib. *26 March 2011: al-Qaeda captured the town of Jaar in the southern part of Yemen. *27 March 2011: al-Qaeda militants captured the town of al-Husn, the strategic mountain of Khanfar, and a weapons factory. Fighting in Jaar captured the day prior is being reported. *31 March 2011: Al-Qaeda Emirate in Yemen is declared Aftermath= Battle of Zinjibar  On 27 May 2011, about 300 Islamic militants attacked and captured the coastal city of Zinjibar (population 20,000). During the takeover of the town, the militants killed seven soldiers, including a colonel, and one civilian. In the months that followed the militants entrenched themselves within the city as the Army resorted to aerial bombardment and artillery attacks. The insurgents responded with daily bombings and suicide attacks. By the end of the year almost 800 had been killed in total, with casualties almost equal on both sides. Situation in Yemen in October 2011. On 4 March 2012, militants launched an attack against an Army artillery battalion on the outskirts of Zinjibar, overrunning it and killing 187 soldiers and wounding 135. 32 al-Qaeda fighters were also killed during the fighting. The militants attacked the Army base with booby-trapped vehicles and managed to capture armored vehicles, tanks, weapons and munitions. The military reported 55 soldiers were captured while the militant group claimed up to 73 were in fact taken prisoner. The assault started with a diversionary attack on one end of the base, with the main militant force attacking the other end of the compound. Several car bombs were detonated in front of the gates, after which the attackers entered the base, capturing heavy weapons and turning them against the soldiers. Reinforcements from other nearby military bases came too late due to a sandstorm. It was also revealed that previous military claims of taking back the city were untrue, with the militants still controlling most of Zinjibar and a few surrounding towns, namely Jaar where they paraded the captured soldiers. In the days following the attack, the military conducted airstrikes against militant positions around Zinjibar which they claimed killed 42 al-Qaeda fighters.185 Yemeni Troops Dead in al-Qaeda Attack The Ansar al-Sharia group that took responsibility for the attack was believed to be just a re-branding of al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, to make it more appealing to the devout rural population. Three days after the attack, the group let a Red Cross team into Jaar to treat 12 wounded soldiers, and demanded a prisoner exchange with the government. After the beginning of fighting around the city of Lawdar in early April 2011, violence escalated around Zinjibar as well. At least six militants and two Yemeni soldiers were killed in a shootout on 19 April 2012. A major army operation followed in the end of the same month, with hundreds of troops advancing against militant positions in Abyan province. Troops managed to reach the center of Zinjibar after several days of fighting, including an intense six-hour battle towards the end on 25 April 2012. Three militants had been killed on the 23rd, and at least 46 died in the province during the next two days, including 15 near Lowdar. Government casualties were initially not released, while meanwhile leaflets and a video released by Ansar al-Sharia contained threats to kill the 85 captive Yemeni soldiers unless the government withdraws its forces. Many of the Islamist forces operating in Abyan province refer to themselves as Ansar al-Sharia (\\"Partisans of Islamic Law\\"). Post- Saleh (2012‚Äì2013) On 14 January 2012, hundreds of people displaced by months of fighting were allowed to return to their homes in Zinjibar after a temporary deal was reached between insurgent forces and the army units. Locals described \\"widespread\\" destruction across the city and several mine fields that the army warned them about. According to reports, the militants held the western part of the city, while the east was controlled by government forces. Thousands of people previously held protests demanding an end to the fighting that has forced them to flee their homes in the south, holding several 50 km (31-mile) marches from the port city of Aden to Zinjibar. Estimates of the number of people displaced from the government operations against the militants had risen to nearly 97,000. Situation in March 2012 Attacks continued during the next weeks, including a suicide bombing on 13 March 2012 near al-Bayda that killed four soldiers and left four other critically injured. After this attack militants posted a video in which they announced the capture of yet another soldier, bringing the total number of prisoners they hold to 74. They demanded an agreement to free imprisoned insurgents in exchange for the soldiers. On 31 March 2012, a large group of militants attacked an Army checkpoint in Lahij Governorate during the night, sparking a battle that left 20 soldiers and 4 insurgents dead. The attackers fled with heavy weapons and at least two tanks. Government forces later called in airstrikes that successfully destroyed one of the captured tanks, killing its three occupants. On 12 December 2013, security officials say more than 40 people have been killed in sectarian clashes between Sunni Islamic militants and northern rebel forces belonging to a branch of Shiites in northern Yemen. The officials say the fighting began when ultraconservative Salafis took over a Hawthi stronghold in a strategic mountainous area near the border with Saudi Arabia. The two sides battled with artillery fire, mortar shells and machine guns in the town of al-Fagga. =Second Battle of Lowdar= On 9 April 2012, a large group of militants attacked an Army base near the city of Lawdar and briefly overran it during a battle where locals had to join the military to help drive them out. There were at least 94 people killed in that initial attack, including six civilians, seventy-four insurgents and fourteen soldiers. This was the third such assault in recent weeks, after two similar attacks in March left at least 130 soldiers dead and more than 70 as prisoners of al-Qaeda affiliated groups. Government sources raised the casualty figures yet again on 10 April 2012, bringing the total to 124 dead in two days‚Äîincluding 102 militants, 14 soldiers and at least eight civilians. Local tribal sources confirmed the toll, adding that among the dead insurgents there were at least 12 Somalis and a number of Saudis. Reinforcements were being brought into the area as Air Force planes began bombing insurgent positions near Lowdar and on the main road towards Zinjibar. At least 51 deaths were recorded on 11 April 2012, most of them al-Qaeda-linked fighters. These included 42 militants, six soldiers and three local militia members. The government reportedly sent an elite anti-terrorism squad to help in defeating the militants. As of 13 April 2012 the battle was still raging around the city with clashes spreading to nearby Mudiyah, the only other town apart from Lowdar that insurgents do not control in the province. Mortar shelling was reported for the second consecutive day by local citizens, with at least 17 civilians injured and the main power station reportedly on fire. After the government sent an additional 200 members of an anti-terrorism unit militants pulled out of the city and back towards the nearby villages of Um Sorra and Wadhia, leaving a few snipers behind. The official death toll on 13 April 2012 stood at 37, including 31 militants, five members of a tribal civilian militia and a child that was shot by an unidentified sniper. Authorities reported the city to be relatively quiet on Saturday, with only sporadic gunfire breaking the silence. On Sunday a suicide bomber killed two tribal militia members at a checkpoint in al-Hodn, just outside Lawdar. Six militants and two locals were killed in other clashes around the town, specifically in an area called al- Minyasa. After a few quiet days, fighting resumed on 18 April 2012, with militants shelling the city and government forces ordering airstrikes in retaliation. Two children were killed and at least five houses were destroyed during the mortar attacks, while six militants were confirmed dead in the airstrikes. The previous day a suicide car bomber had attacked an army checkpoint on the outskirts of Lowdar, killing five Yemeni soldiers and injuring four more. On 19 April 2012 at least seven militants were killed after clashes with an Army unit based in Lowdar. 25 tay s√∫ng al-Qaeda b·ªã gi·∫øt t·∫°i Yemen On 21 April 2012, Yemeni airplanes bombed militant positions in nearby Jebel Yasuf and al-Minyasa, killing at least 13 fighters. On 25 April 2012 at least six militants were killed after their convoy was ambushed by local militia members. Fifteen insurgents were killed two days earlier after a similar incident. Fighting around the city on 30 April 2012 killed 12 militants, a soldier and a tribal militia member. Meanwhile, insurgents continued their attacks across the country, as an army checkpoint near Aden was assaulted by a group of armed men in pickup trucks. In the ensuing gunbattle at least eight attackers and four Yemeni soldier were killed, while three al-Qaida fighters and one security force member were wounded. Additionally, militants kidnapped a senior intelligence officer and two soldiers in the town of Radda south of the capital Sana'a. The town was briefly lost to the terrorist groups in January, before being taken back by government forces a few weeks later. By 16 May 2012, Yemen troops backed pro- government tribal militias captured the Yasouf mountain, a strategic force above the city, after heavy fighting. After doing so, it was announced that the militants had fled Lawder. =2012 Sana'a bombing= On 21 May 2012, a soldier detonated a suicide bomb in a crowd of military personnel at the beginning of a rehearsal for a Unity Day parade in Sana'a. The bomb killed 96 and wounded more than 200, making it the deadliest attack in Yemen's history. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility and described it as \\"revenge\\" for the continued offensive by the Central Security Organization. 2013 In May 2013, Al-Qaeda attackers blew up Yemen's main oil pipeline, halting the flow of exported crude oil. Oil exportion represents 70% of the state budget. In late May 2013, Long War Journal reported that AQAP had been active in Hadramout Governorate over the past several months and that on the 24 May 2013, they took seized control of villages near the Yemeni port city of Mukallah in what an apparent bid to take over swathes of Hadramout Governorate. The Interior Ministry said the seizure was a \\"terrorist plot to proclaim an Islamic emirate in the Ghayl Bawazir area;‚Äù residents of Ghayl Bawazir said that the jihadists had taken advantage of an absence of security forces from the area to deploy in strength and had already distributed leaflets declaring their rule. The Long War Journal reported that on 6 December 2013, AQAP militants assaulted the Ministry of Defense building in Sana‚Äôa in what it claimed was an effort to strike at the US' drone program 52 people were killed including 7 foreign nationals (2 German and 2 Vietnamese doctors and 1 Indian and 2 Filipino nurses) and 11 AQAP fighters. 2014 In 2014, AQAP claimed responsibility for over 150 attacks in Yemen, using tactics such as IEDs, suicide bombings, and small-arms attacks; targeting both Houthis and Yemeni military and government institutions, including military bases, the Presidential palace in Sana‚Äôa, military checkpoints and vehicles, and the police academy in Sana‚Äôa, killing over 75 Yemeni government or military personnel. By early January 2014, AQAP had regrouped in Hadramout Governorate and other provinces after losing control of major cities in Abyan and Shabwa provinces to government forces starting in late spring 2012. Hadramout was the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, and the province has become an AQAP stronghold over the past several years. On 16 January 2014, al- Qaeda militants killed 10 Yemeni soldiers in three simultaneous attacks on army positions in Al Bayda Governorate. Eight extremists were also killed in the assaults, which prompted further clashes with the army. Al-Qaeda assailants carried out simultaneous attacks against three military positions in Rada in Bayda, an extremist stronghold, the official said. On 24 March 2014, al-Qaeda militants attacked a military checkpoint near Reida in the province of Hadramawt, located 135 km (85 miles) east of the provincial capital Mukalla. Twenty soldiers were killed as a result. On 29 April 2014, the BBC reported that the Yemeni military, with tribal leaders and locals, had launched an offensive against AQAP militants in Abyan and Shabwa provinces, Saba News Agency described the \\"extensive.\\" The areas targeted included Abyan's al-Mahfad district and Azzan in Shabwa, security sources told the Associated Press news agency that 8 suspected AQAP militants and three soldiers were killed in the offensive, another report said 15 soldiers were killed in Shabwa province in a suspected ambush by AQAP fighters. Yemeni officials earlier in the month said that as many as 55 militants died in a government air campaign over Shabwa, Abyan and the nearby province of Bayda. In July 2014, AQAP declared plans to establish an Islamic emirate in Hadramout province ordering men and women to obey its strict interpretation of Islamic law. On 17 August 2014, six suspected al-Qaeda militants and three Yemeni soldiers died in clashes in the southeastern Hadramawt province, which became scene of many recent attacks on the army. On 31 August 2014, at least 11 Yemeni soldiers have been killed and 17 others injured by suspected al-Qaeda militants in three separate attacks in the southern part of the country. Yemeni Civil War (2015) On 16 September 2014, a full-scale civil war erupted after Houthi fighters stormed Sana'a and ousted interim President Hadi, fracturing the Yemeni government between the UN recognized government of President Hadi and the Houthis newly formed and led Supreme Political Council. The full-scale civil war led to a rise of AQAP who used the chaos to their advantage and gained influence in Yemeni territory. On 25 November 2014, Yemeni special forces supported by U.S. special forces rescued 8 hostages, killed 7 militants and a member of the Yemeni forces wounded in a rescue mission. On the 31 December 2014, a suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a cultural center during celebrations of the Prophet Muhammed's birthday, killing 23 people. On 7 January 2015, a large car bomb detonated outside a Police Academy in Sanaa, Yemen. The attack killed at least 38 and wounded over 90. In mid-January 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared it had established a branch inside Yemen the previous month, and that they were recruiting fighters, bringing them into competition against AQAP. The United States and the United Kingdom withdrew their forces in March 2015 as a result of the escalation of the civil war. =MukallaCapture of Mukalla Al-Qaeda scored a major victory on 2 April 2015, taking advantage of chaos created by a full-scale conflict in southwestern Yemen and foreign airstrikes elsewhere in the country to capture the city of Mukalla from government forces. Al-Qaeda militants freed some 300 inmates from a jail in the city. The New York Times reported: \\"Al Qaeda‚Äôs strongest opponents, the Houthis and Yemen‚Äôs American-trained counterterrorism troops, have been busy fending off attacks from the Saudi military.\\" Liberation of Mukalla On 24 April 2016 the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces entered Mukalla and commenced operations against AQAP, liberating Mukalla in 36 hours. The operation was hailed by US Defence Scetary James Mattis as a model of fighting terrorism. Mukalla was then used as a base of operations by the UAE Armed Forces and Joint Special Operations Command, allowing the CIA to target AQAP strongest cells in Yemen. 2016 In February 2016 Al-Qaeda forces and Saudi-led coalition forces were both seen fighting Houthi rebels in the same battle. In April 2016, It was reported that MI6 teams with members of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment seconded to them had been operating in Yemen; training Yemen forces fighting AQAP and identifying targets for drone strikes. On 6 May 2016, it was reported that a small number of U.S. military personnel had been deployed to Yemen two weeks previously to support Arab forces fighting AQAP in the country. They have been supporting Yemeni and Emirati forces fighting in Mukalla by planning operations and providing other assistance. The U.S. has also staged over 2,000 to 4,500 U.S. Marines of the 13th MEU offshore in a flotilla that includes the USS Boxer, supported by the USS Gravely and the USS Gonzalez. 2017 On 29 January 2017, The New York Times reported that SEALs from SEAL Team Six carried out a surprise dawn attack on an AQAP headquarters in Bayda Province that a senior American official said counterterrorism officials had deemed valuable enough to warrant a ground operation rather than an airstrike. The raid lasted a little less than an hour, one American commando was killed and three others were injured, an estimated 14 Qaeda fighters were killed in the raid, which according to the statement, led to \\"the capture of information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots.\\" A senior American official said a MV-22 Osprey that was sent to evacuate the wounded troops in the raid crash- landed nearby, leaving two more service members injured and was unable to fly after the landing therefore it was intentionally destroyed by American airstrikes. In April 2017, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Qassim Al-Raymi, issued a statement that his terrorist organization will keep fighting the \\"Houthi Shia\\" in Yemen. Al-Raymi also said he is ready to make truce with Yemen President Hadi government and to set for negotiations but with conditions. Both al-Qaeda and ISIS are fighting the Houthi rebels in Yemen. On 6 August 2017, The New York Times reported that, about 2,000 Yemeni troops, supported by dozens of advisers from the United Arab Emirates and a handful of US special forces personnel providing intelligence and planning assistance, launched an offensive against AQAP militants occupying parts of Shabwa Province the preceding week. In addition the US is providing air-to-air refueling and aerial reconnaissance for forces involved in the operation. 2018 On 22 July 2018, a suspected U.S. drone strike kills four alleged al-Qaeda militants in Ma'rib. In August 2018, Al Jazeera reported that a Saudi Arabian-led coalition \\"battling Houthi rebels secured secret deals with al- Qaeda in Yemen and recruited hundreds of the group's fighters... an investigation by The Associated Press found the coalition has been paying some al-Qaeda commanders to leave key cities and towns while letting others retreat with weapons, equipment, and wads of looted cash. Key figures in the deal- making said the United States was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone attacks against the armed group, which was created by Osama bin Laden in 1988.\\" UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi in an interview responded to the accusations by saying that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with, explaining that many of his soldiers died fighting them. The UAE Armed Forces released a statement that accusations of allowing AQAP to leave with cash contradicts their primary objective of hindering AQAP of its financial strength. The United States Pentagon responded to the accusations by stating they are false. Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, called the news source \\"patently false\\". The governor of Hadramut Faraj al-Bahsani also dismissed the accusations that Al Qaeda has joined with the coalition rank, stating that if they did there would be sleeper cells and that he would be \\"the first one to be killed\\". According to The Independent, AQAP activity on social media as well as the number of terror attacks conducted by them has decreased since the Emirati intervention. =Operation Decisive Sword= On 26 February 2018, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces launched a counter-terrorism operation in Shabwa governorate against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The UAE Armed Forces carried out the operation alongside the Shabwani Elite Forces. The UAE-led operation was launched two days after ISIS in Yemen killed 14 people and wounded 40 while attempting to storm a counter-terrorism headquarter in Aden, southern Yemen. Using Mukalla as a base to retake Shabwa's al-Said district (Wadi Yeshbum). AQAP had used this site‚Äîthe former area controlled by the influential AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki before he was killed in 2011‚Äî to recruit and train extremists. The operation was successful in securing control over several areas in the Shabwa governorate.https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/saudi-led-coalition-cracks- down-on-al-qaeda-in-yemen-1.708090 =Operation Sweeping Torrent= Two weeks after the last offensive, the United Arab Armed Forces began another operation in Abyan province called Operation Sweeping Torrent alongside forces from the Security Belt on 7 March 2018. They used Aden as a base to secure Wadi Hamara and al-Mahfad in Abyan governorate. Abyan is seen as important because it is a crossroad linking the Emirati-influenced regions of Aden and Hadramawt while also providing access to Bayda, the central governorate most infiltrated by extremists. Abu Mohesen Basabreen, an Al-Qaeda leader, was killed while fighting with the Security Belt Forces (SBF). According to the UAE, heavy losses have been incurred already by AQAP.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180308-uae-operation-sweeping- torrent-unleashed-in-yemen/ =Operation Crushing Revenge= UAE-backed Security Belt Forces continued to carry out counterterrorism campaigns targeting AQAP enclaves in Abyan, Shabwa and Hadramawt. In particular, in Abyan's Mudiya district, Security Belt forces launched 'Operation Crushing Revenge' in December 2018.https://www.criticalthreats.org/briefs/gulf-of-aden- security-review/gulf-of-aden-security-review- december-13-2018https://www.alayyam.info/news/7MKYA2KI-YRSQF6 The military operation comes three weeks after the assassination in Aden of Colonel Fahed Gharama, who commanded Security Belt Forces in Lawder district in Abyan province. The operation involved carrying out operations against AQAP forces in Shabwa's as-Said district and western Hadramawt.https://amp.thenational.ae/world/mena/al-qaeda-commanders-killed-in- clashes-with-uae-backed-forces-in-yemen-1.802128 Earlier in December, AQAP cells broke into the Al Fathan area coming from Al Bayda province. According to the Security Belt Force military source, the operation was launched once intel regarding AQAP presence was received. Two Al Qaeda commanders, Abu Al Darda Al Baydhani and Abu Qusai Al Adeni, were reportedly killed in the clashes. The fighting took place in the mountainous area in Al Fathan in Moudiya district. The campaign was intended to track down Al Qaeda militia who were not killed during the operations in Abyan and find the AQAP cells that infiltrated the area. According to the Security Belt spokesman, dozens of Al Qaeda members were killed. The Security Belt Force involved in the operation numbered 10,000 soldiers. AQAP fired mortars from hilltop positions. Security Belt Forces imposed a siege around the area for three days and kept counter shelling using artillery until they had full control over the area.https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2019_83.pdf According to the military source, despite the ongoing military operations by Security Belt Forces in the province, AQAP militants continue to hold pockets of territory in northwest Moudiya district. 2019 On 7 April 2019, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces alongside the Security Belt forces launched a large anti-terror military campaign to clear a number of mountains and valleys located in the Mahfad town, a key previous hideout of AQAP militants. UAE-backed Yemeni security forces succeeded in seizing arms and ammunition, including hand grenades, improvised explosive devices and communication equipment inside the mountainous hideouts of the al-Qaida militants who fled to other areas as a result of the campaign. On 30 August 2019, warplanes of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces launched airstrikes on AQAP in southern Yemen. A number of moving vehicles carrying AQAP members were precisely targeted. AQAP local commanders named as Abu Baraa Baidhani and Al-Khader Judeeb were within the armed convoy struck by UAE airstrikes near the eastern outskirts of Aden. On September 2019, as a result of UAE draw down from Yemen and increased infighting between Houthis and Hadi forces, AQAP took the advantage and deployed across Abyan and Shabwa in southern Yemen. According to a local Yemeni official, absence of the Shabwani elite security units that were trained and equipped by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) enabled AQAP to gain a foothold in the turbulent province Shabwa again. 2020=U.S. drone and cruise missile attacks The U.S. first said it used targeted killing in November 2002, with the cooperation and approval of the government of Yemen. A CIA-controlled high-altitude Predator drone fired a Hellfire missile at an SUV in the Yemeni desert containing Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, a Yemeni suspected senior al-Qaeda lieutenant believed to have been the mastermind behind the October 2000 USS Cole bombing that killed 17 Americans. He was on a list of targets whose capture or death had been called for by President George W. Bush. In addition to al-Harethi, five other occupants of the SUV were killed, all of whom were suspected al-Qaeda members, and one of whom (Kamal Derwish) was an American.\\"Q&A;: Targeted Killings\\", Eben Kaplan, The New York Times, 25 January 2006. Retrieved 8 October 2010. In May 2010, an errant U.S. drone attack targeting al Qaeda members in Wadi Abida, Yemen killed five people, including Jaber al-Shabwani, deputy governor of Maarib province. According to The Times, in 2010 the United States, in cooperation with Yemeni officials, launched four cruise missiles at suspected terrorist targets in Yemen. According to the Times, Yemen asked the United States to suspend the strikes after one of the missiles killed a pro-Yemeni tribal leader, Sheikh Jaber al-Shabwani, the deputy governor of Marib province, resulting in his tribe turning against the Yemeni government. The Times also stated that U.S. special forces troops were on the ground in Yemen helping to hunt al-Qaeda operatives.Tomlinson, Hugh, Michael Evans, and Iona Craig, \\"US Attacks Al-Qaeda in Yemen\\", The Times, 9 December 2010. On 3 June 2011, American manned jets or drones attacked and killed Abu Ali al-Harithi, a midlevel al-Qaeda operative, as well as several other militant suspects in a strike in southern Yemen. Four civilians were also reportedly killed in the strike. The strike was reportedly coordinated by American special forces and CIA operatives based in Sana.Mazzetti, Mark, \\"U.S. Is Intensifying A Secret Campaign of Yemen Airstrikes\\", The New York Times, 9 June 2011.

The rainbow shiner has a length of 5 to 8 centimeters. It has translucent color from pink to golden with a silver-black stripe along its flanks. The base of its fins are of a reddish color. Adult males change their color during the mating period. Their ventral fins become blue, their head turns purple and their nose turns red. The rainbow shiner was originally endemic to the Mobile River system, where it can be found in small clear rivers of drainage areas of the Alabama, Coosa and Black Warrior rivers in particular. Now it also appears in some rivers in Tennessee and is a popular pet fish for aquariums and ponds. The rainbow shiner spawns between May and June.  Introduction  This species of fish is usually found in small streams along river drainages of Northwest Georgia, Northeastern Alabama, and as more recent research suggests, southwest Tennessee. N. chrosomus is a freshwater, benthopelagic fish that inhabits riffles and pools with gravelly bottoms in creeks and small rivers and are usually found accompanied by genera of Campostoma. They are mainly insectivorous and although studies show the predominate prey of N. chrosomus come from the family Chironomidae, they are found to be more opportunistic feeders and are not very selective. The maximum age is typically two years for both sexes and sexual maturity occurs at one year of age. N. chrosomus increase their food intake during the late winter and spring months before spawning in order to meet the increased energy needs for gamete production and sexual reproduction. Hybridization has been observed between N. baileyi and N. chrosomus in areas where N. chilitious populations have been introduced. There is limited information available pertaining to the current and past management of N. chrosomus. What is known, is that this species was once endemic to parts of northern Alabama and populations have spread further north to Tennessee within recent decades. The latitudinal movement northward may be of particular interest to researchers since N. chrosomus favors warmer waters.  Geographic Distribution  The native range of the rainbow shiner consists of the Mobile Bay basin, including the Coosa, Cahaba, and Alabama River drainages. This species is known from, and was possibly introduced into the Black Warrior River system. These reports however, have been questioned recently based on the fact that this species is typically found in streams with limestone outcrops in the watershed. N. chrosomus is found along the southeast edge of the Black Warrior River system consisting of streams that have headwaters in limestone formations.Fishes of Alabama and the Mobile Basin 2013. Notropis chrosomus. N. chrosomus is also known from, and may have been introduced into, tributaries of the Tennessee River, including Town Creek in northern Alabama and the South Chickamauga Creek system in north Georgia. The means of their introduction is unknown but it is hypothesized that it was by bait bucket release.Leo Nico. 2010. Notropis chrosomus. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. Revision Date: 12/5/2003.  Ecology  Notropis chrosomus is typically found in small, low-turbidity headwater streams flowing over gravelly and sandy riffles and pools but can also be found in springs and small, clear streams. N. chrosomus inhabit freshwater benthopelagic habitats in temperate waters.Froese, Rainer 2013. Notropis chrosomus. http://www.fishbase.org/summary/2848 It is typical that rainbow shiners co-occur with Fundulus stellifer (also considered to have been introduced by recent accidental bait bucket introductions) in small streams. N. chrosomus are considered opportunistic insectivores. Over 80% of food items preyed on are invertebrates, the bulk of which are aquatic and terrestrial insects. Studies show gut contents largely consisting largely of Chironomidae larvae, unidentified insect parts, unidentified Diptera adults, and Collembola. Notropis chrosomus is considered a disturbance sensitive species however, their percent occurrence in the Upper Cahaba River (an area recently plagued with urban construction and habitat disturbance) has nearly doubled. Populations increased from 6.5% in 1983 to 12.5% in 1995 as opposed to other disturbance sensitive species also found in the Upper Cahaba River such as Cyprinella callistia, Etheostoma jordani, and Percina brevicauda whose populations have significant decreases within the same time span.Onorato, D., R. A. Angus, and K. R. Marion. 2000. Historical changes in the icthyofaunal assemblages of the upper Cahaba River in Alabama associated with extensive urban development in the watershed. Journal of Freshwater Ecology 15:7-63.  Life History  Average adults reach 1.6 to 2.4 inches in length. Growth rates of N. chrosomus increase in spring in both length and weight in individuals who are one or two years of age. Mean age in months differs between sexes. Males live an average of 11.7 months whereas females typically live 13.5 months. The maximum age for males is around 23 months and 25 months for females. Sexual maturity typically occurs by 12 months of age for most individuals with the exception of a few that will become sexually mature by 24 months of age. The maximum age of a little over 24 months and sexual maturity occurring in most individuals by 12 months of age, suggests no more than two spawning seasons for any individual. Spawning occurs in 16-25 ¬∞C waters in late spring/early summer.Holder, D. S. and S. L. Powers. 2010. Life-history aspects of the rainbow shiner, Notropis chrosomus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae), in northern Georgia. Southeastern Naturalist 9:347-358. N. chrosomus spawn in habits similar to those used throughout the year but egg deposition usually occurs in Semotilus sp. nests and Nocomis sp. nests.Bart, H. L., M. F. Cashner, and K. R. Piller. 2011. Phylogenetic relationships of the North American cyprinid subgenus hydropholax. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 59:725-735. Rainbow shiners increase food intake during late winter and early spring which coincides with the increase in growth experienced in the spring months before the spawning season and also precedes the increased energy requirements of gamete production and courtship behaviors.Johnston, C. E. and K. J. Kleiner. 1994. Reproductive behavior of the rainbow shiner (\\"Notropis chrosomus\\") and the rough shiner (\\"Notropis baileye\\"), nest associates of the bluehead chub (\\"Nocomis leplocephalus\\") (Pisces: Cyprinidae) in the Alabama River drainage. Journal of the Alabama Academy of Science 65:230-238.  Current Management  Currently, N. chrosomus is a species of relatively low conservation concern and does not require significant additional protection or management, monitoring or research action.NatureServe 2013. Notropis chrosomus. In: IUCN 2013. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.2. . However, a detailed recovery plan for the Mobile River Basin aquatic ecosystem, to which N. chrosomus is native, is underway. The plan was created by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and aims to protect the Basin's native aquatic fauna and flora through aquatic ecosystem management. The decline of many other aquatic species within the Basin is a result of increasing human populations, modifications to meet their needs, and impacts of current land use. Human populations and their associated needs for housing, recreation, and agricultural products is projected to increase within the Basin. The recovery plan therefore seeks to emphasize stewardship responsibilities shared by all inhabitants of the Basin by promoting three basic tenets: 1\\\\. Use to the fullest practical extent existing laws, regulations, and policies to protect listed populations and to develop a stream management strategy that places high priority on conservation and restoration. 2\\\\. Encourage voluntary stewardship through joint initiatives and individual actions as the only practical and economical means of minimizing adverse effects of private land use and activities within watersheds. 3\\\\. Continue to promote research efforts on life histories, sensitivities, and requirements of imperiled aquatic species, and develop technological capabilities to maintain and propagate them. By seeking to improve habitat conditions within the Basin, it is likely that populations of N. chrosomus will continue to remain stable or increase with these improvements.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Mobile River Basin Coalition Planning Committee, comps.

Described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1865, it is not a well-known species. It is a close relative of the blacknose shiner. Chiefly occurring now in the Great Lakes and occasionally in upper Mississippi River drainages, the blackchin once ranged commonly as far south as Illinois and Ohio. This fish resides over sandy bottoms in cool waters that provide a lot of cover for the small minnow. Omnivorous, it eats worms and small arthropods as well as plant material. Blackchin shiners are unique because of their anatomical features, such as the black coloring, the incomplete lateral line, and a distinctive dental arrangement.  Taxonomy  American naturalist Edward Drinker Cope described the blackchin shiner in 1865 as Alburnops heterodon, from specimens collected in Lansing and Grosse Isle, Michigan. The original type specimens have been lost. The genus Alburnops was later sunk into the large genus Notropis. The common name of the blackchin shiner comes from the black pigment of the scales on the tip of the lower jaw. This coloring runs over their eyes, across the gills, and along the side, all the way to the base of their tail. This is especially unique because the stripe appears to zig-zag around the scales, whereas the stripes of other shiners do not.  Description  Blackchin shiners have a thin strip of golden scales just above their black stripe. They also have scales on their backs and upper sides that have dark edges, which make them unique from other shiners. Another thing that makes this species of shiner unique, especially from the closely related bigeye shiner, is that blackchin shiners have an incomplete lateral line with a dusky spot above and below each sensory pore. All fins of blackchin shiners are transparent, and the underbelly is a pale cream shade. The scales of these fishes are thinner, flexible scales called bony-ridged scales. Blackchins have scales called cycloid scales, which are round and, compared to the scales of other fishes, smooth. These scales are a clue that this species is primitive in comparison to other teleosts, many of whom have ctenoid scales. For species of fish with either version of leptoid scales, the age of the fish can be determined by examining the pattern of ridges on a scale, similar to how tree trunk rings display the age of a tree. A straight lateral line is positioned roughly near the center of their sides. These fish also have eight anal fin rays on the tail fin, which is a forked version of a homocercal tail. The dorsal fin lies behind the middle of the body. The dorsal fins of all soft-rayed teleosts are supported by soft, flexible rays, and this shiner is no different. The paired ventral fins of shiners are located in the abdominal position, where these pelvic fins are expected to be found: back near the anus. The teeth located at the back of the throat are arranged in two rows, with one tooth in the outer row and four in the inner row, which distinguishes them from related species. The mouth of the blackchin shiner is a pale, off-white color on the inside. These characteristics all help biologists distinguish between various taxonomies. They are usually measured between 1.5 and 2.5 inches, but have been recorded at up to 3 inches. These deep-bodied fishes have a compressed body. However, unlike other deep-bodied fishes, the preferred depth of the fish has shown no relation to the length of the fish. Contrarily typical to deep-bodied fish, blackchins can produce short bursts of speed, but cannot sustain their speed for long. Their maneuverable bodies are slim, which allows them accuracy and efficiency near the safety of weeds, but proves difficult for them when they encounter moving water.  Distribution  Blackchin shiners are only known to be found in North America. They have been seen widely throughout southern Quebec in Canada, and from Vermont to Minnesota to Iowa in the United States. They mostly remain in the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River basins, but a few have been spotted in various Atlantic drainages, the upper Ohio River basin, and the Hudson Bay area. Habitat and ecology The species mostly resides in cool glacial lakes. However, the habitat preference is for a protected weedy area. Therefore, they have also been found near the inlets and outlets of large lakes, in shallow pools, in slow creeks, and in small rivers. These freshwater fish are usually found over sandy bottoms, and seem to prefer clear waters, because they do not remain long in heavily silted waters. When disturbed, this shiner hides in the weeds for protection.  Conservation status N. heterodon is currently not of ecological concern. There may be some minor threats, but populations appears to be fairly stable, as it is represented across a large and broad spectrum of locations. Whether the fish are remaining stable or in slight decline is currently unknown due to a lack of data, but they are ranked as a species of 'Least Concern'. However, it is thought that they were once widely populous in Illinois as well as Ohio, and are now only lightly scattered throughout those states. It was thought to have vanished from Ohio before 1940, until it was found in Myers Lake in Canton, Ohio, and a single fish turned up in Nettle Lake in northwestern Ohio in the early 1980s. It is classified as threatened in Illinois.  Life history  Juvenile blackchin shiners are visually and anatomically similar to their adult counterparts, although the black lateral line may be faint. Reproduction When breeding, the male blackchin shiner can turn golden-yellow. Wart-like nodules sometimes appear on its crown and pectoral fins. These coloring differences appear to make him more attractive to females of his kind. Female blackchin shiners collected between the months of July and August are often reported to be carrying mature eggs. This suggests that spawning begins around May.  Food chain  Blackchin shiners are highly abundant, small fish. These factors increase the likelihood that the blackchin shiner is a food source for juvenile northern pike (Esox lucius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), both of which are found in the same areas of Manitoba. Diet Water fleas (cladocera) and midges have been found inside the blackchin shiner's digestive system, the presence of the latter showing that the fish takes them at the river surface. The worms and plant material also found in the stomachs of these fish lend evidence that this omnivore also has the ability to do some foraging and bottom-feeding, as well. The mouth of a blackchin shiner is located in the terminal position, which is the most common location. This anatomical location alludes to the fact that these shiners probably feed midwater, although this position is versatile and therefore alone does not provide conclusive evidence of this.

It can be found as far north as Canada and as far south as the Chattahoochee River in Georgia. These shiners live in lakes, rivers, and creeks. They occupy the rocky or sandy shorelines and bottoms of the water. One of the defining features of a spottail shiner is the black spot found at the base of the caudal fin. These shiners generally spawn from late June through July. Description Goulais Bay, Lake Superior Spottail shiners are typically small to medium-sized minnows. The average size ranges from around . They can reach up to at their maximum length. They have a slightly elongate, compressed body with a horizontal, sub-terminal mouth. The defining feature of a spottail shiner is the distinct black spot at the base of the caudal fin. The lower edge of the caudal fin can be white in color with all of the other fins lacking pigment. The dorsal fin sits directly above the pelvic fins. The dorsal side of this shiner can range from a silvery to pale green or olive color, whereas the ventral side is white. The spottail shiner has a complete lateral line running horizontally along its sides. Geographic distribution Notropis species mainly live in streams and rivers but can be found in larger lakes.Whittier, T. et al. (2000) \\"Distribution of lake fishes in the northeast: II. The minnows (Cyrinidae).\\" Northeastern Naturalist. 7:131-156 They can be found deep, on substrates of sand and gravel. The spottail shiner is one of more common species of the genus Notropis. Spottail shiners are native to Canada and the United States. They are found in the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Chattahoochee River and Altamaha River in Georgia, the Mackenzie River basin in Canada, Ohio Illinois, the Hudson Bay, some lakes throughout Montana, and the Great Lakes. They can also be found in some lakes in the upper northeast region of the United States. These spottail shiners seem to have only occupied the areas of Canada and United States that they are currently distributed today, with the exception of Montana. It seems that the shiners have been introduced in lakes through Montana in order to become bait for some of the larger gaming fish such as the walleye. Ecology Spottail shiners are generally omnivorous fish that feed on plants, aquatic invertebrate, and zoobenthos. Zoobenthos are the invertebrates that occupy the benthos of the riverbeds and lakebeds. This shiner is said to feed on green algae, plant debris, vascular plants, water fleas, caddis flies, mayflies, nematocerans, and the remains of macroinvertabrates. Given the small size of the fish it does not usually prey on other fish species. The spottail shiner obtains much of its food by scavenging on the floor of the river, lakes, and streams that it occupies. Given the small size of spottail shiners, many different species of fish prey upon them. Some predators include rainbow trout, coho salmon, chinook salmon, northern pike, walleye, brown trout, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). The spottail shiner mainly competes with species that have the same diet and live in the areas. These competitors can include other species of shiners, yellow perches, or white perches.Hartman, K. et al. (1992) \\"Diets of emerald and spottail shiners and potential interactions with other western Lake Erie planktivorous fishes\\" Journal of Great Lakes Research. 18:43-50. There are certain abiotic factors that determine spottail shiners' habitat. The spottail shiner's highest activity levels are usually seen in areas where the pH value range between 5.6 and 6.6, maximizing at a pH value around 6.1.Brown, L. et al. (2009) \\"Variations of thiaminase I activity pH dependencies among typical Great Lakes forage fish and paenibacillus thiaminolyticus\\" Journal of Aquatic Animal Health. 21: 207-216 Spottail shiners generally live in waters that temperatures range from . Life history The life history of the spottail shiner has not been studied much. Spottail shiners breeding season usually occurs in the summertime during the months of June and July. They are thought to spawn in the sandy bottoms and shorelines of the rivers, lakes, and creeks where they live. Females are thought to produce anywhere from 100 to 2,600 eggs per spawning event. The mature age of a spottail shiner is around one or two years of age. The maximum age recorded for a spottail shiner to live is 5 years. Since there has not been a lot of research involving the life history of the spottail shiner not a lot of information can be given on spawning and reproduction. Conservation and management Spottail shiners are currently listed as of least concern. These shiners are not vulnerable in the wild yet. The primary causes for death is being preyed upon, pollution of their natural habitat, and parasites. Minnows are used as bait for game fishing. These shiners are caught and used as bait fish throughout the area they occupy. They are one of the most popular minnow used to lure walleyes. Their shiny scales and small bodies attract specific species of game fish that anglers frequently try to catch. Currently there are conservation agencies at the state-level protecting these shiners from being harvested for fish bait. Pollution of many different toxic chemicals into the areas that these shiners live is one of the main causes of death.Menard, L. et al. (2010) \\"The impacts of urban pollution on the immune system of spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) in the St. Lawrence River\\" Fresenius Environmental BuIletin. 19:1369-1374 It is found that water pollution from wastewater and runoff affect the immune system of spottail shiners.Mclaughlin, J. D. et al. (2007) \\"Effects of pollution and parasites on biomarkers of fish health in spottail shiners Notropis hudsonius (Clinton)\\" Journal of fish biology. 71:519-538. There are certain parasites that also affect the life of these shiners. The parasites are also found to affect the immune system in spottail shiners.

Description  The sailfin shiner has a deep and compressed body, with a narrow base for the caudal fin. Its lateral line is curved downward. It has a maximum total length of 7 cm (2.75 in). The fish is pink-brown or olive on the top half and a white or light pink on the bottom half. It has a dark brown stripe that extends from the head to the dorsal fin, and has a steel-blue stripe along the side that has a thin pink to red line bordering above. The base of the caudal fin has a small red spot on the top and bottom of the side, while a black spot is on the center of the side of the base of the caudal fin. The dorsal fin has a dusky central band, and other fins are a yellow to light orange. The dorsal and anal fins are almost triangular, resembling sails, from which their common name is derived. Breeding males have light orange edges on their dorsal fins.  Distribution and habitat  The fish can be found in Gulf Coast drainages from Alabama to Florida, including in the Mobile Basin. The fish inhabit sand- bottomed and clay-bottomed pools or run waters of creeks and small rivers. They can often be found around debris or vegetation.  Life history  As the fish begins its life as an embryo, its cement glands begin to develop. As a non feeding larva, glue is secreted from the cement glands and the posterior swim bladder forms. The gills, mouth, and gut lining form. The yolk sac becomes streamlined. When swim-up begins, glue secretion stops. The posterior swim bladder becomes inflated. During this stage, the fish is suspended in the water column, and the yolk is almost depleted. The anterior swim bladder forms. After initial feeding, median and pelvic fins develop, and the anterior swim bladder inflates.

Description  Longnose shiners are elongate, straw- colored shiners with a long, bunt snount, broadly rounded head, and a large subterminal, nearly horizontal mouth. The predorsal profile is moderately arched relative to the flatter, ventral profile. Both dorsal and ventral aspects taper abruptly from the level of the dorsal origin, posteriorly. They have small eyes situated high on the head, giving the impression of an upward- looking fish when viewed from above. Their teeth are usually 1,4-4,1 and are hooked and have prominent grinding surfaces. The tooth in the anterior row, when present, is often weak and easily broken.Douglas, N. 1974. Freshwater Fishes of Louisiana. Baton Rouge, LA: Claitors Publishing Division. The dorsal and anal fins are moderately high, about equally elevated, and slightly rounded at the tips. The margin of the dorsal fin is mostly straight, and the anal fin in emarginate. In both fins, the anterior rays are somewhat longer than the posterior rays when depressed. The dorsal fin has 8 (7-8) rays and its origin is slightly anterior to the pelvic fin, which has 8 (7-8) rays. The pectoral fins have 14-15 (13-17) rays and the anal fins have 7 (6-8) rays. The breast is unscaled and the belly is scaled to partially scaled. The lateral line is complete and mostly straight, with a slight decurve. They are usually no more than 58 mm in length. Mature males average 34.9 mm in length while females average 33.8 mm. The back and sides above the lateral line are pale yellow, with a dusky cross-hatched pattern and a thin, but noticeable, middorsal stripe. The lower sides and ventral side is typically silvery or silvery white. Though usually obscure or absent, some fish may have a faint lateral stripe, especially on the caudal peduncle; pigment of the lateral stipe is confined to the areas above the lateral-line. There is no concentration of melanophores at the base of the caudal fin and all fins lack dark pigment. The fins of breeding individuals, particularly males, have a bright lemon yellow pigment. Males may also have yellow snouts.  Diet  Longnose shiners generally feed during the day, with peak activity in the morning. They primarily feed of dipteran larvae and other aquatic insects. Small crustaceans, such as copepods, clasocerans, and ostracods are also a part of their diet. The only terrestrial insect they eat are ants. Longnose shiners also eat various plant materials, such as seeds of various sedges, diatoms, desmids, filamentous algae, and aquatic fungi. With increasing size, longnose shiners can have a more diverse diet, and have been found include mayfly larvae in their diets.Keplinger, B. 2007. An Experimental Study of Vertical Habitat Use and Habitat Shifts in Single-species and Mixed-species Shoals of Native and Nonnative Congeneric Cyprinids. West Virginia University Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Consumer Sciences  Habitat  The longnose shiner is a benthic, schooling species found most often in moderate current over clean sand or small gravel substrata in medium to large streams. Their habitats are often described as shallow (depths to ca. 60 cm), clean, white, open, sand areas along the edges of sand bars in low to moderate flow. Though they are most abundant near the lower end of sand bars and shoal, where there is a reduced current flow, they are also commonly found in areas where stream banks are covered with woody or brushy vegetation. Longnose shiners have also been found to colonize disturbed areas around bridge repair sites where the operation of heavy machinery has created a shallow, sand-bottom stream channel.  Reproduction and Life Cycle  The sex ratio of longnose shiners is about 1:1, and both sexes mature at about the same size (30 mm) The average size of males are about 34.9 mm long and females are about 33.8 mm long. The average size of females tends to vary in different drainage systems. Larger females usually produce larger ova, with mature ova diameters averaging from 0.84-0.95 mm. Variances in female size and average diameters of mature ova seem to be strongly correlated with the amount of surface runoff in the area.Mayden, R. 1992. Systematics, historical ecology, and North American freshwater fishes. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.Williams, C., T. Bonner. 2006. Habitat Associations, Life History and Diet of the Sabine Shiner Notropis sabinae in an East Texas Drainage. American Midland Naturalist, 155/1: 84-102. The breading season of longnose shiners typically lasts from March until October, in waters of about 17-29Àö C. Longnose shiners generally produce multiple clutches during a breeding season. There may be two breeding peaks, one at the very beginning of the season and then another in the middle of the season, around July. Females average from 62-121 mature ova per clutch and usually produce anywhere from 15-129 eggs. Longnose shiners do not prepare the substrate for a spawning event, and instead practice broadcast spawning, in which they scatter the eggs and sperm. This type of reproduction results in a lack of parental care to both egg and larvae. In the wild, longnose shiners are expected to live between 1 and 2.5 years in the wild. While some fish can survive up to their third summer, most do not survive to their third winter.  Distribution  Longnose shiners are widely distributed throughout the southeastern coastal states of the United States. Their range extends from just west of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to Florida. In Louisiana, they are common and widespread throughout the Florida parishes and northward into the lower Ouachita River drainage system in Catahoula Parish. In Mississippi, they are found in the lower part of the Yazoo River drainage system. They are also found to the upper Altamaha River drainage system and the Ocmulgee River system in Georgia. Isolated populations can also be found in the upper Coosa River system and several smaller tributaries in the Alabama River drainage system.Bart, H., J. Taylor, J. Harbaugh, S. Schleiger, W. Clark. 1995. New distribution records of Gulf Slope drainage fishes in the Ocmulgee River system, Georgia. Southeastern Fishes Council Proceedings, 30: 4-10.  Importance to Humans  Longnose shiners are too small to be a game fish or to be used as food, but they are often used as bait by anglers who make use of their silver shiny color to attract bigger fish.  Etymology  The genus name, Notropis, is misnomer given by Rafinesque to shriveled specimens, with the meaning of \\"back keel\\"; from the Greek word, noton, meaning back. The species name, longirostris, comes from the Latin word longus, meaning long, and the Latin word rostrum, meaning snout, referring to the long snout on this species.

History  In the early 19th century, the Detroit Arsenal was located in the city of Detroit.Craig Hutchison, Kimberly Rising, Dearborn Historical Museum, Dearborn, Michigan, Arcadia Publishing, 2002, , p. 15-22 The arsenal's main purpose was to serve as a supply depot for the United States army; storing, maintaining, and repairing arms and ammunition. However, by the 1830s, the population of the city had grown such that there was fear of the stored explosives endangering the city's population. The US Congress authorized the construction of a new arsenal west of Detroit in the village of Dearbornville.  Construction  In July 1832, a site for the new Arsenal was selectedFloyd L.

The first commandant of the arsenal, Colonel Joshua Howard, proposed naming the surrounding area after Major General Henry Dearborn, a New Hampshire physician and hero of the war of Independence. The eleven buildings of the Arsenal were spaced around a walled square, on a side;The Dearborn Arsenal from Wayne County History, retrieved 1/5/10 the ten-foot-high masonry wall was thirty inches thick and completely enclosed the square. These eleven buildings were the following: # Armory, which was the largest of the buildings and used as both a storehouse and social center. # Sutler's Shop, where tobacco and personal articles were sold to the soldiers. # Guard House # Enlisted Men's Barracks # Surgeon's Quarters # Carpenter Shop, which around 1865 was converted into a chapel. # Smith's Shop # Saddler's Shop, where equipment for horses was made and repaired. # Gun Carriage Shed # Arsenal Office # Commandant's Quarters The powder magazine was located outside the walled square, approximately 300 yards to the east.  After 1877  Rear of Commandant's Quarters The arsenal was eventually judged to be no longer useful, and in 1877 the US government auctioned off the buildings. The only building remaining of the original eleven that is still in its original location and form is the commandant's quarters. After 1877, the armory was adapted as a civic center named the \\"Liberty Hall,\\" hosting events such as dancing, lodge meetings, and roller skating. In 1899, the armory was converted into a woolen mill; in 1910 the mill was destroyed in a fire. The bricks from the building were used to build new houses, some of which still stand in the area. The guard house, enlisted men's barracks, and the surgeon's quarters were used as residences. In 1893, all three were demolished to build a school. The sutler's shop was remodeled and used for, among other things, a doctor's office. The carpenter shop and the smith's shop were combined into one two- story, three-unit building. The structure was used as a lumber mill and later by the Detroit-Dearborn Motor Car Company and by a paint shop. The saddler's shop was used as a residence, and in the 1920s was converted into the Dearborn Town Hall. It was used for meetings until 1928. It was sold to S. S. Kresge and removed from the property. The structure was destroyed in 1946. The gun carriage shed was converted into a two-story structure in 1906 for use by the Masonic Temple. It was later used by Pride Cleaners; it is currently home to a European Bakery. The arsenal office was used as a residence, and later as a commercial store. It was demolished in the early 20th century. The powder magazine was converted into a private residence in 1883 by Nathaniel Ross. The structure was donated to the city of Dearborn in 1950. Currently located at 915 Brady Street, it was renamed the McFadden-Ross House after it was donated to the City to be used as a museum. The last remaining structure of the original eleven, the commandant's quarters, served as a social and cultural center in Dearborn until 1875. The building was later used as a library, American Legion hall, a town hall, police station, school, and a newspaper office. In 1949, the commandant's quarters were purchased by the Dearborn Historical Commission for use as a museum. The building was restored in 1959, and in 1970 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As of 2010 it houses the Dearborn Historical Museum.  Description of the Commandant's Quarters  The Commandant's Quarters is a square, red-brick building on a brick foundation. The hipped roof is covered with slate, and has gabled dormers and a balustrade. A two-story verandah with square columns extends around the front and side of the building. The wrought iron railing near the front entrance is handmade. Much of the interior of the Commandant's Quarters has been restored to resemble the original makeup of the building. The wall and sliding doors between the Commandant's office and dining room on the first floor has been replaced, and the second floor partitions, removed in the 1930s, have also been re-installed.

Out of the hundreds of early-20th century mills once scattered across the mountains of East Tennessee, the Clover Hill Mill is one of the few still in operation, and the last such full service mill in Blount County. The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The community of Clover Hill was established in the 1820s along the headwaters of Baker Creek, and by 1849 a gristmill had been established around which the community developed. By the 1860s, Clover Hill had its own post office, school, church, distillery, and general store. The completion of a railroad line a few miles to the north in 1906, however, caused the community to shift to what is now called the Binfield community. The gristmill burned in 1921 and was replaced by the present mill that same year.Inez Burns, The History of Blount County, Tennessee: From War Trail to Landing Strip, 1795-1955 (Nashville, Tenn.: Benson Print Co, 1957), pp. 101, 222, 281-284. Location The Clover Hill Mill is located at the intersection of Clover Hill Mill Road and Clover Hill Road, about halfway between the latter's junction with U.S. Route 411 to the south and Morganton Road to the north. The stream that once provided power to the mill is a headwater stream of Baker Creek, which empties into Tellico Lake near Greenback. History This stream, a tributary of Baker Creek, powered the original Clover Hill Mill; the mill's east wing is visible on the right Early Blount County settler Abijah Conger arrived at what is now Clover Hill in 1823, and established a tavern and general store that catered to traffic travelling between Maryville and Morganton along the recently built Morganton Road. Conger also planted a large clover farm, and thus when he established a post office in his store, Conger chose the name \\"Clover Hill.\\" In 1841, another settler named John S. Craig organized what would eventually become the Clover Hill Presbyterian Church. After the Civil War, a physician named Samuel Gault set up a practice at Clover Hill, and served as the community's post master. A distiller and miller named David McKamey built the first Clover Hill Mill in 1849, which became a center of activity for the Clover Hill community. In 1887, two millers named \\"Martin\\" and \\"West\\" owned and operated the Clover Hill Mill. After the L&N; Railroad completed a line running roughly parallel to Morganton Road a few miles to the north in 1906, a Clover Hill store owner named William Carpenter moved his store to where Clover Hill Road joins Morganton Road in hopes of establishing a railroad stop. Carpenter was appointed post master of the new community, which was named \\"Binfield,\\" in 1907. In 1915, the Clover Hill post office was discontinued. After the original Clover Hill Mill burned in 1921, the mill's owner, Gilbert Blankenship, built the present mill on its site. Blankenship powered his new mill with electricity, and abandoned the classic overshot wheel and mill race design of its predecessor. Brothers Russell and Roy Perkins eventually purchased the mill, and in 1958 the mill was sold to Oscar Whitehead. Whitehead's sons, the mill's current owners, assumed operations of the mill from their father in 1978. Design Clover Hill Mill, viewed from the west The Clover Hill Mill is a -story structure with a metal, gable roof, weatherboard siding, and a concrete foundation. A porch with square columns spans the front of the building. One-story wings are attached to the east and west ends of the structure, which were traditionally used as office space and storage space. The interior of the building retains much of the original mill machinery. The mill's outbuildings include a frame storage shed, built around 1960, and four metal grain silos, all built between 1969 and 1975. Due to their age, none of these structures are considered \\"contributing\\" structures on the National Register listing. The concrete foundation of the original mill's overshot wheel is located behind the present structure.

Description Aiphanes eggersii is a small, multi-stemmed palm tall with up to 10 stems. Stems are in diameter. Stems are covered with black or grey spines up to long. Individuals have between 7 and 10 leaves which consists of a leaf sheath, a petiole and a rachis. Leaf sheaths, which wrap around the stem, are about long and are covered with black or grey spines up to long. Petioles are long and spiny. Rachises are with 50 to 65 pairs of leaflets (or more rarely as few as 30 pairs). Inflorescences consist of a peduncle and a rachis long. The rachis bears 35 to 75 rachillae, which are the smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers. Flowers are borne in groups consisting of one female and two male flowers. The male flowers are yellow, while the female flowers are yellow with brown sepals. The ripe fruit is bright red, spherical, and in diameter. Taxonomy Aiphanes has been placed in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with Desmoncus, Bactris, Acrocomia and Astrocaryum. In his 1932 revision of the genus, German botanist Max Burret placed Aiphanes eggersii in the subgenus Macroanthera, one of the two subgenera into which he divided the Aiphanes. In their 1996 monograph, Finn Borchsenius and Rodrigo Bernal recognised that if Macroanthera was reduced to three species (A. horrida, A. minima, and this species) it could form a viable grouping, but that this would leave the other subgenus, Brachyanthera overly heterogeneous, and consequently the abandoned Burret's use of subgenera. Aiphanes eggersii was described by Burret in 1932 based on collections made by Danish botanist Henrik Franz Alexander von Eggers in February 1897. The generic epithet, Aiphanes, coined by German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1801, derives from Greek ai, meaning \\"always\\" and phaneros, meaning \\"evident\\", \\"visible\\" or \\"conspicuous\\". The specific epithet, eggersii, honours Eggers. Reproduction The flowers of A. eggersii produce small quantities of nectar, but lack a scent. Male flowers open once the inflorescence is freed from the bract in which it develops. They last eight to ten days. Female flowers open about a week after the male flowers, and last for another week. The flowers are visited by bees and wasps and contained micromoth larvae; they are believed to be pollinated by bees, with a possible contribution from the wind. Distribution and habitat Aiphanes eggersii is native to the dry forests of the coastal plain of Ecuador and northern Peru, in areas receiving as little as of precipitation annually. It is commonly found in the Ecuadorian province of Manab√≠. Uses The fruit and seeds are edible, and trees are sometimes planted near houses.

The gut is coiled neatly within the Ozark minnow.http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/endangeredresources/animals.asp?mode=detail&speccode;=afcjb28680 Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources These physical descriptions of the Ozark minnow are true for both the males and females in a population meaning that they do not seem to display any sexual dimorphism. In other words, they do not have very different physical traits that are special to the male or female.  Habitat  Ozark minnows are mostly found in creeks or small rivers that have \\"gravelly or rocky bottoms and strong, permanent flow\\", and are often found in schools with other minnow species.http://mdc.mo.gov/discover- nature/field-guide/ozark-minnow Missouri Department of Conservation In addition, they can be found in pools or near riffles, which are \\"light rapids where water flows across a shallow section of river\\".http://www.arkive.org/ozark-minnow/notropis-nubilus/image-G119980.html Arkive They are also most frequently found in waters that are not highly populated, to ensure their safety and protection. Ozark minnows prefer weaker currents to strong currents, but are found slightly below the surface in calmer water. They prefer freshwater and a more benthic biome, staying close to the bottom for the majority of the time. As for their geographic distribution, Ozark minnows can be found in the \\"central highlands\\" of the United States. They are mainly found in the Mississippi River of more southern states, in addition to Oklahoma and Kansas, due to excessive farming in the more northern states of Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Specifically in these states, they have been found in southeast Minnesota in the Root, Cedar, and Zumbro rivers, the northern and southern portions of Wisconsin, and in northeast Oklahoma. They have also been found in north and central Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa.  Diet  Footnotes  References  * Robert Jay Goldstein, Rodney W. Harper, Richard Edwards: American Aquarium Fishes.

Biography Henricus Aeneae was born 19 August 1743 at Oudemirdum, Friesland, where his father Eduard Schultetus Aenee was a minister. The son, on the advice of the rector of the Latin schools, added a Latin ending to his name and called himself from then on Aeneae, was initially prepared to become a teacher, visiting the Latin schools in Leeuwarden and the college of Franeker. At the latter location, he studied mathematics and physics with the professors Nicolaas Ypeij and Antonius Brugmans; he enjoyed these sciences so much that he decided to devote himself to them. Guided by the famous Jan van der Bildt, who was at the time partly living in Franeker, and by Wytze Foppes, who lived in Dongjum, half an hour away from Franeker, he practised making binoculars and telescopes, driven as he was by his interest in optics. Because he was meanwhile married and thus needed some means of living, he went in 1767 to Amsterdam, where he taught mathematics, with among his pupils the great Nieuwland. Two years after his arrival in Amsterdam, he was promoted to Master in the Free Arts and Doctor in Philosophy in Leiden, with a dissertation on frost. In 1778, the company Felix Meritis made him an honorary member and their Lector or Physics because of his capacities and ever increasing fame: because Aeneae not only became famous by his great progress in physics and mathematics and especially in optics and mechanics, but especially by his methods of teaching. In this he was truly unique and his merits where above all praise. With the utmost clarity and simplicity and in an enjoyable manner he taught physics, while a more than normal dexterity made his experiments extremely important. Until the revolution of 1795, Aeneae only occupied himself with teaching his beloved sciences, but then he was swiftly called to aid his country with his capacities. Immediately after the revolution, he became a member of the Committee of the Marine, and not long thereafter he was given, together with the captains Story and Lucas and ship builder Glavimans, the honorable task of inspecting all warships in these countries on their ability of being brought into service. Even more all encompassing was the job he was called to in 1798, when he received the honour to go together with professor Jan Hendrik van Swinden to Paris, to deliberate about the metric system of measures and weights together with the most prominent French and other scientists, which was eventually mostly brought to its current perfection by these two Dutchmen. After being remade a member of the Marine in 1801, and later Advisor in mathematics, physics, chemistry and mechanics, Inspector of measures and weights, and member of the Central Committee of the Marine, he died in 's Gravenhage on November 1, 1810. Among his works are: *\\"Wiskundige Beschouwing van een hellend waterscheprad, door A.G. Eckhardt uitgevonden\\", Amsterdam 1775, 8o. 2 parts, illustrated *\\"Verhandeling over de Molenwieken in het algemeen en over die, welke eene schroefwijze gedaante hebben, volgens de uitvinding van Jan van Deyl en Zoon\\", Amsterdam 1785, 8o. *\\"Rekenboek voor de Nederlandsche jeugd, uitgegeven door de Maatschappij Tot Nut van 't Algemeen\\", Amsterdam 1792, 2 parts. *\\"Iets over de waterweegkunde\\", Amsterdam 1808.

Breeding females are usually lighter in colour * Seldom survives capture or handling and scales are easily dislodged  Distribution  Eastern North America, in the United States it is found throughout the eastern part of the country from North and South Dakota in the west as far south as Arkansas. In Canada, this species has been found only in the Winnipeg River system, including the Whitemouth watershed. It may occur upstream to Lake of the Woods, Ontario. The Manitoba populations are at the northwestern limit of the distribution, separated from the continuous range of the species by 450 km.  Habitat and life history  Carmine shiners typically summer at midwater depths of clear, fast flowing streams and small rivers over clean gravel or rubble substrates. They often school in riffles and pools near the confluence with larger streams and rivers. Habitat use during other seasons and by young- of-the-year has not been studied in Manitoba, nor has spawning. However, a ripe and running female was taken in the Pinawa Channel in 19.3 ¬∞C water. Southern populations typically spawn in riffles in May/June at temperatures of 20¬∞ to 28.9 ¬∞C. Adhesive eggs are deposited into depressions in gravel, often in the nests of other minnow species. Eggs hatch within 60 hours at 21 ¬∞C and newly hatched larvae work their way vertically into the gravel. These fish are mature at one year and live about three years. Individuals likely move into deeper water to winter.  A Species At Risk  This species has been identified as Threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). It is listed under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and was afforded protection under the SARA as of June 2004. Additional protection is afforded through the federal Fisheries Act. Under the SARA, a recovery strategy must be developed for this species.  Diet  This fish eats primarily aquatic insects, some terrestrial insects, fish eggs, algae and diatoms. Prey are located by sight.  Threats  This species may be threatened by activities that alter turbidity, flow and/or substrate such as channelization, impoundment, drainage that increases sediment loading, streambed gravel removal and shoreline development. It has a narrow range of habitat requirements and may respond quickly to changes in habitat and water quality. During the past century, impoundments that have increased turbidity and decreased riffle habitat may have caused a decline in the abundance of this fish in the Winnipeg River system. Species introductions and bait harvesting may also pose a threat.  Similar species  The carmine shiner resembles its close relative the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), which has a deeper, more compressed body shape and blunter snout.

Description  The fish is somewhat elongate and has a long snout. Its eyes are upward-looking and a barbel can be found in the corner of the mouth. It can reach a total length of 8.4 cm (3.25 in). The fish is similar to bigeye chub. It has smaller eyes, however. During the breeding season in spring, the front third of the body becomes more red, usually most pronounced on the snout. They have 35 to 39 scales along the lateral line. Distribution and habitat The range of the rosyface chub includes the Saluda, Savannah, Edisto, and Altamaha river drainages. It is mostly found above the fall line in these drainages. It may also have been introduced to the Chattahoochee River system. Habitats of this species include pools or edges of riffles in small streams, and near banks in eddy currents in larger streams and small rivers, usually over sand or gravel bottoms. The rosyface chub avoids areas with heavy siltation. It spawns in moderately fast riffles over clean gravel.  Human interest = Aquarium  Rosyface chubs make good aquarium fish as they are quite hardy and sociable. They appreciate being among other minnows, and often school with yellowfin shiners. They are quick to reach for food once fed, and will eat frozen food, flakes, and even shrimp pellets.  Conservation status = South Carolina  While the population of the species is currently considered stable, they are of concern because of their small range, only found in a few major drainages in the state. Conservation efforts in South Carolina have a great impact upon the species as half of global distributions of the species occur in the state. Concerns for the species are similar to those of other fish in South Carolina: source pollution, deforestation, loss of riparian corridors, impoundment development, siltation resulting from poor land use practice, and poorly urban and suburban development.

Prior to 1958, this species was named Notropis roseus.  Description  The weed shiner, Notropis texanus, is a member of the family Cyprinidae. It is a medium-sized minnow with a broad, dark lateral band down and a dark spot at the base of the caudal fin. The posterior 3-4 anal rays often have a dark pigment. Weed shiners have a somewhat compressed body, a large terminal to subterminal mouth, a gently rounded snout, and an eye diameter less than or equal to its snout length. The lateral line system is completely pored with 34-36 scales and is slightly decurved anteriorly. The dorsal surface of this fish tends to be olive-yellow with a silvery overlay and has dark-edged scales, giving off a checkerboard appearance. The ventral surface is white with silver tones. Weed shiners have a total of 6-8 gill rakers, 8 dorsal rays, 7 anal rays, 13-14 pectoral rays, and 8 pelvic rays.  Diet  Weed shiners feed during the day, with peaks in activity after sunrise or during mid-afternoon. During the wet season, their diet is mostly composed of organic detritus (81% by volume). During the wet season, their diet includes surface animal prey (20% by volume), midwater prey (5%), benthic animal prey (39%), and organic detritus (35%).  Habitat  Weed shiners are commonly found in the lower third of the water column in small to moderate sized streams of slow to moderate flow. They can be found in man-made ponds, reservoirs, and natural oxbow lakes. Despite its name, these fish are prevalent in both vegetated and non-vegetated waterways.  Reproduction and life cycle  Weed shiners spawn from March through September (sometimes early October), in water temperatures between 14-29¬∞ Celsius. Female weed shiners produce multiple clutches of eggs during the breeding season; therefore, it is hard to accurately estimate annual egg production. Larval development has not yet been described in weed shiners. Growth of this species is very rapid in the beginning stages of development. They reach about 60% of their maximum length after one year of growth. Although some weed shiners manage to reach their fourth year of life, most of them die after their third year of life.  Distribution  The weed shiner occurs in the Mississippi River Basin from Minnesota and Wisconsin down to the Gulf of Mexico. It ranges all throughout Gulf of Mexico drainage, from the Suwannee River of Florida and Georgia to the Nueces River of Texas, and is more abundant south of the Ohio-Tennessee River confluences. It has also been reported in the Red River of the North drainage in Minnesota and drainages of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.  Etymology  Notropis means \\"keeled back.\\" Texanus is a reference to the type locality, Salado Creek, Texas. Further reading * Robert J. Goldstein, Rodney W.

The Topeka shiner is a type of minnow that does not grow longer than a few inches. This minnow is a shiny silver color its main physical characteristic is the black colored stripe that runs along the side of the body. It is distributed in the Mississippi River basin, from southern Minnesota and southeastern South Dakota south to central Missouri and southern Kansas. The Topeka shiner lives mainly in prairie streams. In order for the Topeka shiner to survive the water must be cold and clear. The streams in which this Minnow lives are typically consistent and run year long. In cases in which the stream does dry up, the Topeka Shiner needs to find a new stream or permanent body of water to survive. The Topeka shiner was listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998. The species is endangered primarily because of the water quality need. This species relies on clean water to survive. When the streams water quality changes the Topeka shiner has difficulty adjusting to the changes. The water quality can change due to both environmental and human impact. A main cause for the decline in population is human activity. The water quality changes and the minnow are impacted when natural plant life is taken away. Any type of construction such as road work, new homes and other types of development can affect the habitat in which the Topeka shiner lives.  References  * USFWS Fact Sheet * Iowa Dept.

He sailed with George Vancouver on his voyages of exploration, captained Bordelais, Africaine and Thalia, and was the chief suspect in the \\"delicate investigation\\" into the morals of Caroline, Princess of Wales. Childhood and early naval career Manby was born in the village of Hilgay on the edge of the Norfolk Fens. His father, Matthew Pepper Manby, was lord of the manor of Wood Hall in Hilgay and a former soldier and aide-de-camp to Lord Townshend. Manby's elder brother was George William Manby, the inventor of life-saving devices including the Manby mortar. Lord Townshend arranged a position for the young Manby in the stationers of the ordnance department, but Manby dreamt of a life at sea and at the age of 14 resigned his post and embarked as a midshipman on board the 24-gun . After two years on the Irish station he joined and sailed to the Caribbean, returning on , and then served on the 74-gun .J. Marshall 1824 Thomas Manby, Esq. In Marshall's naval biography, vol II part 1. London: pp 199-212 Voyage with Vancouver In 1790, when he was 21, Manby was appointed as master's mate on George Vancouver's ship . The Admiralty had ordered Vancouver to complete a survey of the north-west coast of America and take possession of disputed land at Nootka Sound on the island that is now Vancouver Island. Discovery was fitted out for exploration, complete with a plant frame on the quarterdeck to bring back specimens. Together with the brig , the Discovery left Plymouth 1 April 1791. The two ships called at New Zealand, Tahiti and Hawaii before reaching the starting point for the American survey, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, almost exactly a year after setting out. Manby recorded first impressions of the coast: > \\"It had more the aspect of enchantment than reality, with silent admiration > each discerned the beauties of Nature, and nought was heard on board but > expressions of delight murmured from every tongue. Imperceptibly our Bark > skimmed over the glassy surface of the deep, about three Miles an hour, a > gentle breeze swelled the lofty Canvass whilst all was calm below\\".N. Rigby, > P. van der Merwe, G. Williams 2005 Pioneers of the Pacific: voyages of > exploration, 1787-1810. London: pp. 96-115 The Discovery and Chatham spent the next three summers surveying the north- west coast of America, passing the winters in Hawaii. They arrived at Nootka Sound in the autumn of 1792 and, when disputes arose with the Spanish, several officers were sent back to England to request instructions from the Admiralty. Manby was promoted to fill vacant places: firstly as master of Chatham and then as lieutenant on Discovery. The relationship between Manby and Vancouver was not however a harmonious one. Manby wrote that Vancouver: \\"is grown Haughty Proud Mean and Insolent, which has kept himself and his Officers in a continual state of wrangling...\\" French Revolutionary Wars The expedition returned in 1795, by which time England was at war with France. Manby spent the next year as a lieutenant in the 84-gun Juste and then in early 1797 was appointed as commander of the 44-gun , guarding trade in Irish Sea and the Channel. During the two years he commanded Charon, Manby provided protection to 4753 vessels, not one of which was lost, and he also captured a French privateer, the Alexandrine. Manby was promoted to post-captain rank 22 January 1799, three weeks after his thirtieth birthday. Later that year he was appointed commander of the 24-gun Bordelais, a former French privateer which was nicknamed the Coffin on account of her dangerous build. Manby had rescued his brother George Manby from debtors' prison, and he now took him on board his ship as a lay chaplain. On a trip to Ireland the Bordelais foundered on a sandbank; Manby managed to refloat her by throwing everything possible overboard and they limped back to Plymouth. The incident brought home to George Manby the dangers of a lee shore in a storm and led to his invention of Manby's mortar, a life-line for sailors wrecked close to shore.K. Walthew 1971 From rock and tempest: the life of Captain George William Manby. London Back in Plymouth, George Manby underwent an operation to remove slugs and rotting hat from his skull (he had been shot by his wife's lover some years previously). Afterwards he appeared to be dying and decided that he \\"preferred to die at sea among sailors (a consoling and compassionate class of man) rather than be left in the care of a mistress of lodgings, to be hurried to my grave unnoticed and unknown\\". So Manby took him back on board before setting off for duty around the Azores. During the trip Bordelais captured a valuable coffee-laden French prize, and George Manby recovered his health. After a short period spent blockading the port of Flushing, the Bordelais was sent to the Caribbean, where she sank the French warship Curieuse. After the Treaty of Amiens temporarily brought a halt to hostilities between Britain and France, Manby was appointed to the and returned to England where the ship was paid off. Napoleonic Wars The Africaine Manby was not out of commission for long. In October 1802 the Earl of St Vincent, first Lord of the Admiralty, sent for him and said 'I don't like to see an active officer idle on shore; I therefore give you the Africaine, one of the finest frigates in the British navy'. On leaving the Juno, Manby had visited his friend and patron, Lord Townshend, at Raynham Hall in Norfolk, and Lady Townshend had introduced him to Caroline, princess of Wales. While the Africaine was fitting out at Deptford Dockyard, Manby was a frequent visitor to Montagu House in Blackheath where the princess, who was estranged from her husband the prince of Wales, lived. Manby soon replaced Sir Sidney Smith in the princess's affections. She bought the soft furnishings for his cabin and asked the Admiralty to send the Africaine to attend her in the Downs when she rented a house at Ramsgate in the summer. War with France had resumed and the Africaine was called away from her royal duties to blockade the port of Hellevoetsluis, although Manby was able to visit the princess again the following summer when she took a house in Southend and the Africaine anchored off the Nore for a few weeks. After two years blockading Helvoetsluis, the Africaine joined Admiral Russell's squadron off the Texel and was badly damaged in a storm. Having refitted at Sheerness, Manby was ordered to escort a fleet of merchant ships to the Caribbean. On the return journey there was an outbreak of yellow fever on board. Three days out from Carlisle Bay the ship's surgeon and assistant were dead, and Manby had to take care of the sick. Acting on the instructions of a doctor who came alongside in a small boat from Saint Kitts, he treated them with calomel. By the time the Africaine reached England she had lost nearly one-third of her crew and officers, and had to spend forty days in quarantine off the Isles of Scilly. Manby had survived an attack of the fever and large doses of calomel, but his health never recovered. He had also received several serious wounds in action, and had suffered from rheumatic pains since his voyages with Vancouver. The Africaine was decommissioned and Manby was appointed to the frigate Thalia. He spent a year in command of a squadron off the Channel Islands and captured a French privateer, before being sent in 1808 to search for two French frigates off Greenland. The French frigates were not found, but Manby surveyed and named Port Manvers on the coast of Labrador before returning to England. It was to be his last voyage. He accepted medical advice to give up his ship and bought an estate in Northwold in Norfolk. In 1806 the king, at the request of his son the prince of Wales, ordered an inquiry into rumours that the princess of Wales had given birth to a child. A number of men were suspected of having had a relationship with the princess (which was grounds for a charge of high treason), but it was Manby against whom the evidence was \\"particularly strong\\".S. Perceval 1813 The Royal or delicate investigation into the conduct of HRH the Princess of Wales before Lords Erskine, Spencer, Grenville, and Ellenborough, The Four Special Commissioners of Inquiry appointed by His Majesty in the year 1806, containing the Depositions and all the Evidences, Copies of the various Letters, Statements, Narratives, Reports and Minutes of Council, &c;&c;, Superintended by the later Right Hon Spen. Perc. in 1806 and then suppressed. London Manby was called before the commissioners of the inquiry and swore on oath that he never did \\"at Montagu House, Southend, Ramsgate, East Cliff, or anywhere else, ever sleep in any house occupied by, or belonging to, HRH the Princess of Wales\\". The commissioners concluded that the main accusation against the princess was unfounded, but nevertheless they criticised her behaviour. The princess was defended by former attorney-general and future prime-minister Spencer Perceval, who dismissed the evidence of the princess's servants as 'hearsay representations'. The gifts and letters from the princess to Manby were evidence only of her gratitude for Manby having taken two of her charity boys on board the Africaine, and his frequent visits were to keep the princess informed of their progress. If jugs of water and towels were left in the passage when Manby visited it was proof, Perceval argued, of the servants' slovenliness and not of high treason. Perceval was ready to publish his defence in the form of a book when there was a sudden change of government, the princess was accepted at court, and the book was suppressed. After Perceval's assassination in 1812 the book was published and extracts, including Manby's testimony, were published in the Times. Retirement Having given up his naval career on medical advice, Manby settled on an estate in Norfolk and in 1810 married twenty-year-old Judith Hammond. The marriage produced two daughters: Mary Harcourt Manby and Georgina Manvers Manby (1815-1900). A natural daughter, Elizabeth Annabella Montgomery Manby, had been born in 1807. Sons-in-law included James Dawes, Baron de Flassans (nephew of Sophie Dawes, Baronne de Feuch√®res, and first husband of Mary Harcourt), Sir Cavendish Stuart Rumbold, 4th Baronet (second husband of Mary Harcourt), and the French diplomat and politician, Th√©odore Adolphe Barrot (husband of Georgina Manvers). Manby later moved to London and also had a country house in Christchurch, Dorset. He worked on a chart of the South Pacific which he hoped would prove that the peoples of the region had a common origin, and helped solve the mystery of the disappearance of La P√©rouse's ships when he identified medals found by an English whaler in the South Pacific as having belonged to the explorer.Times, 12 September 1825 He was promoted, by seniority, to rear admiral in 1825. Manby died of an opium overdose in the George Hotel, Southampton, and was buried in South Stoneham.

The genus Notropis is commonly known as the eastern shiners. It is native to areas of the Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, much of the Mississippi River basin including areas of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and regions of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas. However, this particular species can be found in other places such as the Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut and Housatonic rivers. This genus is usually characterized by almost all having a complete lateral line, 8 dorsal fin rays, a premaxillae protactile, and a silvery or speckled peritoneum. As the common name indicates, this species is difficult to classify in the wild because it looks similar to many other shiners. In fact, some even hypothesize that this species is actually a complexity of many cryptic species.Etnier, D.A. and W.C. Starnes. 2001. The Fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press. While this is the case, it is important to take more caution to not misidentify this species and to understand its impact on introduced areas. The diet of N. volucellus consists of some terrestrial insects, small crustaceans, and midge pupae and larvae. Mimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years, and are suspected to reach sexual maturity after one year. In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.Moyle, P.B. 1973. Ecological Segregation Among Three Species of Minnows (Cyprinidae) in a Minnesota Lake. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 102(4):794‚Äì805. When found in small streams N. volucellus are generally in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.Hrabik, R. A. 1996. Taxonomic and distributional status of Notropis wickliffi in the Mississippi River drainage: a literature review. Long Term Resource Monitoring Program. Environmental Management Technical Center, Onalaska, Wisconsin, Special Report 96-S001: 15. The diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer. This fish is suspected to have been introduced to many areas via bait bucket release. Because negative impacts of the introduction of this species have not been documented and because this species is not listed as threatened, there is not much immediate need for conservation efforts of this species. Distribution Historically, this species has been mostly found in the southern Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, and much of Mississippi River basin except in the northern Great Plains region and is oddly missing from many of its tributaries. The mimic shiner is also in Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Housatonic rivers along with the region of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas. However, currently this species can also be found in Susquehanna River,Cooper, E.L. 1983. Fishes of Pennsylvania and the Northeastern United States.

It is suspected that the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas may be due to a change in hydraulic regimes due to fragmentation of landscapes along with urbanization and development. Due to fragmentation of the landscape near or around riverine ecosystems, there is less available vegetation along these areas. With less vegetation, a faster flow of water pours into streams and rivers and possibly causes erosion to its banks. This influx of water and higher velocity of flow could have negative impacts on this species that lives in areas that has a relatively slow to moderate current. Ecology Notropis volucellus can generally be found in sandy pools of headwaters, creeks, clear small to large rivers, and in quiet areas of lakesPage, L. M., and B. M. Burr. 1991. A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America, north of Mexico. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. while avoiding small, headwater streams, and swampy and marshy areas. In small streams N. volucellus are in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes. When monitoring one most often will find mimic shiners near riffles in currentGilbert, C. R. and G. H. Burgess. 1980. Notropis volucellus (Cope), Mimic shiner. pp. 322 in D. S. Lee, et al.

Ecological profiles for selected stream-dwelling Texas Freshwater Fishes. A report to the Texas Water Development Board. The Texas Water Development Board March 3, 1997:1-89. Because this is a small fish, mimic shiners have many piscivorous predators that are bigger in size. Such predators include northern pike walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, rock bass, and brown bullhead among others.Hanych, D.A, M.R. Ross, R.E. Magnien, and A.L. Suggars. 1983. Nocturnal Inshore Movement of the Mimic Shiner (Notropis volucellus): a Possible Predator Avoidance Behavior. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 40(7): 888-894. The diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer. One study showed that Daphnia was present in 85% of all stomachs sampled and zooplankton (copepods and Chydorus) was found in greater than 30% of stomach samples in August. Fish aged at 0 ate mostly Chydorus, but in the summer were found to eat varying amounts of invertebrates like small leeches and some chironomids. At age 2, mimic shiners were found to eat other invertebrates than those stated after May while their diet consisted of 50-80% filamentous algae in September and early October but less than 50% at other times. In this study no other large fish populations, except for some centrarchids, were found that would compete for Daphnia as a food source.Gorski, P.R, R.C. Lathrop, S.D. Hill, and R.T. Herrin. 1999. Temporal Mercury Dynamics and Diet Composition in the Mimic Shiner. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 128(4): 701-712 Due to pollution from humans, many fish have been observed to bioaccummulate mercury. While effects of bioaccumulation are mostly studied in the larger piscivores, they can also be observed in smaller prey such as theNotropis volucellus. A rise in mercury levels in water could cause the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas. Life history Mimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years. This species, at least documented in TN, reach sexual maturity after their first year of growth. Spawning of this species varies depending on different locations due to differences in seasons and temperature changes. In Minnesota and Wisconsin this occurs from May to AugustBecker, G.C. 1983. Fishes of Wisconsin. Madison: University of Madison Press. while in Alabama this event occurs from mid-April to early August.18\\\\. Oliver, J. R. 1986. Comparative reproductive biology of the Cahaba shiner, Notropis sp., and the mimic shiner, Notropis volucellus (Cope), from the Cahaba River drainage, Alabama. Master's thesis, Birmingham: Stamford University However, because males produce nuptial tubercles from late May to early October in Tennessee, it is suggested that Notropis volucellus have a longer breeding season than other areas which peak in the summer. In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants. In streams, however, spawning location has not yet been documented.Warren, L. W., Jr., B. M. Burr, S. J. Walsh, H. L. Bart, Jr., R. C. Cashner, D. A. Etnier, B. J. Freeman, B. R. Kuhajda, R. L. Mayden, H. W. Robison, S. T. Ross, and W. C. Starnes. 2000.

Clutch sizes increases per female with an increase in body size, ranging from 74 to 386 oocytes produced from body sizes ranging from .Coburn, M. M. 1986. Egg diameter variation in Eastern North American Minnows (Pisces: Cyprinidae): Correlation with Vertebral Number, Habitat, and Spawning Behavior. Ohio Journal of Science 86: 110-120. These fertilized eggs are demersal and adhesive. Because spawning varies depending on varying seasons and temperature changes, it is not unimaginable to predict changes in spawning due to global temperature changes in the future. As of yet, there has not been much research regarding Notropis volucellus. As stated before, human-caused development and deforestation around the areas alter current of streams and also alter turbidity. Also stated above, the mimic shiner breeds in areas that are clear, has little current, and contains vegetation. Changes in the hydraulic regime of the habitats mimic shiners live in could create unfavorable conditions to reproduce. Current management Some places do claim that this species has declined significantly in certain areas. The department of Natural Resources of Ohio state that the mimic shiner was once found all over Ohio, but it is now not as abundant in many places as it used to be.Mimic Shiner. Ohio.gov: Department of Natural Resources. http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/tabid/22427/Default.aspx In table 2 of a paper discussing effects of landscape change on fish abundances, the mimic shiner is also listed as intolerant to disturbances and thus has been decreasing in number.Kennen, J.G, M. Chang, B.H. Tracy. 2005. Effects of Landscape Change on Fish Assemblage Structure in a Rapidly Growing Metropolitan Area in North Carolina, USA. American Fisheries Society Symposium 47:39‚Äì52. However, many other regions believe this fish to be invasive. The mimic shiner is suspected to have been introduced into many regions. The source is believed to be the spread via the sport of fishing. It is reported, though not commonly sold in stores as such, mimic shiners were used in vast quantities as bait in Wisconsin lake and were even used as a primary source for food for fishes at one hatchery.Scott, W.B., and E.J. Crossman. 1973. Freshwater fishes of Canada. Fisheries Research Board of Canada, Bulletin 184. Ottawa. Not much is being done to protect this specific species nor are many groups focusing on the mimic shiner. This is not unusual seeing how it is not listed as needing protection according to the IUCN red list of threatened species the population of Notropis volucellus is stable and its conservation status is of least concern.Notropis volucellus(mimic shiner). International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Last updated February 2013. http://www.iucnredlist.org/search While pollution and dams are a major problem or water ecosystems, this fish has not been reported to need assistance in respects to conservation. Instead of needing protection, they need to be prevented from being introduced into non-native areas. It is likely that they could cause disruption to their non-native introduced ranges due to competition for resources.

Biography Yorozu was born in what is now part of Hanamaki, Iwate Prefecture in the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan as the eldest son of a merchant. He developed an interest in painting at an early age, and based on what he read in Oshita Tojiro‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Guide to Watercolors‚Äù, taught himself to paint watercolors. In 1903, he traveled to Tokyo with his cousin where he attended the Waseda Junior High School, and briefly studied Zen meditation. In 1905, he began to attend the meetings of the Hakubakai art circle established by Kuroda Seiki. In 1906, he traveled to the United States as part of a Rinzai Zen mission, but with the intention of enrolling in an art school in San Francisco, but returned to Japan the same year due to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1907, he was admitted to the Western Art Department of the Tokyo Fine Arts School. Self Portrait with Red Eyes, 1912 In 1910 he formed the Absinthe Group with his classmates Hirai Tamenari and Yamashita Tetsunosuke. In 1911, Yorozu graduated, with his graduation work, a post-impressionist piece bordering on fauvism titled Nude Beauty, winning considerable critical acclaim. In the same year he participated in the Fyuzankai Exhibition with Saito Yori and Kishida Ry≈´sei, in which he displayed \\"Head of a Woman\\" (also known as \\"Woman with a Boa\\"). The society was disbanded the following year. From 1914-1916 Yorozu returned to Iwate Prefecture to apply himself to his paintings, supported largely by the earnings of his wife. He painted a variety of self-portraits, landscapes and still-life paintings, and experimented with the beginnings of cubism. At the 4th Nika Exhibition held in 1917, he displayed \\"Leaning Woman\\" and \\"Still-life with a Brush Stand\\", which provoked wide critical acclaim. During this time he also displayed still-life works at exhibitions held by the Japan Art Academy and the Inten. In 1919, he moved to Chigasaki, Kanagawa due to health reasons. After displaying four of his works including \\"Town Looked Down through the Branches\\" at the 6th Nika Exhibition, he was selected as a member of the Nika Society. However, his \\"Three Bathers\\" was rejected for display at the Teiten Exhibition in 1921. Yorozu participated as an invited member of the Shunyokai in 1922, and became a member of the Japan Watercolor Painting Association. In 1923 he established the Enchokai together with Kobayashi Tokusaburo, Maeda Kanji, Hayashi Takeshi and Onchi Kashiro. Yorozu died at his home in Chigasaki at the age of 41, from tuberculosis. Many of his works are now displayed at the Yorozu Tetsugoro Museum, in his hometown of Hanamaki, Iwate.

The film was re-released in 1927, after LaMarr's death, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and is now considered a lost film. Plot Quincy Adams Sawyer is a young attorney who one day meets a girl in the park. He is immediately smitten with her, but is summoned to the village of Mason's Corners by his father's friend Deacon Pettengill to investigate a villainous lawyer named Obadiah Strout before he can pursue her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Putnam, an old woman, is being swindled by Strout. Putnam's daughter Lindy, a natural vamp, attempts to seduce Sawyer. He shows interest, until he finds out who the girl from the park is: Alice, Pettengill's niece who has become blind since their first meeting. Despite this tragedy, Sawyer falls in love with Alice. Meanwhile, Strout attempts to scare away Sawyer and convinces Abner Stiles, who once committed a murder, that Sawyer is in town to investigate him. Lindy, on the other hand, tries to get rid of Alice and, with the help from Strout, Lindy lures her onto a boat, after which the rope is cut. The little boat is sent adrift and she is off to the water falls. Lindy is initially glad to be rid of Alice, but soon regrets her decision. She rushes to Quincy and tells him the entire truth. Quincy races to the water falls and rescues her from a fatal fall. Overcome by excitement, she regains her sight. Her father is unaware that his daughter has been saved and becomes convinced that Strout has killed her. He grabs a revolver and attempts to shoot Strout, but he appears to have arrived too late. Stiles, who realized he was being lied to, has killed Strout in a rage. CastReception Film magazine Moving Picture World was uninspired by the film's story, but called it an entertaining film. The New York Times thought the film was 'superficial' and stated that not even Lon Chaney's acting could save it. Variety praised 'the fearful hokum purveyed in the story' and was especially positive about Chaney and Elmo Lincoln. Barbara La Marr received favorable reviews from the critics as well, and the film was a success at the box office.

His father Gabriel de Rochechouart de Mortemart was a childhood friend of Louis XIII. His older sister was Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, the celebrated beauty of the era; another sister was Madame de Montespan herself the mistress of Louis XIV. He was G√©n√©ral des gal√®res and Marshal of France, Mar√©chal de Vivonne. Biography The only son of Gabriel de Rochechouart de Mortemart, he was a member of the ancient House of Rochechouart which were the most ancient noble family in France after the royal family. Encyclop√©die Universalis This powerful dynasty of the Carolingian era dates back to Foucher, supporter of Charles the Bald, who became viscount (vicomte) of Limoges in 876. His descendants‚ÄîLimoges, Rochechouart, Mortemart and de Brosse‚Äîruled over the area for several centuries. The family takes its name from their seat at Rochechouart. His siblings were famous in their own right; his eldest sister, Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart (1634‚Äì1693), was a celebrated beauty famed for her obsession with her own self-importance; the next sister, Fran√ßoise de Rochechouart de Mortemart (1643‚Äì1707), was the future ma√Ætresse en titre of Louis XIV from 1667 giving him seven children. His youngest, often called the most beautiful of the Mortemart daughters, was Marie Madeleine, who took a religious path in life later being nicknamed the reine des Abbesses, \\"Queen of Abbesses\\". She was the Abbess of Fontevraud, the ancient and wealthy convent in Anjou. He was born at the H√¥tel de Rochechouart, the family town house in Paris, on 25 August 1636 and was given the courtesy title of Count of Vivonne, one of the family's numerous titles. The county was later elevated to a duchy by which he is better known. He was an enfant d'honneur, a child which had the right to play with the infant Dauphin, the future Louis XIV. Later on, he was noted as one of the bravest and wittiest men at Louis XIV's court. Louis Victor voluntarily entered the military in 1653 as the Captain of the Royal Guard under the command of Roger de Rabutin, cousin of the famous Madame de S√©vign√©. He distinguished himself greatly in Flanders and in Artois under the command of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne. He was notable for his involvement in the sieges of Landrecies, Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut and Valenciennes. Roger de Rabutin reported to his cousin the bravery of the young Louis Victor at Cond√© under his command. Later Colonel of the Royal Etranger, he served in Italy twice before demanding a place in the Marines. He worked with the Duke of Beaufort, and was later created the Grand Master of Navigation. General of the Galleys Duke of Vivone at Brest naval museum Captain of vessels and created a Peer of France in 1663, he embarked with the unfortunate Chevalier Paul on an expedition to Jijel in north eastern Algeria. When war had been declared with Spain in 1667, Louis Victor distinguished himself in Flanders under the eyes of the king himself. When not on the field, Louis Victor was campaigning on the galleys becoming g√©n√©ral des gal√®res in March 1669, partly due to the influence of his sister la Belle Montespan who had been Louis XIV's mistress for about two years by then. Some time after his promotion he attacked the Turks who had invaded the Venetians at the siege of Candia. After the death of Beaufort (25 June 1669) Louis Victor bought up the vessels and continued the fight. Injured due to combat on 24 July, he was quick to realise that he could not force the Turks to retreat, withdrawing himself to Toulon. In 1671 he was given command of protecting the southern coast of France from barbary pirates. In 1672, in the French War with Holland, he took part in the famous crossing of the Rhine. His horse, Claud Le Blanc, tripped in the water, causing Louis Victor to fall into the river. At the same moment, he was shot in the arm and he had to be carried away in a sling but he was carried with the pride of the Mortemarts. In 1673 he signalled the siege of Maastricht. The next year he was named Governor of Champagne. Viceroy of Sicily The next year, 1675, Louis XIV sent him to Messina where there had been a revolt under Spanish control of Sicily. By 11 February he had sent relief to the town and on 2 August 1675 he was created a Marshal of France. He was known as the Mar√©chal de Vivonne. In August 1676, (22 Aug.) he was made the Viceroy of Sicily, where he sent navies to Duquesne Tourville who were fighting with the Dutch in the Battles of Augusta (22 April 1676) and Palermo (2 June 1676). Louis Victor is known to have declared to the local people on behalf of the Sun King that there was held \\"nothing more at heart than the triumph of the victims against their oppressors\\"rien de plus √† c≈ìur que le triomphe des victimes contre leurs oppresseurs and that he would \\"take them definitively under his powerful and friendly protection\\".les prendre d√©finitivement sous sa puissante et amicale protection The battle of Palermo in 1676 Despite this, the king ordered Louis Victor to abandon the site in January, 1678, leaving Messina to defend itself. As time went on, French men who were left at the place were killed by Sicilians out of reaction to the French abandonment. After the French evacuated Messina in April 1678, Louis Victor stopped working at sea. First Gentleman of the King's Chamber Returning to Paris having a very successful military career, he was created Premier gentilhomme de la Chambre du Roi, \\"First Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber\\". He had returned to a court that was no longer dominated by his sisters influence. Despite this, he had an intriguing life at court and later became an intimate of the king himself. \\"Monsieur de Vivonne had infinite spirit and entertained it without fear; he pleased the king with a hundred stories\\"M. de Vivonne avait infiniment d'esprit, l'amusait sans pouvoir se faire craindre. Le roi en faisait cent contes plaisants reported the duc de Saint-Simon. Louis Victor was also close to the playwright Moli√®re, and Nicolas Boileau, whom, he himself presented to the king. His only son, Louis died in April 1688; Louis Victor was greatly affected by the loss of his only son. He died at Chaillot aged 52. He was succeeded by his grandson Louis de Rochechouart de Mortemart (1681‚Äì1740). His daughter, Marie √âlisabeth, comtesse de Castries, was a lady-in-waiting to her first cousin, the duchesse d'Orl√©ans; the two were very close but when Madame de Castries suggested a marital union between the families, the Duchess of Orl√©ans reprimanded her for the idea of an Orl√©ans daughter marrying a mere nobleman.

Overview Sociedad Comercial del Plata was founded in Buenos Aires on June 7, 1927,Buenos Aires Stock Exchange: SCP and became a holding company with varied interests, primarily real estate.Bradynet: Sociedad Comercial del Plata Francisco Soldati (a nephew of Jos√© Francisco Soldati, the owner of the city's largest utility, the Italian-Argentine Electric Company, and founder of the Villa Lugano ward of Buenos Aires)Swiss Info: Villa Lugano bought controlling interest in SCP in 1965, and expanded the company into petroleum transport; he ultimately lost his life in a November 1979 bombing carried out by the far-left Montoneros terrorist group, in one of their last attacks.New York Times: The Big Push Toward Privatization in Argentina His son, Francisco, became President of SCP in 1976. SCP remained focused on its fuel and electricity, and established a realty, Del Plata Propiedades, though the group's growth was hampered by the debt and inflation crisis in the local economy during the 1980s. The younger Francisco Soldati died in a polo accident in April 1991. His younger brother, Santiago Soldati, took control of SCP at a time when Argentine President Carlos Menem and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo were advancing an ambitious privatizations policy. SCP became a minority shareholder in newly privatized television, telephone, natural gas, electricity, freight rail services, as well as the metro Buenos Aires water utility. These became Telef√©, Telef√≥nica de Argentina, Transportadora de Gas del Norte, Transener, Ferroexpreso Pampeano and Aguas Argentinas, respectively, during the early 1990s. SCP also gained control of water utilities in C√≥rdoba, La Plata, and Santa Fe.Cr√≠tica de la Argentina: Soldati, el lobbysta de la Barrick Gold Soldati invested part of SCP's earnings into two tourist attractions: the Tren de la Costa railway, and the Parque de la Costa amusement park. The first was developed by securing a concession in 1993 to operate the formerly state-owned Ferrocarril Central Argentino route between the northern Buenos Aires suburbs of Olivos and Tigre, in disuse since 1961. Following the recovery of derelict rails and stations, and the purchase of new equipment, the 16 km (10 mi) \\"Coastal Train\\" was inaugurated in April 1995, helping revive the largely upscale area's real estate market.Historia del Tren de la Costa As the largest shareholder in Aguas Argentinas (with 20 percent), SCP profited by Soldati's decision in 1998 to sell its stake to Paris-based Suez, which paid SCP US$150 million for its shares, or three times what Soldati's company had paid in 1993.Santoro, Daniel. The Aguas Tango. February 6, 2003. The sale of the profitable unit was partly motivated by growing debts at SCP, however, whose revenue forecast was dampened by the local effects during 1995-96 of the Mexican peso crisis. Its US$715 million debt was nearly double its book value, and in 1997, SCP divested itself of the natural gas processing concerns had under its Compa√±√≠a General de Combustibles (CGC) unit for US$230 million, most of which had to be earmarked for debt retirement. Controlling CPC, the nation's second-largest construction company, Soldati shed a half ownership stake in the builder, as well as 100% of the BAN gas company, by 1998. SCP, however, defaulted on a US$25 million debt in April 1999, which effectively shut it out of the corporate bond market. The principal drain on the group's finances had reportedly been its US$400 million investment in the two, suburban Buenos Aires tourist attractions: the Tren and Parque de la Costa. Though a majority stake in the latter was sold, their ongoing losses and service costs on their startup debt continued to stymy SCP's balance sheet.La Naci√≥n: Soldati no pudo pagar una deuda de US $ 25 millones Negotiations with creditors followed, but a lawsuit filed against SCP by US-based Reef Exploration in 2000 over the sale of a subsidiary to Shell Petroleum led to Soldati's decision to file for SCP's bankruptcy in September of that year.P√°gina/12: Anochecer de Soldati The sale of a number of energy related interests to Techint, the Argentine multinational registered in Luxembourg, could not rescue SCP from bankruptcy, and in 2004, Soldati divested it of 81% of its CGC unit, which was sold to local household chemicals maker The Value Brand.Ambientalistas: Jabon sucio That year, SCP's bankruptcy was approved in court, which granted it an 80% discharge of a debt which had grown to US$1.2 billion, by then.Fortuna: La Corte Suprema revoc√≥ el concurso de acreedores de Comercial del Plata The discharge allowed SCP to enter into a modest venture with Millicom, a Luxembourg-based mobile phone network provider,Clar√≠n: El grupo Soldati, otra vez de compras which resulted in Latin America's first WiMax network.Wi-Fi Planet: Millicom Argentina Announces WiMax Network SCP's legal problems continued, however, as the bankruptcy ruling had been appealed by a commercial court prosecutor in 2006,iProfessional: Rev√©s judicial para el concurso de Sociedad Comercial del Plata and in October 2009, the Argentine Supreme Court struck down the earlier ruling, citing irregularities in the shareholders' meeting convened to approve the bankruptcy.

He is best known for his accompaniment on records by Barbecue Bob and Curley Weaver. Biography Mapp was born in Social Circle, Walton County, Georgia. He relocated in 1922 to Newton County, where he met the guitar player Curley Weaver. Mapp was noted in Newton County as a harmonica virtuoso with a unique style, who often performed for tips on the street. In 1925 Weaver and Mapp left for Atlanta. The twosome played at country dances. Weaver then formed a group with Mapp, Barbecue Bob, and Bob's brother Charlie Hicks and continued to play locally. In 1929, billed as the Georgia Cotton Pickers, they recorded for the Atlanta-based QRS label. Mapp also cut one solo track, \\"Riding the Blinds\\", the same year. None of the songs sold well. In November 1931, Mapp was found stabbed on an Atlanta street corner. His death certificate recorded that the brachial artery in his left arm had been severed. It gave his age as twenty. No one was charged with his murder. The certificate also noted that he was a musician; it was unusual at the time for a coroner to acknowledge such employment. Allmusic notes that there is some doubt regarding Mapp's year of birth.

Controversy= Land fraud  When the land for the University was leased out by the villagers for a nominal rent, local and state leaders promised that the local villagers will be given priority for admission and jobs. Since then, M.M.Pallam Raju, Union Minister for Human Resource Development, has told the villagers that the Central Universities Act, 2009, does not allow reservations for jobs based on domicile. The people felt cheated and no relief was given to them.  RSS leader speech  The University came under controversy and criticism when a senior leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Sunil Ambekar, presented a conference on \\"research methodology\\" without a research degree and as a chief guest organized by Central University of Haryana. Several scholars have questioned the option and asked if it comes under pressure from the government.

One of the Basque se√±or√≠os, it was a territory with its own political organization, with its own naval ensign, consulate in Bruges and customs offices in Balmaseda and Urdu√±a, from the 11th Century until 1876, when the Juntas Generales were abolished. Since 1379, when John I of Castile became the Lord of Biscay, the lordship got integrated into the Crown of Castile, and eventually the Kingdom of Spain.  Mythical foundation  The first explicit reference to the foundation of the Biscayan lordship is in the Livro de Linhagens, written between 1323 and 1344 by Pedro Afonso, Count of Barcelos. It is an entirely legendary account. The book narrates the arrival in Biscay of a man named Froom, a brother of the King of England, who had expelled him from his kingdom. Froom along with his son, Fortun Froes, defeat the Asturians in Busturia. Froom is killed in battle; his son was named the first Lord of Biscay. The Count of Barcelos then lists six additional mythical lords before he comes to Lope, the historical late-11th century lord, Lope √ç√±iguez.Jos√© Ram√≥n Prieto Lasa (2013), \\"La genealog√≠a de los Haro en el Livro de Linhagens del Conde de Barcelos\\", Anuario de Estudios Medievales, 43/2: 833-69 A notable story among these accounts, which bears some resemblance to the Melusine legend, is that of the Lady of Biscay (La Dama de Viscaya), a beautiful stranger found in the countryside by Lord Diego L√≥pez. She joins him only when he agrees to certain conditions, but he later violates these and she flees into the country with their daughter. Diego L√≥pez is subsequently captured by Moors, and their son Enheguez Guerra seeks out his mother for help. She gives him a horse, Pardalo, with whom he frees his father and is subsequently successful in all his battles. The later lords are said to have made sacrifices at Busturia in thanks for these events, their failure to do so resulting in attacks on the lords and townsmen by a mysterious knight.Jos√© Ram√≥n Prieto Lasa (1991), \\"Las Leyendas de los Se√±ores de Vizcaya y la Tradicion Melusiniana\\", doctoral dissertation, Complutense University of Madrid A better known but equally mythical story appears in the Bienandanzas e Fortunas of Lope Garc√≠a de Salazar (1454). In this story, a man named √áuria is born from the union of the god Sugaar and a Scottish (or in other versions, Irish, Danish or Frankish) princess in the village of Mundaka. √áuria was the elected chief of the Biscayans before the victorious battle of Arrigorriaga against the invading forces of the Kingdom of Asturias. Tradition holds that before the battle he saw two wolves carrying lambs in their mouths, presaging the victory; this scene is reflected in the arms of the lords of Biscay of the House of Haro. Garc√≠a de Salazar proceeds to give √áuria two sons by different mothers, Munso L√≥pez (perhaps representing the historical Munio Velaz of the early 10th century) and √çnigo Esquira (an apparent temporally-displaced doppelg√§nger of the later lord of that name), who are followed by further apocryphal lords, Lope D√≠az and Sancho L√≥pez, before Garc√≠a de Salazar names a second √çnigo Esquira, this time representing the first authentic Lord of Biscay, the 11th-century √ç√±igo L√≥pez Ezkerra. This tale of √áuria would further develop into the legend of Jaun Zuria (the White Lord) of Biscay, treated as a historical figure perhaps identical to Froom by 19th century historians.Juan Antonio Llorente, Noticias hist√≥ricas de las tres provincias vascongadas en que se procura investigar el estado civil antiguo de √Ålava, Guip√∫zcoa y Vizcaya, y el origen de sus fueros (1808), vol. 5, pp. 429, 441, 486-7 The 16th-century historian Gonzalo Argote de Molina tells of other legendary lords of Biscay, and in this he is followed by several 17th and 18th century historians. They name a Hudon (or Eudon), the son of a Duke of Cantabria, who became lord of Biscay and who had a son named Zeno who succeeded him in the title. Hudon and Zeno are variously placed at different dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 9th century, and while the precise details differ in the different accounts, they are described as being related by marriage to the King of Pamplona and to Jaun Zuria. As with Froom and √áuria, there is no historical basis for these men.  History =Biscay before the lordship The first time Biscay is mentioned with that name (in Spanish, Vizcaya) is in the Chronicle of Alfonso III in the late 9th century, which tells of the regions repopulated under orders of Alfonso I, and how some territories \\"owned by their own\\", among them Biscay, were not affected by these repopulations. Biscay is mentioned again in the 10th-century C√≥dice de Roda, which narrates the wedding between Velazquita, daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona, to Munio Velaz, Count of √Ålava, in Biscay. It is considered then, that Biscay was by this period controlled by the Kingdom of Navarre. House of Haro In 1076, after the assassination of Sancho IV of Navarre, Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile and Sancho Ram√≠rez of Arag√≥n fought a war over control of the Kingdom of Navarre. Count √ç√±igo L√≥pez, lord of Biscay surrendering the fortress of Bilibio to the Leonese, which aided in their conquest of La Rioja. In exchange, the Leonese monarchs promised to support √ç√±igo's personal interests in Durangaldea, Gipuzkoa and √Ålava. √ç√±igo died in 1077, and his son, Lope √ç√±iguez became Lord of Biscay, now as vassal of the Kingdom of Castile. The lordship would be later inherited by his son, Diego L√≥pez I de Haro, who served as Lord of Biscay until 1134 when he was defeated and probably killed by Alfonso the Battler, King of Arag√≥n and Navarre. The Lordship was then reintegrated into Navarre and Ladr√≥n √ç√±iguez, one of the most powerful men of the Navarrese court, was named Lord of Biscay. After his death, in 1155, his son Vela Ladr√≥n, who at the time was also Lord of √Ålava and Guip√∫zcoa, became Lord of Biscay and ruled through the reigns of Alfonso the Battler, Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez and Sancho VI. During that time, Lope D√≠az I de Haro claimed the title of Lord of Biscay, though he never set foot on the land during his lifetime. In 1173 Alfonso VIII of Castile attacked the Kingdom of Navarre and, a year later with the death of Vela Ladr√≥n, occupied Biscay and restored the House of Haro: Diego L√≥pez II de Haro was named Lord of Biscay. In 1176 the kingdoms of Navarre and Castile signed a declaration of peace, agreeing to arbitration by Henry II of England. New borders were delimited and ratified in 1179. Biscay was divided, with the left bank of the River Nervi√≥n becoming part of Castile, while the rest of Biscay, Durangaldea and √Ålava (east from the Bayas River) were retained by Navarre. Diego L√≥pez II, Lord of Biscay, swore fealty to the Navarrese monarchy and he ruled Biscay until 1183. The Lords of Biscay were vassals of the Kingdom of Navarre until 1206, when the Haro family were given the title of alf√©rez at the Castilian court, and thereafter Biscay was in the area of influence of the Castilian kingdom, though it would not be wholly integrated into it until much later. Crown domain The Lordship of Biscay was in the hands of the Haro family and their descendants through 1370, when it passed to prince Juan of Castile, a distant kinsman with a maternal descent from the earlier Lords. He would subsequently succeed to his father's Kingdom of Castile, and from that time the Lordship remained bound to the Castilian kingdom, and from the reign of Charles I, to the Spanish crown. However, the Lordship maintained a high degree of autonomy, through the Biscayan law, or fueros. In 1874, after the abolishment of the First Spanish Republic and the beginning of the Restoration, Alfonso XII abolished the Biscayan law and Juntas Generales; putting the Lordship to an end. Since then, Biscay has been fully integrated into the Spanish crown as the province of Biscay.  Territory = Tierra Llana  Vigil tower in Zamudio. Tierra Llana (literally, flatlands) refers to the territory that was not protected by stone walls, that is, mostly rural areas and farms. This territory was organized into 72 elizates, grouped in six merindades. Each elizate had a representation in the Juntas Generales. * Merindad of Busturia (26 elizates): Mundaka (1st), Sukarrieta (2nd), Busturia (3rd), Murueta (4th), Forua (5th), Lumo (6th), Muxika (7th), Arrieta (8th), Mendata (9th), Arratzu (10th), Ajangiz (11th), Ere√±o (12th), Ibarrangelu (13th), Gautegiz Arteaga (14th), Kortezubi (15th), Natxitua (16th), Ispaster (17th), Bedarona (18th), Aulesti (19th), Nabarniz (20th), Gizaburuaga (21st), Amoroto (22nd), Mendexa (23rd), Berriatua (24th), Ziortza (25th) and Arbatzegi (26th). * Merindad of Markina (2 elizates): Xemein (27th) and Etxebarria (28th). * Merindad of Zornotza (3 elizates): Amorebieta (29th), Etxano (30th) and Ibarruri (31st). * Merindad of Uribe (32 elizates): Gorozika (32nd), Barakaldo (33rd), Abando (34th), Deusto (35th), Bego√±a (36th), Etxebarri (37th), Galdakao (38th), Arrigorriaga (39th), Arrankudiaga (40th), Lezama (41st), Zamudio (42nd), Loiu (43rd), Sondika (44th), Erandio (45th), Leioa (46th), Getxo (47th), Berango (48th), Sopelana (49th), Urduliz (50th), Barrika (51st), Gorliz (52nd), Laukiz (53rd), Gatika (54th), Lemoiz (55th), Maruri (56th), Bakio (57th), Morga (58th), Mungia (59th), Gamiz (60th), Fika (61st), Fruiz (62nd), Me√±aka (63rd) and Derio (72nd). * Merindad of Bedia (1 elizate): Lemoa (64th). * Merindad of Arratia (7 elizates): Igorre (65th), Arantzazu (66th), Artea (67th), Zeanuri (68th), Dima (69th), Zeberio (70th) and Ubide (71st). All these regions were governed by the Biscayan law, or fuero. There were five de facto elizates, who did not belong to any merindad nor have any representation in the Juntas. Those were Alonsotegi, Arakaldo, Basauri, Zaratamo and Zollo.  Cities and towns  There were 21 walled cities and towns, all founded during the Middle Ages. They were the towns of Balmaseda, Bermeo, Bilbao, Durango, Ermua, Gernika, Lanestosa, Lekeitio, Markina, Ondarroa, Otxandio, Portugalete, Plentzia, Mungia, Areatza, Errigoiti, Larrabetzu, Gerrikaitz, Miraballes, Elorrio and Urdu√±a. There towns had their own municipal charter or carta puebla, with their own set of laws different from those of the fueros.  Enkarterri  Casa de Juntas of Avellaneda The region known as Enkarterri (Encartaciones in Spanish) is located at the west of the River Nervi√≥n and was incorporated into the Lordship in the 13th Century by the House of Haro. It was traditionally formed by 10 republics, that were united in councils, each with its own representation and government. Enkarterri had its own junta and fueros, but eventually adopted the ones from Vizcaya. Their representatives held councils in Avellaneda. A single common representative of all of them assisted the Biscayan Juntas Generales. In the 17th Century, five of the councils got their own representative in the Juntas. In 1804, the Junta of Avellaneda was dissolved and its councils incorporated into the Tierra Llana. The Enkarterri had the following councils: Karrantza, Trutzioz, Artzentales, Sopuerta, Galdames, Zalla, G√ºe√±es, Gordexola, The Three Councils of the Somorrostro Valley (Santurtzi, Sestao and Trapagaran) and The Four Councils of the Somorrostro Valley (Muskiz, Zierbena, Abanto de Suso and Abanto de Yuso).  Durango  The Foral Field of Gerediaga The region known as the County of Durango (Merindad de Durango in Spanish) and currently known as Durangaldea is a valley located along the upper river Ibaizabal and had the traditional name of Merindad of Durango. Durango and its valley were a semi-autonomous region, controlled by the Kingdom of Pamplona (later, Navarre) and had its own Foral law, and celebrated its own council mettings in Gerediaga. In 1200 it was conquered by the Kingdom of Castile, and in 1212 Alfonso VIII of Castile gives the land to Diego L√≥pez II de Haro, Lord of Biscay, as a reward for his services in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, being then incorporated into Biscay. The Merindad of Durango comprised the following elizates: Abadi√±o, Berriz, Mallabia, Ma√±aria, Iurreta, Garai, Zaldibar, Arratzola, Axpe, Atxondo, Izurtza and Elorrio.  Political institutions  The 1575 publication of the Biscayan law or fuero.  Juntas Generales  The Biscayan Juntas Generales were the maximum governing body of the Lordship; in the Juntas were represented all the Biscayan territories. There were in total 72 representatives; each elizate had one, the towns and cities had one each.Historia General del Pa√≠s Vasco, Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 149  Regiment  The Regimiento General (General Regiment) was established in 1500 and had the function of governing the territory when the Juntas were not meeting. It was formed by 12 regidores that were named by the Juntas and one corregidor. The regiment meet three times each year, and eventually got the name of Universal government of the Lordship. The Regimiento Particular (Particular Regiment) was established in 1570 and had the function of governing in the General Regiment's absence. It was formed by all the regidores that lived in Bilbao.Historia General del Pa√≠s Vasco, Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 150  Diputaci√≥n General  It served as the fundamental political institution of the Lordship during the 18th Century. In 1645 the Particular Regiment changed its name to Diputaci√≥n General and were granted autonomy from the General Regiment. It was formed by seven members; six general members and one president, who was the corregidor. Its function was to govern the Juntas Generales, the Diputaci√≥n had competences in military and financial issues, as well as the maintenance of the roads and charities.Historia General del Pa√≠s Vasco, Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 151  List of lords  The arms of the House of Haro, Lords of Biscay between the 11th and 14th centuries.

Rocholl was born in Sachsenberg (Waldeck) on 11 June 1854, the son of Rudolf Rocholl, the Lutheran theologian and philosopher. He was a student in Munich in 1877, then at the Dresden Academy. After a year, he moved to Munich where he studied historical painting under Karl von Piloty. He completed his art studies at the D√ºsseldorf Academy where he developed his interest in military art under the influence of Wilhelm Camphausen; his contemporaries in this field were Carl R√∂chling and Richard Kn√∂tel. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. The artist observed the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent German army manoeuvres between 1883 and 1888; in 1890, he traveled to Russia to view the German Garde-Korps on manoeuvre. Later in the decade, he was attached to the Turkish Army and covered the conflict in Thessalia in 1897 between the Turks and the Greeks; his sketches of the fighting were published the following year. He covered the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 as the official artist of the German expeditionary force.Burmeister, Helmut (2000).

Hofgeismar: Verein f√ºr Hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde, Zweigverein Hofgeismar A decade later, he covered the fighting between Turkey and Albania. Many of his paintings depict German military scenes, especially the battles of the Franco-Prussian War. One of his most famous pictures depicted King William at the Battle of Sedan, meeting his triumphant soldiers after the victory. Rocholl also painted a large mural for the Evangelischen Padagogiums in Bad Godesberg. In his 60th year, he became a war artist covering the campaign on the Western Front. His War Letters printed in 1916 in which he described the fear and destruction. An autobiography of his life as a painter appeared in 1921.

She is an associate professor in the Security Studies Program within the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. Her work is primarily focused on counter-terrorism and South Asian topics.  Academic career  Fair received her Ph.D. from the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilization at the University of Chicago in 2004. Previously, she received a masters of arts and bachelor of science from the same university. Fair served as a senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation, political officer with the UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan and as a senior research associate with the United States Institute of Peace. She specializes in political and military affairs in South Asia.Author information, Oxford University Press, retrieved September 6, 2016. She has served as a Senior Fellow at West Point's Combating Terrorism Center, a Senior Resident Fellow at the Institute of Defense Studies and Analyses (New Delhi) and took a Reagan‚ÄìFascell Democracy Fellowship in the spring of 2017. Fair is a Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor in the Peace and Security Studies Program (SSP) within Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. She has as authored, co-authored and co-edited several books, including Pakistan's Enduring Challenges (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015), Policing Insurgencies: Cops as Counterinsurgents (Oxford University Press, 2014);Political Islam and Governance in Bangladesh (Routledge, 2010); Treading on Hallowed Ground: Counterinsurgency Operations in Sacred Spaces (Oxford University Press, 2008); The Madrassah Challenge: Militancy and Religious Education in Pakistan (USIP, 2008), and The Cuisines of the Axis of Evil and Other Irritating States (Globe Pequot, 2008), among others. Her current book project is Lashkar-e-Taiba: In its Own Words. Views Fair has published several articles defending the use of drone strikes in Pakistan and has been critical of analyses by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other humanitarian organizations, arguing that drone strikes are accurate, have reduced casualties, have targeted Taliban leadership and are popular among some Pakistanis.  Academic controversies  Fair's work and viewpoints have been the subject of criticism. In 2015, journalist Glenn Greenwald dismissed Fair's arguments in support of drone strikes as \\"rank propaganda\\", arguing there are \\"enormous amounts of evidence\\" showing drones are counterproductive, pointing to mass civilian casualties and independent studies. Commenting on her debate with Greenwald, Brookings Institution senior fellow Shadi Hamid called Fair's arguments \\"surprisingly weak\\". In 2010, Fair denied the notion that drones caused any civilian deaths, alleging Pakistani media reports were responsible for creating this perception. Jeremy Scahill wrote that Fair's statement was \\"simply false\\" and contradicted by New America's detailed study on drone casualties. Fair later said that casualties are caused by the UAVs, but maintains they are the most effective tool for fighting terrorism. Writing for The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf challenged Fair's co-authored narrative that the U.S. could legitimize support in Pakistan for its drone program using 'education' and 'public diplomacy'; he called it an \\"example of interventionist hubris and naivete\\" built upon flawed interpretation of public opinion data. An article in the Middle East Research and Information Project called the work \\"some of the most propagandistic writing in support of President Barack Obama‚Äôs targeted kill lists to date.\\" It censured the view that Pakistanis needed to be informed by the U.S. what is \\"good for them\\" as fraught with imperialist condescension; or the assumption that the Urdu press was less informed than the English press ‚Äì because the latter was sometimes less critical of the U.S. Fair's journalistic sources have been questioned for their credibility and she has been accused of having a conflict of interest due to her past work with U.S. government think tanks, as well as the CIA. In 2011 and 2012, she received funding from the U.S. embassy in Islamabad to conduct a survey on public opinion concerning militancy. However, Fair states most of the grants went to a survey firm and that it had no influence on her research. Pakistani media analysts have dismissed Fair's views as hawkish rhetoric, riddled with factual inaccuracies, lack of objectivity, and being selectively biased. She has also been rebuked for comments on social media perceived as provocative, such as suggesting burning down Pakistan's embassy in Afghanistan or asking India to \\"squash Pakistan militarily, diplomatically, politically and economically.\\" She has been accused of double standards, partisanship towards India, and has been criticized for her contacts with dissident leaders from Balochistan, a link which they claim \\"raises serious questions if her interest in Pakistan is merely academic.\\"  Personal controversies  In January 2017, Fair was involved in a Twitter dispute with Asra Q. Nomani. In response to Nomani's tweet that as a Muslim, she voted for President Trump, Fair tweeted that she had \\"written [Nomani] off as a human being\\" and that Nomani had \\"pimped herself out to all media outlets.\\" Nomani responded by filing a complaint with Georgetown University, Fair's employer, alleging discrimination and harassment. In May 2017, Fair began an altercation with white nationalist Richard B. Spencer at a gym in Alexandria, Virginia. While the two were working out, Fair approached Spencer and accused him of being a Nazi, along with a number of other accusations, leading a third gym patron to intervene on behalf of him. This incident resulted in Spencer's membership being terminated by the manager of the gym. In January 2018, Fair was involved in an incident at Frankfurt Airport. When her bag was flagged for possibly containing explosives, it was searched and German Federal Police instructed Fair that she would have to dispose of a liquid deodorant or transfer it to her checked bag. German police stated that Fair was uncooperative, as she accused them of sexism and of being Nazis and thugs, and directed expletives at them. Fair was charged with slander under Germany's defamation law. She subsequently published an article on HuffPost partially rejecting the police account of the incident. In the midst of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in September 2018, Fair tweeted that Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were \\"entitled white men justifying a serial rapists' arrogated entitlement\\" and that they \\"deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps.\\" She made additional comments expressing support for post-mortem castration and corpse desecration of the senators. At least one student expressed the fear that Fair's comments would cause students who hold opposing views to feel threatened. Georgetown University responded by saying that her expressions did not violate the university's policies. The university later responded by moving up her scheduled international research leave. Fair has accused the historian Dipesh Chakrabarty of sexual harassment.News Works ; Books * Cuisines of the Axis of Evil and Other Irritating States: A Dinner Party Approach to International Relations (The Lyons Press, 2008). . * Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army's Way of War (Oxford University Press, 2014). . * In Their Own Words: Understanding Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (Oxford University Press, 2019). ; Edited collections * Treading on Hallowed Ground: Counterinsurgency Operations in Sacred Spaces (with Sumit Ganguly, Oxford University Press, 2008). . * Islam and Governance in Bangladesh (with Ali Riaz, Routledge, 2010). . * Pakistan in National and Regional Change: State and Society in Flux (with Shaun Gregory, Routledge, 2013). . ; Research reports * Limited Conflicts Under the Nuclear Umbrella: Indian and Pakistani Lessons from the Kargil Crisis (with Ashley J.

The film documents China's resistance to Japan's invasion during the Second World War. Inside Fighting China is directed by Stuart Legg, and narrated by Lorne Greene. The film's French version title is La Chine sous les armes.  Synopsis  In 1931, while the United States and the United Kingdom are mired in the Great Depression and consumed with domestic strife, Japanese territorial ambitions on China have not provoked international attention. With their diplomats extolling a new East Asian empire, Japan began a campaign to brutally subjugate China. Following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, China's call for an investigation of war crimes, resulted in the League of Nations probing the use of poison gas and \\"liquid fire\\" by Japan. The international body ultimately did not intervene to end the Japanese aggression, allowing Japan as an occupying force to exploit the raw material resources of the region. Manchuria was only the first \\"stepping stone\\" in Japan's plans, with the conquest of China leading to future aspirations on Burma and India. By 1937, plans were in place for a rapid three-month campaign that would collapse any Chinese resistance. Initially, the Japanese scored major victories, such as the Battle of Shanghai, and overrunning the Chinese capital of Nanking. Slowly, China began to react to the Japanese invasion with individuals rallying behind the Communist and Nationalist groups that had once been vying for power. In political rallies, at schools, even in the fields, ordinary Chinese were coming together not only to stem the tide of Japanese attacks but also to address the economic and social needs that have bedevilled China. \\"... people still needed to learn how to conquer poverty, promote the well being of people and labour for the common good.\\" After failing to stop the Japanese in Wuhan, the Chinese central government was relocated to Chongqing in the Chinese interior. By 1939, Chinese victories in Changsha and Guangxi continued to put pressure on the beleaguered Chinese military. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, however, brought the United States into the global conflict on the side of the British Empire. With Western allies finally reacting to the Japanese threat in the Far East, war mat√©riel was shipped to China. Other nations, including Canada, trained Chinese soldiers and airmen. Facing a new Chinese resolve, despite the Japanese victories and incursions deep into the interior territories, the stretched lines of the occupying forces resulted in the war in China deteriorating into an impasse.

To ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. After the success of Warclouds in the Pacific, the NFB was able to make a further arrangement with United Artists for additional titles to be distributed in the United States.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.Ohayon, Albert. \\"Propaganda cinema at the NFB\\". National Film Board of Canada, July 13, 2009. Retrieved: February 13, 2016. Historian Malek Khouri, in analyzing Inside Fighting China and the role of propaganda in the NFB wartime documentaries, said. \\"During the early years of the NFB, its creative output was largely informed by the turbulent political and social climate the world was facing. World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover. Khouri further stated: \\"unity between people from different political viewpoints is essential for defeating fascism and other forms of oppression. Such unity is also crucial for building a better and more prosperous future. Sending home a familiar message on the need to overcome political differences, Legg cites the example of the Popular Front in China, where Nationalists and Communists joined together in the resistance against the Japanese invasion in the late 1930s. ... earlier western governments' ignoring of economic and social problems eventually also led them to ignoring the growing menace of fascism which fed on social instability and lack of equitable social systems. The film also condemns the inaction of western governments in relation to the pre-war Japanese invasion of China. In a phraseology that echoes those used in statements by leaders of Communist and Popular Front movements in Canada and around the world, the film affirms that to counter all kinds of oppression people need to 'organize and unite'.\\"Khouri 2007, pp. 136‚Äì137.

Using document scanning and document capture technologies, companies can digitise incoming mail and automate the classification and distribution of mail within the organization. Both paper and electronic mail (email) can be managed through the same process allowing companies to standardize their internal mail distribution procedures and adhere to company compliance policies. Many companies still believe that they are legally bound to archive some documents as paper for a certain time, such as accounting documents or contracts. According to a recent survey by AIIM, legal admissibility of scanned documents is still seen as an issue in over a quarter of businesses. However, the reality is that these rules only apply to a small minority of documents. Most digitized documents are now legally admissible in a court of law. The new British Standard, BS 10008 \\"Evidential weight and legal admissibility of electronic information\\" covers this in detail. The culture of 'avoiding risk at all cost' is what compels companies to print and archive thousands of documents every day. Digital Mailroom Reasons for implementation Mail volumes continue to grow exponentially, stimulated by business growth and mobile workforces. For example, medium-sized companies now process 100,000 pieces of mail a month and service over 200 departments. In addition, the corporate mailroom, a vital link in the corporate information system, is struggling to keep abreast of this paper flow. Meanwhile, today's organisations demand instant, accurate information; US businesses spend over $500 billion annually turning the information on the documents they receive every day into useful data that they can use to run their business. The need for corporate compliance and accountability has also forced large corporations to invest heavily in information backup, storage systems, and compliance solutions. Some corporate mailrooms have benefited from the development of high-speed automation equipment designed for moving physical mail more efficiently through the system. However, the challenges are daunting, considering that most mailrooms are using one-piece-at-a-time visual identification and manual sorting methods. By digitizing the incoming mail process, and indexing the documents on the fly, companies can not only gain control of their mail processes internally (no more efficiency losses, gaps in document control and loss of valuable mail), but will have the opportunity to combine electronic mail formats (e-mail, fax) in the same document processing flow. A digital mailroom designed as a central platform for information allows an organization to bring rationality to mail processing and significant gains in productivity and customer service. Benefits=Reducing the decision cycle One major benefit of turning all incoming paper mail into images as soon as it is received is the extent to which it shortens the decision cycle. Although it might be difficult to quantify exactly what the cost savings are, it seems an obvious advantage. Digital mailroom s allow users to receive an immediate notification of a document's arrival at the company. Employees can access images in record time, regardless of where the documents were physically acquired. Files can then be processed very rapidly according to their level of urgency. Just as digital mailrooms facilitate the exchange of company information, they also facilitate the coordination of several people around the same document. The decision-making process becomes quicker and more accurate. Rationalising the circulation of information The various technologies at the heart of digital mailrooms help companies rationalise their processes, e.g. it allows companies to reduce costs associated with resending documents between sites. Reducing paper costs Mailroom costs not only include staff costs involved in the distribution of letters, but also the costs associated with the resending, loss or deterioration of documents. A digital mailroom implementation has a direct effect on all those costs and becomes a key element of competitiveness for the company. Another source of paper costs is the one associated with the physical storage of documents. Encouraging employees \\"to do without paper\\" will quickly lead to the reduction in the cost of excessive printing and copying of documents. The aim is obviously not to ban the paper from the work environment but rather to set up a new coherent and secure organisation that makes the use of paper superfluous. Ensuring data tracking Ensuring incoming mail tracking has become a necessity for the majority of companies, with compliance regulation being a major factor. The earlier a document is transformed into an image file, the more reliably it can be tracked throughout its life cycle. Furthermore, a scanned document becomes accessible by all authorised users (as a PDF, TIFF or JPEG file). The file created includes more than simply images; it references one or more documents in the archive database and records all the actions carried out by the people responsible for the file. The security of the process guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the document, which aligns with the records management policy of the company. Improving customer service The electronic management of incoming mail improves the handling of documents within service oriented companies and agencies. It enhances the quality of the service offered to customers by allowing staff to instantly access customer files and answer questions immediately. The improvement of customer service is considered to be of fundamental importance by the majority of companies. Reduce dependency on physical office locations Digitizing mail upon its entry into an organization coupled with content management systems allows mail to be routed to appropriate staff members regardless of their physical location. The growing trend of remote work has lessened the overall need for real estate for the company mailroom. Many companies are now opting for mailroom software to automate their entire inbound and outbound mail operations. Technologies=Document capture \\"Document capture\\" is the act of scanning paper documents so they can be archived and retrieved in their original image format. It is the most widespread imaging technology used by companies today. Software improvements now make it possible to capture paper documents while importing electronic files and to process them together through the same production platform. Both incoming paper and electronic mail can now be archived together at the same storage location. Another major change is the ability to scan documents from remote locations and to retrieve them through a web interface. This is known as distributed capture and provides many cost benefits to companies with multiple branch offices or remotely located staff. Data capture Originally, forms processing technologies were only able to extract and validate data from structured documents such as administrative forms. The improvements in OCR technology now make it possible to automatically extract all data from semi-structured documents (e.g. Invoices) ‚Äì the technical acronym for this is Intelligent Document Capture (IDC). For fully unstructured documents (e.g. legal contracts, customer correspondence, and white mail), it is not yet possible to locate and extract all information. However, technologies have improved enough to identify the document type and automatically extract key information that can be used to index the document and/or route the document to the right department or recipient. Document classification Software using a graphical approach can analyze and classify mixed batches of structured or semi-structured documents in order to build a library of templates. Using this auto-generated library of templates, the software can then identify and extract data from any scanned document in a single flow. This image-based classification approach, combined with a full- text analysis of certain documents (based on a keyword search), are the main technologies used today to process semi- or unstructured documents. These innovative automatic classification technologies reduce the need for pre- sorting documents before the scanning process. As a result, companies receiving high volumes of paper mail can make significant cost reductions every year. Workflow Workflow applications enable electronic documents and information to circulate inside the company. They might have to manage very complex processes related to multiple locations due to the globalization of companies. The increasing importance of security is another vital challenge. One of the key developments in workflow technologies is around making company processes and workflow processes more consistent in order to avoid organizational changes when implementing these tools. Although company organizations tend to become increasingly complex, these software solutions are becoming simpler in terms of implementation and interfaces. Archiving Due to the high volume of documents that need to be archived by organizations today, it is critical that the documents can be stored rapidly, securely managed and quickly retrieved through a common user interface. Documents can usually be archived on a variety of electronic storage media and easily retrieved through a Web interface (thin client). There are many archiving solutions on the market today, some as a component of an ECM or document management solution and some as a stand-alone system specifically designed for the purpose of high volume, high speed archiving. Document and content management A document can be an image, a file stored and compressed in a tiff, gif or jpg electronic exchange format, or an MS Office file or a PDF file (Acrobat exchange format). Content generally includes all the above combined with any data/information as well as other electronic files such as e-mails and web pages. Content Management solutions need back-end repositories or databases (e.g. Oracle or MS SQL Server) to store the files and retrieval data. During the last decade, these software solutions have benefited from the universal XML standard used to index, store and access files to and from any repository. Relative to the other systems, content management systems manage more complex administrative, access and workflow rules in relation to the number of files and file formats it needs to support. Evolution of hardware The range of hardware available to turn paper documents into digital images has increased considerably in the last 10 years. Although desktop scanners and multi-function devices (MFDs) are now very affordable and well suited to a small office or departmental scanning requirements, the need for high speed, high volume document scanners is still evident. The speed, reliability and increased functionality of these high-end scanners can save considerable time and money in the long term. Today, it is possible to scan documents of different dimensions and formats in the same flow, scan colour documents, sort them physically and read data from them using OCR and barcode technologies during the scanning process. Processing speed has also significantly increased. This evolution, together with the existence of machines able to completely automate mail processing ‚Äì opening envelopes, removing staples, scanning, sorting ‚Äì play a significant role in the development of large volume paper processing such as mail processing. The next step for companies is to rationalize their mail processing to be as consistent as possible with their organizational structure, e.g. choosing between the implementation of a centralized digital mailroom and the implementation of decentralized mail scanning facilities or a combination of the two. Adoption According to a survey conducted by AIIM in 2009, centralized in-house scanning and mailroom scanning are set for considerable growth in take-up compared to outsourced scanning and capture. 48% of the survey respondents have a centralized, in-house scanning service, citing better indexing and closer integration with the process as the main benefits.

The 2nd Division was formed in January 1921 out of the Reichswehr-Brigaden 2 and 9, both part of the former √úbergangsheer (Transition Army). It consisted of 3 infantry regiments, the 4th, 5th, and 6th. It also consisted of the 2nd artillery regiment, an engineering battalion, a signals battalion, a transportation battalion and a medical battalion.

The episode premiered on September 17, 2009. In the episode, suave yet rude and belligerent spy Sterling Archer, prompted by questions regarding his expense account, breaks into the mainframe computer of his organization ISIS and inadvertently discovers a mole in the organization. The episode was written by Archer creator and co-executive producer, Adam Reed, and directed by Mack Williams. It was produced at Floyd County Productions and animated at Radical Axis Studio in Atlanta, over the course of approximately one month. The FX Network officially greenlit the series in August 2009 for six episodes‚Äîalong with an additional four scripts‚Äîand planned on airing it alongside the fifth season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. However, because of production time constraints, the network was forced to push the official series run to January 2010 and changed Philadelphia's paired series to The League, but aired the special sneak preview of this episode following the season premiere of Philadelphia on September 17, 2009, without promoting it or listing it on channel listings. \\"Mole Hunt\\" attracted 1.4 million viewers, with 950,000 between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received generally favorable reviews from television critics, who noted that despite its raunchiness, it contained sharp dialogue and quick wit. H. Jon Benjamin received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Archer in the episode. Plot Sterling Archer, a suave agent from the spy organization ISIS, partakes in a torture training exercise, but causes it to be terminated after complaining about fellow agent Krenshaw's fake-torture tactics. The following day, while trying to get members of the organization to smell his dry cleaning due to its strangely curry-like odor, he is called into the office of Malory, his mother and boss, where he is chastised for misusing his ISIS-run expense account. He seeks assistance from Cyril Figgis, a member of the organization and his ex-girlfriend Lana Kane‚Äôs current boyfriend, to clear his account, but he refuses. Attempts to get access to accounts with a made-up \\"Mole Hunt\\" also meet with failure, because only section heads (Krenshaw, Cyril Figgis in accounting and Pamela Poovey in human resources) have access to the mainframe, and none of them wants to help him. Archer tries getting secretary Cheryl to leave the mainframe open that night, allowing Archer to easily slip in and clear his account, but she too denies his request. Without any outside options, Archer is forced to manually break into ISIS's mainframe. Though he initially thinks that this will be an extremely difficult task, he discovers that actual security is appallingly terrible and he easily figures out the password to hack his account after the first try. While trying to transfer all of his excess expenses from his account to Krenshaw, the agent enters the room and holds a gun up to Archer's head. He reveals that he is actually a Russian spy named Kremenski and fears the agency has started to realize that he is a mole, so he plans on stealing $50,000 from Archer's account and fleeing from the country. Just then, however, Lana arrives and pulls a gun on Kremenski. She and Archer begin to argue and the mole is able to escape. They pursue him outside, where Cyril and Malory have already arrived. Kremenski grabs Malory and threatens to kill her if they do not let him leave; Archer tries to turn the tables on him by grabbing Lana and threatening to do the same, but Kremenski does not care about her well being. When Lana proclaims that Archer is getting an erection (caused by picturing Malory being dead), Kremenski lets go of Malory in disgust, allowing Archer room to shoot him several times in his chest and once in the head, killing him. Despite his previous actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril comes to the assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time. Malory notes that she would have known if there was a mole at ISIS, her earlier phone call interrupted by Archer, was shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB. She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants. Production Radical Axis over the course of approximately one month. \\"Mole Hunt\\" was written by Archer creator and executive producer Adam Reed, while the series' animation director Mack Williams directed it. Reed had been known for his creation of several Adult Swim animated television programs that he worked on with Archer co-executive producer Matt Thompson, such as Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo. In 2008, while walking along the Via de la Plata in Spain, Reed conceived the concept of Archer. Being a longtime \\"rabid fan\\" of FX Network and its original programming, he pitched the concept to the network and they accepted it, ordering six episodes of the series to be produced, along with an additional four scripts. The pilot episode was produced at Reed's Floyd County Productions studio in Atlanta, Georgia, over the course of approximately one month. Animation took place at Radical Axis Studio, also located in Atlanta. The artistic style of the series was designed to be as realistic as possible, so the character designers used as much reference material as they could. In order to create consistency between the separate animators, the artists take photographs of each actor and utilize Adobe Illustrator to trace over them as a base for each actor's character. As Chad Hurd, the lead character designer for the series, noted, the end result resembles \\"a 1960‚Äôs comic book come to life.\\" FX originally planned on pairing the premiere of Archer with the fifth season of the network's situation comedy It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on Thursday nights in the fall. However, the network learned of the long, month-long production length it would take to create the needed six episodes and realized that there was not enough time to have all of the episodes ready before Philadelphia began its new season. FX then decided to reschedule the series and start airing it in January 2010, and replaced Archer with The League as Philadelphia's companion show. Despite this, FX also decided to air a sneak airing of \\"Mole Hunt\\" following the season five premiere of Philadelphia on September 17, 2009. The network did not promote the sneak peek, nor did they feature it on any program listings, and merely informed select television critics. Reception In its official broadcast on FX on January 14, 2010, \\"Mole Hunt\\", which aired as the second episode, attracted 1.4 million viewers, with 950,000 of them being within the key 18‚Äì49 demographics. This was a slight drop from the airing of the second episode \\"Training Day\\", which aired the same day and attracted 1.2 million viewers in between the ages of 18 and 49, and 1.8 million viewers in total. In 2010, H. Jon Benjamin received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Archer in the episode; he lost, however, to Anne Hathaway for her performance in The Simpsons. \\"Mole Hunt\\" received generally favorable reviews from television critics and media outlets. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that it \\"has a little 'Arrested Development' and a little of 'The Office' and maybe some 'Mad Men,'\\" and recommended it to readers as one of the \\"new and good on TV this fall.\\" Hinkely also commented favorably on the scene where Archer tries firing bullets at the door to the mainframe, only to a bullet ricochet and hit another agent, likening it to \\"Leslie Nielsen classics.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide said that he \\"got many more sustained belly laughs\\" out of the episode than he did with the aforementioned Philadelphia premiere. Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry opined that with \\"Mole Hunt,\\" Archer \\"gives FX something that the drama-heavy channel hasn't enjoyed for awhile ‚Äî namely, a sharp comedic arrow in its quiver.\\" Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad applauded the character development in the \\"Mole Hunt,\\" as it \\"was fairly impressive.\\" Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying \\"The back and forth between Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were laugh out loud funny,\\" and noted that he wished he could incorporate the phrase \\"baby town frolics\\" from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was \\"a bit of a stretch,\\" and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was \\"out of nowhere\\" and \\"a bit confusing.\\" Whitney Matheson wrote for USA Today that \\"Mole Hunt\\" was \\"crude and offbeat\\" but \\"also very funny and a welcome addition to [her] DVR queue.\\" Maureen Ryan, writing for the Chicago Tribune, applauded both the voice cast and the \\"deadpan wit and surreal goofiness.\\" Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald, awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" calling it a \\"spy spoof [that] hits a bull‚Äôs-eye with risque snark and one of the best vocal casts assembled for any animated series.\\" In an article for the San Francisco Chronicle, Tim Goodman called \\"Mole Hunt\\" a \\"brilliant pilot.\\" Rob Owen in his review for the series in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that though it was crude, the episode is \\"far more clever than last fall's disappointing 'Testees,'\\" and that it \\"wins points with its observational humor about modern life and in its mocking of mundane workplace minutiae.\\" Aaron Barnhart wrote in his article for McClatchy News Service that it was \\"very funny.\\" Other reviewers, however, have commented negatively towards \\"Mole Hunt.\\" Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter did not enjoy the episode, saying it \\"looks great but could be much funnier\\" and \\"rife with words that would be bleeped on broadcast channels and even most other basic-cable outlets.\\" Rick Bentley of McClatchy Newspapers wrote, \\"Most of the comedy is milked from the personal relationships in the office, which start off tedious and only grow more annoying. The adult material ‚Äì from nudity to words you haven't heard on basic cable ‚Äì comes across as merely an attempt to be shocking. It's hard to be shocked when you are bored.\\" On the season one DVD boxset, there is a bonus where this episode played out as normal with the character of Sterling Archer being replaced by a velociraptor replacing Archer's dialogue with appropriate dinosaur noises.

Early years He was born September 1857 to Henry Spencer, a blacksmith, in Columbus, Muscogee County, Georgia. He was raised by his father along with his sisters: Mary, Dora, Hattie, Ella, Leila and Lidia; and a brother, Samuel.ancestry.com Spencer attended the Asbury Chapel, a Columbus public school designated for African-American children. After graduating, he applied for and received a certificate for teaching in 1875, marking the beginning of a 50 year career in education. Spencer began teaching in the Harris County schools. He soon found a position in the Columbus Public Schools.Harris, Roger, and Historic Columbus Foundation. Our Town: An Introduction to the History of Columbus, Georgia. [Columbus, Ga.]: with the sponsorship of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, 1992, p. 55. Spencer taught at 5th Avenue School in Columbus under Mr. Peters. Family life Spencer married Martha Love in 1879. They had five children: Ethel, Annie, Alma, Pearl and William Henry Jr. The Spencers lived on 4th Avenue in Columbus. Today, the Spencer House is on the National Register of Historic Places. Career After the American Civil War ended, schools to educate the Freedman appeared throughout the south. In Columbus, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands established Claflin School in 1868.http://mcsdhistory.blogspot.com/ By 1872, schools for African-American citizens became a part of the city school system. Columbus Public Schools had 1,174 African-American students attending. Julia Hampton was one of the first African-American teachers in the system. The first school was in rented quarters, Temperance Hall. In the 1870s, much was done to continue the establishment of schools for blacks. A. J. Ketchum became one of the first black principals in the school system. George Foster Peabody gave the Columbus black schools $600. At that time there were 5 black teachers and 13 white teachers. In June 1875, the school board bought the African Methodist Church on Mercer Street for $800 with of land. This was converted for school purposes and a two-story frame building with four rooms was built on the site. In October 1888, the street and the school name was changed to 6th Street. By 1880 the school board acquired Claflin School. Spencer was placed in charge of Claflin School in spite of his not receiving a college degree. He was promoted on his ability and passion for the education of African-Americans in Columbus. Miss Anna Love and Miss Lucy Love, both graduates of the Columbus Public Schools, were elected teachers at Claflin. A report on school enrollment shows total black enrollment was 517, surpassing white enrollment at 462. In 1882, black schools were overcrowded with enrollment of 827, 599 attending. In May, 160 Black citizens petitioned the Board asking that the grades of their school be raised a year to a total of 9 years. This was not granted since the schools were already overcrowded. It was suggested that an additional story be added to 6th Street school. The Black citizens of Columbus continued to press the Board for a high school but there was no suitable building to do so. Spencer continued on as principal of Claflin. In addition to Claflin, there were three other schools for blacks: Sixth Avenue, Fourth Street and 28th Street schools. As the African-American population grew in Columbus, more schools for blacks were created and Spencer was named Supervisor of Colored Schools while retaining his position as principal at 6th Avenue School. He improved himself academically and eventually was able to enroll at Clark College in Atlanta. He was given broad powers in his new role on almost everything affecting the education of African-Americans - from the improvements of the physical facilities, to the hiring and firing of teachers. He was adamant in promoting efforts to improve the curriculum of the black schools in Columbus. Spencer's main educational goal was to persuade the Columbus Public Schools to provide an accredited high school for African-Americans. Up until this time, the schools for blacks in Columbus only went to the ninth grade. Parents had to send their children to schools outside of Columbus, usually to Atlanta, if they wanted to go beyond the ninth grade. Eventually, the Board did add one more grade, but Spencer was adamant that a fully accredited high school for African-Americans be created in the City of Columbus. A conditional promise was elicited from the Board contingent on the availability of funds.Columbus Times Spencer did not live to see his dream become a reality. He was stricken with appendicitis and died on May 30, 1925. The Board, however, did live up to its promise and erected a fully accredited high school for African-Americans on Tenth Avenue in 1930. The school was named William Henry Spencer High School his honor.

Biography = Initial career  The family of Eutolmii originated in Syria; Tatian was born in Sidyma, son of Antonius Tatianus, praeses (governor) of Caria from c. 360 to 364. He had a son, Proculus, who followed his footsteps into a political career. Tatianus began his career during the governorship of his father. Around 357 he was a lawyer, then he was assessor (legal counsel) of a governor, a vicarius, a proconsul and twice prefect. In the 360s he was praeses Thebaidos (governor of the Thebaid); between 367 and 370 he was praefectus augustalis in Egypt; from 370 to 374 he administered the Diocese of the East as comes Orientis and from 374-380 he held the office of comes sacrarum largitionum in the imperial financial administration. After working for a year under Theodosius I, Tatianus left his place to retire for the next eight years in Lycia; it is not clear whether it was due to the pressure of imperial favourites, brought by the new Emperor from the West.  Praetorian prefect of the East  On 16 June 388, shortly before his departure for the campaign against the usurper Magnus Maximus, Theodosius I appointed Tatianus Praetorian prefect of the East, succeeding Maternus Cynegius, a Spaniard like Theodosius, who had died recently; after having sent the insignia of power to Tatianus in Lycia, the Emperor appointed Proculus praefectus urbi of Constantinople. Some laws of this period have been preserved, which Tatianus would abide in the absence of Theodosius (the Emperor returned to the East only in the autumn of 391) to pursue his own policy, somewhat anti-clerical;Codex Theodosianus, xvi.2.27. nonetheless, it is not possible to speak of a change of policy in favour of the Pagans. It should however be considered that in 391 Tatianus was consul together with Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, another member of the Pagan aristocracy.  Fall  Tatian's fall was caused by his conflict with the powerful general and politician Rufinus. Rufinus, consul in 392, feared the power of Tatianus and his son Proculus, as the two of them held both the Praetorian prefecture of the East and the urban prefecture: such concentration of power in the hands of father and son caused the envy of powerful men. Rufinus took advantage of some mistakes of Tatianus in the administration of finances, to depose and arrest him and to succeed him as prefect (September 392). Tatianus was later sent into exile, probably in Lycia,Rufinus issued some laws that barred the Lycians form public offices; these laws were repelled only after his death in 395. and he was hit by damnatio memoriae;For an example of damnatio memoriae in action, see the inscription put on the basis of a statue, erected by Tatianus in honour of Honorius at Aphrodisias ; later, however, in some inscriptions the name of Tatianus was re-carved, and his homonymous nephew, Governor of Caria, erected a statue in his honour in Aphrodisias . the fall of Tatian also involved his son Proculus, who was sent to death. The last years of the reign of Theodosius were characterized by a growing intolerance against Paganism; perhaps the fall of Tatian is to be interpreted in this context.

The brand mark of Gronbach is a stylized eagle (similar to Germany's national eagle), which is stamped with her name on many of her pieces. logo of Eva Gronbach The designer first gained international recognition in 2000 with her collection \\"D√©claration d‚Äôamour √† l‚ÄôAllemagne\\". The motif of the stylized eagle, the use of the Germany's national colors black, red and gold and of the letter \\"D\\" caused a sensation and evoked heated debates. Exhibitions and Fashion Shows Gronbach's work is presented internationally. Her fashion is shown at museums, fashion weeks, exhibitions, and public institutions. The designer has also worked as a curator for various institutions. In 2003, she worked as guest curator for the exhibition \\"In. Femme Fashion ‚Äì 1780-2004\\" at the Museum of Applied Arts Cologne (MAKK). The subject was the modeling of femininity over time. Afterwards the museum decided to buy some pieces of Gronbach's collection. In 2004, Gronbach presented her work at the Goethe-Institut in Berlin. A year later, she curated the exhibition \\"The Fashion Generation\\" for the Stadtmuseum D√ºsseldorf. For this exhibition Gronbach travelled to the world's most renowned art schools in over thirty countries and chose from fifty schools the most interesting ideas. The designer visited schools in Tokyo, New York, Paris, and London, but also schools in upcoming fashion cities like Ulan Bator in Mongolia, Tashkent in Uzbekistan, Cape Town, Dakar, Kingston in Jamaika, Caracas, Reykjavik, Shanghai, Auckland etc. From 2008-2010, Gronbach had opened a fashion store in Cologne's hip Belgian quarter. In 2009, young Belgian designers were invited to present their work at this store for a few weeks. The goal of this event, organized together with the Belgian House in Cologne, was to deepen the relationship between Brussels and Cologne. Single pieces of Gronbach's collection were bought by the Haus der Geschichte (\\"House of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany\\"). They are presented at the museum in Bonn. The Museum of Industry (LWL) in Dortmund bought some pieces of Gronbach's \\"german jeans\\" collection. In 2011, the Jewish Museum Berlin invited the artist to show her work from the past ten years at the exhibition \\"how german is it?\\". In 2012, Gronbach participated in the MANIFESTA 09 European Art Biennale. In September 2015, Gronbach presents her work of the past 15 years at the show \\"Relight - Best of Eva Gronbach\\" in the context of the Futur25 Festival. The Futur25 Festival is organized by the Federal Agency for Civic Education and the Federal Ministry of the Interior in celebration of the 25th jubilee of the German unity. It takes place at Radialysystem V in Berlin. Fashion Classes at Schools and Universities Gronbach works with children and young adults. She initiates and teaches fashion design classes at schools in Germany. She also gives presentations at conferences, e.g. at the Berlin Academy of Arts and at \\"Kinder zum Olymp!\\" and participates in TV shows. Since May 2008, Gronbach is a guest lecturer at the K√∂ln International School of Design (KISD). Focusing on transformation processes in fashion design she discusses the meaning of fashion with her students. In 2009, she led the designer workshops for students in the Ruhr area, sponsored by the region North Rhine-Westphalia. The developed designs were presented at RUHR.2010. Since 2014, Gronbach works as a lecturer at the international fashion school (ESMOD) in Berlin.  Awards  In 2004, Gronbach received the \\"T-com inspire!\\" award for her collection \\"D√©claration d'amour √† l'Allemagne\\".

Clyde Wyncham is notable in that he ties all of Mark Millar's recent runs together. Origin Clyde Wyncham was the first and only mutant of Earth 1218, which is the Marvel Multiverse designation for the \\"real world\\" we inhabit. Clyde was so powerful he could control humans and bring the dead back to life. Despite his power, he was too young to control it. One night in 1964, he unwittingly coerced a crowd of people to surround his home, including his dead father whom he had unintentionally resurrected. Clyde's mother was so horrified that she struck him with a candlestick to get him to stop, resulting in permanent brain damage. His mother left him to live in an asylum from that point on. Marvel 1985 Clyde has been in an institution ever since his mother's attack. The nurses left his comic book collection behind, which angered the vegetative Clyde. For payback, he summoned Marvel supervillains to his world, causing great death and destruction. Jerry Goodman steals a comic collection back from a comic shop, where the villains had sold it, in an effort to appease Clyde. Before Clyde can stop the villains, the Red Skull kills Jerry with a machine gun. Clyde is shocked and sends the Marvel villains home, shouting \\"EVERYBODY GO HOME NOW!\\" Jerry's ex-wife asks Clyde to bring Jerry back to life, but Clyde says he had promised his mother he \\"wouldn't do that trick no more.\\" In the aftermath of the event, Captain America offered to take Clyde back to the Marvel Universe, where scientists were more used to dealing with people like Clyde. Fantastic Four Though technically brain-dead, Reed Richards had Clyde placed in a holding cell in the Area 87 and created a cybernetic helmet designed to keep Clyde in a permanent state of pleasant dreams. However, during The Marquis of Death's attack The Thing released Clyde and pitted him against his corrupted future self. Clyde was defeated by The Marquis of Death but not before The Marquis had been severely weakened to the point that he could no longer fight back against his adversaries. Clyde had been returned to a state of unconsciousness during the fight and is presumed to have been taken back to Area 87 where he dreams pleasant dreams once more. Powers and abilities Clyde is capable of reality manipulation on a massive scale. He is immortal and can open portals to other dimensions/realities, time travel, resurrect the dead, manipulate matter, shapeshift, teleport, generate massive amounts of energy, project telepathic illusions, and mind control high-level cosmic entities. He is also highly durable as it took planck temperature to defeat him after he was severely weakened from fighting. Alternate versions The Marquis of Death is a future incarnation of Clyde Wyncham from a parallel universe where he escaped his imprisonment from Area-87 and had his mind fully restored following an attack led by several incredibly powerful supervillains, all of whom he killed with but a thought. Old Man Logan Another future version of Clyde is the Doctor Doom of The Old Man Logan timeline.

In its time of common use, the instrument was referred to as a bass viol, despite the fact that it more closely resembles a large violoncello than a bass viola da gamba (also known as a bass viol). The size and form of these instruments varies; many are uniquely proportioned folk instruments. The earliest dated example of a church bass is from the maker Benjamin Crehore, made in Massachusetts in 1788. A particularly notable double bass luthier, Abraham Prescott, is known to have made 500 to 600 church basses, the earliest example dating from 1809. With the rising popularity of the reed organ in the 1840s, church basses fell into disuse.

This frigate served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars under the command of several notable officers. Alcmene was active in several theatres of the war, spending most of her time cruising in search of enemy vessels or privateers, and escorting convoys. She fought at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 and served in the blockade of the French coasts during the later Napoleonic Wars until she was wrecked on the French coast in 1809. Construction and commissioning Alcmene was ordered from the yards of Joseph Graham, of Harwich on 14 February 1793, shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. She was laid down there in April that year and launched on 8 November 1794. The ship was completed at Chatham Dockyard by 12 April 1795 and had commissioned under her first commander, Captain William Brown, in January that year. Joining the Alcmene on 26 March was surgeon William Beatty, who later served aboard at the Battle of Trafalgar, and attended the dying Lord Nelson. Beatty would spend most of the next five years aboard Alcmene, his longest period on a single ship. Career Alcmene went out as a convoy escort to the West Indies in November 1795, returning in January the following year and serving on the Lisbon station from August. Alcmenes main tasks involved escorting convoys to and from Oporto and Lisbon, some numbering upwards of 200 merchants; and cruising off the coast in search of enemy warships and privateers. On 5 November 1796, Alcmene was in company with , and when they captured the Spanish ship Adriana. Alcmene took the 14-gun privateer Rochelleuse off Cape Finisterre on 6 March 1797, while the privateers Bonaparte and L√©g√®re were taken on 8 January and 22 August 1798 respectively. Alcmene had been refitting at Spithead when the naval mutiny broke out there. Her crew did not join the mutineers, though there were rumblings of mutiny later in the year aboard her, and several seaman were tried and punished. Captain George Johnstone Hope took command in August 1798 and Alcmene went out to the Mediterranean. She took part in the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, carrying supplies to the British fleet, and raided enemy shipping. On 22 August, Alcmene captured the , of two 6-pounder guns and some swivel guns, and 61 men, off Alexandria. Hope tried to board her before her captain could throw overboard any dispatches she was carrying for Napoleon Bonaparte, then in Egypt. Hope was unsuccessful, but two seamen from Alcmenes crew jumped overboard and were able to retrieve the dispatches before they sank. One of Alcemenes boats was able to rescue the intrepid seamen. The Royal Navy took the gunboat into service as HMS Legere.Winfield (2008), p. 328. In 1799, Alcmene helped Horatio Nelson to evacuate the Neapolitan Royal family from Naples ahead of the advancing French armies. She then returned to the Lisbon station. Alcmene captured the privateer on 26 June 1799. Courageaux had left Pasajes in company with Grand Decide and to intercept a convoy from Brazil. Courageaux, though pierced for 32 guns, only had twenty-eight 12 and 9-pounders, some of which she had thrown overboard while Alcmene chased her. Courageaux had a crew of 253 men under the command Jean Bernard. After a chase of almost three days, and a one-hour running fight, Courageaux struck at , which lies slightly west of the Azores. No casualties were reported for either side. On 1 August, Alcmene captured Deux Amis. Capture of Thetis and Santa Brigada On 15 October 1799, sighted two Spanish frigates. She gave chase and before dawn joined the pursuit. At 7:00 am, the two Spaniards parted company so Naiad followed Santa-Brigida, together with Alcmene and , which too had joined the chase, while directing Ethalion, to pursue the other frigate. By 11:30 am, Ethalion had caught up with her quarry and after a short engagement the Spanish vessel struck her colours. Triton, the fastest of the three British frigates, led the chase. The next morning she struck some rocks as she tried to prevent her quarry from reaching port. Triton got off the rocks and resumed the chase despite taking on water. She and Alcmene then exchanged fire with the Spanish frigate, which surrendered before Naiad could catch up. Four large Spanish ships came out from Vigo but then retreated when the three British frigates made ready to receive them. Alcmene had one man killed and nine wounded, and Triton had one man wounded; had two men killed and eight men wounded. The vessel that Ethalion captured turned out to be Thetis, under the command of Captain Don Juan de Mendoza. She was homeward- bound from Vera Cruz (Mexico) with a cargo of cocoa, cochineal, and sugar, and more importantly, specie worth 1,385,292 Spanish dollars (¬£312,000). The vessel that Triton, Alcmene and Naiad captured was Santa Brigada, under the command of Captain Don Antonio Pillon. She was carrying drugs, annatto, cochineal, indigo, sugar, and some 1,500,000 dollars. Prize money was paid on 14 January 1800. Alcmene then returned to Plymouth in November 1799. Hope's successor, in 1799, was Captain Henry Digby, and Alcmene joined the squadron blockading the French coast. Captain Samuel Sutton took command in January 1801, and she went at first to Lisbon and then to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker's expeditionary force in March 1801. She was present at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April that year, as part of Edward Riou's frigate squadron, and suffered five men killed and 19 wounded in the battle. In 1847, The Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\" to any remaining survivors of the battle. Sutton was killed by a sniper's bullet during the battle. Alcmene then came under the command of Captain Edmund Carlise who was promoted in action from lieutenant, appointed substantively wef 17 July and remaining captain of Alcmene in the Baltic and Newfoundland until 2 July 1802, according to a transcription of Admiralty Officers' Services, Captains, Vol 1 Folio 7 given to one of his descendants. (An earlier entry on this page suggested either Captain Charles Pater or Captain John Devonshire, noting however that Devonshire returned to Britain with dispatches on in June 1801). Alcmene went out as a convoy escort to Newfoundland, before returning to British waters and joining the Channel Fleet. Captain John Stiles took command in August 1802, and Alcmene spent between 1804 and 1805 on the Channel Islands station. Captain James Brisbane succeeded Stiles in November 1805 and sailed Alcmene to the Irish station. Here she took the privateer Courier on 4 January 1806. Courier was the former His Majesty's hired armed cutter . Courier was pierced for 14 guns but mounted only seven brass 42 and 24-pounder carronades. She had a crew of 70 men, was four days out of Morlaix, and had not captured any prizes. Alcmene came under her last commander, Captain William Tremlett, in January 1808. Tremlett commanded her in the English Channel. Fate Alcmene was wrecked at the mouth of the Loire on 29 April 1809. She was following the 44-gun frigate to reconnoiter the French forces when her pilot's ignorance resulted in her striking Blanche Rock, off Nantes. The ebbing tide made it impossible to get her off and at low tide she broke her back and bilged. Fortunately, Amelia was able to rescue both the entire crew of Alcmene and her stores. Her crew then set fire to Alcmene. She burnt to the waterline, leaving little of use to the French.Grocott (1997), p. 278.

The 7th Division was formed in January 1921 out of the Reichswehr-Brigaden 21, 23 and 24, all part of the former √úbergangsheer (Transition Army). It consisted of 3 infantry regiments, the 19th, 20th, and 21st (Bavarian). It also consisted of the 7th artillery regiment, an engineering battalion, a signals battalion, a transportation battalion and a medical battalion. The commander of the Wehrkreis VII was simultaneously the commander of the 7th Division. For the leadership of the troops, an Infanterief√ºhrer and an Artillerief√ºhrer were appointed, both subordinated to the commander of the Division.

Her work as a scholar practitioner has furthered both research and practice in the fields of appreciative leadership and positive organization development. She was awarded Vallarta Institute‚Äôs Annual 2X2 (Two by Two) Recreate the World Award. She is President of the Corporation for Positive Change (an international consulting group that she founded); a Fellow of the World Business Academy;, a Founder and Director Emeritus of the Taos Institute and a founding advisor to the United Religions Initiative. Whitney earned her PhD from Temple University. She currently teaches and advises students in the capacity of distinguished consulting faculty at Saybrook University and as faculty advisor for the Taos Tilburg PhD Program. Social innovations In 1991 Whitney along with Kenneth Gergen, Mary Gergen, Sheila McNamme, Harlene Anderson, David Cooperrider and Suresh Srivastva founded the Taos Institute as a community of scholars and practitioners dedicated to furthering relational practices in the fields of organization development, family therapy and education. There are now over 250 associates around the world. From 1995 until 2009 Whitney served as an advisor and facilitator in the design and development of the United Religions Initiative, a global inter-faith organization dedicated to peace. It was for this purpose that Whitney and David Cooperrider created the processes that Whitney entitled the Appreciative Inquiry Summit. Whitney worked with Case Western Reserve University Weatherhead School of Management faculty David Cooperrider and Ron Fry to assess the need for and design the first Master‚Äôs of positive organization development program. Research In her 1980 dissertation, funded by the National Institute of Education, Whitney studied and mapped the processes used for the dissemination of educational innovations. Her relational consultative model of the work of dissemination linking agents was implemented in educational R&D; laboratories across the country. Whitney‚Äôs most recent research, conducted in partnership with Kae Rader and AmandaTrosten-Bloom, focuses on leadership and positive power. Through a qualitative research process employing one-on-one interviews and focus groups, they discovered and subsequently confirmed five factors related to appreciative leadership: inquiry, inclusion, illumination, inspiration and integrity. The results are published in their book, Appreciative Leadership: Focus on What Works to Drive Winning Performance and Build a Thriving Organization. In partnership with Jeff Jackson and Maurice Monette of the Vallarta Institute and funded by a grant from the Reynolds Foundation, Whitney is currently engaged in research on the impact of appreciative inquiry in Cuba.

Packaging engineers work to meet the performance requirements of a box while controlling total costs throughout the system. In addition to the structural design discussed in this article, printed bar codes, labels, and graphic design are also vital. Functions Corrugated boxes are used frequently as shipping containers. Boxes need to contain the product from manufacturing through distribution to sale and sometimes end-use. Boxes provide some measure of product protection by themselves but often require inner components such as cushioning, bracing and blocking to help protect fragile contents. The shipping hazards depend largely upon the particular logistics system being employed. For example, boxes unitized into a unit load on a pallet do not encounter individual handling while boxes sorted and shipped through part of their distribution cycle as mixed loads or express carriers can receive severe shocks, kicks, and so forth. Ordinary shipping containers require printing and labels to identify the contents, provide legal and regulatory information, and bar codes for routing. Boxes that are used for marketing, merchandising and point-of-sale often have high graphics to help communicate the contents. Some boxes are designed for the display of contents on the shelf known as \\"Retail Ready Packaging\\". Others are designed to help dispense the contents. Popular for their strength, durability, lightness, recyclability, and cost-effectiveness, corrugated boxes are used for the shipping of a variety of items. Due to the quality and safety of packaging items in corrugated boxes, they are used widely in the food industry. The boxes handle the pressure that comes with stacking, making them ideal for easy transporting. Also, more elaborate and innovative box designs have emerged due to several reasons. Unboxing is one emerging trend that has challenged designers to create cool new ways of opening boxes and lively product displays within those boxes. Another trend is the use of corrugated board for product displays. With the rigidity of corrugated board combined with the ability to print beautiful designs, corrugated board can be designed as a Point of Purchase display or \\"POP\\" display to showcase products in a fully branded display rather than the standard retail shelf. More than 95% of all products in the United States are shipped in corrugated boxes. Corrugated paperboard accounts for more than half of all the paper recycled in the US. Stacking strength One of the important functions of a corrugated box is to provide crush resistance (product protection) and adequate strength for stacking in warehouses. A box can be designed by optimizing the grade of corrugated board, box design, flute direction, and inner supports. Support from the product also provides \\"load sharing\\" and can be an important factor. Box closures sometimes can have effects on box stacking strength. If long-term storage of corrugated boxes in high humidity is expected, extra strength and moisture resistance is called for. The method of loading boxes on pallets strongly affects stacking. Vertical columns provide the best box performance while interlocking patterns of boxes significantly reduce performance. The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important. Box compression testing is a means of evaluating boxes, stacks of boxes, and unit loads under controlled conditions. Field conditions of stacking and dynamic compression do not have the same degree of control. Compression strength can be estimated based on container construction, size, and use parameters: actual package testing is often conducted to verify these estimates. Many packaging engineers find it beneficial to periodically audit warehouses and visit customer's package receiving operations. When field performance is observed or documented to have problems, a new cycle of design and testing may be justified. for a corrugated box to withstand the deformation while stacking or storage (stack load = 1/3 compression strength). where stack load=gross weight of box *stack height.  Estimating compression  Fiber Box Association has a method for estimating compression strength which includes the following factors: * Time * Moisture * Palletizing type * Pallet patterns * Pallet type * Handling Process Laboratory drop test to determine ability to withstand rough handling Packaging engineers design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped, the hazards of the shipping environment, (shock, vibration, compression, moisture, etc.), and the needs of retailers and consumers Engineers and designers start with the needs of the particular project: cost constraints, machinery capabilities, product characteristics, logistics needs, applicable regulations, consumer needs, etc. Often designs are made with Computer Aided Design programs connected to automated sample making tables. Several design and construction options might be considered. Samples are often submitted to performance testing based on ASTM or other standard test protocols such as the International Safe Transit Association. Structural design is matched with graphic design. For consumer based designs, marketing personnel sometimes use Focus groups or more quantitative means of assessing acceptance. Test markets are employed for major programs. The process starts by making corrugated board on a corrugating line, a long series of linked machines which may be in size of a football field. A finished piece of singlewall corrugated board is a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liners. Skilled workers prepare job tickets for each stack of box blanks and route the blanks to fabrication machines. Printing dies and patterns are prepared on large, flexible, rubber or tin sheets. They are loaded onto rollers and the box blanks are fed through it, where each is trimmed, printed, cut, scored, folded, and glued to form a box. Finished boxes are then stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped and shipped. Design The most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container (RSC). All flaps are the same length from score to edge. Typically the major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not, unless the width is equal to the length. Box styles in Europe are typically specified by a 4-digit code provided by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO): A regular slotted container is coded 0201. Regular Slotted Container Box blank for a regular slotted container showing score lines, slots, and manufacturer's joint The manufacturer's joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched. The box is shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager who sets up the box, fills it, and closes it for shipment. Box closure may be by tape, adhesive, staples, strapping, etc. Many other styles of corrugated boxes and structures are available: * FOL (Full Overlap): A Full Overlap Box is similar to an RSC except the major flaps fully overlap. Full-overlap flaps provide extra stacking strength and edge protection. * HSC (Half Slotted Container): Half-Slotted Containers (HSC) are similar to an RSC, but with only one set of flaps. They are useful when an open-top container is desired. HSCs can be used to create a telescope box. * A Full Telescope Box has two fully telescoping sections. The sections may be formed by staples, die-cut locks, adhesive, etc. * A Partial Telescope Box has two sections. The top telescopes partially over the bottom. Commonly used for holding printing paper. * A corrugated tray is often used for display purposes or used with a shrink wrap * Corrugated corner pads can be used for product support and cushioning * Special die-cut shapes have almost endless designs and uses. * etc. The size of a box can be measured for either internal (for product fit) or external (for handling machinery or palletizing) dimensions. Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions. File:BJs Wholesale Club VA.jpgWholesale outlet using full pallet loads.

The goal is to put the case directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages. Retailers often require products to come in shelf-ready packaging to reduce stocking costs and save labor expenses. Several specialized box designs are available. Individual mixed shipments Box construction needs to be matched to its logistics system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform pallet loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with express carriers. Many items are shipped individually (in part or entirely) by express carrier, mail, or other mixed logistics systems. The demands of multiple manual handlings, automated sortation, and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes, box closures, and the contents. Boxes designed for unit load handling and storage may not be suited to mixed logistics systems. Less than truckload shipping puts more stress on corrugated shipping containers than shipment by uniform pallet loads in trucks or intermodal containers. Boxes sometimes need to be heavier construction to match the needs of the distribution system. Government, military, and export Many items being supplied to governments are handled very well: boxes are unitized, shipped on covered trucks or intermodal containers, and storage is in warehouses. Normal \\"domestic boxes\\" and commercial packaging are acceptable.ASTM Standard D3951 - Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging Military materiel, field supplies, and humanitarian aid often encounter severe handling and uncontrolled storage. Special box specifications for government shipments are often applicable. Weather-resistant fiberboards, box construction, box closure, and unitizing are needed.

Normal \\"domestic boxes\\" are commonly used. Break bulk cargo needs to be water- resistant and heavy-duty. Even shipments initially sent via intermodal freight transport may have subsequent logistics operations that are extreme and uncontrolled. The specific conditions in the destination port and the country of use need to be considered for the design of export boxes. Dangerous and hazardous goods Doublewall box with dividers for shipping four bottles of corrosive liquid Shipment of dangerous goods or hazardous materials are highly regulated. Based on the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods model regulations, each country has coordinated design and performance requirements for shipment. For example, in the US, the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction and published requirements in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Corrugated boxes are described in 4G requirements. Performance (severe drop test, etc.) needs to be certified for the box and contents. Some carriers have additional requirements. Box closure The means of closing a box is an important aspect of design. It affects the types of equipment available to production lines, the measured laboratory performance, the field performance, and the ability of end-users to easily and safely open the box. Box closures include: * Adhesive, water-based or hot-melt adhesive-Adhesives are applied manually or by machine. Starch- based adhesives are the choice of a corrugator as it is economic. Starch works as a medium for molds, lichens, and fungus, so to prevent it, antifungals are added in it before use. * Staples - staples are used to attach the box flaps. Small (nominally ¬Ω inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler. Wider crown (nominally 1¬º inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher * Box sealing tape, pressure-sensitive-taps are available in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72 mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backing. Taping is done either manually or by semi-automatic Case sealer. * Filament tape, reinforced pressure-sensitive tape used to close boxes. * Gummed paper tape - consists of a heavy paper in which adhesive is activated by water for bonding to the box. * Reinforced water activated gummed tape. Two plies of paper with reinforcing filaments embedded between * Strapping- straps are generally used for unitizing, made up of plastic (PP, PE, PET, PVC), metal (SS steel) etc. and available various width. * Shrink wrap- it is a thin film of LLDPE, LDPE, etc. which shrinks with the application of heat resulting in wrapping a box from all sides.it is costlier amongst all as it needs hot tunnel and material consumption will be more. However, the packed box will be protected from the environment as it will work as a barrier.

The overall hull shape of the barge is a marriage of the French and Dutch barge building influences. She was converted to a hotel barge in 1996. L'Impressionniste is owned and operated by European Waterways and sails on the Canal de Bourgogne in France. History The vessel is slab-sided and has a flat lower part of the hull which means she was fairly cheap to build originally and space was maximized as the hull is effectively a box section. During the 1960s she carried grain and timber, making regular trips between Paris and Brussels. She had a particularly long commercial hold for a vessel of 38.50m overall length, and this eventually was one of the reasons her hull was well suited to be converted into a hotel barge. Her conversion took place in 1996 and was mainly done by Verrian Gray and Geoffrey Foot, two English engineers. Her design and layout were based on La Belle Epoque, which was built the year before, and the original owners purchased the plans from European Waterways. She was originally powered by an 8-cylinder Deutz diesel engine which produced . This gave the barge a top speed of 16 km/h. She has a single rudder and chain-link steering which, coupled with her relatively fine bow, ensure practical maneuverability. She was re-engined in 2000 with a Scania and spent several of the following years on the river Rh√¥ne, which has a strong current and needs plenty of horsepower. L'Impressionniste currently has 6 double cabins, allowing her to carry up to 12 passengers. She also has separate crew quarters which house the 5 crew. Deck Plan The crew consists of a captain and pilot, deck hand and tour guide, master chef and two housekeepers and waiters. She regularly cruises on the Burgundy Canal.

Morgan was the son of David Thomas Morgan of Whipps Cross, Walthamstow, Essex, and his wife Mary n√©e Ridge. Born at the White House, High Road, Leytonstone, he was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow from 1853-1860 and at Vevey in Switzerland. Morgan was a member of The Football Association at their fifth meeting on 1 December 1863, representing Forest School.Adrian Harvey: Football: The First Hundred Years, 2005 He entered business in the City of London, where he was a Russia merchant and member of the firm of Morgan, Gellibrand and Company. He was also a director of the Surrey Commercial Docks Company and of the Northampton Brewery Company. In 1867 he married Emily Bigland of Etloe House, Leyton. Morgan entered politics when he was elected to the first Essex County Council formed in 1889, being returned as Conservative councillor for Leytonstone in a hard- fought contest. He later became councillor for Brentwood, having made his home at Bentley Mill near the town. In 1900 he was selected as the Conservative and Unionist candidate to contest the South Western or Walthamstow Division of Essex. The seat was held by Sam Woods, elected as a Liberal-Labour member of parliament at a by-election in 1897. The election was held at the height of the Second Boer War, and Morgan benefitted from the fact that he supported the government's policy, while Woods had abstained on a vote in the Commons supporting the war. Morgan won the seat by a large majority, and the gain of the seat was seen as one of the most significant government successes in the \\"khaki election\\". Morgan only served one term in parliament, and did not contest the next general election in 1906 on medical advice. Morgan was Master of the Worshipful Company of Bowyers of the City of London from 1902 to 1904.

Two Leadership Square is and 16 stories. They are the 10th and 19th tallest buildings in Oklahoma City, respectively. History The Pei Plan is a master redevelopment plan prepared for Oklahoma City in the 1960s. The plan called for the demolition of existing structures and construction of new commercial buildings in much of the downtown area, including that now occupied by Leadership Square.Pei Plan Central Business District map Plans for the site originally included an office tower of at least 60 stories. The collapse of Penn Square Bank in 1982 and softening oil market created tenancy concerns and the design was reduced. Daon Development Corporation was originally involved as the developer, but perceived antagonism toward non-U.S. entities and Daon's indebtedness resulted in a change to Leadership Properties Inc., the real estate subsidiary of Oklahoma Land and Exploration Company. The building, when constructed in 1984, was owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and managed by CB Richard Ellis. The total cost of $94 million was the most paid for a building in Oklahoma City to that date. The Leadership Square building replaced, in part, the seven story Local Federal Savings and Loan tower, built in 1958. The oil price collapse in the mid 1980s adversely impacted occupancy and value immediately after its opening. In April 2000, MetLife sold Leadership Square to LSQ Investors, an affiliate of Dorchester Capital. This transaction placed the building in local ownership. The $45 million price equated to $57.52 per square foot, lower than expected. As of the sale in 2000, the building was 78 percent leased, with a lease rate of $13.50 per square foot per year. Price Edwards & Company assumed management responsibilities. In 2000, major tenants included Bank of America, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, Smith Barney, and Grant Thornton, as well as local law firms McAfee & Taft, Phillips McFall McVay, and Gable & Gotwals.

Sacred Salmon Ceremony A ceremony to welcome, bless, and thank the returning salmon each year was held by the Takelma tribe, as well as many other Indian tribes in the northwest United States and Canada, . However, for 140 years, due to the loss of traditional ways, the ceremony was not performed publicly by the Takelma tribe. To revive the ceremony, Pilgrim and her late husband Grant Pilgrim (Yurok tribe), visited with area tribes that continued to perform this ceremony. Following numerous visits to ceremonial and spiritual gatherings of northwest tribes, the Pilgrims brought back their version of the ceremony to Southern Oregon.Baker-Pilgrim, A, Salmon Ceremony '94‚Äì'06 Due to Pilgrim's contribution in returning the Salmon Ceremony to Jackson County, she is known to some locals as the 'Keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony'.Doty, T, Ceremonies A great deal of interest has since been shown by the National Geographic magazine and the World Wildlife Fund and Martha Stewart due to the unprecedented increase in salmon seen in the river since the ceremony has been performed.Supriano, S, (6 April 2009) The ceremony is annually held on the bank of the Applegate River in Southwest Oregon Konanway Nika Tillicum (All My Relations) Youth Academy While studying psychology and Native American studies at Southern Oregon University at the age of 50, Pilgrim co-founded the Konanway Nika Tillicum (All My Relations) Native American Summer Youth Academy.

He had previously served as Bishop of Namur from 1991 until 2010 under the name Andr√©-Mutien L√©onard. Pope Francis accepted his resignation on 1 June 2015.  Early life  L√©onard was born Andr√© L√©onard on 6 May 1940 in Jambes, Namur. His father died shortly after his birth during the first days of the German invasion of Belgium. He is one of four brothers who all became diocesan priests. After his studies at the Coll√®ge Notre-Dame de la Paix in Namur, he was sent by Andr√©-Marie Charue, the Bishop of Namur, to Pope Leo XIII Seminary in Leuven, where he earned a master's degree in Philosophy.  Academic career  L√©onard continued his studies in Rome at the Belgian Pontifical College, where he graduated with a degree in theology. He was ordained a priest on 19 July 1964 by Charue. He stayed in Rome, and earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1974 L√©onard obtained a doctorate in philosophy from the Catholic University of Louvain, with a thesis entitled \\"A literal commentary on the logic of Hegel\\". He taught in the philosophy department of Louvain until 1991. In the late 1980s he became a member of the International Theological Commission, the consultative organ of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Episcopal career  L√©onard was appointed Bishop of Namur by Pope John Paul II on 7 February 1991, for which he was consecrated on 14 April of that year by Cardinal Godfried Danneels. He has been described as a man whose theological vision is in line with Pope Benedict XVI's. As Bishop of Namur, L√©onard focused in particular upon youth ministry and the promotion of vocations to the priesthood. His seminary complex, which also includes Redemptoris Mater Seminary run by the Neocatechumenate movement, is said to have the largest enrollment in Belgium (where in 2010, 35 of the 71 Belgian seminarians study). Italian Vatican writer Andrea Tornielli reports that L√©onard is considered \\"the most traditional of the Belgian bishops\\".National Catholic Reporter: \\"End of Danneels era in Belgium completes European facelift\\" 15 January 2010 When first named a bishop, L√©onard added the name \\"Mutien\\" to his first name Andr√© in honor of Mutien-Marie Wiaux, a Belgian Brother of the Christian Schools who is honored as a saint. L√©onard preached the 1999 Lenten retreat for Pope John Paul II and the Roman Curia.  Primate of Belgium  Andr√©-Joseph L√©onard visiting the parish of Terbank Heverlee in February 2012 On 18 January 2010, L√©onard was appointed Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels by Pope Benedict XVI,Press Office of the Holy See replacing the retiring Cardinal Danneels. Leonard's appointment was seen by Robert Wielaard of the Associated Press as a move by Pope Benedict to energize the country's Roman Catholic faithful and to reverse 30 years of liberalism. The appointment was in line with the pope's policy of putting tradition-minded and conservative bishops in important dioceses.USA Today: \\"Conservative Belgian archbishop in eye of storm\\" 11 November 2010 When named Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels, L√©onard chose to drop \\"Mutien\\" and instead appended \\"Joseph\\" to his name, in reference to Saint Joseph, patron saint of Belgium. On 5 January 2011, L√©onard was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO PER LA PROMOZIONE DELLA NUOVA EVANGELIZZAZIONE = Initial reception = In response to L√©onard's appointment, Deputy Prime Minister Laurette Onkelinx, who is also the country's health minister, said, \\"Church and State are separate in Belgium, but when there are problems in our society, all the social partners sit down around a table, including representatives of secularism and of religion. Cardinal Danneels was a man of openness, of tolerance and was able to fit in there. L√©onard has already regularly challenged decisions made by our parliament.\\" She added: \\"Concerning AIDS, he's against the use of condoms even while people are dying from it every day. He is against abortion and euthanasia ... The pope's choice could undermine the compromise that allows us to live together with respect for everyone.\\" The Socialist Party said it \\"insists that Archbishop L√©onard respects democratic decisions taken by the institutions of our country. For the Socialist Party, the rights and duties that people take on democratically take precedence over religious traditions and commandments, without any exception.\\".Reuters: \\"New Catholic archbishop of Brussels raises hackles in Belgium\\" 18 January 2010 = Sex abuse crisis = In April 2010, the then-Bishop of Bruges, Roger Vangheluwe, retired and admitted that for years he had abused a nephew. In June 2010, police raided both the palace of the archbishop and the home of retired Cardinal Godfried Danneels. The offices of an independent commission set up by the newly installed L√©onard in early 2010 to look into cases of sexual abuse were also raided. At the time, L√©onard said the move showed that the Church wanted to \\"resolutely turn a page on a very painful\\" topic. There was no suggestion L√©onard was involved in a coverup (having been in the office for half a year), but he was criticized for saying that full prosecution of elderly abusive priests was unnecessary given their age and the effect public prosecutions would have on victims. The raids were not well received by the Catholic Church, even raising the ire of the Pope.BBC News: \\"Belgian Catholic bishops angered by police raids\\" 25 June 2010 Pope Benedict XVI in a letter addressed to Archbishop Leonard said that: \\"I wish to express to you, dear Brother in the Episcopate, as well as to all the Bishops of Belgium, my closeness and my solidarity at this moment of sadness, in which, with certain surprising and deplorable modalities, searches have been carried out, including in the Cathedral of Mechelen and in the premises where the Belgian Episcopate was meeting in Plenary Session. During this meeting, there should have been, inter alia, aspects related to the abuse of minors by clergy. I myself have repeated many times that these serious facts should be dealt with by the civil order and by the canonical order in the mutual respect of the specificity and autonomy of each. In this sense, I hope that justice will follow its course by guaranteeing the rights of individuals and institutions, with respect for the victims.\\"Message of the Holy Father to S.E. Mons. Andre- Joseph Leonard, Archbishop of Milines-Brussels, President of the Belgium Episcopal Conference = Temperament = *In November 2010 L√©onard's spokesman, Juergen Mettepenningen, quit after only three months. Mettepenningen said at a press conference that \\"Monsignor Leonard at times acts like a motorist driving on the wrong side of a freeway who thinks all the other motorists are wrong,\\" He said the archbishop had promised him he would avoid statements to the media but had failed to keep the pledge. \\"A lack of trust means that I neither wish nor want to continue working as Monsignor Leonard's spokesman,\\" he said.Belgium's Catholic primate faces homophobia charge Spokesman for Belgium's Catholic archbishop quits *In December 2010, speaking at a parliamentary commission on child abuse in Belgium, L√©onard's predecessor, Danneels (who had been archbishop from 1979 until 2010 during which revelations about the sexual abuse crisis first became public) admitting his mistakes, stated \\"for too long the church thought only about itself and about its priests and now it is time to think about the victims of sexual abuse\\". When L√©onard was asked about whether the Catholic Church would contribute to a general compensation fund set up for victims of sexual abuse (including those not abused by Catholic priests), he refused stating that \\"The civil court must determine the compensation and the offender must pay.\\" The Commission was surprised as they thought that L√©onard would build on Danneels' testimony and use the opportunity to try to heal the poor relations between the government and the Catholic Church over the sex abuse crisis. L√©onard added that he expected representatives of other \\"respectable professions,\\" like medicine and sports, to contribute as well \\"because abuse is not a monopoly of the church.\\" The day after appearing before the commission, tempering his position, L√©onard announced that he would voluntarily donate to a \\"solidarity fund\\" to compensate victims of sexual abuse \\"not because we are obliged to do that, but because we want to show solidarity, as we also regularly do for victims of floods or epidemics.\\"National Catholic Reporter: \\"Archbishop: church not obligated to compensate abuse victims\\" 10 December 2010 *In October 2010, L√©onard was criticised by HIV activists, gay advocates, and political party operatives for rejecting the idea that AIDS is \\"a punishment from God\\", instead \\"this epidemic is sort of intrinsic justice, not at all a punishment.\\" He continued saying that \\"All I'm saying is that sometimes there are consequences linked to our actions\\" and that \\"HIV carriers merit respect\\" and \\"must not suffer discrimination.\\" \\"I believe this is a totally decent, honourable and respectable stance.\\" *L√©onard said that retired priests suspected of paedophilia should be spared canonical action (removal from the priesthood or laicization), which he termed \\"a sort of vengeance.\\" Priests who abused children in their care, Leonard went on television to say, must be made aware of what they did, \\"but if they're no longer working, if they have no responsibilities, I'm not sure that exercising a sort of vengeance that will have no concrete result is humane.\\" On 31 September 2010, the bishop of Antwerp, Johan Bonny, said this was \\"a personal point of view\\" and not that of the church. Leonard then went public after All Saints Day Mass to say he had been misunderstood and that he believed paedophile priests should be sent before justice. Leonard's position is in agreement with current Vatican practice. The Vatican admits it has no tolerance for pedophiles, but rarely subjects elderly pedophile priests to full canonical trials, instead telling them to live out their years in prayer and penance.  Positions on moral and political issues = Belgian political crisis of 2007‚Äì08  In 2007, Belgium was facing one of the longest and most intense political crises in its 178 years of existence. After the Belgian general election of 2007, Belgium entered a period of communitarian tensions and political instability, mostly caused by the different opinions about the need and the extent of a state reform. On 9 July 2008, Bishop L√©onard published an open letter on the website of the Diocese of Namur entitled The end of Belgium? (). He wrote that Belgium will not fall apart: L√©onard asked Walloons and French-speaking inhabitants of Brussels to renounce their superiority complex of the French language against Dutch-speaking Belgians. Bishop L√©onard himself is a proficient speaker of Dutch. The letter was published the same month in the Dutch Catholic magazine Katholiek Nieuwsblad.Einde Belgi√´?, Katholiek Nieuwsblad, 18 July 2008  Homosexuality  In an April 2007 interview for the weekly ', L√©onard was asked about his position on homosexuality and described homosexual behaviour as \\"abnormal\\". As a consequence, L√©onard was charged with homophobia under Belgium's 2003 Anti-Discrimination Act, after gay activists have said he sought to \\"stigmatize\\" homosexuals. Due to the criticisms that followed his interview, Bishop L√©onard quickly clarified that it is their behaviour that is abnormal, not their very person. In April 2009, the Belgian courts ruled that L√©onard's comments were not severe enough to be considered slander or discrimination. \\"Homosexuality is not the same as normal sex in the same way that anorexia is not a normal appetite,\\" L√©onard said in an interview for a Belgian television station. He added that he would \\"never call anorexia patients abnormal.\\" In April 2013, L√©onard was doused with water from bottles shaped like the Virgin Mary by four topless FEMEN activists while participating in a debate with philosophy professor Guy Haarscher on the subject of blasphemy and freedom of speech at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles. The archbishop remained in silent prayer during the incident. Resignation Upon reaching the age of 75 on 6 May 2015, L√©onard submitted his resignation as archbishop to the Apostolic Nuncio of the Holy See to Belgium, as required by Church law. On the following 1 June, the archdiocese announced that Pope Francis had accepted it, to be effective with the naming of his successor. While the archdiocese described it as a routine response, some media speculated that this was an exceptionally quick action.  Works   .

While corporately based in New York City, the mission of the organization is carried out through a traveling bus, an audio and video recording studio on wheels. With the very newest technology and gear, the Bus continues to be dedicated to providing young people with tours of the studios and participation in free songwriting and multimedia production workshops. With the assistance of three on-board engineers, students learn how to write, perform, and record original songs, plus produce and shoot music videos or documentaries, completing a broadcast-quality production in a single visit. The Bus is highly adaptable, designed to provide students, their schools and communities with performances, demonstrations, remote recordings, and studio sessions customized for their needs, levels of experience and interest. The Bus travels the country visiting schools, musical and technology conferences and events, and partners with newspapers and other media to host Battles of the Bands with the national winner selected online. The Bus is also able to produce live multi-camera video productions streamed to the web in real-time. All projects created on board are available for viewing on lennonbus.org, YouTube, and Facebook. The Bus travels from coast to coast, making stops at K-12 schools, universities, Boys and Girls Clubs, concerts, trade shows, music festivals and more. At most stops the staff conducts free tours while providing an opportunity for a group of youths to record an original song and video. Each stop typically culminates in a community celebration and screening of the music and video just produced on the Bus. John Lennon Bus Website - Video Archive. At some of its school visits, the Bus organizes a Battle of the Bands where students can engage in a friendly competition and the winning band may receive prizes. The Bus has also co-produced a course with the Digital Media Academy that is offered at several universities each summer, called \\"Come Together: Music and Video Production.\\" Digital Media Academy Website - Course Description. Requests for the Bus to stop at schools and communities across the U.S. are accepted at any time, but the high volume of requests that the staff receives results in the unfortunate reality that not all requests can be accommodated. Nevertheless, the Bus and its staff strive to reach as many people as possible in order to further music education. The Bus' interior is divided into three separate studio environments that can be opened to create one large studio. The front studio is an audio and video production room. The rear studio offers recording and mixing, as well as an iso booth for acoustic recordings, and a Chromatte (green screen) booth. Featuring Apple audio and video solutions, the studios are powered by Apple computers. Yamaha instruments including guitars, keyboards, and drums are included. The Lennon Bus is connected to the professional recording industry. Recording artists, including will.i.am, Natasha Bedingfield and Justin Timberlake have recorded on the Bus and participated in outreach programs. Fosters Daily Democrat News - Friday, May 1, 2009. In addition to isolated recording sessions, the Bus has accompanied headlining artists, such as The Black Eyed Peas, on their concert tours, allowing these artists to continue working on their records while they are on the road. Participants like Black Eyed Peas guitarist George Pajon and musical director Printz Board find time to inspire and be inspired.

A two-time former presidential election candidate in 2012 and 2017, Ahn was the Bareunmirae Party's candidate for the Seoul mayorship in 2018. He ran as an independent candidate for the presidential election in 2012, but withdrew a month before the election took place to support Moon Jae-in whom he ran against in 2017 as the People's Party nominee. He was a founding co-leader and the party leader of the People's Party until his party and Bareun Party merged as Bareunmirae Party in February 2018. Prior to politics, Ahn founded AhnLab, Inc., an antivirus software company, in 1995. He was chairman of the board and Chief Learning Officer of AhnLab until September 2012, and remains the company's largest stakeholder. Prior to entering politics, Ahn served as dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at Seoul National University until September 2012. Early life and education Ahn was born on 26 February 1962, in Miryang, South Korea, while his father was on military service there; he subsequently moved with his family to Busan, where he grew up. Ahn was not an academic child but had number academic hobbies such as reading.http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&aid;=0002032901 He received his Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in physiology from Seoul National University between 1980 and 1991. He became the youngest chief of professors at Dankook University medical college at 27 years of age, marking his first career as a medical doctor. Ahn met his wife whilst in university. Whilst working as a graduate student pursuing his MD, Ahn began to gain an interest in computer software as a hobby, in particular, antivirus software. Ahn soon began working on his own antivirus software after he was confronted with a virus that was mass- infecting computers in Korea. Ahn was soon infected with the same virus and reverse engineered the virus in an attempt to erase it from his disk drive which was successful. The program he wrote to help get rid of the virus was eventually called \\"Vaccine\\" which Ahn distributed for free.  Business career = AhnLab, Inc  After finishing military service as a medical officer in the South Korean navy, and leaving behind his career in the medical profession, Cheol-soo went on to establish his venture company AhnLab, Inc in March 1995 after being advised by a software company official to do so. Ahn had previously attempted to distribute V3 via Samsung's brand though Samsung rejected Ahn's offer. Ahn, not knowing how to run a business at first, struggled for the first several years. Whilst managing the company, Ahn was also attempting to get a master's degree in engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997. Ahn eventually received a $10 million offer from US software giant, McAfeeÎØºÎèÑÏãù, ÎÇòÎ•º ÌôïÎ∞îÍæ∏Îäî Ïã§Ï≤ú ÎèÖÏÑúÎ≤ï Î∂ÅÌè¨Ïä§ 155ÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄ '1997ÎÖÑ ÏßÅÏõêÎì§ÏóêÍ≤å ÏïàÏ≤†ÏàòÏó∞Íµ¨ÏÜåÎ•º Îß°Í≤®ÎëîÏ±Ñ ÎØ∏Íµ≠ÏóêÏÑú Ïú†ÌïôÌïòÎ©∞ Ïã§Î¶¨ÏΩòÎ≤®Î¶¨Ïóê Î®∏Î¨ºÎçò Ï§ë ÌòÑÏû¨ Í≤ΩÏüÅÌöåÏÇ¨ Îß•ÏïÑÌîºÏóêÍ≤å 1Ï≤úÎßåÎã¨Îü¨ Ï†úÏïà Î∞õÏïòÏßÄÎßå Í±∞Ï†à' and Ahn met with John McAfee personally. McAfee was struggling to expand into South Korea due to AhnLab, Inc and wanted to purchase the company in an attempt to monopolize the anti-virus software market in South Korea. Ahn rejected the offer because, despite AhnLab struggling, selling the company would lead to widespread redundancies and might allow a foreign firm to dominate the Korean market. In 1999, the company began to run a surplus after the CIH virus became widespread in Korea and people needed to buy V3 to protect against it. By the end of 1999, AhnLab, Inc became the second biggest computer security company in South Korea. That same year, he won the Scientist of the Year Award presented by the Korea Science Journalists Association. The same company later became the largest computer security company in South Korea,AhnLab Looks to Perform in International Stage at Korea Times.AhnLab Considers Overseas M&A; at Korea IT Times. and was included in annual lists of Korea's most admired companies by Korea Management Association Consulting between 2004 and 2008.AhnLab, \\"The Korea's Most Admired company\\" Consecutive 5 years at Asia Economy (2008.02.20).

He resigned as CEO in 2005 and served as chairman of the board until 2012.  Later life and education  Ahn became an outside director of POSCO in 2005, and from 2010 to 2011 was chairman of the company. Ahn was awarded an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degree from the Wharton School (San Francisco campus) in 2008. He then became a professor at KAIST in 2008, and later in the beginning of 2011 became the Dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at Seoul National University. Political career=Entry into politics Since 2006, Ahn had been offered places in the main political parties but was constantly denied any chance to run as an independent due to opposing factions. In early September 2011, speculation spread that Ahn would enter politics by competing in the 26 October Seoul mayoral by-election. The Democratic Party and Liberty Korea Party attempted to recruit Ahn for the mayoral by-election though they failed due to Ahn feeling like he, and many other voters, had become disenfranchised with the main two choices. Ahn eventually made an announcement, denouncing the opposition and ruling party and saying he was not sure on his candidacy, deciding to watch the polls before making a choice though he shared the sentiment that he felt like it'd take a lot of work to help Seoul, saying \\"ten years of work\\" would be needed to help the city. Analysts stated that if positioned as an independent, Ahn would attract a degree of support from those disaffected by mainstream political parties in the wake of corruption allegations and continuing policy failures. Ahn's polling was higher than other potential candidates, at 35% with second place coming in at 17%. His approval rating was subsequently polled afterwards, reaching over 50%. Ahn eventually didn't run despite his positive poll ratings instead endorsing Park Won-soon who went on to win the by-election. Park's win has been attributed to Ahn's endorsement due to centrist voters moving to Park's side after the endorsement. He alluded to standing as a presidential candidate in his 2012 book Thoughts of Ahn Cheol- Soo. First presidential campaign (2012) On 19 September 2012, at 3 p.m. Korea Standard Time, Ahn held a press conference and announced his intention to run for the 2012 presidential election. This announcement came after months of speculation on whether or not Ahn was going to run for the presidency. The South Korean presidential election was to be held on 19 December 2012. In an address that lasted around 20 minutes, Ahn spent a considerable amount of time explaining how he came to the decision to run for President of the Republic of Korea, quoting the people he had met while exploring his candidacy, who had expressed their desire for a \\"new politics\\". Ahn at one point showed to be polling stronger than Moon Jae-in, with a few polls showing he could win against Park Geun-hye, the candidate who would go on to win the election. On 23 November 2012, at 8:20 p.m. KST, Ahn announced that he would drop out of the race,http://news.naver.com/main/president2012/news/read.nhn?mid=hot&sid1;=154&cid;=909465&iid;=39207146&oid;=003&aid;=0004843794&ptype;=011 endorsing Moon Jae-in, the Democratic United Party presidential candidate. Early Assembly career (2013‚Äì2016) On 11 March 2013, Ahn announced that he would run for a seat in the National Assembly of South Korea as an independent candidate in the by-election in the district of Seoul Nowon C. He won the election on 24 April, entering his first elected office. In May 2013, he launched a new think tank named Policy Network Tomorrow. = New Politics Alliance for Democracy Chairmanship (2014) = Having entered the Assembly, Ahn began to explore the creation of a new party, which was provisionally named the New Political Vision Party on the basis of public surveys. On 26 March 2014, however, while the party was in the process of being set up, Ahn merged his faction with the liberal Democratic Party to form the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD), becoming co-chairman of the new party alongside Kim Han-gil. Ahn and Kim both resigned from their position three months later in July following the new party's disappointing performance in by-elections that year, which had seen the liberals lose a seat in Jeolla to conservatives for the first time in 26 years. = Defection from the NPAD (2015) = Ahn remained in the NPAD, but came into increasing conflict with Moon Jae-in, who had taken over sole leadership of the party after his resignation, and the \\"pro-Roh\\" faction that Moon represented. In December 2015, Ahn issued an ultimatum to Moon demanding that a convention be held at the beginning of 2016 to elect a new party leader. Moon rejected the demand. Ahn then left the NPAD along with a range of other lawmakers opposed to Moon, including Kim Han-gil. Announcing that he would form a new party, he subsequently joined forces with Chun Jung-bae, who had left the party earlier in the year, to form the People's Party in January 2016. Moon resigned as leader after Ahn's defection, describing his experience as \\"a series of difficult days without a single one of respite\\". People's Party (2016‚Äì2018) Ahn positioned the new People's Party as an anti-establishment centrist force, attracting support from both political wings. He labeled the remaining NPAD \\"anachronistic progressives\\", and accused contemporary Korean politicians of lacking policies beyond \\"short- term gimmicks\\". In the lead-up to the April 13 parliamentary election, he came into conflict with his co-leader Chun and other members of the party after Kim Chong-in, the interim leader of the Democratic Party, the NPAD's successor, called for the two parties to form an electoral alliance. Kim Han-gil and Ahn's co-leader Chun both supported the plan, but Ahn rejected any prospect of an alliance with his former party. The proposal was ultimately scotched, with Kim Han-gil withdrawing from the upcoming election in protest. In the event, the People's Party performed better than anticipated, coming second in party- list voting and winning 38 seats overall, including 23 of the 28 districts in the liberal stronghold of Jeolla. The People's Party held the balance of power in the new Assembly, establishing a three-party system. Ahn was credited for the victory, which was seen as giving him a position as kingmaker and support for contesting the presidential elections in the following year. Following the election, Ahn rejected continued calls to regroup with the Minjoo Party, stating that \\"it would be inappropriate to speak of politically realigning at this point in time\\". He added that the People's Party would not be \\"a mere tie-breaking third party, but ... a new opinion leader in parliamentary affairs\\". = Second presidential campaign and defeat (2017) = Ahn was widely known to be a likely contender for the 2017 South Korean presidential election. He was selected as the People's Party's nominee, defeating Sohn Hak- kyu and Park Joo- sun.http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD‚à£=sec&sid1;=100&oid;=079&aid;=0003072580 Despite rapid increase in opinion polling which briefly bypassed Moon Jae-In, Ahn floundered in TV debates that led to his loss finishing third in a field of five total candidates.' = Return of party chairmanship (2017-2018) = The underperformance of his presidential campaign and a party scandal that found People's Party members fabricating evidence to smear Moon Jae-in's campaign led Ahn to declare in July 2017 to both apologize and take a step back from politics in \\"self-reflection.\\" He returned a month later to run, and later win, the party chairmanship.  Bareunmirae Party (2018‚Äì2019)  As head of the People's Party, Ahn was a strong advocate for merging with the center-right Bareun Party. The two leaders of the respective parties, Ahn and former presidential contender Yoo Seung-min, pushed forward with the merger which was completed in February 2018. Although Yoo retained a leadership position within the new party and Ahn stepped down from any leadership role, as of March 2018 took on the role of leading the party's talent recruiting committee - a formal position speculated to signal his preparation to run for the Seoul mayorship later in the year. = Seoul Mayorship campaign (2018)  People Party (2020‚Äìpresent)  Ahn Cheol-soo will return to South Korea's political arena, according to a Facebook post. On March 1, he was reported that he was carrying out Covid-19 medical service in Daegu with his wife Kim Mi-kyung. It is said that there is no problem in treating patients because they have a doctor's license. On April 1, He started the \\"Chunri-gil National Territory Master,\\" a run of hope and unity that runs a total of 400 kilometers. Political positions= \\"New Politics\\"  Ahn has stated that he considers Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a role model, and has referred to himself as the Bernie Sanders of Korea. He supports an increased capital gains tax, higher public welfare spending, and a cautious approach to free trade agreements.  Centrism  Despite taking progressive stances on social and economic issues, Ahn‚Äôs foreign policy proposals are roughly similar to that of South Korean conservatives: he calls for a tougher approach towards North Korea, and supports the THAAD system (although initially opposed to it). In September 2012, Ahn visited the graves of Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Kim Dae-jung. Park and Rhee are often praised by Korean conservatives, and Kim by liberals. Ahn stated at the time that it would be \\"hypocritical to paint half the people as enemies and at the same time call for 'unity. Ahn has been considered \\"more palatable for conservative voters\\" in part due to his business background.  National security (THAAD)  Ahn was among the first who opposed the American deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, commonly referred to as THAAD, alongside Moon Jae-in. However, he changed his stance suggesting it was \\"irresponsible\\" for any future president to reverse an agreement already made between the United States and Korea.  LGBT rights  Ahn has stated he opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage, although in a more detailed article on broadcasting network SBS' website, he said that same-sex marriage needs to be achieved through social discussion. Philanthropy In December 2011, Ahn has expressed his willingness to donate half of his shares in AhnLab for the education of children from low-income families. He owns 37.1 percent of AhnLab shares, and as of 9 December 2011, the value of the shares to be donated is about 250 billion won ($218 million). Legal problems In September 2012, Ahn made a public apology as reports surfaced that his wife evaded taxes by under-pricing a 2001 apartment she bought worth ‚Ç©450 million to ‚Ç©250 million, thus reducing the acquisition and registration taxes by up to ‚Ç©10 million. However, a statement by the Korea Taxpayers' Association claimed that the \\"down contract\\" was in accordance with trade customs and thus not unlawful due to flaws in the local tax law between 1996 and 2005.  Personal life  In 1988 he married Kim Mi-kyung, who is currently a professor at the Seoul National University College of Medicine. Ahn has a daughter with Kim.http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2012&no;=610838 Bibliography * 2012. Thought of Ahn Cheol-Soo (ÏïàÏ≤†ÏàòÏùò ÏÉùÍ∞Å). ÍπÄÏòÅÏÇ¨. 276 pages. * 2009.

The unit was also called 1st Tennessee Battery (African Descent). Service The Memphis Battery Light Artillery (African Descent) was organized at Memphis, Tennessee and mustered in for three years on October 31, 1863 under the command of Captain Carl A. Lamberg. As was custom at the time, the battery was designated the Memphis Battery (Colored) Light Artillery. It was initially attached to the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery Regiment (African Descent) as Battery M. The battery was attached to the garrison of Fort Pickering, District of Memphis, 5th Division, XVI Corps, Department of the Tennessee, to January 1864. 1st Colored Brigade, District of Memphis, Tennessee, XVI Corps, to April 1864. The Memphis Battery Light Artillery (African Descent) ceased to exist on March 11, 1864 when its designation was changed to Battery D, 2nd United States Light Artillery Regiment (Colored). This designation was changed again on April 26, 1864 to Battery F, 2nd United States Colored Light Artillery. Detailed service During its brief existence, the regiment performed post and garrison duty at Memphis, Tennessee, until April 1864. One section under the command of Lieutenant A. M. Hunter was sent to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, on February 15, 1864. During the final assault on the fort, the section of 2nd U.S. Light Artillery (colored) manned two 6-pound James Rifles cannon in the center two embrasures of the fort. All Union artillery was largely ineffective because the guns could not be depressed enough to fire upon the Confederates on the steep terrain below. Nearly every man in this detachment was killed or missing in action when Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest captured the fort on April 12, 1864 and Union troops were subsequently massacred. In his report of April 27, 1864, Captain Lamberg, who was not present at the battle, stated that the section had one officer and 34 enlisted men. Of these, six were killed, four wounded, five taken prisoner, and Lieutenant Hunter and 18 other men were listed as missing in action. Private John Kennedy, who was wounded and captured (but escaped to report to Captain Lamberg), stated that he saw Lieutenant Hunter and several men of the section in the Mississippi River, but that he was captured before seeing what became of them. Captain Lamberg commanded one section in June 1864 under Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis on his expedition into Mississippi. The expedition ended in defeat Maj. Gen. Forrest at the battle of Brice's Cross Roads. The section was attached to the brigade of Colonel W. L. McMillen and consisted of two officers and 37 enlisted men. The section's guns were spiked and abandoned on the field. Casualties Records are incomplete, but the battery lost at least 6 men killed or mortally wounded during service. The official report on the Battle of Fort Pillow identified only one soldier of the section of 40 men as a survivor. However, a review of individual service records identifies 8 survivors who were considered missing in action and 5 survivors who were released or paroled from prison camps. One reason for this oversight is that many soldiers of the 2nd US Colored Light Artillery were reported to be members of the 6th US Colored Heavy Artillery. Many eyewitnesses stated that the officer in command of the section, Lieutenant Alexander M. Hunter, was killed. However, Lt. Hunter survived the battle and the war. (Source: \\"River Run Red\\") One example of a survivor is Daniel Tyler who was shot in the eye and right shoulder. The Confederates threw him into the ditch and buried him in a mass grave. By dawn of the 13th, he managed to dig himself out. Tyler's story was told in many newspaper accounts. Though badly wounded and almost blind, he returned to his unit in May 1864. Then he left to recuperate from his wounds. When he returned in March 1865, he was accused of being absent without leave and was imprisoned in Irving Block Prison in Memphis. Amid the filth and deplorable conditions, he died in prison 4 months later on July 12, 1865. (Source: \\"River Run Red\\") Commanders * Captain Carl A. Lamberg * Captain Francis N.

Hamilton was a nineteenth-century English and American architect, active between 1840 and 1870. Hamilton had a significant practice in his native England before moving to North America in 1850. Between 1852 and 1859, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hamilton's business thrived, with a long list of private homes, churches, and several major public buildings. He then moved to New York City, can be found in the American south as a traveling graphic journalist during and after the Civil War, and was again practicing architecture from New York in 1870.  Life  Ford Park Cemetery chapel, Plymouth, by Hamilton and Medland  England  Hamilton first appears in 1841 as a new partner of Samuel Daukes (1811-1880). Daukes was established in practice in Gloucester and Cheltenham, designing for the rapidly developing railways. Among other commissions for mansions and churches, Daukes and Hamilton designed the main building of Royal Agricultural College near Cirencester, in Victorian Tudor style. Construction began in 1845. In 1848 the firm won a competition for the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum, moved offices from the Midlands to London, took into the partnership James Medland (1808‚Äì94), and changed its name to Hamilton & Medland. (Daukes continued as an unnamed partner.) That firm is credited for Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester, Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth, Warstone Lane Cemetery, Birmingham, and insane asylums in Lincoln and Powick Hospital in Worcester.  Americas  Woodward High School, 1855 (razed 1907) Hamilton came to North America in 1850. A single source has an architect, with the same name, designing a residence for British emissary Louis Lewis in San Felipe, Panama in 1851.The Panama Star of 30 September 1851, quoted in The structure still stands on Plaza Sim√≥n Bol√≠var as the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var School in San Felipe. Hamilton arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio in approximately 1852. In city business records he was listed on his own in 1853-1855, as partners with James C. Rankin, 1856‚Äì1857, and then with James W. McLaughlin in 1857-1858. Hamilton's 1855 Woodward High School building stands among the first buildings in America to use terracotta for exterior decoration.according to an article in the ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Bureau‚Äù in The Horticultural Review and Botanical Magazine, IV (1854), 428-429. The historian of Cincinnati's schools noted that Hamilton had urged the adoption of terra cotta because of his extensive travels in Italy. \\"Unfortunately, however, its manufacture was then an untried process here, and within a few years it began to disintegrate in the walls of the structure, and it became necessary to cut it out and replace it with stone. This unfortunate state of affairs brought the building into disrepute. Nevertheless, as an architectural design, it was eminently satisfactory.\\" Hamilton may have been in New York City at 36 Wall Street by 1859. According to Haverstock, page 369, \\"he served during the Civil War as special artist for Harper‚Äôs Weekly, traveling as far south as Port Hudson, Louisiana,\\" and was in Richmond, Virginia, from about 1864 to 1866. In 1870 advertised his services from a New York office at 1267 Broadway. Hamilton was an early member of the Literary Club of Cincinnati (1857), and was made a Fellow of the fledgling American Institute of Architects on April 3, 1860.by 1880 Hamilton's membership had lapsed; see Prominent Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford, also born in England but brought to the Cincinnati area as a child, got his start in Hamilton's office in 1857.  Henry Clay monument  In 1854 Hamilton entered and won a national design competition for the Henry Clay monument, to be built in Lexington Cemetery, Lexington, Kentucky. Hamilton's entry was accepted by the committee from more than 100 entries. The New York Times described it as, :a gothic temple of circular form with thirteen sides, intended to illustrate the thirteen original States of the Confederacy... The upper portion of the building is to be used as a record room to contain relics of the great statesman, an original and admirable idea. Altogether this will make the most complete and graceful mausoleum in the world. Other sources noted it was to be \\"constructed entirely and innovatively of cast-iron\\". It was never built. Citing costs, the monument committee turned to a far more conventional column design by Julius W. Adams, a Lexington civil engineer and architect.

It is a Grade II* listed building. Origins The station in use in 1861 The first York railway station was a temporary building on Queen Street outside the walls of the city. It was opened in 1839 by George Hudson's York and North Midland Railway and was the terminus of the original trunk route for trains to London, via Derby and Birmingham. It was succeeded by what is now the old station, built at the junction of Toft Green, Tanner Row and Station Rise inside the city walls by the Y&NM;'s architect George Townsend Andrews in 1840. It opened on 4 January 1841. Andrews also designed the neo-Tudor arch where the walls were breached to allow trains to access the station. The building The station was built in an Italianate style. Its main facade, a symmetrical seventeen-bay three-storey block, faces Tanner Row and Toft Green. The ground floor is of carboniferous limestone and the upper floors are brick with stone dressings. Behind this are the remains of the train-shed, which was of iron construction and was largely demolished in 1965. Beyond the shed, by the city wall, are brick buildings which housed the refreshment rooms and waiting rooms. They originally consisted of only one storey, but an upper storey was added in 1850. York old station hotel frontageAndrews also designed the hotel across the head of the lines on Station Rise. This was completed in 1853 and was the first hotel to be incorporated into a railway station. After a visit by Queen Victoria, it was named \\"The Royal Station Hotel\\". Closure and afterlife With the rapid increase in the number of new railway lines during the railway mania and later, this station, originally a terminus, became a part of the route from London to Newcastle and beyond. Through-trains calling at York had to reverse out of the station to continue their journeys, an inconvenience to railway staff and passengers, and a new through station (the present York railway station), outside the city walls, was planned and eventually built, opening in 1877. The tracks into the old station, however, remained in use for a further 88 years as carriage storage space. Meanwhile, the railway buildings and hotel were converted into offices. In February 2010, the City of York Council announced that it intended to convert the station into its new headquarters, to be known as the West Offices. A planning application was submitted, and was approved in June 2010. English Heritage and York Civic Trust supported the proposal. Following objections by the Victorian Society to some aspects of the conversion, the application had to await a decision of the Secretary of State, but it was eventually approved and work on refurbishing the building was completed in April 2013. A 'Topping Out' ceremony was conducted by construction and project teams from York Investors LLP, Miller Construction and City of York Council on 17 November 2011. The council moved in during the spring of 2013. An official opening ceremony was conducted on 20 September 2013.

History The Middle Neva shipyard, located near the junction of the Izhora and Neva rivers in the Kolpino district of southern St. Petersburg, is an important builder of mine warfare ships for the Russian navy. The yard probably dates back to 1911, when the Saint Petersburg Metals Plant, then a builder of marine turbines, established a shipyard at Ust-Izhora to build destroyers. Between the world wars the Ust-Izhora yard was limited to the construction of river barges. It was expanded into a major builder of minesweepers and other small combatants after World War II and built ships of the steel-hulled T-43, T-58, Yurka, and Natya classes in the 1950s and 1960s. It has also built a few large tugs and small tankers for service as naval auxiliaries. Around 1970 it began to experiment with glass-reinforced plastic and subsequently built a few Zhenya-class minesweepers and many Yevgenya- and Lida-class inshore minesweepers. It also built hydrofoils of the Matka and Turya classes and Tarantul-class missile corvettes. Today it is offering several types of ships on the civil market similar to its minesweeper classes, including ships of up to 100 tons with glass-reinforced plastic hulls, steel- hulled ships of up to 800 tons, and similar ships built with low-magnetic steel.

Formed in 2009, the band is a supergroup composed of bassist and lead vocalist Glenn Hughes, guitarist and second vocalist Joe Bonamassa, drummer Jason Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009 after an impromptu performance together. From the advice of their producer, Kevin Shirley, they recruited Bonham and Sherinian to finalize the band's lineup. The name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, which refers to an area of the West Midlands of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin. After playing together for a while, the group released its self-titled debut album in 2010. Black Country Communion 2 followed the next year, which was promoted on the group's first concert tour of the US and Europe. The band released its third album, Afterglow, in 2012. In early 2013, after months of public tensions, Bonamassa announced he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in late 2016, with a fourth album BCCIV released in 2017. After three years working on separate projects, the band plans to enter studio for a potential fifth album in early 2021. History=2009‚Äì10: Formation and debut album Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa first met at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed together at Hughes' studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & Me on the recommendation of producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It was at this point that the two decided to form a new band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist. The completed quartet first performed together during the encore at one of Bonamassa's solo shows in Riverside, California on March 17, 2010, playing \\"One Last Soul\\" and a cover version of the Deep Purple song \\"Mistreated\\". The name Black Country Communion was not finalised until May 2010, after the threat of legal action from another band prevented the group from using the name Black Country. Hughes later revealed that the band in question, from Baltimore, Maryland, reportedly demanded $500,000 for the right to use the name Black Country, a move which he quickly condemned as \\"just rude\\". The bassist later elaborated on the situation in a 2016 interview, explaining that his group had successfully bought the name Black Country from the Baltimore-based band (for less than the initially touted $500,000), although by the time the case was settled it was too late to use the name and they instead had to continue using the longer moniker Black Country Communion. The band recorded its debut album at Los Angeles' Shangri-La Studios in early 2010, scheduling a September release through Mascot Records in Europe and Bonamassa's label J&R; Adventures in North America. Hughes described the album as \\"a big British rock statement\\", comparing the band's sound to that of his previous groups Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, as well as Led Zeppelin. \\"One Last Soul\\" was the first song to be released, receiving its worldwide debut on British digital radio station Planet Rock on August 2, 2010. The track was later released as a free digital download on the band's official website. Shortly before the album's release, Planet Rock also broadcast an hour-long documentary featuring exclusive interviews with the band and a selection of tracks from the album. Black Country Communion was officially released in Europe on September 20, 2010, and in North America a day later. On the night of its European release, the band played its first official show at the John Henry Rehearsal Studios in London, in front of a limited crowd of \\"around 75‚Äì100 people\\". The performance was broadcast on Planet Rock that night, and again later on September 24. The album was a commercial success in the UK, reaching number 13 on the UK Albums Chart and topping the UK Rock Albums Chart, while in the US it peaked at number 54 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It also received mainly positive reviews from music critics, including four-star reviews from AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia and Mojo writer Paul Elliott. The band did not tour in promotion of the album, playing just two shows in the UK at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall and London's Shepherd's Bush Empire. At the end of the year, Black Country Communion won the Planet Rock awards for Band of the Year and Best New Band. 2010‚Äì12: Second album and touring Talk of a second album began to circulate as early as October 2010, just a month after the release of Black Country Communion, when Bonham estimated that the band would start recording again in January 2011. By December, Hughes had already written nine tracks for the album, which he suggested would serve as a direct sequel to the first album. The album was scheduled for release in June 2011, with the band set to embark on a promotional tour to coincide with its release. \\"The Outsider\\" was released as a free digital download on the band's website in May, followed by a music video for \\"Man in the Middle\\" the next month. The album was released on June 13, 2011 in Europe and the following day in North America, selling over 8,000 copies in its first week in the US (compared to the 7,100 units of Black Country Communion) but only debuting on the Billboard 200 chart at number 71. The album was also less successful on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 23 (ten places lower than its predecessor). In 2011, the band embarked on its debut tour to promote Black Country Communion 2. In promotion of Black Country Communion 2, the band completed a short tour of Europe between June and July supported by the Michael Schenker Group. The group also performed in the US for the first time on the Black Country Communion 2 cycle, playing a total of seven shows in six states between June 10 and 19, 2011. The band's first live video album, Live Over Europe, recorded during the summer tour of Europe, was released in October 2011 and screened in a select number of Vue Cinemas across the UK and Ireland the next month. At the end of the year, the group won the Classic Rock award for Breakthrough Act of the Year. 2012‚Äì13: Afterglow and disbandment The band returned to the studio in June 2012 to record the follow-up to Black Country Communion 2. Discussing the direction of the group's third album, Hughes explained that it serves as \\"a continuation of the first and second albums\\", while also containing \\"darker [material]\\" and \\"moments of drama\\". The first track released from the album was \\"Confessor\\", which was made available as a free download on the band's official website from September 19, 2012. Afterglow was released the next month, reaching number 29 in the UK and number 48 in the US. Black Country Communion scheduled a one-off show at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall on January 5, 2013, with a video release of the concert planned for later in the year. However, it was later announced that the concert had been cancelled due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\". The band's producer Kevin Shirley offered an apology to fans the next day, suggesting that the show would be rescheduled at a later date. Speaking in August 2012, Hughes doubted the long-term future of the band by suggesting that Afterglow \\"just may be [the band's last album]\\", blaming the band's lack of regular touring (due in part to Joe Bonamassa's busy solo touring schedule) as a hindrance to the group's continued success. He later clarified his comments by stating that they \\"were fuelled from frustration and aimed at motivating other members of the group to commit to a proper touring schedule\\", adding that if the band was unable to tour regularly then he would seek another band which could. Later, both Bonamassa and Hughes both mentioned that they were \\"ready to move on\\" from Black Country Communion. Bonamassa eventually responded to rumors that he was to leave Black Country Communion, condemning Hughes' \\"bullying\\" of the guitarist to complete the planned 2013 show despite knowing that he was not able to, as well as the way in which he publicly revealed the tensions in the band and his claim of being the sole songwriter on Afterglow. Bonham also revealed his frustration with the situation, while Bonamassa's manager and business partner Roy Weisman admitted that it was his decision to cancel the Wolverhampton gig, based on Hughes's actions. On March 13, 2013, Bonamassa announced that he was \\"happily not involved any more\\" with Black Country Communion. Ten days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was over, revealing that Bonamassa would not allow the remaining members to continue with the Black Country Communion name. Speaking about the future, he hinted that \\"Jason, Derek and I will continue with a different name when the time is right\\". In August 2013, Sherinian joined Bonamassa's solo band as a full-time member, and in February 2014, Hughes and Bonham unveiled a new band with guitarist Andrew Watt named California Breed. 2016‚Äìpresent: Reformation and future In April 2016, it was announced that Black Country Communion would be reuniting in 2017 to record a fourth album. Speaking about the supergroup's comeback, Bonham explained that the reunion was initially suggested by Bonamassa, who reached out to the other band members with the proposal. Hughes and Bonamassa started writing new music for the forthcoming album in September, with recording beginning the following January. The album, entitled BCCIV, was released on September 22, 2017, and was promoted at two UK shows in January 2018. BCCIV was the band's first release to reach the top ten of the UK Albums Chart. After the band's members returned to their respective solo careers, Bonham suggested in 2018 that Black Country Communion would be potentially returning to the studio the following January to start work on a new album. However, Hughes later estimated that the band would likely not have time to work on new music until 2020. This schedule was subsequently pushed back another year, when the bassist explained that \\"Joe [Bonamassa] and I have been talking ... for nine months now about album number five. At the moment ... we're looking at January 2021 to record.\\" Style and songwriting As a supergroup, Black Country Communion's style is often described as a mix of various different sounds and influences. Particular significance is attributed to the band's mix of blues rock (attributed primarily to Bonamassa's work within the genre) and hard rock (originating from Hughes's previous work with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath and from Bonham's tie with Led Zeppelin via his father John), with some critics going as far as to claim that the group's sound is based on \\"the vintage Deep Purple template\\". In reviews for the band's second album, a number of critics compared the sound of the group to that of Led Zeppelin ‚Äì Eduardo Rivadavia of website AllMusic noted that the album \\"sounds like the baby of drummer Jason Bonham\\", while Paul Cole of the Sunday Mercury claimed that it is \\"haunted by the spirit of Zeppelin\\". Hughes has dubbed the group \\"a rock and roll band in the true sense of the word\\". Traditionally, the lyrical processes for Black Country Communion's albums have been led by Hughes, with Bonamassa only occasionally providing lyrical input. The majority of the music on Black Country Communion was composed by Hughes and Bonamassa, with Sherinian increasing his composition presence for the second album. Noting the extensive touring commitments of Bonamassa, Hughes has claimed that he was \\"left as the keeper of the keys to write [the band's] albums\\", noting that for each record ‚Äì which have been continuations of their predecessors ‚Äì he has had more and more time to write material (six weeks for Black Country Communion, four months for Black Country Communion 2, six months for Afterglow). Bonham has described the band's writing style as \\"spur of the moment\\".

Biography  The son of a stockbroker, Voorhees was born on May 29, 1871, in New York City. He was initially drawn to the sciences and earned degrees in Chemistry from Yale and Columbia Universities. In 1894, Voorhees began to seriously pursue fine art (which had always been a hobby) when he enrolled in classes at the Art Students League. The following year, Voorhees enrolled at the Metropolitan School of Fine Art. He also studied with Irving Ramsey Wiles on Long Island and with Leonard Ochtman in Connecticut. In 1897, Voorhees traveled to Europe, studying with Benjamin Constant and J. P. Laurens at the Acad√©mie Julian in ParisBenezit Dictionary of Artists and spending time in the French village of Barbizon as well as in the Netherlands. Sill Lane, Old Lyme Voorhees first visited Old Lyme, Connecticut in 1893. In 1896, he returned with his mother and sister, who stayed at an informal boarding house run by Florence Griswold. The Florence Griswold House (now the Florence Griswold Museum ) would eventually become the center of Old Lyme's artistic community and it is very likely that Henry Ward Ranger, often described as the Old Lyme colony's founder, was introduced to both Old Lyme and the Griswold House through Voorhees. Stylistically, Voorhees was one of the Old Lyme artists who remained at least somewhat loyal to the Barbizon-derived, Tonalist style associated with Ranger even after the majority had adopted Childe Hassam's Impressionist style. Most of Voorhees's paintings are undated, but it appears that he gradually adopted a more Impressionistic approach later in life. He also experimented with etching in the 1930s. Many of Voorhees's paintings depict Old Lyme prospects. Bermuda scenes are also common‚Äîbeginning in 1919, Voorhees and his family wintered there. He also painted in Newport, Rhode Island and in Western Massachusetts (his wife was from Lenox). Vorhees exhibited along with other members of the Old Lyme Art Colony as well as at the National Academy of Design, the Society of American Artists, the American Watercolor Society, the Carnegie Institute, and the Art Institute of Chicago. He was awarded a bronze medal at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition and in 1905 received one of the National Academy's three Hallgarten Prizes, honoring the best three oil paintings produced in the United States by artists under the age of thirty-five. My Garden Examples of Voorhees's work are in the collections of the Yale University Art Gallery, the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Florence Griswold Museum, and the Lyme Historical Society. Major exhibitions featuring Voorhees's work have included the Lyme Historical Society and Florence Griswold Museum's Clark G. Voorhees, 1871‚Äì1933 (June 13 ‚Äì August 30, 1981) and Hawthorne Fine Art's The Light Lies Softly: The Impressionist Art of Clark Greenwood Voorhees, 1871‚Äì1933 (December 15, 2009 ‚Äì February 27, 2010).

She is currently signed to Universal Music and EMI.Coco's Got Her Miracle by Bill Lennon, Hertfordshire Magazine June 2000 Coco Star has collaborated with artists such as Craig David, Artful Dodger and Fragma for the number 1 hit, \\"Toca's Miracle\\". Early life Coco Star was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Her parents were both musical artists and singers although not professionally. She was musically active before the age of just 5 with hopes of having a number one hit record, which she later achieved. Coco can play the cello and all of the recorder family, and some piano. At the age of just 12, Coco was writing and performing her own songs and had recorded her first track at the age of 15. Coco attended The University of West England, Bristol where she achieved a BA Hons degree in fashion and textiles. Prior to this, she had completed an art foundation course and a national diploma in art and design. Musical career During her time at The University of West England (not to be confused with The University of Bristol), she met up with Jody Wisternoff, Massive Attack and Tricky and began to further enhance her live performances and songwriting skills, landing underground hits with \\"One By One\\" and \\"Always on my Mind\\".Mixmag Music Magazine 1993 In 1994, Coco Star was signed by Universal MCA music publishing as part of a development deal where she worked alongside Paul Connolly on live showcases. Coco was coached by Whitney Houston's vocal coach and had dance tuition at Pineapple Dance Studios, as well as meeting Rob Davis regularly to work on music he wrote, and \\"I Need a Miracle\\" was just one of a few projects Coco worked on between 1994 and 1997. The ad libitum parts and sections of the melody line in \\"I Need a Miracle\\" including harmonies are exclusively the creation of Coco, who gave the song its iconic stamp. Coco also spent some time working with Roger McKenzie (AKA Wildchild) who died in 1995 aged 24. By 1997, Coco had entered the main UK charts with \\"I Need a Miracle\\" at No. 39 following its debut live performance at Pacha, Ibiza. It later went on to be the feature of a bootleg by UK DJ Vimto with huge success. Originally called \\"Fragma vs Coco\\", the mashup of the two records \\"Toca Me\\" by Fragma, and \\"I Need a Miracle\\" by Coco resulted in the name \\"Toca's Miracle\\". By the time of its official release in April 2000, the energy surrounding it was such that it went straight in at No. 1 in the UK, selling in excess of 500,000 copies. Coco Star is an accomplished songwriter, also signed to Universal Music Publishing for her works, including \\"It Ain't Enough\\" which features on the Artful Dodger album It's All About the Stragglers; this version also featuring Coco's vocals. \\"It Ain't Enough\\" was a top 20 hit for the Artful Dodger in 2001 but featured vocalist MZ MAY. Coco also wrote the track \\"Driftaway\\", which was covered by Kele Le Roc. Coco worked on an EP of songs by songwriter/producer Peter Wright. \\"Take You There\\" was released in April 2011. She has also signed a deal with DJ Smash, for a release of her self penned \\"Get Over You\\". This collaboration was part of the 2011 DJ Smash album, 23, and featured production by another Russian, DJ She. Ahead of the Miami Winter music conference 2011, Coco Star featured at No. 12 in the official buzz chart with a revocal of \\"I Need a Miracle\\", in a fresh new collaborative work with MYNC and Australian house music star Christian Luke form Melbourne. As with \\"Toca's Miracle\\", the new release entitled \\"A Miracle in Melbourne\\" is a mashup of the iconic vocal from \\"I Need a Miracle\\" and the track \\"London to Melbourne\\" released in late 2010 by MYNC and Christian Luke on CR2 Records, London. Collaborations Coco Star has collaborated with artists including Sub Love (Way out West) in 1993 (both writing and performing with DJ Die & Jody Wisternoff), Tricky, Massive Attack, Victor Imbres (Deep Dish engineer), Rob Davis from 1994‚Äì'97 (Kylie Minogue's songwriter), Craig David and the Dreem Teem (Timmi Magic and DJ Spoony), Artful Dodger, Brian Harvey (East 17), Fragma (on the remix of \\"I Need a Miracle\\" 2000 & 2008) and Photek under his moniker of 'Sentinel'. In 2011, Coco Star teamed up with MYNC and Christian Luke for collaborative works involving \\"I Need a Miracle\\". Coco Star is also associated with Andy Levy and Simon Bartholomew of the Brand New Heavies with whom she collaborated with during the production of some of her self written music. \\"I Need a Miracle\\" and \\"Toca's Miracle\\" Her most notable work to date is as the vocalist of \\"I Need a Miracle\\", released by EMI/Positiva in the UK and by Greenlight Recordings in the US. This track is also known worldwide under the guise of the mashup \\"Toca's Miracle\\" which was a number 1 hit in 14 countries worldwide in 2000.John-Paul. \\"Coco Star one of the biggest dance vocalists of all time!\\" , \\"Don't Stay In\\", 31 December 2008. \\"Toca's Miracle\\" is the result of splicing tracks (see mashup (music)) from two separate entities, namely Fragma (the German-based electronic production trio) and their hit \\"Toca Me\\", and \\"I Need a Miracle\\" which was initially written for solo artist Coco, by Universal Music publishing writers Victor Imbres and Rob Davis in 1994. Despite appearances in the \\"Toca's Miracle\\" video and Fragma album line-up, Coco was never part of the Fragma group, and remains a solo artist. Rebranding of the original song \\"I Need a Miracle\\" to Fragma's \\"Toca's Miracle\\" occurred without permission or prior agreement. Coco appeared live on Top of the Pops on four occasions, including the Christmas special during 2000 and 2001 to perform \\"Toca's Miracle\\" as well as on CD:UK, T4 and the Pepsi Chart Show. Further live performances of \\"Toca's Miracle\\" and Coco's other works were given on MTV and Prince Charles' Party in the Park. \\"Toca's Miracle 2008\\" Coco Star's vocals can also be heard on the 2008 remix of \\"Toca's Miracle\\", remixed by brothers Marko and Dirk Duderstadt. Again it uses the vocal parts from Coco's signed release of \\"I Need a Miracle\\". The 2008 remix was released by EMI/Positiva on 7 April 2008. Although the original 2000 release topped the charts in several countries exactly eight years previously, the remix climbed to No. 2 in Australia and No. 16 in the UK. The original is acknowledged as one of the top 5 biggest dance anthems ever. Remixes of Toca's Miracle were released without authorisation of Coco or Universal Music in 2008 and 2012. Both poor credit and lip-synching issues were discussed by press in Central Europe in 2010 when official singer Coco Star announced on National TV that a passing off act was appearing worldwide claiming to be the singer of the hit, either lip-synching or performing live over Coco's copyright-protected vocals, a scenario compared with the Milli Vanilli scandal, although it relates to only one song \\"Toca's Miracle\\", effectively a remix of \\"I Need a Miracle\\" written for Coco Star in 1994. The offending passing off artist appears on the cover of the Australian release of \\"Toca's Miracle 2008\\" adding to further confusion.

Male pedipalp, scale = 0.1 mm. Taxonomy The species was first described by the arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham in 1888 as Eris nervosus. Arachnologist James Emerton subsequently described the species in 1891 as Zygoballus terrestris. After examining the type specimen of Eris nervosus, however, Emerton concluded that they were the same species. In 1909, the Peckhams renamed the species Zygoballus nervosus and synonymized the previous names. Distribution In 1909, the Peckhams reported that the species had been collected from Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, and Illinois. Later records report the species from Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, eastern and central Texas, Ohio, Kansas, Louisiana, and Quebec. The range of Z. nervosus overlaps with that of two other Zygoballus species, Z. sexpunctatus and Z. rufipes. Diagnosis The male Zygoballus nervosus can be distinguished from Z. sexpunctatus by its lack of a large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic slope. It also lacks the thick covering of white scales on the sides of the carapace which extend from the clypeus to beyond the posterior median eyes in Z. sexpunctatus. The male Z. nervosus can be distinguished from Z. rufipes by its wider, heavier cephalothorax, its shorter chelicerae, and its longer, narrower hammer-like process on the chelicerae. In addition, the thoracic slope is not as steep as in Z. rufipes. The legs and pedipalps of the male Z. nervosus are shorter and thicker than those of Z. rufipes or Z. sexpunctatus. The tibia of the anterior legs are typically 2¬Ω times as long as wide, compared to about 4 times in Z. sexpunctatus or 4 to 6 times in Z. rufipes. The female Z. nervosus can be distinguished by the distinct form of the epigyne, which has its openings towards the front and very close together. Description Adult females are 3 to 4 mm in body length, while males are 2.5 to 4.5 mm. The sides of the cephalothorax are nearly vertical in front, and more rounded in the back. The ocular area occupies nearly three-fifths of the length of the cephalothorax and is widest at the posterior lateral eyes (PLE). The anterior median eyes (AME) are twice as large as the anterior lateral eyes (ALE), while the PLE are roughly the same size as the ALE.

All provinces elected their provincial governors for three-year terms that will begin on June 30, 2010. Governors that are currently serving their third consecutive terms are prohibited from running as governors (they may run in any other position). Highly urbanized cities and independent component cities such as Zamboanga City, Angeles and Cebu City, and including Metro Manila and the municipality of Pateros are outside the jurisdiction of any province and thus won't elect for governors of their mother provinces (Pampanga and Cebu, for Angeles and Cebu City). They, along with Metro Manila would elect mayors instead. Background Lakas-Kampi-CMD, the merged party of Lakas-CMD and KAMPI of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, has a majority of the provincial governorships in the lead-up to the 2010 elections. The Liberal Party (Philippines) was a far second. However, with the resolution of pending disputed election results by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), the Liberals lost three more governorships. Attracting international attention is the election race for governor of Maguindanao where Esmael Mangudadatu will be competing after a rival clan kidnapped and murdered 57 people including his wife, sisters, aides, and lawyers, plus several journalists. Bulacan On December 1, 2009, the COMELEC's Second Division ruled that Roberto Pagdanganan defeated Jonjon Mendoza in the 2007 elections, with Pagdanganan garnering 342,295 votes, 4,231 votes over Mendoza. Mendoza was a member of KAMPI prior to switching to the Liberals, and Pagdanganan was a member of Lakas-CMD before joining the Nacionalista Party. Mendoza and Pagdanganan won't contest the governorship; Pagdanganan is running for Congress as representative of Bulacan's 1st district, while Mendoza is running as representative from Bulacan's 3rd district, while her sister, former governor Josefina Dela Cruz will run as her brother's replacement. Isabela In Isabela, Grace Padaca of the Liberal Party defeated Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Dy of the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) via a margin of 17,007 votes, with Padaca garnering 237,128 votes and Dy having 220,121 votes. Padaca was proclaimed winner on June 30, the day of inauguration of all local officials. On December 8, 2009, the COMELEC Second Division ruled that Dy defeated Grace Padaca by a margin of 1,051 votes, with Dy garnering 199,435 over Padaca's 198,384. Padaca previously defeated Benjamin's brother Faustino Jr. in the 2004 election, ending the Dy's three-decade long rule in Isabela. This time, it's one of Ben's brothers, Faustino III also known as Bojie, who will contest Padaca in the 2010 gubernatorial election, with the ruling Lakas-Kampi-CMD party nominating him; while Ben on the other hand will vie for the mayorship of Cauayan City instead. Pampanga Arroyo's home province of Pampanga had one of the most hotly contested gubernatorial elections in 2007, with three out of six candidates having a realistic chance of winning: then incumbent Mark Lapid (Lakas-CMD), board member Lilia Pineda (KAMPI) and Roman Catholic priest-on-leave Eddie Panlilio (Independent). Panlilio was proclaimed the winner, garnering 219,706 votes, with Pineda obtaining 218,559 and Lapid having 210,875 votes. Pineda contested the result; meanwhile, Panlilio became a member of the Liberal Party late in 2009, supporting Noynoy Aquino's presidential campaign. On early February 2010, the COMELEC's Second Division ruled that Pineda won the 2007 election, obtaining 190,729 votes against Panlilio's 188,718.

He served as senior vice president (SVP) of corporate development and chief legal officer (CLO) for Alphabet Inc., and, formerly, for its subsidiary, Google. Prior to joining Google, in 2002, Drummond was a partner at law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and then chief financial officer of software company SmartForce. Drummond retired from Alphabet on January 31, 2020. Career Drummond earned a bachelor's degree in history from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. Drummond's first time working with Google was in 1998 as a partner at the technology law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati's corporate transactions group; he was Google's first outside counsel. Drummond worked with Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to raise funding and incorporate the company. Drummond was Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of software company SmartForce from June 1999 until January 2002. In July 2007, Drummond and three other SmartForce executives settled accounting violation charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resulting from an overstatement of the company‚Äôs net income by $127 million during a period of time from 1999 to 2002. Drummond paid a $700,000 fine to the SEC; he was also ordered to pay a $125,000 civil fine by the New Hampshire District Court. In February 2002, Drummond joined Google as Vice President of Corporate Development and General Counsel. He became Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in January 2006 and Chief Legal Officer in December 2006, positions he retained following Google's restructure into Alphabet Inc. in October 2015. He has also been Secretary at Google and Alphabet since 2002. During his tenure at Google, Drummond was involved in lawsuits the company fought against GEICO, Viacom, Microsoft and the Association of American Publishers. He played a central role in Google's right to be forgotten dispute in Europe and the company's exit from China in 2010. He also oversaw major acquisitions including YouTube, Android, DoubleClick and Motorola Mobility. Drummond is an advocate for freedom of speech and diversity. Drummond was charged by the SEC in 2005 with causing Google to violate securities law because he failed to advise the company's board that the company was required to register $80 million in stock options used as compensation for employees. The SEC said in its press release, \\"By deciding Google could escape its disclosure requirements, and failing to inform the Board of the legal risks of his determination, Drummond caused the company to run afoul of the federal securities laws.\\" In January 2005, Google and Drummond settled the complaint by agreeing not to violate securities laws in the future. Neither Google nor Drummond paid a fine or acknowledged wrongdoing. Drummond and other Google executives were defendants in a trial in Italy which began in 2009 over a video of a child being bullied which had been uploaded to Google Video in 2006. None of the executives charged had any involvement with the creation or posting of the video and Google removed the video after being notified by authorities. The case could have had ramifications for content providers around the world. In 2010, Drummond and two other Google executives were found guilty of privacy violations and handed six-month suspended sentences. They were cleared of defamation charges. In December 2012, the convictions and sentences were overturned on appeal. Drummond joined Uber's board of directors in August 2013 after Google Ventures led a $360 million funding round for Uber. Drummond stepped down from the board in August 2016 amid reports he had be shut out of board meetings due to his conflict of interest on self-driving cars. Drummond also sat on the board of Crisis Text Line, a not-for-profit organization, from 2012 to 2018. In 2014, Drummond was appointed a board member at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, where he sat on its conflicts committee. His compensation from Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., was US$47,282,232 in 2018, US$664,252 in 2017, and US$664,387 in 2016. Drummond is an investor and advisor to the media company Ozy. On January 10, 2020, it was announced that Drummond would leave Alphabet to retire, effective January 31, 2020, following scrutiny for potentially inappropriate relationships. He will not receive an exit package. In the months leading up to his announcement, Drummond sold off over $200 million of his Alphabet stock.  Personal life  Drummond has a son born in 2007 during an affair with Jennifer Blakely, at the time a Google employee in the department he oversaw. Drummond's relationship with Blakely was detailed in a 2018 New York Times expos√© on sexual misconduct by executives at Google. Drummond married Corinne Dixon, an employee in Google's legal department, around September 2019. Alphabet's board of directors, including Drummond, were sued by shareholders in January 2019 for allegedly covering up the sexual misconduct by executives. The board formed an independent committee and hired a law firm to investigate how executives handled the claims.

The company supplies and packages private-label, store-brand, organic dairy products for many of the country's largest grocery chains, including Wal-Mart, Safeway, Target and Costco. The company was founded in 2003 by Marc Peperzak as a combined farm and bottling plant situated on a sloping plain north of Denver. In 2005, this had 5300 cows. At this time, the organic standards of the new company were already causing squabbles with other organic producers. The Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group representing organic and family-scale farmers, complained to the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service about their livestock management and organic practices. In particular, it was alleged that their cows were not allowed to graze upon pasture and were instead kept in feedlots or buildings. This was said to be contrary to the National Organic Program which the AMS administers. In August 2007, Aurora was sanctioned by the United States Department of Agriculture after the agency investigated alleged violations of federal organic law. In August 2007, Aurora entered a consent agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture, and agreed not to sell as organic milk from cattle that may not have been raised organically. An agreement was reached by the USDA and Aurora which resulted in Aurora agreeing to reduce the size of its herd and provide cattle with pasture grazing during the growing season. In June 2009, a court dismissed lawsuits against Aurora, grocery chains that sold Aurora's milk, and QAI, a certification body. Cornucopia filed additional legal complaints against Aurora in 2009, claiming that Aurora does not provide sufficient grazing for its cattle, as required by regulations. According to Cornucopia, Aurora planted \\"substandard crops that are planted on an annual basis,\\" not providing sufficient year-round grazing for cattle. Aurora responded by saying that Cornucopia's new claims were identical to those that were brought up in 2007, and were summarily dismissed. In September 2012, Aurora agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over deceptive trade practices in its organic milk business.

They play in the West Coast League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The league comprises teams from Canada, Oregon, and Washington. Cowlitz calls David Story Field on the campus of Lower Columbia College home. History=2010 The Black Bears began play as an expansion team in the West Coast League in 2010. In their inaugural season, they were coached by Bryson LeBlanc and managed a record of 18 wins and 30 losses to finish tied for last in their division. The team finished fifth overall in home attendance by drawing 27,669 fans. 2011 The following season, LeBlanc returned as head coach and their record improved to 28 wins and 26 losses, placing them third in the West division. The team narrowly missed the West Coast League playoffs by losing the final game of the season. The attendance also improved to 30,102. 2012 & First Playoff Appearance Tim Matz was hired in September 2011 to replace LeBlanc as head coach after the latter left to accept a full-time college assistant coaching position. With a record of 26 wins and 28 losses, the team made their first playoff appearance by coming in second in the West division. They were eliminated in the first two games by the Corvallis Knights. 2013 The next season, Matz returned as Head coach and the Bears repeated their 2011 record with 28 wins and 26 losses, finishing fourth in the South division. 2014 The Black Bears returned with Tim Matz and had a record of 24 wins and 30 losses on the season, finishing third in the South division. The Bears had a season high overall attendance of 31,138. 2015 In September 2014, Grady Tweit was named as the team's new head coach to replace Matz who resigned the previous August. They produced a record of 21 wins and 33 losses, finishing fourth in the West division. 2016 The seventh season of Cowlitz Black Bears baseball brought the return of Grady Tweit and a new split season format in which the WCL season was split equally into two parts, with the winner from each division of each half securing a playoff berth. The 54-game league schedule was divided into a first and second half, each 27 games long. In the first half, the Bears finished third in the South division with a record of 12 wins and 15 losses. In the second half, they finished fourth with a record of 11 wins and 16 losses. They completed the entire season with a record of 23 wins and 31 losses, finishing fourth in the South division. The Cowlitz Black Bears also had the honor of hosting the 2016 West Coast League All-Star Game at David Story Field. The South claimed victory over the North, shutting them out by a score of 4-0. 2017 Cowlitz struggled the first half of their eighth season, finishing in fourth with a record of 11 wins and 16 losses. The Bears turned it around in the second half finishing in second place with a record of 16 wins and 11 losses, coming within a game of a playoff berth. For the whole season, they broke even with a record of 27 wins and 27 losses, finishing third overall. 2018 The Black Bears had a rough ninth season, finishing the first half in third with a record of 10 wins and 17 losses. They saw no improvement in the second half by again finishing third with a record of 10 wins and 17 losses. Overall, Cowlitz finished the season with a record of 20 wins and 34 losses, finishing in third for the second year in a row. 2019 & 10th Anniversary The 2019 season was the 10th Anniversary of the Cowlitz Black Bears. The Bears repeated their 2018 first half woes by finishing with a record of 10 wins and 17 losses. They kicked it up a notch in the second half, finishing with 14 wins and 13 losses. They ended their anniversary season with an overall record of 24 wins and 30 losses, landing in fifth in the South. The 2019 season would be Coach Grady Tweit's final season with the team. 2020 The 2020 season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The film relates a fictionalized account of the life of Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, a street kid in Rio de Janeiro that survived the Candel√°ria massacre and, in 2000, hijacked a bus. On September 16, 2008, the film was chosen by the Ministry of Culture as the representative of Brazil in the Oscar competition for best foreign film at the ceremony in 2009. In rigorous reconstruction of the facts, the film was set in locations of downtown Rio de Janeiro, as the Candel√°ria Church, the neighborhood of the Jardim Bot√¢nico, Tavares Bastos' favela (slum) and Curicica, over eight weeks, between July, August and September 2007.  Plot  Last Stop 174 tells the story of Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, who in 2000 hijacked Bus 174 in Jardim Bot√¢nico, a violent hijacking that has vividly stuck with Brazilians. The film opens with a woman giving her child (Alessandro) up at gunpoint to a man collecting debts. This woman soon finds religion as a means of salvation, marrying a pastor. She believes that God will help her find Sandro. However, the Sandro the woman finds is not her son ‚Äî it is another boy (Sandro do Nascimento), whose mother was murdered in front of him, prompting him to move to Rio in search of a better life. There, Sandro lived near the Candel√°ria Church, and survived the Candel√°ria massacre in 1993. The film takes the viewer through Sandro's life, showing his various run-ins with the law, his romantic life, and the charity workers that tried to help him in the favela. Despite his knowledge that the religious woman is not his mother, Sandro goes along with it anyway to have a place to live. The final thirty minutes of the film is a dramatization of the Bus 174 hijacking of 2000, showing how the events happened (including the feigned killing of the woman who wrote the lipstick messages, the death of the young teacher on the bus, and the eventual death by asphyxiation of Sandro). The final scene of the film is Sandro's adoptive mother and his friend Al√™ (whose full name is also Alessandro) at Sandro's funeral. Themes Religion/Family: Last Stop 174 invokes ideas of salvation/prevention from crime through religion and/or family. Religious imagery is frequently juxtaposed with violence, illustrating the divide in Brazil between peace and those seeking peace with those involved in violence, whether it be street kids or the police. Sandro‚Äôs adoptive mother saves herself through religion and the hope of putting her family back together. Sandro loses his footing when his mother dies, leading him to a life ridden with crime. Victims: All the characters in Last Stop 174 are victims - some are victims of Sandro and his gang, some are victims of the system. Sandro is an indirect victim of violence when gangsters murder his mother in front of him. Through becoming orphaned at a very young age, Sandro lacks guidance and runs to Rio, where he becomes a victim of a system that doesn‚Äôt care. As a homeless youth in Rio, Sandro robs and kills people, making them his victims, and indirectly, victims of the system. When Sandro holds up the bus, the lipstick woman tells Sandro that he is the only true victim of the situation, ‚Äúthe situation‚Äù being the system - he is the true victim because he is the direct victim, the hostages are only indirect victims. Prevalence of Violence: Last Stop 174 shows how common violence in Brazil is, and how it is not contained to the favelas. One instance of this is when Sandro and his friend hold up a woman who has her window open in a traffic jam. She gives Sandro what he asks for, but him and his friend shoot her anyhow, in front of a number of cars and no one does anything about it. Furthermore, when Sandro holds up the bus, the lipstick woman casually calls her boss, explaining that she‚Äôs going to be slightly late to work because she‚Äôs ‚Äújust getting mugged.‚Äù Her action of casually making a call displays how desensitized Brazilians have become to everyday violence.

Until c. 550 BC, there was probably no \\"national\\" Roman army, but a series of clan-based war-bands, which only coalesced into a united force in periods of serious external threat. Around 550 BC, during the period conventionally known as the rule of king Servius Tullius, it appears that a universal levy of eligible adult male citizens was instituted. This development apparently coincided with the introduction of heavy armour for most of the infantry. The early Roman army was based on a compulsory levy from adult male citizens that was held at the start of each campaigning season, in those years that war was declared. There were probably no standing or professional forces. During the Regal Era (to c. 500 BC), the standard levy was probably of 9,000 men, consisting of 6,000 heavily armed infantry (probably Greek-style hoplites), plus 2,400 light-armed infantry (rorarii, later called velites) and 600 light cavalry (equites celeres). When the kings were replaced by two annually-elected Consuls in c. 500 BC, the standard levy remained of the same size, but was now divided equally between the Consuls, each commanding one legion of 4,500 men. It is likely that the hoplite element was deployed in a Greek-style phalanx formation in large set- piece battles. However, these were relatively rare, with most fighting consisting of small-scale border-raids and skirmishing. In these, the Romans would fight in their basic tactical unit, the centuria of 100 men. In addition, clan-based forces remained in existence until at least c. 450 BC, although they would operate under the Consuls' authority, at least nominally. In 493 BC, shortly after the establishment of the Roman Republic, Rome concluded a perpetual treaty of military alliance (the foedus Cassianum), with the combined other Latin city-states. The treaty, probably motivated by the need for the Latins to deploy a united defence against incursions by neighbouring hill-tribes, provided for each party to provide an equal force for campaigns under unified command. It remained in force until 358 BC.  Background: early Rome (to 338 BC) = Socio-political developments  According to Roman legend, Rome was founded by Romulus in 753 BC. However, the vast amount of archaeological evidence uncovered since the 1970s suggests that Rome did not assume the characteristics of a united city-state (as opposed to a group of separate hilltop settlements) before around 625 BC. The same evidence, however, has also conclusively discredited A. Alfoldi's once- fashionable theory that Rome was an insignificant settlement until c. 500 BC (and that, consequently, the Republic was not established before c. 450 BC). There is now no doubt that Rome was a major city in the period 625-500 BC, when it had an area of c. 285 hectares and an estimated population of 35,000. This made it the second-largest in Italy (after Tarentum) and about half the size of contemporary Athens (585 hectares, inc. Piraeus).Cornell (1995) 96, 103, 203-9 Few scholars today dispute that Rome was ruled by kings in its archaic period, although whether any of the seven names of kings preserved by tradition are historical remains uncertain (Romulus himself is generally regarded as mythical). It is also likely that there were several more kings than those preserved by tradition, given the long duration of the regal era (even if it did start in 625 rather than 753 BC).Cornell (1995) 119-21 The Roman monarchy, although an autocracy, did not resemble a medieval monarchy. It was not hereditary and based on \\"divine right\\", but elective and subject to the ultimate sovereignty of the people. The king (rex, from root-verb regere, literally means simply \\"ruler\\") was elected for life by the people's assembly (the comitia curiata originally) although there is strong evidence that the process was in practice controlled by the patricians, a hereditary aristocratic caste.Cornell (1995) 245 Most kings were non-Romans brought in from abroad, doubtless as a neutral figure who could be seen as above patrician factions (somewhat like the podest√† in medieval Italian cities). Although a king's blood-relations could succeed him, they were still required to submit to election.Cornell (1995) 141‚Äì42 The position and powers of a Roman king were thus similar to those of Julius Caesar when he was appointed dictator-for-life in 44 BC and indeed of the succeeding Roman emperors. According to Roman tradition, in 616 BC, an Etruscan named Lucumo, from the town of Tarquinii, was elected king of Rome as Lucius Tarquinius I. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Servius Tullius, and then by his son, Lucius Tarquinius II. The establishment of this \\"dynasty\\" of Etruscan origin has led some dated historians to claim that late regal Rome was occupied by troops from Tarquinii militarily and culturally Etruscanised. But this theory has been dismissed as a myth by Cornell and other more modern historians, who point to the extensive evidence that Rome remained politically independent, as well as linguistically and culturally a Latin city.Cornell (1995) In relation to the army, the Cornell faction argue that the introduction of heavy infantry in the late regal era followed Greek, not Etruscan, models. It seems certain that the monarchy was overthrown in c. 500 BC and replaced by some form of collegiate rule.Cornell (1995) 226-9 It is likely that the revolution that overthrew the Roman monarchy was engineered by the patrician caste and that its aim was not, as rationalised later by ancient authors, the establishment of a democracy, but of a patrician-dominated oligarchy. The proverbial \\"arrogance\\" and \\"tyranny\\" of the Tarquins, epitomised by the rape of Lucretia incident, is probably a reflection of the patricians' fear of the Tarquins' growing power and their erosion of patrician privilege, most likely by drawing support from the plebeians (commoners). To ensure patrician supremacy, the autocratic power of the kings had to be fragmented and permanently curtailed. Thus the replacement of a single ruler by a collegiate administration, which soon evolved into two praetores (Praetors, renamed Consuls in 305 BC), with equal powers and limited terms of office (one year, instead of the life tenancy of the kings). In addition, power was further fragmented by the establishment of further collegiate offices, known to history as Roman magistrates: three Aediles and four Quaestors. Patrician supremacy was assured by restricting the eligibility to hold the Republican offices to just patricians. The establishment of a hereditary oligarchy obviously excluded wealthy non-patricians from political power and it is this class that led plebeian opposition to the early Republican settlement. The early Republic (510-338 BC) saw a long and often bitter struggle for political equality, known as the Conflict of the Orders, against the patrician monopoly of power. The plebeian leadership had the advantage that they represented the vast majority of the population and of their own growing wealth. By 338 BC, the privileges of the patricians had become largely ceremonial (such as the exclusive right to hold certain state priesthoods). But this does not imply a more democratic form of government. The wealthy plebeians who had led the \\"plebeian revolution\\" had no more intention of sharing real power with their poorer and far more numerous fellow-plebeians than did the patricians. It was probably at this time (around 300 BC) that the population was divided, for the purposes of taxation and military service, into seven classes based on an assessment of their property. The two top classes, numerically the smallest, accorded themselves an absolute majority of the votes in the main electoral and legislative assembly. Oligarchy based on birth had been replaced by oligarchy based on wealth.  External relations  Gate of the so-called \\"Servian Wall\\", Caelian Hill, Rome. The wall, made of massive tufa stone blocks, was built shortly after Rome was sacked by the Gauls in 390 BC. Several sections survive to this day It appears likely that Rome in the period 550-500 BC, conventionally known as the period that it was ruled by the Tarquin dynasty, established its hegemony over the other Latin city-states of Old Latium, which may have been required to pay tribute.Cornell (1995) 209-11 The fall of the Roman monarchy was followed by a war with the Latins, who probably took advantage of the political turmoil in Rome to attempt to regain their independence. The Romans apparently prevailed, scoring a notable victory over the Latin forces at Lake Regillus sometime between 499 and 493 BC. But instead of restoring their previous hegemony, the Romans settled for a military alliance on apparently equal terms with the Latins. According to the sources, the foedus Cassianum was a bilateral treaty between the Romans and the Latin city-states.Cornell (1995) 299 The impetus to form such an alliance was probably provided by the acute insecurity caused by a phase of migration and invasion of the lowland areas by Italic tribes occupying the mountains surrounding Old Latium, notably the Aequi and Volsci, in the period after 500 BC.Cornell (1995) 305 The new Romano-Latin military alliance proved strong enough to repel the incursions of the Italic mountain tribes, but it was a very tough struggle. Intermittent wars, with mixed fortunes, continued until c. 395 BC. The Sabines disappear from the record in 449 BC (presumably subjugated by the Romans), while campaigns against the Aequi and Volsci seem to have reached a turning point with the major Roman victory on Mount Algidus in 431 BC.Cornell (1995) 304-9 In the same period, the Romans fought three wars against their nearest neighbouring Etruscan city-state, Veii, finally reducing the city in 396 BC, probably increasing the ager Romanus (Roman territory) by c. 65%.Cornell (1995) 320 At this juncture, Rome was crushed by an invasion of central Italy by the Gallic Senones tribe. Routed in the Battle of the River Allia in 386 BC, the Roman army fled to Veii, leaving their city at the mercy of the Gauls, who proceeded to ransack it and then demand a huge ransom in gold to leave. The effects of this disaster on Roman power are a matter of controversy between scholars. The ancient authors emphasize the catastrophic nature of the damage, claiming that it took a long time for Rome to recover.Livy VI.2; Polybius II.18 Cornell, however, argues that the ancients greatly exaggerated the effects and cites the lack of archaeological evidence for major destruction and the building of the so-called \\"Servian\\" Wall as evidence that Rome recovered swiftly. The wall, whose 11 km-circuit enclosed 427 hectares (an increase of 50% over the Tarquinian city) was a massive project that would have required an estimated five million man-hours to complete, implying plentiful financial and labour resources.Cornell (1995) 318-22 Against this, Eckstein argues that the history of Rome in the fifty years subsequent to 386 BC appears a virtual replay of the previous century. There were wars against the same enemies except Veii (i.e. the Volsci, Aequi, and Etruscans) in the same geographical area, and indeed against other Latin city-states, such as Praeneste and Tibur, just 30 miles away. In addition, a treaty concluded with Carthage in c. 348 BC seems to describe Rome's sphere of control as much the same area as in a previous treaty signed in the first years of the Republic 150 years earlier: just Old Latium, and not even all of that.Eckstein (2006) 132-3 This phase of Roman history ended with the Latin War (341-338 BC). The Latin city-states, acting collectively as the Latin League, tried to withdraw from their military alliance with Rome, for fear of the latter's ever-growing political dominance. But the Romans scored a decisive victory and the Latin city-states were either annexed into Roman territory or tied into satellite status.  Army evolution  The early Roman army is shrouded by a lack of evidence. Ancient historians' accounts of the history of Rome before it was sacked by the Gauls in 386 BC (390 by Roman reckoning) are regarded as highly unreliable by modern historians. Livy, the main surviving ancient source on the early period, himself admits that the pre-386 period is very obscure and that his own account is based on legend rather than written documentation, as the few written documents that did exist in the earlier period were mostly lost in the Gallic fire.Livy VI.1  Early regal era (to c. 550 BC)  In the earliest times, when Rome still consisted of separate hilltop settlements, and into the earlier regal period until c. 550 BC, it is likely that there was no \\"Roman army\\" in the conventional sense, but war-bands based on the Roman gentes (clans), led by their clan-leaders e.g. the war-band of the Fabii, which, according to Livy numbered 306 cognati et sodales (\\"kinsmen and supporters\\") in 479 BC.Livy II.49.4 In this era, the predominant \\"warfare\\" consisted of chronic small-scale raiding and cattle- rustling against other clans and, later, neighbouring hill-tribes such as the Sabini and Aequi.Livy II.21.1 Only occasionally did the clan war-bands join together to form a larger force, in order to face a major threat from neighbouring tribes. It is likely that the heroic tales in Livy's first three books derive from old ballads celebrating such raids, orally transmitted through the generations within aristocratic clans.Fields (2007) 4-5Cornell (1995) At this time, it is likely that Roman warriors, both foot and mounted, were unarmoured, carrying only light shields and leather helmets.  Later regal era (c. 550‚Äì500 BC)  It appears that the \\"Early Roman army\\" in the sense of an organised national force with standard equipment did not become established before the period 600-500 BC, when both the ancient chroniclers and archaeology indicate major changes in organisation and equipment.Fields (2007) 5 = Infantry = The critical changes were the adoption by the infantry of Greek-style hoplite equipment, most likely borrowed from the Greek colonies of southern Italy (Magna Graecia), featuring metal body-armour; and the concomitant differentiation of the section of the citizen-body who were wealthy enough to pay for such equipment (known as the classis, or \\"class\\") from those who were not and continued to serve as unarmoured light infantry (infra classem, or \\"beneath the class\\").Goldsworthy (2000) 35 According to Livy, Romulus (traditional reign dates: 753‚Äì717 BC) raised ten centuriae (military units of 100 men) of infantry from each of the three original \\"tribes\\" of Rome which he had founded - the Ramnes, Tities and Luceres.Livy I.15, 36 (Although the Latin term tribus - literally \\"in three parts\\" - is conventionally translated as \\"tribe\\", the term \\"constituency\\" would be more precise, as they were artificial divisions for administrative purposes. The Romans always used the terms gentes or nationes to mean \\"tribes\\" in the sense of ethnic groups). But the establishment of these centuriae (and even of the tribes themselves) is probably anachronistic, and in reality dates from much later in the regal era, probably in the period 600-550 BC. The initial 30 centuriae were then doubled to 60 in the period around 550 BC, according to the scholar P. Fraccaro's interpretation of the so-called Servian centuriate organisation.Cornell (1995) 182-2 Fraccaro suggests that the Servian army consisted of a single legion of 6,000 hoplites, plus 2,400 velites (unarmoured infantry) and 600 cavalry.Cornell (1995) 181-2 Until recently, Fraccaro's thesis was not widely accepted because of Alfoldi's view of an \\"insignificant\\" early Rome, which could not have supported such a powerful army (or cavalry).Cornell (1995) 209 But with a population now estimated at 35,000 inhabitants, a regal military levy of 9,000 is plausible, and the Fraccaro interpretation has won wide acceptance among modern scholars of ancient Rome.Cornell (1995) 204-7 It implies that the \\"Servian\\" citizen-body was divided into just three property-classes for military service: patricians for cavalry service, landowning peasants for service (collectively known as the classis) as hoplites and others for service as velites (infra classem, or \\"beneath the class\\").Goldsworthy (2000) 35Fields (2007) 5 = Cavalry = Romulus supposedly established a cavalry regiment of 300 men called the Celeres (\\"the Swift Squadron\\") to act as his personal escort, with each of the three tribes supplying 100 horse. This cavalry regiment was supposedly doubled in size to 600 men by King Tarquinius Priscus (conventional dates 616-578 BC).Livy I.36 That the cavalry was increased to 600 during the regal era is likely, as in the early Republic the cavalry fielded remained 600-strong (2 legions with 300 horses each).Polybius However, according to Livy, king Servius Tullius established a further 12 centuriae of equites, a further tripling of the cavalry.Livy I.43 But this is probably anachronistic, as it would have resulted in a contingent of 1,800 horses, incongruously large since the heavy infantry was only 6,000-strong. Instead, the additional 12 centuriae were probably created at a later stage, perhaps around 400 BC, but these new units were political not military, most likely designed to admit plebeians to the Order of Knights.Cornell (1995) 193 An important question is whether the royal cavalry was drawn exclusively from the ranks of the patricians. This is certainly the mainstream view among historians, starting with Mommsen, but Cornell considers the supporting evidence tenuous.Cornell (1995) 250 If the cavalry was indeed a patrician preserve in the regal era, it probably played a critical part in the coup against the monarchy. Indeed, Alfoldi suggests that the coup was carried out by the Celeres themselves.Cornell (1995) 238, 446 note 32  Early Republic (500‚Äìc.300 BC)  According to the Fraccaro hypothesis, when the Roman monarchy was replaced by two praetores in c. 500 BC, the royal legion was divided into two (one for each praetor), each legion comprising 3,000 hoplites. The velites and cavalry were also split equally (1,200 velites and 300 cavalry each), for a total of 4,500 men.Cornell (1995) 182 This remained the normal size of a Republican legion until the end of the Social War (88 BC). However, Livy states that a legion at the time of Marcus Furius Camillus (early 4th century BC) consisted of only 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry.Livy Around 400 BC, according to Livy, important reforms were made. Pay was introduced for levies under arms, both infantry and cavalry (at 1/3 and one drachma per day respectively). Although modest, infantry pay was at least sufficient to cover food rations, clothing and miscellaneous equipment (other than weapons and armor), which until then had been borne by the soldier.Fields (2007) A seminal innovation of the young Republic was the establishment, in c. 493 BC, of an indefinite military alliance with the other city-states of Old Latium, the home of the Latin tribe, to which the Romans themselves belonged. The so-called foedus Cassianum (\\"Treaty of Cassius\\") was a mutual non-aggression and defense pact. It required all signatories to assist any of their number who was attacked with all their forces. It also appears to have provided for joint operations in the field. Judging by the provision that the Romans and Latins were to share booty on an equal basis, it is likely that the treaty required the Latins to contribute roughly the same number of troops to joint operations as Rome. It appears that allied strategy was determined by an annual conference and that command of any joint forces may have alternated between Romans and allies.Dionysius I The treaty remained in force until 358 BC and effectively doubled Rome's military potential to c. 18,000 troops, a huge size for Italian armies of the time.  Transformation into manipular Roman army (c.300‚Äì264 BC)  Scholars generally believe that the transformation of the early army into the \\"manipular\\" army of the mid- Republic took place during the Samnite Wars (which ended in 290 BC). From this time onwards, instead of fielding a phalanx for battle, the Romans deployed a series of small tactical units called manipuli (maniples), arrayed in three lines (triplex acies) in a chessboard pattern (quincunx). The maniples were basically the old centuriae, reconfigured so that those deployed in the front two lines of triplex acies were 20 men larger (120 men) and those in the rear line were reduced to 60 men each. The quincunx offered much greater flexibility and maneuvrability than the large, dense mass of a phalanx. It is believed that the Romans copied the quincunx from their adversaries, the Samnites. Other major changes occurred around this time. The demands of the struggle with the Samnites led to the doubling of the normal Roman military levy, from two to four legions. In addition, the defunct alliance (foedus Cassianum) with the other Latin cities was replaced, probably during this period, by a new military alliance embracing all the states, Latin or non- Latin, that the Romans had subdued by then (called the socii, or \\"allies\\"). Unlike the foedus, which was a multilateral treaty (or bilateral between Rome and all the other Latin states together), the new arrangements were based on bilateral treaties between Rome and each of a large number of allies. The new system was probably much more Roman-dominated than the foedus. Strategy was determined by the Roman Senate alone, joint forces were always levied and command of joint forces was to be always in Roman hands. These measures quadrupled the size of a normal consular army, from c. 5,000 to c. 20,000 men. This period is also regarded by some historians as the most likely time for the introduction of the \\"Servian\\" centuriate organization which underpinned the military levy. The period also saw the introduction of new equipment, including armour for the cavalry and chain-mail armor, the gladius (a sword of Spanish design) and the pilum (a heavy javelin) for the infantry.  Equipment  Relief of a Spartan hoplite, c. 510 BC. Detail from the Vix bronze krater, Mus√©e du Pays Ch√¢tillonnais, France Reconstruction of Greek hoplites in phalanx formation c. 480 BC On the basis of Etruscan representations, it has been widely accepted that the main early Roman infantry type was an armoured hoplite. These hoplite would probably have worn bronze helmets, breastplate and greaves and a round leather or large circular bronze-plated wooden shield. They were armed with a spear, sword and dagger.Goldsworthy (2003) According to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, whose Histories (written c. 140s BC) are the earliest substantial extant account of the Republic, Roman cavalry was originally unarmoured, wearing only a tunic and armed with a light spear and ox-hide shield which were of low quality and quickly deteriorated in action.Polybius I.  Tactics  As it appears that early Roman heavy infantry were armed as Greek-style hoplites, so it is assumed that it followed the Greek practice of fighting in a \\"phalanx\\" formation. This was a deep (eight ranks or more), densely packed formation of heavily armoured spearmen, developed in Greece in the 7th century BC. The phalanx would aim to charge and break through the enemy line. Fighting was in tight formation, stabbing with the spear. Phalanx fighting required extensive training, as holding formation was critical to success.Goldsworthy (2000) 34 Goldsworthy points out, however, that the phalanx was only suitable for large-scale set-piece battles.Goldsworthy (2000) 38 It was impractical for the small-scale raiding and skirmishing that remained the most frequent type of fighting that Rome was involved in during this period.Goldsworthy (2000) 38 Despite the establishment of a national levy in the Regal Era, aristocratic war-bands continued to play a role into the first decades of the Republic e.g. the war-band of the Fabii, which in 479 BC was charged by the praetores with guarding Roman territory against raids from the neighbouring Etruscan city of Veii (only to be ambushed by the Veientines and wiped out, supposedly leaving only one Fabius alive to perpetuate the clan).Livy II.49.4 In these minor operations, a smaller tactical unit would have been essential and there is no reason to doubt that it was the centuria. Most likely in the regal period it actually consisted of 100 men, as its name implies.Goldsworthy (2000) 35 Light infantry (velites) and cavalry would also have been important in small-scale skirmishes.

He was a personal craftsman of Peter I of Russia, and later a member of the Russian Academy of Science.  Career  From 1705 Nartov worked in the lathe workshop at the Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation in the Sukharev Tower, Moscow. During the period 1712-1725 Nartov worked in the newly founded Saint Petersburg, at the palace workshop of the Tsar Peter the Great. There he constructed many lathes of different types and made a number of innovations. Of special value was his copying lathe for the purpose of ornamental turning, which allowed the user to make ornaments with the same precision as that of handicraft work of that time. In 1718 Nartov invented what might have been the first lathe with a mechanical cutting tool-supporting carriage and a set of gears (also known as a compound rest or slide rest).Nartov's biography In 1718-1719 Nartov travelled to England and France and demonstrated his lathes. In his letters to Peter I, Nartov wrote that nowhere in Europe could he find lathe masters comparable to Russian ones. On his way back to Russia, he taught lathe-working to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I. After the death of Peter I in 1725 Nartov went to work at the Moscow Mint, where he supervised modernisation of the machinery. In 1727 Nartov wrote a book about Peter the Great, containing many interesting historic details of the scenes that Nartov witnessed when he worked at the palace workshop together with the Tsar. That book became the source of many historical anecdotes about Peter the Great. In 1735 Nartov was elected a member of the Russian Academy of Science, where he was one of the few Russians amongst many Germans and other foreigners. From 1736 to the end of his life Nartov was head of the Academy's lathe workshop. Among other inventions of Nartov are such things as a unique fast-fire battery on a rotating disc, a screw mechanism for changing the artillery fire angle, a gauge-boring lathe for cannon-making and an early telescopic sight. He also supervised the building of a device intended to lift the gigantic Tsar Bell onto a bell-tower.

Early life Wilhelm Runge was born and raised in Hannover, where his father, Carl Runge, was a well-known professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Hannover. Military service When World War I started, he was not doing well in his engineering studies and, in 1915, volunteered into the German Army. Unsuccessful in officer training, he was sent to the Western Front and the infamous trench warfare. By early 1917, he had reached the rank of Sergeant and was rescued from likely death by being selected by Lieutenant Richard Courant ‚Äì a friend of his father who later married his sister, Nina ‚Äì to go to occupied northern France and assist in developing the earth telegraph, a seismic apparatus. Education At the close of the war, Runge, now highly motivated by his adverse military experience, returned to academic studies. He eventually earned the Doctor of Engineering (Electrical) degree from the Technical University at Darmstadt, and was later in life also awarded the higher academic degree (the Habilitation) in physics from the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1923, while pursuing his academic studies, he started working at Telefunken, and in 1926, joined their development laboratory in Berlin. Nationalism In the early 1930s, Aryanization and Nationalism took a strong hold in Telefunken. While there is no evidence that Runge was personally involved in this, he was being promoted rapidly, so he must have been at least aware of the situation. If this was the case, it was ironic; Dr. Richard Courant, the man who ‚Äòsaved‚Äô him from the trenches during World War I, was himself a Jew and had to flee Germany.Reid, Constance; Courant in G√∂ttingen and New York, Springer-Verlag, 1996, pp. 65-66 Research At Telefunken‚Äôs development laboratory, Runge experimented with high-frequency transmitters and had the tube department working on cm- wavelength devices. In the summer of 1935, Runge, now Director of Telefunken‚Äôs Radio Research Laboratory, initiated an internally funded project in radio- based detection technology. A-50 cm (600-MHz) receiver and 0.5-W transmitter were built, both using Barkhausen-Kurz tubes. With the antennas placed flat on the ground some distance apart, he arranged for an aircraft to fly overhead and found that the receiver gave a strong Doppler-beat interference signal.‚ÄúTelefunken firm in Berlin reveals details of a 'mystery ray' system capable of locating position of aircraft through fog, smoke and clouds.‚Äù Electronics, September 1935 Runge, with Hans Hollmann as a consultant, then developed a 1.8-m (170-MHz) system using pulse-modulation. Wilhelm Stepp, an engineer on the research staff, designed a transmit-receive device (a duplexer) for allowing a common antenna. Stepp also code-named the system Darmstadt after his home town, starting the practice in Telefunken of naming systems after cities. The Darmstadt, with only a few watts transmitter power, was first tested in February 1936, detecting an aircraft at about 5-km (3-mi) distance. This led the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) to fund Telefunken for the development of a 50-cm (600-MHz) gun laying system, the W√ºrzburg.Runge, W.; ‚ÄúA personal reminiscence,‚Äù in Radar Development to 1945, edited by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus Ltd, 1988, p.227 Development for military uses Telefunken received a contract from the Luftwaffe in late 1938 to build the W√ºrzburg for supporting anti-aircraft guns. The transmitter had a 2-Œºs pulse width and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of about 4 kHz; the antenna used a 3-m parabolic reflector built by the Zeppelin Company. The W√ºrzburg was demonstrated to Adolf Hitler in July 1939. Runge was justifiably proud of this system; it came to be the primary mobile, gun-laying system used by the Luftwaffe and the Heer (German Army) during World War II. In early 1941, the Luftverteidigung (Air Defense) recognized the need for Funkmessger√§t on their night-fighter aircraft. The requirements were given to Runge at Telefunken, and by the summer a prototype system was tested. Code-named Lichtenstein, this was a 62-cm (485-MHz), 1.5-kW system, generally based on the technology now well established by Telefunken for the W√ºrzburg. The Lichtenstein had an excellent 200-m minimum range (important for air-to-air combat) and a 4-km maximum range. The first production models became available from Telefunken in February 1942. Aviation research In 1943, Runge was appointed to head the Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt (Aviation Research Institute) in Braunschweig. At the close of World War II in May 1945, he returned to Telefunken, which was located in the West Berlin occupied area. Here he spent the next several years in rebuilding the engineering department. In 1955, Runge was awarded the Habilitation (higher academic degree), earning him the title of Professor. Until his retirement in 1963, he established and managed the Telefunken Research Institute in Ulm.

Definition War crimes are defined as acts which violate the laws and customs of war (established by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907), or acts that are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I and Additional Protocol II.Solis, pp. 301‚Äì2 The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 extends the protection of civilians and prisoners of war during military occupation, even in the case where there is no armed resistance, for the period of one year after the end of hostilities, although the occupying power should be bound to several provisions of the convention as long as \\"such Power exercises the functions of government in such territory.\\"Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 2Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 6 The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict published by the UK Ministry of Defencehttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf uses the 1945 definition from the Nuremberg Charter, which defines a war crime as \\"Violations of the laws or customs of war. Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.\\" The manual also notes that \\"violations of the 1949 Geneva Conventions not amounting to 'grave breaches' are also war crimes.\\" The 2004 Laws of Armed Combat Manual says The 2004 publication also notes that \\"A person is normally only guilty of a war crime if he commits it with intent and knowledge.\\" The Human Rights Watch reported that the UK government sought the overseas operations bill to stop the prosecution of British soldiers for torture and other war crimes committed overseas. Under this bill the power of the attorney general, a member of the government, had more power to protect soldiers from prosecution whether with a genuine case or not. The South African War=Counterinsurgency As part of the strategy to defeat the guerrilla warfare of the Boer Commandos, farms were destroyed to prevent the Boers from resupplying from a home base. This included the systematic destruction of crops and slaughtering of livestock, the burning down of homesteads, poisoning of wells and salting of fields. Destruction of townsVentersburg= On 26 October 1900, the British justice of the peace at Ventersburg (in the former Orange Free State), William Williams, relayed a secret message to Field Marshal Lord Frederick Roberts alleging that Boer Commandos were concentrating in the village. Roberts decreed that \\"an example should be made of Ventersburg\\".John Boje (2015), An Imperfect Occupation: Enduring the South African War, University of Illinois Press. Page 93. On 28 October, Roberts issued orders to General Bruce Hamilton that all houses belonging to absent males were to be burned down. After burning down the village and its Dutch Reformed church, Hamilton posted a bulletin stating: \\"The town of Ventersburg has been cleansed of supplies and partly burnt, and all the farms in the vicinity destroyed, on account of the frequent attacks on the railway lines in the neighborhood. The Boer women and children who are left behind should apply to the Boer Commandants for food, who will supply them unless they wish to see them starve. No supplies will be sent from the railway to the town.\\"Boje (2015), page 93. On 1 November 1900, Major Edward Pine-Coffin wrote in his diary that the remaining civilian population of Ventersburg had been transported to concentration camps. He admitted to having families divided, with male and female Afrikaners sent to different locations \\"so that after the war they will have some difficulty in getting together.\\" The destruction of Ventersburg was denounced in the House of Commons by Liberal MP David Lloyd George, who said Hamilton \\"is a brute and a disgrace to the uniform he wears.\\"Packenham (1979), pages 534‚Äì535. =Louis Trichardt= On 9 May 1901, Cols. Johan William Colenbrander and H.L. Grenfell rode into Louis Trichardt ahead of a mixed force of about 600 men. In addition to Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, the force included elements of the Pietersburg Light Horse, the Wiltshire Regiment, the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC), a large force of Black South African\\" Irregulars\\", and six members of the War Office's Intelligence Department commanded by Captain Alfred James Taylor.Leach (2012), pages 2‚Äì4. Even though Louis Trichardt was \\"reeling from the annual effects of malaria\\", British and Commonwealth servicemen sacked the town and arrested an estimated 90 male residents suspected of links to the Zoutpansberg Commando.Leach (2012), page 3. On 11 May 1901, the remaining residents of Louis Trichardt, including both the Afrikaner and \\"Cape Coloured\\" populations, were ordered to evacuate the town. According to local resident E.R. Smith, British and Commonwealth servicemen helped themselves to whatever \\"curios\\" they wanted and allowed the civilian population only a short time to gather their things. The town of Louis Trichardt was then burned down by Native South African \\"Irregulars\\" under the supervision of Captain Taylor. The civilian population was force marched between 11 and 18 May to the British concentration camp at Pietersburg.Leach (2012), pages 3‚Äì5. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Taylor \\"emphatically told\\" the local Venda and Sotho communities \\"to help themselves to the land and whatever else they wanted as the Boers would not be returning after the war.\\"Leach (2012), page 7. Concentration camps Lizzie van Zyl, visited by Emily Hobhouse in a British concentration camp. As a further strategy, General Lord Kitchener ordered the creation of concentration camps ‚Äì 45 for Afrikaners and 64 for Black Africans. The National Women's Monument at Bloemfontein, South Africa, memorialises those who died in British concentration camps. According to historian Thomas Pakenham, \\"In practice, the farms of Boer collaborators got burnt too ‚Äì burnt by mistake by Tommies or in reprisal by the commandos. So Kitchener added a new twist to farm-burning. He decided that his soldiers should not only strip the farms of stock, but should take the families, too. Women and children would be concentrated in 'camps of refuge' along the railway line. In fact, these camps consisted of two kinds of civilians: genuine refugees ‚Äì that is, the families of Boers who were helping the British, or at least keeping their oath of neutrality ‚Äì and internees, the families of men who were still out on commando. The difference was crucial, for at first there were two different scales of rations: little enough in practice for the refugees, and a recklessly low scale for the internees.\\"Packenham (1991), page 577. Of the 107,000 people interned in the camps, 27,927 Boer women and children died as well as more than 14,000 Black Africans.Thomas Pakenham (1991), The Scramble for Africa, 1876‚Äì1912, Random House, New York. Pages 580-581. The Pietersburg War Crimes Trials The Boer War also saw the first war crimes prosecutions in British military history. They centered around the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC), a British Army irregular regiment of mounted rifles active in the Northern Transvaal. Originally raised in February 1901, the BVC was composed mainly of British and Commonwealth servicemen with a generous admixture of defectors from the Boer Commandos.Charles Leach (2012), The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried: A South African Version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 ‚Äì April 1902, Leach Printers & Signs, Louis Trichardt, pages xxviii-xxix. After more than a century, the ensuing courts martial remain controversial. =The Letter= On 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was secretly dispatched to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army Officer Commanding at Pietersburg. Written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former Justice of the Peace from Western Australia,Leach (2012), pages 98‚Äì101.Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, Second Series No. 18. Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town. Pages 78‚Äì82. the letter accused members of the Fort Edward garrison of six \\"disgraceful incidents\\": 1\\\\. The shooting of six surrendered Afrikaner men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at Valdezia on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains Alfred Taylor and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been carried out by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.Leach (2012), pages 17‚Äì22, 99. 2\\\\. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. Peter Handcock on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had \\"disapproved\\" of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims' wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.Leach (2012), pages 22‚Äì23, 99. 3\\\\. The revenge killing of Floris Visser, a wounded prisoner of war, near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol let by Lieut. Harry Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt. Morant had ordered his men to form a firing squad and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A coup de gr√¢ce was delivered by BVC Lt. Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at Duivelskloof on 6 August 1901.Leach (2012), pages 35‚Äì60, 100. 4\\\\. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four Dutch schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. George Witton, Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane's letter made no mention of the fact, three Native South African witnesses were also shot dead.Leach (2012), pages 61‚Äì72, 100. The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend Carl August Daniel Heese of the Berlin Missionary Society near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt. Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt. Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese's driver, a member of the Southern Ndebele people, was also killed.Leach (2012), pages 62‚Äì68, 73‚Äì82, 100. 5\\\\. The orders, given by BVC Lt. Charles H.G. Hannam, to open fire on a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire led to the deaths of two boys, aged 5- and 13-years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.Leach (2012), pages 83‚Äì86, 100. 6\\\\. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.Leach (2012), pages 87‚Äì90, 100‚Äì101. The letter then accused the Field Commander of the BVC, Major Robert William Lenehan, of being \\"privy the these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\\" After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \\"Sir, many of us are Australians who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are Africaners who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.\\"Leach (2012), page 100-101. =Arrests= In response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Col. Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \\"brought into town like criminals\\". Lt. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in Pretoria, where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.Leach (2012), pages 97‚Äì98. =Indictments= Although the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, were later destroyed by the British civil service,Leach (2012), page 104, 106. it is known that a Court of Inquiry, the British military's equivalent to a grand jury, was convened on 16 October 1901. The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the Provost Marshal of Pietersburg. The first session of the Court took place on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for a further two weeks,Leach (2012), page 105. at which time it became clear that the indictments would be as follows: 1\\\\. In what became known as \\"The Six Boers Case\\", Captains Robertson and Taylor, as well as Sgt. Maj. Morrison, were charged with committing the offense of murder while on active service.Leach (2012), page 107. 2\\\\. In relation to what was dubbed \\"The Van Buuren Incident\\", Maj. Lenahan was charged with, \\"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was his duty to make.\\"Leach (2012), page 203. 3\\\\. In relation to \\"The Visser Incident\\", Lts. Morant, Handcock, Witton, and Picton were charged with \\"While on active service committing the offense of murder\\".Leach (2012), page 105-107, 203. 4\\\\. In relation to what was incorrectly dubbed \\"The Eight Boers Case\\", Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton were charged with, \\"While on active service committing the offense of murder\\".Leach (2012), page 109, 203. In relation to the slaying of Rev Heese, Lts. Morant and Handcock were charged with, \\"While on active service committing the offense of murder\\". 5\\\\. No charges were filed for the three children who had been shot by the Bushveldt Carbineers near Fort Edward.Leach (2012), page 113. 6\\\\. In relation to what became known as \\"The Three Boers Case\\", Lts. Morant and Handcock were charged with, \\"While on active service committing the offense of murder\\". =Courts Martial= Following the indictments, Maj. R. Whigham and Col. James St. Clair ordered Bolton to appear for the prosecution, as he was considered less expensive than hiring a barrister.Davey (1987), page 123. Bolton vainly requested to be excused, writing, \\"My knowledge of law is insufficient for so intricate a matter.\\"Davey (1987), page 122. The first court martial opened on 16 January 1901, with Lieut.-Col. H.C. Denny presiding over a panel of six judges. Maj. J.F. Thomas, a Solicitor from Tenterfield, New South Wales, had been retained to defend Maj. Lenahan. The night before, however, he agreed to represent all six defendants. The \\"Visser Incident\\" was the first case to go to trial. Lt. Morant's former orderly and interpreter, BVC Trooper Theunis J. Botha, testified that Visser, who had been promised that his life would be spared, was cooperative during two days of interrogation and that all his information was later found to have been true. Despite this, Lt. Morant ordered him shot.Leach (2012), pages 54‚Äì55. In response, Lt. Morant testified that he only followed orders to take no prisoners as relayed to the late Captain Hunt by Col. Hubert Hamilton. He also alleged that Floris Visser had been captured wearing a British Army jacket and that Captain Hunt's body had been mutilated.Leach (2012), pages 105‚Äì109. In response, the court moved to Pretoria, where Col. Hamilton testified that he had \\"never spoken to Captain Hunt with reference to his duties in the Northern Transvaal\\". Though stunned, Maj. Thomas argued that his clients were not guilty because they believed that they \\"acted under orders\\". In response, Maj. Bolton argued that they were \\"illegal orders\\" and said, \\"The right of killing an armed man exists only so long as he resists; as soon as he submits he is entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.\\" The Court ruled in Maj. Bolton's favor.Leach (2012), page 110. Lt. Morant was found guilty of murder. Lts. Handcock, Witton, and Picton were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter.Leach (2012), pages 115‚Äì118, 203. =Execution= On 27 February 1902, two British Army Lieutenants ‚Äî Anglo-Australian Harry Morant and Australian born Peter Handcock of the Bushveldt Carbineers ‚Äî were executed by firing squad after being convicted of murdering eight Afrikaner POWs. This court-martial for war crimes was one of the first such prosecutions in British military history. Although Morant left a written confession in his cell, he went on to become a folk hero in modern Australia. Believed by many Australians to be the victim of a kangaroo court, public appeals have been made for Morant to be retried or pardoned. His court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a stage play, and an award-winning Australian New Wave film adaptation by director Bruce Beresford. Witton was sentenced to penal servitude, and Picton was cashiered.Australian Town and Country Journal (Sydney, NSW) 12 April 1902. https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71522700#titleModal Reaction in Britain On 1 March 1901, Lloyd George quoted a Reuters report about the lower rations given to the interned families of Boer Commandos. \\"It means,\\" declared Lloyd George, \\"that unless the fathers come in their children would be half-starved. It means that the remnant of the Boer army who are sacrificing everything for their idea of independence are to be tortured by the spectacle of their starving children into betraying their cause.\\"Packenham (1979), page 535. During the same month, Liberal MPs C.P. Scott and John Ellis dubbed them \\"concentration camps\\", after the reconcentrado camps set up by the Spanish during the Cuban War of Independence. World War I According to American historian Alfred de Zayas, both sides during the Great War \\"established, for judicial and political reasons, special commissions to investigate reported instances of war crimes by enemy forces.\\"de Zayas (1989), page 3. In contrast to their Allied counterparts, German investigators rarely publicised their findings for propaganda purposes.de Zayas (1989), pages 3‚Äì10. Furthermore, all except 11 volumes of the German Bureau's World War I archives were destroyed during the 1945 Allied bombing raids on Berlin and Potsdam.de Zayas (1989), page 325. Chemical weapons usage A World War I-era British gas bomb The production and use of chemical weapons was strictly prohibited by the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which explicitly forbade the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare. Even so, the United Kingdom used a range of poison gases, originally chlorine and later phosgene, diphosgene and mustard gas. They also used relatively small amounts of the irritant gases chloromethyl chloroformate, chloropicrin, bromacetone and ethyl iodoacetate. Gases were frequently mixed, for example white star was the name given to a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and phosgene, the chlorine helping to spread the denser but more toxic phosgene. Despite the technical developments, chemical weapons suffered from diminishing effectiveness as the war progressed because of the protective equipment and training which the use engendered on both sides. By 1918, a quarter of British artillery shells were filled with gas and the United Kingdom had produced around 25,400 tons of toxic chemicals. The British Expeditionary Force first used chemical weapons along the Western Front at the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915 and continued their usage for the remainder of the war. This was done in retaliation for the use of chlorine by Imperial German Army from April 1915. Following the Imperial German Army's use of poison gas at Ypres, the commander of II Corps, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Ferguson, had said of poison gas: Mustard gas was first used effectively in World War I by the German army against British and Canadian soldiers near Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 and later also against the French Second Army. The name Yperite comes from its usage by the German army near the town of Ypres. The Allies did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at Cambrai, France, after the armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard-gas shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard gas weapon, with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks. (The only option available to the British was the Despretz‚ÄìNiemann‚ÄìGuthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line with the Hundred Days' Offensive. =SM U-27= HMS Baralong According to the Hague Convention of 1907, it is defined as a war crime to kill unarmed enemy sailors after their ship has been sunk. Even so, after the sinking of by the German submarine SM U-20 in May 1915, Lieutenant-Commander Godfrey Herbert, commanding officer of the Q-ship HMS Baralong, was visited by two officers of the Admiralty's Secret Service branch at the Royal Navy's base at Queenstown, Ireland. He was told, \\"This Lusitania business is shocking. Unofficially, we are telling you ... take no prisoners from U-boats.\\" p. 21 Since April 1915, Herbert had ordered his subordinates cease calling him \\"Sir\\", and to address him only by the pseudonym \\"Captain William McBride.\\" p. 23 On 19 August 1915, the German submarine U-27 sighted the British freighter Nicosian, 70 nautical miles off the coast of Queenstown. Unlike the German submarine commanders who had recently sunk the Lusitania and the S.S. Arabic, the U-27's commanding officer, Kapit√§nleutnant Bernhard Wegener, decided to obey international law as codified in the Prize Rules. U-27 surfaced, stopped and boarded the Nicosian, and checked her cargo manifest. After finding the Nicosian loaded with war materiel and mules bound for the British Expeditionary Force in France, Wegener realized that the Nicosian was a legitimate target of war and allowed the Nicosian's Captain and crew to take to the lifeboats. As Wegener and his boarding party remained aboard the otherwise empty Nicosian, the Baralong arrived, flying the neutral American flag as a ruse of war. After steaming into firing range, lowering the American flag, and raising the British White Ensign in its place, Baralong's crew opened fire and sank the U-27. Twelve German sailors survived the U-27's sinking: the crews of her two deck guns and the sailors who had been on the conning tower. They swam to Nicosian and attempted to join the six-man boarding party by climbing up her hanging lifeboat fallsThe ropes by which a boat is lowered from the deck of a ship to the water and pilot ladder. In response, Herbert ordered his men to open fire with small arms on the men in the water. p. 53 p. 27 p. 301 Meanwhile, Nicosians crew were cheering wildly from the lifeboats. Captain Manning was heard to yell, \\"If any of those bastard Huns come up, lads, hit 'em with an oar!\\"Messimer 2002, p. 30. After a few German survivors managed to climb aboard the Nicosian, Herbert sent Baralongs 12 Royal Marines, under the command of a Corporal Collins, to board the sinking vessel. As they departed, Herbert ordered Collins, \\"Take no prisoners.\\"Messimer (2002) p. 42 The German sailors were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: \\"Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck ‚Äì I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezed through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head.\\"Bridgland (1999) p. 43 Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's murder, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, \\"What about the Lusitania, you bastard!\\" In Herbert's report to the Admiralty, he alleged the German survivors were trying to board and scuttle the Nicosian, so he ordered the Royal Marines on his ship to kill the survivors. The Admiralty, upon receiving the report, vainly ordered that the incident be kept secret. After the Nicosian's crew arrived at Liverpool, however, the American members of the crew gave sworn testimony to the United States Consul about the massacre of U-27's crew. After their return to the United States, they repeated their testimony to American newspapers and before a notary public at the Imperial German Consulate in New Orleans. As a result, the US State Department forwarded a formal protest by the German Empire to the British Foreign Office. The memorandum demanded that \\"Captain William McBride\\" and the crew of HMS Baralong be court-martialed and threatened to \\"take the serious decision of retribution\\" if the massacre of U-27's crew went unprosecuted. SMS U-27 with members of her crew Rather than admit that Lt.-Comm. Herbert only followed orders, the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, replied through the U.S. State Department in a textbook example of diplomatic effrontery. He wrote, \\"His Majesty's Government do not think it necessary to make any reply to the suggestion that the British navy has been guilty of inhumanity, according to the latest figures available, the number of German sailors rescued from drowning, often in circumstances of great difficulty and peril, amounts to 1,150. The German navy can show no such record ‚Äì perhaps through want of opportunity.\\"de Zayas (1989), page 8. Sir Edward further argued that the alleged massacre of U-27's unarmed sailors could be grouped with the Imperial German Navy's sinking of SS Arabic, their attack on a stranded British submarine in neutral Dutch territorial waters, and their attack on the steamship Ruel. In conclusion, Grey suggested that all four incidents be placed before a tribunal chaired by the United States Navy.Hesperides (2007) pp. 58‚Äì59 The U.S. State Department also vainly protested that the American flag had been used as a false flag, as this placed American ships in danger. Walter Hines Page, the U.S. Ambassador in London, was telegraphed by Secretary of State Robert Lansing and ordered to not ask Sir Edward Grey any questions about whether the American flag had been used in the case. \\"The fact,\\" he was told, \\"is established. The massacre of U-27's unarmed survivors and the Royal Navy's refusal to court-martial the perpetrators led the Imperial German Navy to cease adhering to the Prize Rules and to adopt unrestricted submarine warfare. During the Second World War, it was cited by Admiral Karl D√∂nitz as a reason for the Kriegsmarine to do the same. A German medal was issued commemorating the victims of the masacre. Lieutenant Commander Herbert and the crew of HMS Baralong were awarded a bounty of ¬£185 for sinking U-27.E. Keble Chatterton, (1980), Q-Ships and Their Story, Ayer Publishing. . Page 22. =SM U-41= On 24 September 1915 HMS Baralong also sank U-41, which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship Urbino. According to the two German survivors, Baralong continued to fly the American flag after opening fire on U-41 and then rammed the lifeboat carrying the German survivors, causing it to sink.Hadley, Michael L. (1995), Count Not the Dead: The Popular Image of the German Submarine, McGill-Queen's Press ‚Äì MQUP, p. 36; . The only witnesses to the second attack were the German and British sailors present. Oberleutnant zur See Iwan Crompton, after returning to Germany from a prisoner-of-war camp, reported that Baralong had run down the lifeboat he was in; he leapt clear and was shortly after taken prisoner. The British crew denied that they had rammed the lifeboat.Messimer, pp. 61‚Äì62 Crompton later published an account of U-41s exploits in 1917, U-41: der zweite Baralong-Fall (Eng: \\"The second Baralong case\\").Hadley (1995) p. 36 Baralong's new commanding officer, Lieutenant-Commander A. Wilmot-Smith, and his crew were awarded a ¬£170 bounty for sinking U-41. German Investigation of British War Crimes According to historian Alfred de Zayas, the Prussian Ministry of War established the \\"Military Bureau for the Investigation of Violations of the Laws of War\\", () on 19 October 1914. The Bureau's stated purpose was \\"to determine violations of the laws and customs of war which enemy military and civilian persons have committed against the Prussian troops and to investigate whatever accusations of this nature are made against by the enemy against members of the Prussian Army.\\"Alfred de Zayas (1989), page 5. The Military Bureau \\"had wide competence to establish facts in a judicial manner and to secure the evidence necessary for legal analysis of each case. Witnesses were interrogated and their sworn depositions taken by military judges; lists of suspected war criminals were compiled, which would probably have led to criminal proceedings if Germany had won the war. The material remained largely secret, though some excerpts from witness depositions were used in German white books.\\" By the summer of 1918, the Military Bureau had documented 355 separate incidents of violations of the laws and customs of war by British servicemen along the Western Front.Alfred de Zayas (1989), page 7. The Military Bureau also compiled a thirteen-page \\"Black List of Englishmen who are guilty of violations of the laws of war vis a vis members of the German Armed Forces\\" (). The list, which survived the Allied firebombing of Berlin and Potsdam during the Second World War, contains a total of 39 names, including \\"Captain McBride\\" of HMS Baralong. In contrast, however, nine similar lists survive of alleged French war criminals and consist of 400 names.Alfred de Zayas (1989), pages 8, 279 note 32, 325. Following the Armistice, investigation continued, particularly into crimes against German POWs, and culminated in a five volume report entitled International Law during the World War (). The report was never translated, however, and had minimal effect outside of Germany.Alfred de Zayas (1989), pages 9‚Äì10, 279 note 42. Also following the Armistice, the victorious Allies pooled their reports, compiled a joint list of alleged German war crimes, and demanded the extradition of 900 alleged war criminals for trial in France and the United Kingdom. As this proved unacceptable to the German electorate, the Government of the Weimar Republic agreed to try them domestically in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials.Alfred de Zayas (1989), pages 4‚Äì5. According to de Zayas, however, \\"Generally speaking, the German population took exception to these trials, especially because the Allies were not similarly bringing their own soldiers to justice.\\" World War II=Attack on neutral powerCrimes against enemy combatants and civiliansLooting= In violation of the Hague Conventions, British troops conducted small scale looting in Normandy following their liberation. On 21 April 1945, British soldiers randomly selected and burned two cottages in Seedorf, Germany, in reprisal against local civilians who had hidden German soldiers in their cellars. Historian Sean Longden claims that violence against German prisoners and civilians who refused to cooperate with the British army \\"could be ignored or made light of\\". =Torture of POWs= An MI19 prisoner of war facility, known as the \\"London Cage\\", was utilised during and immediately after the war. This facility has been the subject of allegations of torture. The Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre, in occupied Germany, managed by the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, was the subject of an official inquiry in 1947. It found that there was \\"mental and physical torture during the interrogations\\". = Rapes = Rape took place during the British advance towards Germany.Emsley, p. 128 During late 1944, with the army based across Belgium and the Netherlands, soldiers were billeted with local families or befriended them. In December 1944, it came to the attention of the authorities that there was a \\"rise of indecency with children\\" where abusers had exploited the \\"atmosphere of trust\\" that had been created with local families. While the army \\"attempted to investigate allegations, and some men were convicted, it was an issue that received little publicity.\\"Longden, p. 195 Rape also occurred once British forces had entered Germany. Many rapes involved alcohol or post-traumatic stress, but there were also instances of premeditated attacks. For example, on a single day in April 1945, three women in Neustadt am R√ºbenberge were raped. In the village of Oyle, near Nienburg, two soldiers attempted to coerce two girls into a nearby wood. When they refused, one was grabbed and dragged into the woods. When she began to scream, in according to Longden, \\"one of the soldiers pulled a gun to silence her. Whether intentionally or in error the gun went off hitting her in the throat and killing her.\\" Sean Longden highlights that \\"Some officers failed to treat reports of rape with gravity.\\" He provides the example of a medic, who had a rape reported to him. In cooperation with the Royal Military Police, they were able to track down and apprehend the perpetrators who were then identified by the victim. When the two culprits \\"were taken before their CO. His response was alarming. He insisted since the men were going on leave no action could be taken and that his word was final.\\" =Bombing of Dresden= The city centre of Dresden after the bombing The British, with other allied nations (mainly the U.S.) carried out air raids against enemy cities during World War II, including the bombing of the German city of Dresden, which killed around 25,000 people. While \\"no agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument governing the protection of the civilian population or civilian property\\" from aerial attack was adopted before the war, the Hague Conventions did prohibit the bombardment of undefended towns. The city, largely untouched by the war had functioning rail communications to the Eastern front and was an industrial centre. Allied forces inquiry concluded that an air attack on Dresden was militarily justified on the grounds the city was defended.USAF Historical Division When asked whether the bombing of Dresden was a war crime, British historian Frederick Taylor replied: \\"I really don't know. From a practical point of view, rules of war are something of a grey area. It was pretty borderline stuff in terms of the extent of the raid and the amount of force used.\\" Historian Donald Bloxham claims that \\"the bombing of Dresden on 13‚Äì14 February 1945 was a war crime\\". He further argues that there was a strong prima facie for trying Winston Churchill among others and that there is theoretical case that he could have been found guilty. \\"This should be a sobering thought. If, however it is also a startling one, this is probably less the result of widespread understanding of the nuance of international law and more because in the popular mind 'war criminal', like 'paedophile' or 'terrorist', has developed into a moral rather than a legal categorisation.\\"Addison, Paul & Crang, Jeremy A. (eds). Firestorm: The Bombing of Dresden. Pimlico, 2006; . Chapter 9, p. 180 The bombing of Dresden has been politicised by Holocaust deniers and pro-Nazi polemicists‚Äîmost notably by the British writer David Irving in his book The Destruction of Dresden‚Äîin an attempt to establish a moral equivalence between the war crimes committed by the Nazi government and the killing of German civilians by Allied bombing raids. War crimes at seaUnrestricted submarine warfare= On 4 May 1940, in response to Germany's intensive unrestricted submarine warfare, during the Battle of the Atlantic and its invasion of Denmark and Norway, the Royal Navy conducted its own unrestricted submarine campaign. The Admiralty announced that all vessels in the Skagerrak, were to be sunk on sight without warning. This was contrary to the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty. = Shootings of shipwreck survivors = According to Alfred de Zayas, there are numerous documented cases of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force deliberately firing upon shipwreck survivors.de Zayas (1990), pp. 245‚Äì260. In July 1941, the submarine HMS Torbay, under Lieutenant Commander Anthony Miers, was based in the Mediterranean where it sank several German ships. On two occasions, once off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt, and the other off the coast of Crete, the crew fired upon shipwrecked German sailors and troops. Miers made no attempt to hide his actions, and reported them in his official logs. He received a strongly worded reprimand from his superiors following the first incident. Mier's actions violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances. = Attacks against non-combatant ships = On 10 September 1942, the Italian hospital ship Arno was torpedoed and sunk by RAF torpedo bombers north-east of Ras el Tin, near Tobruk. The British claimed that a decoded German radio message intimated that the vessel was carrying supplies to the Axis troops. Arno was the third Italian hospital ship sunk by British aircraft since the loss of the Po in the Adriatic Sea to aerial torpedoes on 14 March 1941 and the bombing of the California off Syracuse on 11 August 1942. On 18 November 1944, the German hospital ship T√ºbingen was sunk by two Beaufighter bombers off Pola, in the Adriatic Sea. The vessel had paid a brief visit to the allied-controlled port of Bari to pick up German wounded under the auspices of the Red Cross; despite the calm sea and the good weather that allowed a clear identification of the ship's Red Cross markings, it was attacked with rockets nine times. Six crewmembers were killed. American author Alfred M. de Zayas identifies the sinking of T√ºbingen and other German hospital ships as war crimes. Malaya On 12 December 1948, during the Malayan Emergency, the Batang Kali massacre took place which involved the killing of 24 villagers. Six of the eight British soldiers involved were interviewed under caution by detectives. They corroborated accounts that the villagers were unarmed, were not insurgents nor trying to escape, and had been unlawfully killed on the order of the two sergeants in command. The sergeants denied the allegations. The Government's position was that if anyone is to be held responsible, it should be the Sultan of Selangor. As part of the Briggs' Plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs, 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya's population) were eventually removed from the land, had tens of thousands of their homes destroyed, and were interned in 450 guarded fortified camps called \\"New Villages\\". The intent of this measure was to inflict collective punishments on villages where people were deemed to be aiding the insurgents and to isolate the population from contact with insurgents. The British also tried to win the hearts of the internees by providing them with education and health services as well as piped water and electricity within the villages. This practice was prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and customary international law which stated that the destruction of property must not happen unless rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. Kenya=Treatment of detainees During an eight-year conflict in Kenya from 1952 to 1960 in which Britain sought to restore order many Kikuyu were relocated. According to David Anderson, the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels. It was found out that over half of them executed were not rebels at all. Thousands more were killed by British soldiers, who claimed they had \\"failed to halt\\" when challenged. Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was Hussein Onyango Obama, the grandfather of former U.S. President Barack Obama. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated. In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to the governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is \\"distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia\\". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, \\"vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys\\", and it was important that \\"those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate\\". He also reminded the governor that \\"If we are going to sin,\\" he wrote, \\"we must sin quietly.\\" Chuka massacre The Chuka massacre, which happened in Chuka, Kenya, was perpetrated by members of the King's African Rifles B Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on 13 June 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the Kikuyu Home Guard ‚Äì a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight a guerrilla enemy. Hola massacre The Hola massacre was an incident at a detention camp in Hola, Kenya. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded \\"closed camp\\". This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial \\"rehabilitation process\\" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action ‚Äì as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.Maloba, Wunyabari O. Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of a Peasant Revolt.(Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN: 1993) pp. 142‚Äì43. All of the surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries. The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability. War on Terror In November 2019, BBC News reported that the British government and military were accused of covering up the killing and torture of civilians and children during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Leaked documents allegedly contain evidence implicating British troops in killing children and the torture of civilians in these regions. The Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated British war crimes in Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated the same in Afghanistan, were dismantled by the British government in 2017 after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who took more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he had paid people in Iraq to find clients. Some former IHAT and Operation Northmoor investigators said Shiner‚Äôs actions were used as an excuse to close down the inquiries. No case investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor led to a prosecution. An IHAT detective told Panorama: \\"The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn‚Äôt wriggle their way out of it\\". Investigators said they found evidence of murders by an SAS soldier, as well as deaths in custody, beatings, torture and sexual abuse of detainees by members of the Black Watch. A senior SAS commander was found to have covered up the crimes committed by soldiers under his command. Corporal Donald Payne a former soldier of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment of the British Army who became the first member of the British armed forces to be convicted of a war crime under the provisions of the International Criminal Court Act 2001. He was jailed for one year and dismissed from the army. In June 2020, Johnny Mercer said that Operation Northmoor had been completed and no more British troops would be prosecuted over alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Afghanistan War In September 2013, Royal Marines Sergeant Alexander Blackman, formerly of Taunton, Somerset, was convicted at court martial of having murdered an unarmed, wounded Taliban insurgent in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. On 6 December 2013, Sgt. Blackman received a sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum of ten years before being eligible for parole. He was also dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines. In April 2017, following an appeal that saw his conviction reduced to manslaughter, Blackman was released from prison having served 3 years of his sentence.

The academy was established in 1670 by Richard Frankland M.A. (Christ's College,Cambridge), 1670 and which was carried on, in spite of much persecution and many changes on venue of the academy, for nearly 30 years. Preparations Efforts were being made by the nonconformists of the north to secure the educational advantages offered for a short time by the Durham College. William Pell, who had been a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and a tutor at Durham, declined to start an academic institution, holding himself precluded by his graduation oath from resuming collegiate lectures outside the ancient universities. Application was then successfully made to Frankland, who was not hindered by the same scruple. Nonconformist tutors usually understood the oath as referring to prelections in order to a degree. Beginnings Early in March 1669 Frankland began to receive students at Rathmell. His first student was George, youngest son of Sir Thomas Liddell, bart., of Ravensworth Castle, Durham, head of a family distinguished for its loyalty, though marked by puritan leanings. Some of Frankland's students were intended for the legal, others for the medical profession; his first divinity students belonged to the independent denomination. It was not till the Royal Declaration of Indulgence of 1672, from which Edward Stillingfleet dates the presbyterian separation, that divinity students connected with that body were sent to Rathmell, and the earliest nonconformist ‚Äòacademy‚Äô (as distinct from a mere school) became an important institution and the model of others. In the first four years he received 15 pupils, six of whom became nonconformist ministers. The course of studies in this ‚Äònorthern academy‚Äô included ‚Äòlogic, metaphysics, somatology, pneumatology, natural philosophy, divinity, and chronology.‚Äô The lectures were in Latin, and given by Frankland until he had trained up assistants, among whom were John Issot, Richard Frankland (the tutor's son) and John Owen. The discipline of the house was strict, but Frankland always succeeded in gaining the confidence of his students, and maintained his authority with ‚Äòadmirable temper.‚Äô Morning prayers were at seven, winter and summer; lectures were over by noon, but solitary study went on after dinner till six o'clock prayers, and supper was followed by discussion of the day's work, unhampered by the tutor's presence. Those who wished to graduate went on to Scotland, where they were promoted to a degree after one session's attendance. The total number of Frankland's students was 304; among the best known of his divinity students are William Tong (entered 2 March 1681), Joshua Bayes and John Evans, D.D. (entered 26 May 1697), leaders of the presbyterian interest in London. John Disney (1677‚Äì1730) entered as a law student on 5 July 1695. The ministry of dissent in the north of England was chiefly recruited from Frankland's academy, as the ejected of 1662 gradually died out. James Wood minister of Chowbent Chapel was a student of the academy. Migrations The academy underwent six migrations from place to place. From Rathmell it moved to Natland, near Kendal, in Westmoreland, in early 1674. Early in 1683 the enforcement of the Five Mile Act compelled him to leave Natland as being too near to Kendal. He transferred his academy to Calton Hall, the seat of the Lamberts, in the parish of Kirkby Malham, West Yorkshire, and in 1684 to Dawson Fold in Westmoreland, just outside the five- miles radius from Kendal. In 1685 (a year in which two of his former students were imprisoned at York, and the only year in which his academy received no accessions) he retired to Hart Barrow, near to Cartmel Fell, just inside the Lancashire border, and so convenient for escaping a writ for either county. Late in 1686 Frankland availed himself of James II's arbitrary exercise of the dispensing power by taking out a fifty shilling dispensation, and removed to Attercliffe, a suburb of Sheffield, Yorkshire. He left Attercliffe at the end of July 1689, in consequence of the death of his favourite son, and returned to Rathmell. His pupil Timothy Jollie, independent minister at Sheffield, began another academy at Attercliffe on a more restricted principle than Frankland's, excluding mathematics ‚Äòas tending to scepticism.‚Äô Troubles Frankland carried his academy with him back to Rathmell, and during the remaining nine years of his life he admitted nearly as many students as in the whole previous period of over nineteen years. His congregation also throve, and he maintained harmony among its members at a time when many were beginning to relax their hold of the Calvinism to which he himself adhered. But while the Toleration Act of 1689 protected him as a preacher, hardly a year passed without some fresh attempt on the part of the authorities to put down his academy. In 1692 the clergy of Craven petitioned archbishop John Sharp to suppress the academy. Sharp wrote to John Tillotson for advice. Tillotson evidently did not like the business, and suggested to Sharp (14 June 1692), as ‚Äòthe fairest and softest way of ridding‚Äô his ‚Äòhands of‚Äô it, that he should see Frankland and explain that the objection to licensing his academy was not based upon his nonconformity. His school was not required in the district, and it was contrary to the bishop's oath to license public instruction in ‚Äòuniversity learning.‚Äô Edmund Calamy states that his troubles continued till the year of his death, but no further particulars are available. Oliver Heywood's diaries are full of references to the academy and its students, and to Frankland's labours at ordinations.

She appears twice in the records of the Arval Brethren as Mater Larum, elsewhere as Mania and Larunda. Ovid calls her Lara, Muta (the speechless one) and Tacita (the silent one).Taylor, 301: citing \\"Mania\\" in Varro, Lingua Latina, 9, 61; \\"Larunda\\" in Arnobius, 3, 41; \\"Lara\\" in Ovid, Fasti II, 571 ff: Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1, 7, 34-5; Festus, p115 L. Arval rite Cult to Matres Larum is known through the fragmentary Arval rites to Dea Dia, a goddess of fruitfulness. The Arvals address Dia herself as Juno Dea Dia, which identifies her with the supreme female principle. The mother of the Lares is addressed only as Matres Larum; she is given a sacrificial meal (cena matri Larum) of puls (porridge) contained in a sacred, sun-dried earthenware pot (olla). Prayers are recited over the pot, which is then thrown from the temple doorway, down the slope on which the temple stands; thus, remarks Lily Ross Taylor,Taylor, Lilly Ross, \\"The Mother of the Lares\\", American Journal of Archaeology, 29.3, (July - September 1925), pp 299 - 313. towards the earth as a typically chthonic offering. On another occasion, the Arvals offer sacrificial recompense to various deities for a necessary pollution of Dia's sacred grove; the Mater Larum is given two sheep.Beard et al, vol. 2, 151: section 6.2: CIL VI.2107, 2-13: ILS 5048. The grove was polluted by the use of iron tools when clearing up after a storm and lightning-strike. Iron was strictly forbidden in the sacred area. The Arvals also invoke her children, in the opening lines of the Arval Hymn to Dia, which begins enos Lases iuvate (\\"Help us, Lares\\").Taylor, 299. Festivals The Mater Larum may have been offered cult with her Lares during the festival of Larentalia as she was, according to Macrobius (floruit 395 - 423 AD),Macrobius, Saturnalia I, 7, 35. during Compitalia. OvidOvid, Fasti. poetically interprets what may be a variant of her rites at the fringes of the Feralia: an old woman squats among a circle of younger women and sews up a fish-head. She smears this with pitch then pierces and roasts it; this, she says, binds hostile tongues to silence. She thus invokes Tacita (silence). If, as Macrobius proposes, the Lemures are unsatiated and malevolent forms of Lares, then they and their mother also find their way into Lemuralia, when the vagrant and malicious Lemures and (perhaps) Larvae must be placated by midnight libations of spring-water and offerings of black beans, spat from the mouth of the paterfamilias to the floor of the domus. Again, Taylor notes the chthonic character of offerings made to fall - or deliberately expelled - towards the earth. Varro (116 BC ‚Äì 27 BC) believes that she and her children were originally Sabine and names her as Mania; the name is used by later Roman authors with the general sense of an \\"evil spirit\\". In the late 2nd century AD, according to Festus, nursemaids use the name of Mania to terrify children. Macrobius applies it to the woolen figurines (maniae) hung at crossroad shrines during Compitalia, thought to be substitutions for ancient human sacrifice once held at the same festival and suppressed by Rome's first consul, L. Junius Brutus.Taylor, 302: whatever the truth regarding this sacrifice and its abolition, the Junii held ancestor cult during Larentalia rather than the usual Parentalia even in the 1st century BC. Myth The only known mythography attached to Mater Larum is little, late and poetic: again, the source is Ovid, Fasti, II.571ff who identifies her as a once-loquacious nymph, Lara, her tongue cut out for betrayal of Jupiter's secret amours. Lara thus becomes Muta (speechless) and is exiled from the daylight world to the underworld abode of the dead (ad Manes); a place of silence (Tacita). She is led there by Mercury and impregnated by him en route. Her offspring are as silent or speechless as she.Link to Latin text of Ovid's Fasti II at the latinlibrary.com Nature If their mother's nature connects the Lares to the earth they are, according to Taylor, spirits of the departed and their mother a dark or terrible aspect of Tellus (Terra Mater).Taylor, 300-301; Wiseman, 71, is more oblique and suggests that the Lemuria might represent Lara's \\"bitterness at the cruelty of her treatment\\". The Lares and the Mater Larum have been suggested as ancient Etruscan divinities; the title or forename Lars, used by Rome's Etruscan kings has been interpreted as \\"king\\", \\"overlord\\" or \\"leader\\".See Lars Porsenna: \\"When Porsenna, Lars (lord) of Clusium, in Etruria, had reached with his army the Ja-nic'u-lum, just across the Tiber from Rome... (John Jacob Anderson, A complete course in history: new manual of general history 1893:pt I, 190 ). Greek authors offered \\"heroes\\" and \\"daimones\\" as translations for Lares and Plautus employs a Lar Familiaris where Menander's Greek original has a heroon (hero-shrine).Weinstock, 114-18, proposes the equivalence of \\"lar\\" and Greek hero, based on his gloss of a 4th century BC inscription from Latium as a dedication to the Roman ancestor-hero Aeneas as Lare (Lar).

It has a height of and 20 stories, with a restaurant called 360 featuring 360-degree panoramic views of Oklahoma City on its top floor. Founders Tower was the second building in the nation to have a revolving restaurant--the first being at the Space Needle, though the restaurant no longer revolves.

In addition to creating the distinctive zigzag pattern of the building's crown, it enabled the 20th floor to be free of load-bearing columns. The 20th floor includes the tower's restaurant space, which houses The George Prime Steakhouse as of 2013. The restaurant no longer revolves. The design of Founders Tower is representative of the Googie, also called \\"Populuxe\\", architectural style prevalent at a time when much of the United States was enamored with spaceflight. It was, also, largely influenced by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington. Because the available offices in Founders Tower \\"were small, awkward--and shaped like slices of pie\\" as a consequence of its circular design, it could have only been used for \\"small, low-rent\\" offices That layout and the presence of balconies, something that was irrelevant in an office setting, made it suitable, however, as a residential building.  History  The United Founders Life Tower was built by the real estate development arm of the United Founders Life Insurance Corporation. In addition to being the primary tenants of the skyscraper, the company expected to profit from the development of the mostly rural land surrounding the tower. When it was completed in 1964, the Founders Tower was the first skyscraper to be built in Oklahoma City outside of downtown. Its relatively isolated location in northwestern Oklahoma City and its unusual design spurred the development of the area. At the time the Space Needle inaugurated the first revolving restaurant in the United States at the World's Fair in Seattle, the design of Founders Tower was the first one changed to incorporate its own revolving restaurant in the United States. Founders Tower is one of only three office buildings in the U.S. to include a revolving restaurant. It was purchased by 1978 by Northwest Investors Limited for $15.5 million; Northwest Investors also received a $5.8 million loaned at the same time. The building was sold in 1981 for $11.1 million to California-based National Capitol Real Estate Trust in 1981, with Northwest Investors retaining 25 percent ownership. The building was certified as a nuclear fallout shelter by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1983. United Founders foreclosed on Founders Tower in 1986 after National Capitol defaulted on loan payments for the remaining $4.92 million. It was sold at sheriff's sale on November 5, 1986 to the Protective Life Insurance Corporation, the parent company of United Founders. The tower was sold on April 24, 1989 to the U.S.-Swedish investment group, Growth Fund International Limited for $2.5 million. In 1996, Founders Tower was sold to Hebron Corporation, a subsidiary of the long-distance calling provider AmeriVision, for $3.3 million. In 2005, Founders Tower was purchased, along with of surrounding land, for $4.6 million by the Bridgeport Development Group. The next year, a $50 million renovation, to convert the office building into condominiums and to reverse the 15 years of neglect from the constant buying-and-selling by out-of-state investors, was announced. At the same time, the building was renamed \\"The 360 at Founders Plaza\\", a reference to the view from the building and its revolving restaurant. During the renovations from 2007 to 2008, the building's original, darkly-tinted, glass panes were replaced with modern, energy-efficient, turquoise-colored glass. The building's name was returned to Founders Tower in January 2010. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 15, 2013.

Historians sometimes render his name as Alexander Thomas McCormick, likely confusing him with his brother Alexander Hugh McCormick, but his tombstone reads \\"Andrew Thomas McCormick\\". Early years McCormick was born in County Donegal in Ireland in 1761. He was brought up as a Presbyterian. He came to the United States and became an Episcopalian. He was made a deacon by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Thomas John Claggett, Bishop of Maryland, on June 15, 1794. The date he was ordained as a priest is not on record.The correspondence of John Henry Hobart, by John Henry Hobart, pages 226-7 Ministry McCormick became assistant rector in Queen Anne Parish, (St. Barnabas Church (Upper Marlboro, Maryland)), Prince George's County, Maryland. In 1796, he took charge of a classical school in the new city of Washington, D.C. prior to the creation of a public school system. The Rev. George Ralph, his predecessor in the school, had recently resigned to take charge of the newly organized parish of Washington, known as Christ Church, Washington Parish.A History of the National Capital from Its Foundation, Volume 1, 1914, by Wilhelmus Bogart Bryan, page 301 In 1798, Mr. McCormick helped Ralph establish the first Episcopal Church in Washington, Christ Church, and became assistant at it. It was opened in a converted barn. Many notable early residents attended services there, including Presidents Jefferson and John Quincy Adams. On May 4, 1806, he was elected rector, a position he would continue to fill through 1823.Washington's First Parish, Christ Church, 1956 In 1807, the church moved to a larger brick structure near the Navy Yard. John Quincy Adams was a Unitarian, not an Episcopalian, but decided while Secretary of State to go to Christ Church. The reason, he wrote in his diary in 1819, was that its rector, Andrew McCormick, was the only preacher in town worth hearing. I have at last given the preference to Mr. McCormick, of the Episcopal Church, Adams noted in the entry for October 24, and spoke to him last week for a pew.Christ Church, Washington Parish, A Brief History, by Nan Robertson, 1994, page 3 During this period, McCormick served as Chaplain of the Senate (1804‚Äì1805 and 1807‚Äì1808). Later years McCormick served on the board of trustees of Washington's Eastern Free School, one of only two schools in the city, from 1802 to 1816 and as its president from 1816 to 1841 and was credited with the school's survival. His nephew Hugh was the teacher at the school from 1825 to 1844. McCormick died in 1841 at age of 80. The McCormick School located on the east side of the 1200 block of 3rd St., SE and opened in 1870 was either named for him or for his nephew Hugh. It was closed in 1909 and torn down around 1915.

Because the law passed on 31 January 1901 creating an insular police did not apply to towns with a population over 6,000 inhabitants, the enforcement work of the insular police in Ponce was limited to work at the Jail for the Second District located in Ponce, not to the municipality of Ponce proper.

It is extended to the east by the rue Marc Bloch then the route de Vienne. It was named after the presence of several university buildings, built from 1884 until the late nineteenth century. History In the Ancient history, the street seems already exist. From the east, perhaps from the ancient city of Vienna, it ended on the Rh√¥ne where it is possible that there was a bridge. Once the river crossed, the street ended in the district of Canabae, the current peninsula, before reaching the high city of Lugdunum, the ancient city of Lyon. This can be testified by cippi mausoleums or burial found in this area due to the presence of a Roman necropolis located around the access road to the city. A hypothetical layout can be found noting that three discoveries are aligned under the street, respectively, in the rue de Marseille, rue S√©bastien Gryphe and Place de la Madeleine. Thus, in 1870, Acceptius' tomb was found under the Citro√´n garage and in July 1943, four blocks including ancient basis of a cippus and its pyramidion were found at number 33, rue de l'Universit√©. The street was no longer used when the Roman Empire fell. In 1180, the tower of B√©chevelin was built by John 1st of Bellesme (or Jean Fair Hands), Archbishop of Lyon. It is located near the Place Dep√©ret and the Pont de l'Universit√©, which led several authors to imagine that the first bridge over the Rh√¥ne, which appeared in several texts would be located, not that of the rue de la Guilloti√®re, but that of the rue de l'Universit√©. The base of the tower is visible on a 1550 scenographic plan and would have been only partly destroyed when Protestant troops left the place in 1561. The ruins of the tower were visible up to half of the nineteenth century. The street was formerly named Rue Bouchardy, as Andr√© Bouchardy lived in the cour du Soleil and the drawing of the street crossed over his house. It received its current name after the deliberation of the municipal council on 17 June 1902. The eastern part of the street, from the rue Jean-Jaur√®s, became the rue Marc- Bloch in 1945. It took its first form in the late 19th century with the construction of university buildings to the south, then that of the north in the early 20th century. The eastern part was open in the early 20th century by the demolition and a broadening. Architecture The street starts with a wide part between the two gray stone big facades of the universities, then widens again after the rue Pasteur with workshops and a two-floor large square building. After the rue Gryphe and the Place Prado, it becomes a common avenue with two rows of buildings, high at north, more diverse and lower at south. The Citro√´n garage was built in 1930.

Johann August Zeune  Life  Zeune was born on 12 May 1778 in Lutherstadt Wittenberg as the son of Johann Karl Zeune, professor of Greek at the University of Wittenberg. In his parents' house, he was educated by his father and tutor. In 1798 Zeune started studying at the Wittenberg University enrolled. He graduated with his thesis on the history of geography, and was awarded for a short time the dignity of an academic faculty, as a Quasi-professor of Geography. His novel ‚ÄûH√∂henschichten-Karte‚Äù \\"Topological map\\" of the earth, had made him famous in academic circles. In 1803, he moved to Berlin and became a teacher at the Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (gray convent school). In Berlin, where he lived as a scholar, he was on friendly terms with Johann Gottlieb Fichte and the historian Johannes von M√ºller. He applied unsuccessfully for an expedition into the interior of Africa, and shortly thereafter went into the \\"inner world of the blind\\". In the field of ophthalmology Zeune expanded his knowledge to the founder of the first European foundation for the Blind, Valentin Ha√ºy in Paris. King Frederick William III decreed on 11 August 1806 to create a foundation for the blind in Berlin. Zeune was offered that job. On 13 October the same year he was able to start classes. It was the first blind school in Germany. With money from friends and his own fortune, he saved the school by the time of distress. Johann August Zeune was a professor of geography in 1810 in Berlin. From 1811 to 1821 he lectured at the University of Berlin also about German language and literature. Educational skills were presented in his Manual of Education of the Blind \\"Belisarius\\" (1808) and the work \\"Gea. Attempt at a scientific geography\\" (1808). After the French occupation, he joined as a political journalist of decidedly patriotic stance. As a Germanist, Zeune stood under the spell of romantic notions. He fought against the usage of foreign words and worked on the publication of the Nibelungenlied; of which he published a prose translation (1813) and a paperback edition (1815). August Zeune died on 14 November 1853 in Berlin, after he had lost his eyesight in old age. He was buried at the Berlin St. George's Cemetery in the Greifswald Street 229/234. In his honor, the Johann August Zeune School for the Blind in Berlin-Steglitz and the Zeunepromenade where named after him (see Rothenburg (Berlin)).

A further aim of the METAFOR project is to ensure the wide adoption of the CIM. METAFOR is optimizing the way climate data infrastructures are used to store knowledge, thereby adding value to primary research data and information, and providing an essential asset for the numerous stakeholders actively engaged in climate change issues (policy, research, impacts, mitigation, private sector). METAFOR has created tools for practical use of the CIM, e.g., the CMIP5 questionnaire for input and creation of CIM documents. External groups, e.g., the Earth Systems Grid, are also writing tools for CIM content. METAFOR and the CMIP5 metadata questionnaire METAFOR was tasked by the World Climate Research Programme to produce the metadata for the 5th Coupled model intercomparison project, an international experiment involving multiple general circulation models that will serve as a basis for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. The CMIP5 questionnaire is an ambitious metadata collection tool and will help scientists to provide the most comprehensive metadata of any climate model inter-comparison project.

Per Google Books, retrieved 16 October 2010. *Walt Whitman (1819‚Äì1892): \\"Conceived out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism‚Äîonly one of the 'wolfish earls' so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works\\". *George Greenwood (1850‚Äì1928), lawyer and first president of the Shakespeare Fellowship, an anti-Stratfordian organization. *Sir Tyrone Guthrie (1900‚Äì1971) ‚Äì Anglo-Irish theatrical director and writer. First Artistic Director of the Stratford Festival of Canada. *Sir Charles Chaplin (1889‚Äì1977): \\"In the work of the greatest geniuses, humble beginnings will reveal themselves somewhere but one cannot trace the slightest sign of them in Shakespeare.... Whoever wrote [Shakespeare] had an aristocratic attitude\\". *Sir John Gielgud (1904‚Äì2000), actor, signatory to a petition requesting the Shakespeare Society of America to \\"engage actively in a comprehensive, objective and sustained investigation of the authorship of the Shakespeare Canon.\\" *Hugh Trevor-Roper (1914‚Äì2003), historian: \\"The available evidence that the plays and poems were the work of William Shakespeare of Stratford is weak and unconvincing\\". *William James (1842‚Äì1910), psychologist and philosopher: \\"The absolute extermination and obliteration of every record of Shakespeare save a few sordid material details, and the general suggestion of narrowness and niggardliness which ancient Stratford makes, taken in comparison with the way in which the spiritual quantity 'Shakespeare' has mingled into the soul of the world, was most uncanny, and I feel ready to believe in almost any mythical story of the authorship. In fact a visit to Stratford now seems to me the strongest appeal a Baconian can make.\\"Attributed on the declaration website to a letter to Charles Eliot Norton, 2 May 1902 *Sigmund Freud (1856‚Äì1939): \\"I no longer believe that ... the actor from Stratford was the author of the works that have been ascribed to him.\\" *Clifton Fadiman (1904‚Äì1999), noted intellectual, author, radio and television personality. Graduate of Columbia University, chief editor at Simon & Schuster): \\"Count me a convert‚Ä¶ This [book's] powerful argument should persuade many rational beings, who, well acquainted with the plays, have no vested interest in preserving a rickety tradition.\\" *John Galsworthy (1867‚Äì1933), English novelist and playwright, winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize for literature. Best known for The Forsyte Saga and its sequels. Charles Wisner Barrell said that the late Galsworthy described Oxfordian J. Thomas Looney's Shakespeare Identified as \\"the best detective story\\" he had ever read. No such contemporary quotation by Galsworthy has been found.Posthumously attributed to Galsworthy in Charles Wisner Barrell (1 May 1937). \\"Elizabethan Mystery Man\\". Saturday Review of Literature, 16 (1): 11‚Äì15, p. 11. *Mortimer J. Adler (1902‚Äì2001), Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Just a mere glance at [his] pathetic efforts to sign his name (illiterate scrawls) should forever eliminate Shakspere from further consideration in this question ‚Äì he could not write.\\" \\"Academics err in failing to acknowledge the mystery surrounding 'Shake-speare's' identity ‚Ä¶ They would do both liberal education and the works of 'Shake-speare' a distinguished service by opening the question to the judgment of their students, and others outside the academic realm.\\"Attributed on the declaration website to a letter to Max Weismann, Director, Center for the Study of The Great Ideas, 7 November 1997 *Paul Nitze (1907‚Äì2004), High-ranking U.S. government official; co-founder of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

If I had to rule on the evidence presented, it would be in favor of the Oxfordians\\". *Lewis F. Powell Jr. (1907‚Äì1998), Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1972 to 1987: \\"I have never thought that the man of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the plays of Shakespeare. I know of no admissible evidence that he ever left England or was educated in the normal sense of the term.\\"  Included with caveats  *Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803‚Äì1882) is included on the list along with an incomplete quotation that is interpreted as a statement of doubt: \\"Other admirable men had led lives in some sort of keeping with their thought, but this man in wide contrast\\". However, Emerson did not doubt Shakespeare's authorship, nor did he ever make a statement to that effect.Churchill, 1959, pp. 68, 207 In 2015, a caveat was added to his name on the list. *Orson Welles (1915‚Äì1985) is included on the list on the basis of a comment taken from a collection of Kenneth Tynan interviews: \\"I think Oxford wrote Shakespeare. If you don't agree, there are some awfully funny coincidences to explain away\\". In other interviews conducted in the late '60s and early '70s, Welles expressed the orthodox opinion that Shakespeare wrote the plays: \\"... He was a country boy, the son of a butcher, who'd made it into court. He spent years getting himself a coat of arms. He wrote mostly about kings.\\"Bogdanovich, Peter. This is Orson Welles. New York: Harpercollins, 1992, pp. 211‚Äì212. In the 1980s he said \\"The mystery surrounding Shakespeare is greatly exaggerated. We know a lot about his financial dealings, for example. He was brilliant in arranging his finances, you see. He died very rich from real-estate investments. The son of a bitch did everything! And finally he got what his father had always wanted‚Äîa coat of arms. His father was a butcher. And a mayor of Stratford.\\"Biskind, Peter, ed. My Lunches with Orson (2013). Metropolitan Books, pp. 102‚Äì3. . His listing has since been amended to acknowledge that Welles was not an anti-Stratfordian for most of his life. 2015 changes In 2015, responding to criticism of the inclusion of some of the names on the list, the SAC removed two names, replaced them with two others, and revised the entries of two other names on the doubters list. The caveats were added to the entries on Ralph Waldo Emerson and Orson Welles. Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì1870) was originally included on the list based upon an incomplete misquotation that was interpreted as a statement of doubt. Stage and film actor and director Leslie Howard (1893‚Äì1943) was included on the basis of the lines he spoke as the lead character in the 1941 film, \\"Pimpernel\\" Smith. Both names have been removed from the list, but the entries remain online in the \\"past doubters\\" pages of the website with the heading \\"Removed from Past Doubters list\\".Past Doubters: Removed from the List These two names were replaced with Hugh Trevor Roper and George Greenwood.

Biography  Feliza Bursztyn was born in Bogot√°, Colombia in 1933 to Polish Jewish immigrants. Her parents had just been visiting Bogot√° at the time of her birth in 1933. When they received news of Adolf Hitler's election to the German Chancellorship, they decided to remain in Colombia, where her father founded a small textile factory.Camilo Leyva, Manuela Ochoa, and Juan Carlos Osorio, \\"Cronolog√≠a,\\" in Feliza Bursztyn : Elogio de la chatarra (Bogot√° : Museo Nacional de Colombia, 2009), p.7 Bursztyn's father managed a prosperous textile factory and the family rose to the elite ranks of industrialists in a nation that underwent a swift process of modernisation. Her father's textile factory allowed her to pursue studies in Bogot√°, then at the Art Students League of New York to study painting, and lastly the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris to study sculptures. At the Academia Grande Chaumi√®re, she was taught by the cubist sculptor Ossip Zadkine. On her second trip to Europe she learned to melt and work scrap metal with the sculptor C√©sar Baldaccini. Bursztyn wasn't as enthusiastic, however, about the country's dynamic transformation because of her observation that the process further deepened the nation's social and economic divisions. In 1960 she converted a section of her father's factory into an art studio. She explored the use of materials and was influenced by the work of the French artist C√©sar Baldaccini, and after 1961 she started using scrap metal within her works.\\"Feliza Bursztyn\\", article in Arte en Colombia 17 (Dec. 1981) by Miguel Gonz√°lez, pp. 44‚Äì47 Bursztyn was part of a generation that changed the definition of sculpture in Colombian culture.\\"Feliza Bursztyn\\", article in Eco 44.267 (Jan. 1984) by Marta Traba, pp. 235‚Äì260 Bursztyn's workshop in Bogot√° was a gathering place for many writers, artists, and intellectuals including Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Alejandro Obreg√≥n, Marta Traba, √Ålvaro Cepeda Samudio, Santiago Garc√≠a, Jorge Gait√°n Dur√°n, Fernando Mart√≠nez Sanabria, and Hernando Valencia Goelkel. She took exile in Mexico in 1981 due to the political and social problems in Colombia. Bursztyn married Lawrence Fleischer on December 6, 1952 and together had three daughters, Jannette, Bethina, and Michelle. On December 6, 1982 Michelle gave birth to a daughter and named her Feliza. Bursztyn died in exile in Paris on 8 January 1982, leaving many of her works to the Colombian Ministry of Culture and the National Museum of Colombia.  Life as an artist  Feliza Bursztyn was a Colombian artist who evolved her own original path of kinetic art. Her later sculptures took a more direct approach to the critique of political and religious elites. Bursztyn never shied from her support of leftist opposition movements. After a trip to Cuba, she found Colombia's political police in her flat, who accused her of smuggling weapons to the partisans through her studio. Bursztyn gained political asylum in Mexico, then later emigrated to Paris. She died from a heart attack a short time later. Bursztyn has been one of the artists who have most marked the contemporary art of Colombia and Latin America, but she is little recognized by history. Perhaps, many prefer to ignore her because she devoted herself, both in her artistic career and in her personal life, to breaking the rules. Bursztyn entered the canon of Colombian art history as a key modern artist, but to place emphasis primarily on her formal innovations as they contributed to the development of modern, autonomous art in Colombia is to risk minimizing the ways in which her work challenged cultural hegemony and European-American discourses of modernity. Her art can be interpreted as problematizing the assumption that \\"development\\" is the answer to \\"underdevelopment,\\" that modernity can be universally beneficial. In their confrontations with dominant power structures in Colombia that sought to control class and gender relations and morality, Bursztyn's work exposed modernity's dark side, coloniality.  Timeline = 1960s  *In 1961, Bursztyn presented her first of eleven chatarras (sculptures made from scraps) in which received negative backlash and a harsh review from even Colombia's leading art critic, Walter Engel. *1962: Exhibits at the Besalel Museum in Jerusalem and participates in the XIV Colombian Artists Salon. *1963: Participates in the XV Salon of Colombian Artists in the National Museum of Bogot√°. *1964: Win the First Prize in Sculpture at the I Intercol Salon, at the Museum of Modern Art in Bogot√°. * By 1964, and around the time of her second solo art show, art critics, much like Walter Engel, decided to reconsider the possibilities of \\"junk\\" as \\"art.\\" * In 1965, Bursztyn won first prize in sculpture at the 17th Sal√≥n Nacional, and in 1967 she unveiled a new body of work, made of stainless steel with a kinetic component, which she titled Las hist√©ricas (The hysterical ones). *1965: Win the First Prize in sculpture at the XVII Colombian Artists Salon with the sculpture \\"Mirando al Norte\\". *1966: Part of Six Colombian Sculptors exhibition of the Luis Angel Arango Library and participates in the XVIII National Artists Hall in the same institution. *1967: Win the Third Prize at the XIX Salon of National Artists, at the Luis √Ångel Arango Library, Bogot√°. That same year authorities detained Bursztyn at El Dorado airport by military authorities during her arrival on a trip to Europe, Cuba and Israel. *1968: Exhibits \\"Las Hist√©ricas\\" at the Museum of Modern Art in Bogot√°. The same series is also presented in Buenos Aires, San Francisco and Havana.  1970s  * In the 1970s, two important works‚Äîthe series Las camas (The beds, 1974) and La baila mec√°nica (The mechanical dance, 1979) -- fully embraces the possibilities of kinetic art in a multimedia setting. In 1974, at the Museo de Arte Moderno de Bogot√°, Las camas consisted of thirteen motorized beds with stranges shapes moving suggestively underneath satin sheets to a sound track composed by experimental musician Jacqueline Nava. Similarly, for la baila mechanica, Bursztyn built seven large upright covered sculptures resembling bodies. As with the beds, the figures would \\"dance\\" to music with dramatic lighting to complete the stagelike presentation. *1971: Makes the sculpture \\"Tribute to Gandhi\\" which is located in Carrera 7 with 100th Street in Bogot√° and participates in Ten Years of Colombian Art and in the XXII National Artists Hall in the National Museum. *1972: Participates in the III Biennial of Coltejer in Medell√≠n and in the 1st National Exhibition of Plastic Arts of the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University. There she obtains the Special Prize Paz del R√≠o for \\"Cama\\". *1973: Designs the offices of Par Publicidad in Medell√≠n commissioned by Luis de Zuleta and Am√≠lcar Osorio. *1974: Presents \\"Camas\\" with mechanical movement in the Museum of Modern Art of Bogot√° and the Museum of Modern Art La Tertulia. *1975: Executes one of her \\"Lacework\\" as a mural on the fa√ßade of the Banco del Comercio in Bogot√° and exhibits \\"Beds with music and movement\\" in the Museum of the University City of Mexico. *1976: The \\"Last Supper\\" mural is finished, made with 12 thousand silverware, for the Hotel Center of the Seine, Bogot√°. *1977: Exhibits her \\"Miniesculturas\\" at the San Diego Gallery in Bogot√°. *1979: Exhibits the exhibition \\"Baila Mec√°nica\\" at the Garc√©s Vel√°squez Gallery, the La Tertulia Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw, Krak√≥w and Havana.  1980s  * 1980: Participates in an exhibition of Colombian Artists in Casa de las Am√©ricas, in Havana. * In 1981, Detained and questioned for two days by the military after her two trips to Cuba. * In 1982, Died of a heart attack at the age of forty-nine in Paris, on 8 January.  Artworks  Although her artwork is abstract, through its material of \\"the new reality\\" and its new relationship to viewers, it can be linked to social issues. From her comfortable yet \\"outsider\\" position as a Jewish woman, daughter of immigrant industrialists, living next to a factory, she was able to flourish as an innovative artist with radical views. Unlike other Latin American artists working in abstract art, Bursztyn's pursuit was never focused on rules on how reality should be experienced. On the contrary, she used it as a medium for politicized content relating to women's rights in a post-colonial society, revealing the troublesome face of modernization while putting forth a critique of authoritarian rule. There is a special place for Bursztyn among the company of artists working in the field of kinetic art. For her, the movement was never a source of fascination. Rather, it was a way of conjuring up a feeling of discomfort in the viewer. The kinetic art created by Bursztyn wasn't so much a research tool as a method of depicting that which wasn't supposed to be spoken of. Eventually, she evolved her own original path of kinetic art.  Chatarras  In 1961, Bursztyn unveiled her first eleven chatarras, relatively simple and flat compositions of rustic mechanical fragments such as wheels hoops, nuts, bolts, spark plugs, gears, wires, etc. Bursztyn's first sculptures (Chatarras ‚Äì assemblages) were made of junkyard scraps ‚Äì discarded fragments of machines, tires, cables, bolts and other metal bits. Hers was an undaunted critique of industrialism and ensuing rise of consumerism, and it wasn't welcomed with open arms by the nation's art institutions and critics, who generally believed that artists should be supportive of Colombia's progress.  Las hist√©ricas  Las histericas was Bursztyn's break with common preconceptions and social naturalizations. She used materials, forms, movements and mechanical noises, she created art that was rough and shocking. She put the junkyard scraps away in favor of discarded parts from a radiator manufacturing plant. She attached a small electrical motor to the long, spiraling strips of aluminum, which came together as abstract forms set into a noisy, vibrating motion that were experienced by the viewer through several senses at once. Bursztyn expressed interest in using the exhibition space as an experiential space. Her sculptures took up all the walls and floors, some of them hung from the ceiling in entirely blacked-out rooms, with a single spotlight directed at a particular work constantly in motion. The hysterics , made of scrap stainless steel, were exhibited in 1968 at the Museum of Modern Art in Bogot√°, which in those years was based at the National University. With that work, she won that year's XIX National Salon of Artists. In 1969, the series paired with the film Hoy Felisa by experimental director Luis Ernesto Arocha, which, in turn, featured the mobile forms of Las hist√©ricas woven through with the images of pop culture idols like Bette Davis and Marlon Brando.  Las camas  In Las camas, 1974, she took 13 beds and in each of them she placed an enigmatic form covered in multi-coloured fabrics, along with an electric motor that set the entire piece in a vibrating motion. In the Mechanical Dance, several characters coexisted completing themselves, providing depth and even from different points of view. However, a degree of sadness and bad omen prevailed in space. If we take into account the events that led to Bursztyn's exile, each character under the Baila fabrics was a hint of what would happen during those years with many Colombians blindfolded and interrogated, subjected to an absurd and endless mechanism. From this perspective, the exhibition space was social and political: the victims were on a platform to be observed by the public with attention and indifference.  La baila mechanica  In her Mechanical Ballet, 1979, Bursztyn used linen, steel, motors and wheels to create a stage and arranged seven abstract figures upon it, which hung from the ceiling and performed an awkward, uncoordinated mechanical dance.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History It was built in 1884 for Chester City Council as a police station for the Cheshire County Constabulary, and was designed by the local architect John Douglas. It was used as the police headquarters until 1967 when a new building for the purpose was constructed on a different site. In the early 2000s it was being used as an occupational health unit for Cheshire County Council. Architecture The building is constructed in red Ruabon brick with stone bands and terracotta and stone dressings, and a grey slate roof. It has three storeys plus an attic. On the ground floor two steps lead to an arched doorway. To the left of this are three arched sash windows and to the right is a casement window. The middle and top storeys contain six two-light mullioned and transomed windows in pairs. The gable is stepped and contains a row of six windows, over which are two more windows. Between these is the date 1884 in brick moulding. In the apex of the gable is the cartouche of the police force.

It can be viewed with binoculars or a small telescope but is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 7.60. This object is located at a distance of 155 light years from the Sun, as determined from its parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +30 km/s. This is an ordinary G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G0V, which indicates it, like the Sun, is generating energy through core hydrogen fusion. It is slightly larger, hotter, brighter, and more massive than our Sun. The metal content is about 8% greater than the Sun, and it has a quiet (magnetically inactive) chromosphere. The star is an estimated 6.8 billion years old and it is spinning with a rotation period of about 26 days In 2009, a very long-period giant planet, more massive than Jupiter, was found in orbit around the star by measuring changes in the star's radial velocity. This planet takes to orbit the star at the typical distance of . The planet's eccentricity (0.02) is about the same as Earth. According to a 2018 research, HD 13931 is the most promising Solar System analogue known, since it has a star similar to the Sun and a planet with mass and semimajor axis similar to Jupiter. Those characteristics yield a probability almost 75% for the existence of a dynamically stable habitable zone, where an Earth-like planet may exist and sustain life.

It was built in 1796 by Colonel George Newcom, one of the first settlers in Dayton after the Treaty of Greenville (1795).Newcom Tavern Touring Ohio. Retrieved August 02, 2012. It was established as the New Jersey Land Company, under the leadership of Jonathan Dayton, with partners General Wilkinson, General St. Clair and Colonel Ludlow, employed surveyors to lay out a town site between the two Miami rivers. The Newcom Tavern, built by Robert Edgar, was the first structure in the area. Edgar received seventy-five cents a day for its construction. The house originally consisted of two rooms: one upstairs and one downstairs, and was located at what became the southwest corner of Main and Water (later Monument) Streets, where \\"it stood there for almost a century.\\" The size of the cabin was doubled two years after it was built and it served as Dayton's first school, first church, courthouse, council chamber and store. It was best known as a crossroads tavern in the Northwest Territory for all wagon men and drovers. In 1894 when architect Charles Insco Williams \\"tried to raze it to make way for an apartment building,\\" the logs beneath the clapboards were found to be those of the old Newcom Tavern. In 1896 the Centennial Celebration Committee helped move the structure to Van Cleve Park on Monument Avenue and the Daughters of the American Revolution raised money to restore it. In 1896 it was opened as a public museum and held relics donated by Daytonians. The Tavern was moved once again in 1965 when it was relocated to Carillon Historical Park and became part of the Settlement Exhibit. The lower level of the tavern is open to the public, but the upper level is no longer open.

After playing amateur football as a youth, he was appointed manager of Accrington Stanley in 1897. He was in charge of the team for 13 years, leading them to two Lancashire Combination titles, before moving to nearby Burnley in July 1910. His 14-year spell as secretary-manager of Burnley was highly successful and guided the team to an FA Cup victory and a Football League championship. Haworth is the only Burnley manager to date to have won the FA Cup. Personal life Haworth was born in Accrington, Lancashire on 8 May 1876 and was the nephew of England international George Haworth. He died of pneumonia on 4 December 1924 aged 48. Managerial career=Accrington Stanley As a teenager, Haworth played amateur football for local club Meadow Bank, where he later became secretary. In 1897, he merged the club with North East Lancashire Combination side Accrington Stanley and became a member of the Accrington Stanley committee. Later the same year, he was named secretary of the club. At the time, club secretaries were in charge of first- team duties such as coaching and signing players. Under the stewardship of Howarth, Accrington Stanley were transformed into one of the foremost non- league clubs in Lancashire, winning the Lancashire Combination in the 1902‚Äì03 season. The following campaign, the team finished as runners-up before again claiming the league title in the 1905‚Äì06 season. He went on to manage the club for 13 years before leaving in the summer of 1910. Burnley Haworth was appointed secretary‚Äìmanager of Football League Second Division side Burnley in July 1910, replacing Richard Wadge, who had taken care of first-team affairs since the death of Spen Whittaker in April 1910. During his first summer in charge, he signed Burnley's first foreign player, German defender Max Seeburg. Soon afterwards, he changed the colour of Burnley's strip as he considered the green kit to be unlucky. He opted to change the colours to claret and blue, to match the strip of reigning Football League champions Aston Villa. Towards the close of the 1910‚Äì11 season, Haworth pulled off his first major signing when he persuaded England centre forward Bert Freeman to join the club from Everton. The following season, Haworth guided the team to a third-placed finish in the Second Division, narrowly missing out on promotion. In the 1912‚Äì13 campaign, Burnley reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before losing to Sunderland after a replay. That year, the team finished second in the league to gain promotion to the First Division. In the club's first season in the top-flight of English football since 1900, he led the side to third place in the league, just three points off the title. He also guided the team to an unprecedented FA Cup run, where they conceded only four goals in eight matches. Haworth's team secured a 1‚Äì0 victory over Liverpool, making him the only manager to date to have won the FA Cup with Burnley. The team ended the 1914‚Äì15 season in fourth place in the First Division before football in England was interrupted for four years by the First World War. Upon the return to competitive football, Burnley finished runners-up in the league. The 1920‚Äì21 season started disappointingly for the side, but he eventually led the team to a 30-match unbeaten run to become Champions of England for the first time in 1921. A third-placed finish followed in 1922, but the team's league form fell away thereafter and they could only achieve relatively mediocre finishes in the next two campaigns. On 4 December 1924, he became the second successive Burnley manager to die while in office when he died of pneumonia.

In the Intrigues of the Warring States, the strategist Su Qin is quoted as telling the king of Qin: \\"Kings Wei and Xuan of Qi were the worthiest rulers of their age. Their power was great and their lands were broad. Their states were wealthy and their citizens capable. Their generals were aggressive and their troops strong.\\" King Wei was judicious and measured in his actions toward his subordinates.

Sun Bin had been punished with mutilation of his knees in Wei at the instigation of his enemy Pang Juan. King Wei's commander Tian Ji recruited him to come to Qi. As Sun Bin could not sit on a horse, he refused when King Wei offered him the actual command of the army. Sun Bin wrote Sun Bin's Art of War, in which King Wei and Tian Ji question Sun Bin on strategy and tactics. Sun Bin was influential in devising the strategy for the Qi triumph at the Battle of Maling in 342 BC, which considerably weakened the rival state of Wei.

Engraving from 1786. The New College at Hackney (more ambiguously known as Hackney College) was a dissenting academy set up in Hackney, at that time a village on the outskirts of London, by Unitarians. It was in existence from 1786 to 1796. The writer William Hazlitt was among its pupils, sent aged 15 to prepare for the Unitarian ministry, and some of the best-known Dissenting intellectuals spent time on its staff.Herbert J McLachlan, The Old Hackney College 1786-1796; Trans. Unitarian Historical Soc.; 3(1923-26) 185-205. History The year 1786 marked the dissolution of Warrington Academy, which had been inactive since 1756 as a teaching institution. Almost simultaneously the Hoxton Academy of the Coward Trust, under Samuel Morton Savage, closed its doors in the summer of 1785. Some of the funding that had backed Warrington was available for a new dissenting academy for the London area, as well as for a northern successor in Manchester. The London building plans were ambitious, but proved the undoing of the New College, which was soon strained financially.David L. Wykes, The Dissenting Academy and Rational Dissent, pp. 131-2 in Knud Haakonssen (editor), Enlightenment and Religion: Rational dissent in eighteenth-century Britain (1996).

Bestowed the title of despot, Jacob Svetoslav was the ruler of a widely autonomous domain of the Second Bulgarian Empire most likely located around Sofia. Seeking further independence and claiming the title of Emperor of Bulgaria, he twice changed allegiance from Bulgaria to the Kingdom of Hungary and vice versa, and the Hungarians recognized his Bulgarian royal rank as their vassal and ruler of Vidin (medieval Bdin). Bulgarian despot Jacob Svetoslav's exact origin is not clear, though he is known to have been either a Russian noble himself or the son of one. Jacob or his father most likely arrived in Bulgaria with the wave of Russians fleeing the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the first half of the 13th century.Fine, p. 175. Historian Plamen Pavlov theorizes that Jacob Svetoslav was a descendant of the princes (knyaze) of Kievan Rus', and estimates his birth date as being in the 1210s or 1220s.–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤. In the late 1250s, Jacob Svetoslav was already an influential noble. He married a daughter of Theodore II Laskaris from his marriage with Tsar Ivan Asen II's daughter Elena. By 1261, he had become a despot, a high- ranking noble in the Bulgarian hierarchy. The title was awarded to him probably by his own suzerain, the ruler of Bulgaria, rather than a Byzantine emperor, possibly Constantine Tih. Jacob Svetoslav was close to the Bulgarian court and pledged loyalty to Constantine. Thus, the tsar made him the ruler of a domain usually considered to have been south of the Vidin region in the west of the Bulgarian Empire. Byzantine sources indicate his possessions lay \\"near Haemus\\", thus close to Sofia, between the Hungarian possessions to the north and Macedonia to the south.–ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, p. 499. In 1261, he commanded the Bulgarian forces in a war against Hungary near Severin (western Wallachia), and in 1262 he possibly fought against Byzantium, as a Byzantine army invaded his lands in the following year during an anti-Bulgarian campaign. Jacob Svetoslav's continuing ties to his Russian homeland are evidenced by his request to the Bulgarian patriarch. Jacob requested the making of a copy of the Nomocanon which was then sent to Cyril III, the Metropolitan of Kiev. It was supplemented by a letter from Jacob in which the noble calls the metropolitan \\"the bishop of the entire Russian land... of my ancestors\\". The copy finishes with a passage in which Jacob is called a \\"Bulgarian despot\\".–ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, pp. 501‚Äì502. He also minted his own coins bearing the imperfect images of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki or Jacob himself, dressed as a warrior wearing a helmet and holding a sword. Hungarian and Bulgarian ruler of Vidin The Baba Vida castle in Vidin is widely regarded to have been Jacob Svetoslav's capital In 1263, the situation in Bulgaria was far from stable, as Constantine was facing both the threat of his predecessor Mitso Asen's throne ambitions and a large-scale Byzantine invasion. Because Constantine was unable to assist Jacob against the advancing Byzantines, Jacob sought aid from his northern neighbour, Hungarian king Stephen V. The Hungarians drove the Byzantines out of Jacob's domain and themselves invaded Byzantine-controlled territories. Rescued from the Byzantine threat, Jacob Svetoslav submitted to Hungarian suzerainty.Engel, p. 175. Stephen V placed him as the ruler of the Vidin province on the Danube River, previously governed for Hungary by the then-deceased Rostislav Mikhailovich, and allowed him to retain his lands to the south. Had it not been for the appointment of Jacob Svetoslav as a Hungarian vassal at Vidin, Bulgaria would have re- established control over the city in 1263.Fine, pp. 176‚Äì177. In 1264, however, Hungary was precipitated into another civil war between Stephen V and his father B√©la IV. Fearing Bulgarian retribution and lack of Hungarian support should B√©la IV come out victorious, in 1265 Jacob Svetoslav changed allegiance to Bulgaria and acknowledged the authority of Constantine Tih. The two crossed the Danube in 1265 and raided the Hungarian fortresses north of the river. By the spring of 1266, however, Stephen V had established himself as the sole ruler of Hungary, and on 23 June 1266, conquered Vidin back from Jacob after a brief siege. Two waves of Hungarian raids proceeded to devastate the Vidin province and enter the possessions of Constantine. In spite of Bulgarian resistance, the Hungarians subjugated a number of cities including Pleven. Jacob Svetoslav's previous defection to Bulgarian suzerainty notwithstanding, the Hungarians restored him as the puppet ruler of the Vidin region. In 1266, he was even referred to as \\"Tsar of the Bulgarians\\" (imperator Bulgarorum)–ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, p. 508. in Hungarian sources, possibly to encourage a rivalry between Constantine and Jacob Svetoslav for the Bulgarian throne or simply to satisfy Jacob's ambitions.Fine, pp. 178‚Äì179. Final submission to Bulgaria and death The death of Stephen V in 1272 meant that he was succeeded by his infant son Ladislaus IV, with the widowed consort and mother of the boy, Elizabeth, as his regent. At the time, Jacob Svetoslav still held Vidin as a Hungarian vassal. Possibly in 1273, Hungarian rule in Braniƒçevo, west of Jacob's domain, was put to an end by two Cuman‚ÄìBulgarian nobles, Darman and Kudelin. Cut off from his Hungarian suzerains and facing the menace of a Bulgarian attack from the east, Jacob Svetoslav once again submitted to Bulgarian rule. He arrived in the capital Tarnovo to negotiate his submission with Constantine's consort Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, who was the dominant figure in the empire at the time due to the Tsar's paralysis. There, Jacob was formally adopted by the much younger Maria as her second son, after the infant heir Michael Asen II. This adoption solidified Jacob's ties to the court and meant that he could safely retain his autonomous domain as a Bulgarian vassal. He also harboured hopes to ascend to the throne by ousting Michael when Constantine died.Fine, pp. 181‚Äì183. Suspicious of these disloyal intentions of Jacob's, Constantine's consort Maria is thought to have poisoned him,–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤. and he died in 1275 or 1276/1777, shortly before the Uprising of Ivaylo. While the fate of the city of Vidin itself is unclear, at least part of Jacob's possessions were certainly restored to direct Bulgarian rule in the wake of his death. One such territory was the Svrljig region lying southwest of Vidin, which in 1278 was documented as belonging to Bulgaria.Fine, p. 183.

The school was built in the late 1930s but its opening was delayed by World War II. The school takes pupils between 11 and 16, and holds adult skills classes after school hours. History Testwood School opened in 1946 as a secondary school, and became a comprehensive school in 1969. The school is formed of the original building alongside other extensions added through the years. Major extensions were added in recent years including the Sports Hall, and an extension to the science block and library in 1997. A further extension containing more science laboratories and ICT rooms opened in 2001. Sports college status In 2004, the school was given the special status of sports college. With this new status, the astroturf was built, and a whole change of school image took place. The logo was changed, as was the uniform. With the specialist status, many in the local community use the school's facilities, and the school has become well known in the community. Since the status was granted, improvements have been made to the sports facilities including refurbishment of the changing facilities, and an extension to the sports hall. Since becoming a sports college, the school has been the hub of the New Forest School Sports Partnership,New Forest School Sports Partnership which encourages and supports sports in the local community through the feeder schools, and through the Dreams and TeamsDreams and Teams project working with Serokolo High School. The NFSSP has its main base at Testwood, and another base at the other local sports college, Noadswood School. Academy status In late 2011, the school applied for academy status, which was granted in the autumn of 2011. Name change It was announced that Testwood Sports College was reverting to its previous and original name, Testwood School. This was because when the school obtained sports college status, it was to receive government funding, but the government had ended the programme a few years previously. The school decided to keep the name Testwood Sports College, as it is known for its sporting facilities. It was agreed that Testwood was not only good for sporting, but its overall curriculum, and it was decided to revert the name. Ofsted In February 2014 Testwood received a judgement of \\"Inadequate\\" from Ofsted and was placed in special measures. In June 2014 the Governing Body of the school was sent a pre-warning letter by Lord Nash of the Department of Education advising that standards erre seen as \\"unacceptably low\\" by the Secretary of State. Since the Ofsted report, I Appleton was replaced in May 2014 by J.A. Pitman. Since she has arrived there have been changes to the uniform, back to what it used to be. More positive changes have been made around the school. In July 2015, Testwood School received a good rating from Ofsted,Ofsted good rating and the school is no longer in special measures. Facilities The school has a synthetic turf pitch, a recently refurbished sports hall, an field including two adult and two junior football pitches and a rugby pitch; tennis courts, outdoor basketball hoops, a gymnasium, fitness studio and two drama/dance studios. The school also has 35 general purpose teaching rooms, nine science laboratories, a music suite, six purpose built technology rooms, three art rooms, six ICT suites and a Learning Resource Centre. The LRC spans 450 square meters and was one of the best school libraries in the country when opened. It contains 60 computers alongside the collection of books. Structure Pupils usually come to Testwood from the three main feeder schools: Abbotswood Junior School, Calmore Junior School and Oakfield Primary School. Applications for School Prefect occur during Year 10, and duties continue until the final exams in Year 11. Six students per year group serve on the school council along with the Head Boy and Girl and Deputy Head Boy and Girl. Testwood bases its organisation on tutor groups. Each has its own tutor and is part of a house system. The houses are named Bedivere, Lancelot, Galahad and Excalibur.

The building was finished in 1909 and has been considered Oklahoma City's first skyscraper. It is tall and has 14 floors. Originally an office tower developed by Charles Colcord, the building was renovated by Coury Hospitality and reopened as a luxury hotel in 2006. Colcord Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History Colcord built the Colcord Building, now known as the Colcord Hotel, which was the first skyscraper in Oklahoma City. It was also the first steel-reinforced concrete building in Oklahoma, because Colcord had seen the devastation to lesser buildings in San Francisco following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and resulting fires. Originally designed with two wings, only the east wing and connecting elevator/stair segment were constructed. Architect William A. Wells was a prot√©g√© of Louis Sullivan, a founder of the Chicago School style of architecture. Sullivan designed the molds for the decorative terra cotta ornamentation on the first, second, and twelfth floors of the Colcord.[20] The building survived Oklahoma City's Urban Renewal efforts and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Developer Paul Coury, with the help of investors including Beck Design and Manhattan Construction, has transformed the office building into a boutique hotel adjacent to the state's tallest building, the new 51 story, 274 metres/900 feet Devon Tower. The Colcord Building is now owned by Devon Energy. Colcord also built the Commerce Exchange Building and the Biltmore Hotel. Architecture When the Colcord Building was completed in 1910, at 12 stories, it was the first skyscraper in Oklahoma City. Constructed by Charles Francis Colcord, he chose William A. Wells as the architect. Wells was a prot√©g√© of Louis Sullivan, a founder of the Chicago School style of architecture. Sullivan was also the designer of the molds for the decorative terra cotta, which adorns the first, second, and twelfth floors of the Colcord Building. The building was constructed of reinforced concrete after Colcord witnessed terrible devastation associated with the San Francisco earthquake and resulting fires in 1906. He wanted to avoid the same catastrophic loss of his building. Every luxury of the time was incorporated in the construction. Marble adorned the columns and walls of the main lobby, the original nickel and bronze letterbox and elevator doors shone, and an ornamental plaster ceiling crowned the space.

(Leslie Rowsell) Moore, (23 June 1912 ‚Äì 13 November 2003), was Sorby Professor of Geology at Sheffield University, where under his leadership its geology department became one of the largest in the country. He also made significant advances in the study of palaeobotany and palynology. He was called as an expert witness at the inquiry into the Aberfan disaster. He was instrumental in the creation of the Micropalaeontological Society and was its first President. He has been described as \\"one of the founders of modern Carboniferous palynology\\". Early life He was born and grew up in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. He was the son of a miner in the Somerset coalfield. He attended Midsomer Norton Grammar School (now Norton Hill School). His family had encouraged him to obtain a good education and hoped that he would study medicine; however, he won a Miner's Welfare Scholarship at the University of Bristol where he read Geology and obtained a first class degree. He was a strong sportsman, captaining the University Football team at Bristol and was later President of the football club at Sheffield University. Academic career At Bristol University obtained both his BSc (1934) and PhD (1936) and later a DSc (1948). He was taught by Professor Arthur Elijah Trueman. His PhD was on the structure, stratigraphy and economic geology of the Bristol and Somerset Coalfields. He realised early on the value of the fossil floral and faunal evidence and using these made significant proposals relating to the regional correlation of the Coal Measures. His first job was in teaching in Suffolk, but he was soon appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in Geology at University of Wales, where he expanded his research to cover the South Wales coalfield. He developed research interests in areas of palaeobotany that were subsequently to provide a major impetus to the emerging science of palynology. He noted that miospores recovered from the maceration of numerous Coal Measure fructifications displayed a wide range of morphological variations. These, he suggested, represented a series of developmental stages towards maturity. The observation that similar trends could be observed in the fructifications from different plant groups was to have major implications on the emerging schemes of classification for dispersed miospores. He moved briefly to a more senior position at the University of Glasgow before being appointed to a Readership in the University of Bristol. In 1949 he became Sorby Professor of Geology in the University of Sheffield. By the 1970s, he had led the Department to become one of the largest in Britain. He was called as an expert witness to the Government Enquiry following the Aberfan disaster in 1966. In 1968, the Geological Society invited him to explore the potential for establishing a Specialist Group for Micropalaeontology within the Society. This led to the creation of the British Micropalaeontological Society, now the Micropalaeontological Society, of which he was its first President. He also played a major role in the establishment of the Association of Teachers of Geology (now the Earth Science Teachers‚Äô Association). Towards the end of his time at Sheffield University he concentrated on micropalaeobiology and the search for evidence of fungal and bacterial attack on organic matter in sedimentary rocks. He also published on the presence of fungal and bacterial structures in the Precambrian Nonesuch Shale. He was also active in the Palaeontological Association.http://www.gly.bris.ac.uk/www/history/biogs/moore.html Later life He retired in 1977. He and his wife Peggy lived at Curbar in the Peak District of Derbyshire. His wife died in 1985. With the progressive loss of mobility over the years, he decided to move to Birmingham to be closer to his son. He died on 13 November 2003 aged 91.

Together with Josip Jurƒçiƒç, he is considered the most important representative of literary realism in the Slovene language.  Biography  Brdo Manor Kersnik was born in Brdo Manor near Lukovica in Upper Carniola, then part of the Austrian Duchy of Carniola (now in Slovenia). His father Jo≈æe Kersnik was a district judge, while his mother Berta H√∂ffern was a local noblewoman. Kersnik grew up in a bilingual, German-Slovene environment. He attended the German-language grammar school in Ljubljana, but was expelled under accusations of Slovene nationalism. He continued his studies under the private tutorship of Fran Levec, an influential Young Slovene literary historian. He studied law at the University of Vienna and Graz, where he graduated in 1874. He worked in the Austro-Hungarian administration in Ljubljana between 1874 and 1878, where he opened a civil law notary office in his native Brdo pri Lukovici. In the late 1870s, he became active in politics in the liberal Young Slovene party. In 1883, he was elected to the Carniolan provincial diet. Together with Fran ≈†uklje, He belonged to the moderate faction of the Slovene Liberals, and opposed both the conservatism of the Old Slovenes, the centralism of Austrian liberals, and the Slovene radical national liberalism, advocated by Ivan Hribar and Ivan Tavƒçar. He died in Ljubljana in 1897.  Literary work  Kersnik started his literary career as a German language poet. Under the influence of Slovene post-Romantic authors Josip Stritar and Simon Jenko, he began writing in Slovene. He first wrote in late Romantic style, but under the influence of his personal friend Josip Jurƒçiƒç, he switched to literary realism. He was a prolific author of short stories, feuilletons, and satires, in which he critically assessed the backwardness of the Slovene Lands of his time, and the radicalization of political life.

It is \\"one of the dominant and most characteristic crustaceans in deep-sea communities of the Mediterranean Sea\\". Description Adult P. typhlops reach a total length of , from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the telson. This excludes the greatly elongated first pair of pereiopods which are normally held with the first three segments close to the side of the thorax, and the remainder held horizontal above the level of the animal's body, with the tips of the claws not exceeding the tip of the rostrum. This is thought to be an adaptation to predation while partly buried in the sediment. The usual colour of the exoskeleton is whitish, orange or yellow, with the fertilised eggs matching the colour of the pleon where they are brooded. As in other polychelids, and as implied by the generic names Polycheles and Pentacheles, all five pairs of pereiopods bear claws. Polycheles typhlops may be distinguished from closely related species by a number of characteristics, including the presence of an indentation around the orbit of the eye, 12‚Äì15 spines on each side of the carapace, a forward- pointing spine on the back of each of the second to fifth segments of the pleon, and two longitudinal ridges on each uropod. Only one other polychelid species is known to occur in the Mediterranean Sea, although four different species of larva have been found there. Distribution Polycheles typhlops lives in deep water throughout the Indo-Pacific, and on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the type specimen having been caught off Sicily. The species' depth distribution is less clear, with different authors citing depths of , , , , and . It is reported to be most abundant at depths of , , or . There are known to be both seasonal and geographical variations in depth, which may help to explain the variation. Ecology P. typhlops probably acts as an ambush predator, hiding buried in the sediment with its claws raised above the surface. Its main prey are bony fish and other crustaceans, such as shrimp, mysids and amphipods.

The Chasqui I was developed by students at Peru's National University of Engineering (UNI) and was part of an educational project to acquire the experience and ability in developing satellites. The name of the project refers to the chasqui, messengers of the Inca Empire.  General objectives  Capacities of UNI in satellite technology through the design, analysis, assembly, integration, test, launch and operation of a technology nanosatellite Cubesat. The satellite Chasqui I plans included taking pictures of the earth with transmission to a ground station. Specific objectives include: * Establish contacts and support to other universities and / or institutions involved in such projects. * To deepen the knowledge in information and communications technologies emerging. * To lead such projects in Latin America. * To demonstrate and validate new technologies. Goals include: * Design of the project profile. * Funding. * Capacity building. * Implementation of the Laboratory. * Development of the project. * Testing integrated. * Guidelines. * Operation Project Chasqui I in space The nanosatellite Chasqui I research project is an effort to secure Peru's access to space, along with the previous launched satellites, and gives the opportunity to open new application areas specific to its own geographical and social reality. It is also from an academic point of view a tool that facilitates collaboration between the various faculties of the university trains students and teachers with real world experience in satellite, allowing technological advances in the aerospace industry in the country. The development of small-scale satellites like Chasqui I gives way to the various opportunities of access to space with lower costs and development time. For this reason, various universities, companies and government organizations in the world show interest in developing nanosatellites that allow to carry out experiments and scientific missions. The educational benefits of the project can be emphasized in training camp for future engineers and scientists. Chasqui I logo The research project Chasqui I nanosatellite built a miniaturized satellite based on the CubeSat technology, the mass of the satellite is less than 1 kg and it has a volume of up to 1 Lt. The project demonstrates its utility in imaging land, more specifically from the Peruvian region, using a CMOS camera that seeks to distinguish between fertile land and uncultivated areas. To minimize the cost of development and construction, Chasqui I was constructed using commercial components. However, the very fact of using these components in a space environment presents new challenges in relation to tolerance to temperature and radiation and also presents increased requirements in areas related to redundancy when designing hardware and software components. Additionally, Chasqui I will use the amateur radio frequency, making it possible to be accessed by an entire amateur radio community can be located throughout the country, increasing the educational potential of the project. The project also includes the implementation of a ground station that allows monitoring of Chasqui I, as well as monitoring other small satellites of universities. Peru has a large geographical diversity, which makes it very difficult to constantly monitor the situation of certain events, whether natural or man-made, such as permanent snow melting, deforestation of the Amazon, the protection of habitats of endangered species, combating narco- terrorism, surveillance of borders and territorial sea, the prediction and mitigation of natural disasters, etc. It is in this context that space technology is presented as an alternative to solve problems of national interest. UNI, with its project Chasqui I, are taking steps in the process of addressing problems such as crop monitoring and telecommunications areas. The project Chasqui I, which initially was formative in nature, has evolved into a technological and scientific challenge for all members of the project. It is expected that Chasqui I allows to plant the foundations for future work in the area of small satellites and, to be increasing their size or number, give rise to satellite projects in different categories, in areas such as: communications, meteorology, remote sensing, earth images, navigation and oceanography.  Outline of the Project Development Modules  Outline of the Project Development Modules  Project Modules = Mechanical Structure ‚Äì EMEC  Displacement The research group module mechanical structure (EMEC) is responsible for reviewing the state of art, comparative analysis of existing cases to the pico-satellite design and manufacture our own model based on the Standard Cubesat. Within the pico-satellite will be assembled the following modules: Central Control and Management Information (CCMI), Unit Identification and Attitude Control (DCA), Imaging Management System (SIMA), Unit Power and Thermal Control (PCT) and Communications System (SICOM).  Central Control and Information Management ‚Äì CCMI  This module manages and monitors information from all subsystems Chasqui I. The module to meet the goals set must have within it a processor (called OBC: On Board Computer), which fulfills the following functions in each module: * Camera (SIMA): Regulates the satellite image capture and storage in an external memory. * Attitude (DCA): Order and confirms the stabilization order and spatial orientation. * Power (PCT): Manages and monitors satellite states of physical variables such as temperature, voltage and current. * Communication (SICOM) ground station receives orders and sends the information of camera data and pico-satellite states The data managed are: Data from the camera, Data Maintenance and commands.  Power and Thermal Control ‚Äì PCT  Energy Cycle Chasqui I The first subsystem is the Power and is responsible for receiving, processing, storing and distributing power to other subsystems in the Chasqui I. The objective of this subsystem is to ensure electricity supply for Chasqui I give it the energy needed at the right time. The second subsystem is the Thermal Control and he is responsible for maintaining the temperature of the batteries and other components of the satellite in its operating range, in order to ensure the functioning of Chasqui I. The most critical task of this subsystem is to maintain the batteries to operate within its limit of operation (0 ¬∞C to 20 ¬∞C.). Through heaters specifically designed and constructed at the National University of Engineering. Both subsystems are being designed and built at the National Engineering University.  Communication System ‚Äì SICOM  The TT & C module is responsible to provide a means of communication between the peak itself and the satellite earth station.  Image Acquisition System ‚Äì SIMA  SIMA The main objective of the research group is to obtain photographs of the Earth from Chasqui I. SIMA The module consists of two cameras, a visible range and the other in the near infrared range. Digital information is collected by the Central Control Module and Management Information (CCMI) and then sent to the Earth Station (ESTER). Additionally, the Group is responsible for processing digital images obtained by the Chasqui I.  System Identification and Attitude Control ‚Äì SDCA  System Identification and Attitude Control The SDCA maintains the pico- satellite stabilization and guidance to a desired direction when necessary. Specifically, we can say that SDCA is responsible for: * Stabilize the pico- satellite after leaving the deployer through reduction (within 0.1rad / s) and control their angular velocities. * Maintain a pointing accuracy of 3 degrees for taking pictures of Peru and, if technically possible, having a wide coverage of South America through maneuvers of 30 degrees in roll (roll) and 30 degrees pitch (pitch). * Maintain a less demanding pointing accuracy (e.g. 20 degrees) to enable up / down data between the pico-satellite and ground station. The SDCA enables the pico-satellite by using sensors to determine its attitude, calculate the correction required to achieve the desired orientation and execute the necessary maneuvers using the actuators. The attitude determination system will use magnetometers, sun sensors and attitude determination algorithms for estimating positions and angular velocities. Using GPS and gyroscopes as sensors for determining attitude will also be evaluated. The attitude control system will use electromagnetic coils and permanent magnets as actuators, forming what are known as magnetorquers. The electromagnetic coils are especially important for the stabilization of the pico-satellite once it leaves the deployer. The inclusion of the permanent magnet can have a system of active-passive control. More than one control law will be studied for possible implementation. The use of magnetic materials and hysteretic also be evaluated.  Ground Station ‚Äì ESTER  Block Diagram ‚Äì ESTER This subsystem is not part of the satellite itself, but its existence and operation is necessary to achieve the objectives of Chasqui I. The set of facilities and wireless communication (radio) needed to communicate with the Chasqui I, and any satellite. The main functions of this module are: * Follow- up: radioforo hear the beacon or satellite for its position. * Telemetry: Request state variables (temperature, voltage, etc..) To monitor and validate the satellite orbit calculation. * Commando: Order to extend the satellite antenna; order reset the system, order the taking and sending photos.  System Orbits ‚Äì SORS  Trajectory of Chasqui I The module aims to simulate the trajectories of Chasqui I, which is previously calculated differential equations of motion and then solve them in parallel with two programs: Delphi and Matlab. This simulation is accomplished by taking into consideration the following phases: * Considering the Earth as an inertial reference system, the quadrupole term of the gravitational potential and using Newton's second law, we obtained the equations of motion are nonlinear equations. * Using the Runge-Kutta of order 4 with the Delphi program to solve the equations of motion energy remaining constant. * Phase 2 was repeated with the Matlab program and with this software are carried out trajectory simulations Chasqui I.  Module Integration and Testing ‚Äì MIP  MIP The module aims to achieve the assembly of components developed by different modules of the project as electronic circuit boards, cameras, batteries, antennas, sensors, and electromagnetic coils. This goal can be achieved: * Optimizing surfaces, volumes, masses, finding center of gravity, center of mass. * Planning and conducting standardized testing requirements. * Perform field tests planned in the project.

The organization was founded in 2002 and is based in Reston, Virginia.http://thestaffordfoundation.org The Stafford Foundation is best known for its People's Inaugural Project which brought 300 disadvantaged individuals from across America to Washington, D.C. to help celebrate in the historic presidential inauguration of Barack Obama. Founder Earl W. Stafford spent over $1 million of his own money to fund the effort. The foundation recently launched The People's Project, which continues to build on the goodwill established by the People's Inaugural Project. TSF also recently announced its \\"Doing Good\\" campaign, with spokesperson Bill Cosby, as an effort provide people with the information and resources they need to help make a difference by doing good for others in need. Earl W. Stafford, Founder 2010 Horatio Alger Award winner Earl W. Stafford is the Founder and Chairman of The Stafford Foundation. Stafford is also the founding Chairman and CEO of The Wentworth Group, also based in Reston. Until January 2008, he was Chairman and CEO of UNITECH, Inc., which he founded in 1988. Stafford also had a 20-year distinguished career in the U.S. military that included service as the assistant Air Force Liaison Officer to the Federal Aviation Administration. In addition to his work with TSF, Stafford currently serves on the Boards of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Drexel University, Wesley Theological Seminary, Venture Philanthropy Partners, and Business Executives for National Security. The People's Inaugural Project In the spring of 2008, founder Earl Stafford felt compelled to do something special for local underprivileged Americans during the 2009 presidential inauguration festivities. His initial idea was simple: host an inaugural event at a Washington, D.C. hotel suite for those who would otherwise not be able to attend: the homeless, victims of abuse, wounded veterans, and the poor. At the time, he imagined it would be perhaps a simple gathering of fifty to sixty locally, disadvantaged individuals. Then in October 2008, Stafford read an article about extravagant hotel packages being sold in the area and stumbled upon a larger calling - to rent the ultimate inaugural hotel package and include hundreds of disadvantaged Americans from across the country to participate in a three-day celebration of the incoming president. Days later, Stafford and TSF anonymously purchased the JW Marriott's premier $1 million inaugural package, which included hundreds of hotel rooms, use of their grand ballroom, and access to the 12th floor terrace overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue and the inaugural parade route. On December 4, the Washington Post featured a front-page story about Stafford and his grand plans to readers across the globe. Word quickly spread about Stafford's extraordinary gesture, and within an instant he became known as \\"The Benefactor of the Ball.\\".https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/12/03/AR2008120304095.html From the onset, media organizations and people from across the globe became captivated by the Stafford Foundation's plans. On the same day that the Washington Post launched their story, the Stafford Foundation was featured in a three-minute story on ABC World News Tonight with Charlie Gibson. The next morning, Mr. Stafford appeared on the CNN, CBS, and ABC morning programs, and an editorial about the events appeared in the New York Times. Over the next several weeks, the People's Inaugural Project and TSF continued to gain in popularity and recognition. Stafford was featured in several media outlets, including the major national television news organizations, magazines, popular radio shows, local newspapers from across the globe, and on Oprah. Behind the scenes, TSF and accompanying partners were working diligently to plan a series of events that the honored guests of disadvantaged Americans would attend. They were also working day and night to identify those who would attend the events throughout the country, sorting through thousands of requests and looking to provide a diverse crowd of marginalized Americans from all walks of life, with all sorts of challenges which would prevent them from being able to attend through their own means. Hundreds of non-profit groups asked to send qualified individuals to the events, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the National Urban League, and the US Army's Wounded Warrior program. Beauticians, manicurists, and stylists from across the Washington region offered their services free of charge during the events to help prepare the disadvantaged guests for such a glamorous affair. And after just one month of announcing their plans, more than 500 gowns and tuxedos were donated to the disadvantaged guests from a variety of individuals. On Sunday, January 18, 2009, the People's Inaugural Project finally kicked off: more than two thousand individuals attended the various events; over 300 disadvantaged guests were lodged in rooms at the JW Marriott; and a boutique featuring the collected gowns, tuxedos, shoes, and accessories was built at the JW Marriott. The three-day event included a thousand-person Prayer Breakfast, which featured religious leaders from a variety of faiths and a performance by First Lady of Gospel Shirley Caesar; a thousand-person Martin Luther King Luncheon, which featured a keynote speech by Martin Luther King III and a performance by students of the Ron Clark Academy; an inaugural parade viewing from the Marriott's 12th Floor Terrace; the main inaugural ball, which featured a performance by legendary jazz singer Jean Carne; and the youth balls that were held on the 12th floor terrace. Letters of welcome were also issued by both President-Elect Barack Obama and Mayor Adrian Fenty. The People's Project Since the People's Inaugural Project, The Stafford Foundation has continued its investment in underserved people through continued outreach. The Peoples' Project 2010 national initiative, launched with the assistance of friend and supporter Bill Cosby focused on \\"Doing Good\\". The People's Project encompasses initiatives through grants that support programs with viable nonprofits groups aligned with TSF's mission. Since the fall of 2009, TSF has supported the work of 30 organizations with grants totaling more than $1 million.https://www.thestaffordfoundation.org/how-we-help.html These groups provide programs that include homeless shelters that provide job training and a facility that provides employment to the severely disabled. The Doing Good campaign In January 2010, The Stafford Foundation (TSF) launched a national movement to motivate people to help others in need by Doing Good. Comedian and educator Bill Cosby stood alongside Earl W. Stafford, TSF chairman and CEO, to announce the launch of the Doing Good campaign. Stafford and Cosby unveiled a national public service announcement featuring Cosby promoting the initiative. The Doing Good campaign is based on a simple principle: to help those in need become self-reliant so that they will in turn be inspired to help others. The effort focuses on ways to help people with job-training, health and wellness, and mission-based support. The campaign will result in bringing support and services to people in need to help them become self-sufficient and live in dignity. The impact ranges from supporting women's homeless shelters that also provide job training to helping low-income families have healthy diets. TSF recognizes that many people want to do good, but simply don't know how. The Doing Good campaign is based on a simple principle: to help those in need become self-reliant so that they will in turn be inspired to help others. It is TSF's goal to help others learn how to help themselves, so that one day they may be capable of helping someone else in need.

Leishman was the mastermind behind the largest gold theft in Canadian history. After being caught and arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Leishman managed to escape twice, before being caught and serving the remainder of his various sentences.Barnes 2008, pp. 104‚Äì110. In December 1979, while flying a mercy flight to Thunder Bay, Leishman's aircraft crashed about north of Thunder Bay.\\"Presumed dead, Flying Bandit 'alive'.\\" The Montreal Gazette, September 26, 1980. Early life Leishman was born on June 20, 1931 in the town of Holland, Manitoba. Coming from a troubled home, he dropped out of school prior to graduation, and worked various jobs before marrying Elva Shields at the age of 17. Sometime in the summer of 1951, Leishman started working as a travelling mechanic for Machine Industries, repairing straw cutters in southern Manitoba. In 1952, he was able to purchase an Aeronca aircraft, using it to fly to the farms he needed to work at, as well as making additional money selling short rides in the aircraft. At some point in the next five years, Machine Industries closed its doors, and Leishman started working for Queen Anne Cookware. He continued working with them until November 1957, when they went bankrupt.\\"Documentaries:'Ken Leishman: The Flying Bandit'.\\" Telefilm Canada. Retrieved: January 21, 2016. Criminal career=First theft On December 17, 1957, Leishman, by posing as a friend of the manager, robbed the Toronto- Dominion Bank on the corner of Yonge Street and Albert in Toronto, Ontario. He got away with $10,000. This was accomplished by arranging to meet the manager to talk about a business loan. Once inside the manager's office, with the door closed for privacy, he produced a gun, and had the manager write him a cheque for $10,000. After receiving the cheque, and questioning the manager for personal information about himself, his family and friends, he coerced the manager into taking him over to a bank teller, and having the cheque cashed. The knowledge gained from the questioning was used to appear as though he was a close friend of the manager. After getting the money, under the pretense of getting a drink, Leishman took the manager with him to the getaway car, then let him go. Second theft Three months later, on March 16, 1958, Leishman attempted to rob the C.I.B.C. bank on the corner of Yonge Street and Bloor, in Toronto. This time, he was not successful, as the manager, Howard Mason, upon sight of the gun, did not acquiesce to his request. As Leishman attempted to escape the bank, he was tripped by a female customer, before being tackled by a teller less than a block from the bank, and was arrested. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, to be served at Stony Mountain Penitentiary.Schroeder 1997, p. 172. Leishman was paroled on December 21, 1961, and for a time, to support his family, worked as a door-to-door salesman. By 1966, however, with his family having grown to seven children, the income provided by legitimate work was insufficient, and Leishman needed to find another means of supporting his family, reverting to a life of crime. The Great Gold Heist On his most famous heist, Leishman and four accomplices stole almost $385,000 (just over $2.5 million 2009 dollars) in gold bullion being transported by TransAir to Winnipeg where it would be shipped via Air Canada to Ottawa, Ontario. While watching aircraft at Winnipeg International Airport as a form of inexpensive entertainment, Leishman had occasionally seen gold shipments from Red Lake being flown into the airport for transport via Air Canada to the mint in Ottawa.Barnes 2008, p. 106. While incarcerated in Stony Mountain Penitentiary, he formed the basics of the idea. Leishman recruited four people to be accomplices in the heist. Harry Backlin, a Winnipeg lawyer who had befriended Leishman in Stony Mountain was to provide financial backing. John Berry, and Richard Grenkow were recruited to be the ones to actually get the gold, as Leishman was too well known to the police to take the gold himself. Grenkow's brother Paul was recruited to go to Red Lake in the guise of a salesman to watch for a large shipment to leave. In addition to this preparation, Leishman also prepared fake Air Canada coveralls by purchasing some winter coveralls, and stenciling the Air Canada logo onto them. Lastly, he acquired some Air Canada waybills from the Air Canada desk at the airport by simply waiting until the desk was unmanned at lunch, and taking what he needed.Schroeder 1997, p. 161. On March 1, 1966, the lookout called Leishman to report a large shipment of gold was being delivered. The team put their plan into action. Wearing the fake Air Canada coveralls, Rick and John stole one of the Air Canada trucks, and drove to the tarmac to meet the arriving TransAir aircraft carrying the gold shipment. Pretending to be Air Canada staff, they explained that there had been a change of plans, as there was a charter flight leaving in an hour, and Air Canada wanted to ship the gold out immediately, rather than waiting on the normal flight. As the two were driving an Air Canada truck, had Air Canada uniforms, and had what appeared to be a valid waybill for the shipment, their ruse worked, and the gold was loaded into their truck, and they drove off with the gold. The gold was then transferred into Leishman's car, and driven to the house of Harry Backlin, his lawyer, who was on vacation with his family. The gold ingots were loaded into his freezer.Dreidger, Mary Lou. \\"Account by the lawyer retained to defend Backlin.\\" maryloudriedger2.wordpress.com, March 21, 2012. Retrieved: January 21, 2016. The plan was to leave the gold there overnight, prior to moving it to a farm in Treherne, belonging to Leishman's uncle, but a blizzard on March 3 and 4 prevented them from recovering it.Redekop 2002, pp. 81‚Äì82. Since Backlin had distanced himself from the heist, the gold could not stay there. Most of the gold bars ended up buried in Backlin's backyard, but were soon unearthed by the local police force who were investigating all of Leishman's suspected associates. Later life Imprisoned again as a result of the gold heist and awaiting trial, Leishman, assisted by some accomplices, managed to escape from Headingley Jail in September, 1966, and stole an aircraft from Steinbach, Manitoba, reinforcing his reputation as the \\"Flying Bandit.\\" Leishman and his accomplices were arrested after a shootout in Gary, Indiana. In 1975, after his release from prison, Leishman moved to Red Lake, Ontario to manage Tomahawk Airlines. He was a \\"model citizen\\", even being nominated as a candidate for Reeve of the community. Leishman disappeared while on a mercy flight in 1979 and was declared officially dead in 1980.Redekop 2002, pp. 89‚Äì90.

A singer- songwriter, he plays guitar, as well as mandolin, bass guitar, and other instruments. He studied music at Roosevelt University. There he met Corky Siegel, and became interested in blues music. Schwall and Siegel formed a blues duo in 1964, playing at Chicago bars and clubs. They performed regularly at Pepper's Lounge and at Big John's, where well known, established blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Willie Dixon would often sit in. The duo expanded to a quartet and became the Siegel-Schwall Band. Schwall's amplified Gibson B-25 acoustic guitar was a distinctive component of the band's sound. The Siegel-Schwall Band became quite popular, and by 1967 were touring nationally, performing at large venues like the Fillmore West and sharing the bill with well-known rock bands. Between 1966 and 1974, they released ten albums. They were also noted for their collaborations with Seiji Ozawa, combining blues with classical music. After 1974, they disbanded, but the band re-formed in 1987. They still play occasional live dates and have released two albums of new material. Schwall is the leader of his own blues- rock band, the Jim Schwall Band. This band formed in the mid-1970s, and has continued playing live on an intermittent basis to the present time. Schwall has also been involved in numerous other musical projects. He plays guitar and accordion in the band So Dang Yang, and is the bassist for the Cajun Strangers. He holds a PhD in musical composition from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1993, and has taught music at the college level. Photography Jim Schwall is also a professional photographer, and has done many different types of photography. In recent years he has worked at creating art prints that combine human figures and natural landscapes. He sometimes uses a 19th-century photographic technique known as non-silver printing that predates the gelatin silver process. Political activism Schwall has been active in progressive political causes. In 2002 he ran for mayor of Madison, Wisconsin.

A native of Moesia in the northern Balkans, and probably of mixed Roman and Gothic or Scythian barbarian descent, he followed his father into the imperial army, and by 513 had become a senior commander in Thrace. In that year he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518), whose fiscal stringency and promotion of Miaphysitism were widely unpopular, and allowed Vitalian to quickly win over large parts of the army and the people of Thrace to his cause. After scoring a series of victories over loyalist armies, Vitalian came to threaten Constantinople itself, and forced Anastasius to officially recant his adoption of Miaphysitism in summer 515. Soon after, however, as Anastasius failed to honour some of the terms of the agreement, Vitalian marched on Constantinople, only to be decisively defeated by Anastasius' admiral, Marinus. Vitalian fled to his native Thrace and remained in hiding until Anastasius's death in 518. As a staunch promoter of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, he was pardoned by the new emperor Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527) and was engaged in the negotiations with the Pope to end the Acacian Schism. He was named consul for the year 520, but was murdered shortly after, probably on the orders of Justin's nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565), who saw in him a potential rival for the throne. His sons also became generals in the East Roman army. Biography=Origins and family Vitalian was born in Zaldapa in Lower Moesia (usually identified with modern Abrit in north-eastern Bulgaria).. He is called a \\"Goth\\" or a \\"Scythian\\" in the Byzantine sources. Since Vitalian's mother was a sister of Macedonius II, Patriarch of Constantinople in 496‚Äì511, this points to a mixed marriage and a probable barbarian origin for his father, Patriciolus... On the other hand, the assertion that he was a \\"Goth\\" is based on a single Syriac source, and is today considered dubious.. Likewise, the \\"Scythian\\" label commonly applied to him by some contemporary authors is non-conclusive, since the term \\"Scythian\\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply, in the classicizing language usual in Byzantine texts, someone from the north-eastern fringes of the Graeco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean; the term had a wide- encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.. Furthermore, since none of the \\"Scythian Monks\\", to whom Vitalian and members of his family seem to have been related, expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritually, with the Arian Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Vitalian is questionable.. Whatever Patriciolus's origin, his name was Latin, while of Vitalian's own sons, the generals Bouzes and Coutzes had Thracian names and Venilus a Gothic name. His nephew, John, later also became a distinguished general in the wars against the Ostrogoths of Italy... According to the chroniclers' descriptions, Vitalian was short of stature and stammered, but his personal bravery and military skills were widely acknowledged... Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised Dacian-Getic (Thracian) stock, born in Scythia Minor or in Moesia; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.Patrick Amory, People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489‚Äì554, Cambridge University Press, 2003. Revolt against Anastasius Gold semissis of Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518). Vitalian is first mentioned in 503, when he accompanied his father in the Anastasian War against the Persians. By 513, he had risen to the rank of comes in Thrace, possibly comes foederatorum, \\"count of the foederati\\", barbarian soldiers serving in the East Roman army. From this post, he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518), taking advantage of widespread resentment over the emperor's military, religious, and social policies. In 511, Anastasius had changed the form of the Trisagion prayer and officially adopted the Miaphysite dogma, angering the Empire's Chalcedonian population, and adding to the disaffection caused by his strict financial policies.. Furthermore, Anastasius had refused to supply the annonae (\\"rations, provisions\\") due to the foederati, allowing Vitalian to quickly gain the allegiance of the regular troops stationed in the provinces of Thrace, Moesia II, and Scythia Minor from the unpopular magister militum per Thracias, Anastasius' nephew Hypatius. Hypatius's subordinate commanders were either killed or joined the rebellion.. At the same time, posing as a champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was able to gain the support of the local people, who flocked to join his force. According to contemporary Byzantine historians, he quickly assembled an army of 50,000‚Äì60,000 men, \\"both soldiers and peasants\\", and marched on Constantinople, possibly hoping that the mostly Chalcedonian inhabitants would join him.. Indeed, it appears that Vitalian's revolt was primarily motivated by religious reasons, something suggested by his repeatedly demonstrated willingness to reach an accommodation with Anastasius.. To counter Vitalian's propaganda, Anastasius ordered bronze crosses to be set up on the city walls inscribed with his own version of events. The emperor also reduced taxes in the provinces of Bithynia and Asia to prevent them from joining the rebellion. When Vitalian's forces reached the capital, they encamped at the suburb of Hebdomon and blockaded the landward side of the city. Anastasius opted for negotiations, and sent out Vitalian's former patron, the former consul and magister militum praesentalis Patricius, as ambassador.. To him, Vitalian declared his aims: the restoration of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and the settling of the Thracian army's grievances. Patricius then invited him and his officers in the city itself for negotiations. Vitalian refused for himself, but allowed his senior officers to go on the next day.. The officers were well treated by Anastasius, who gave them gifts and promised that their soldiers' grievances would be settled. He also pledged to submit the religious dispute for resolution to the Patriarch of Rome. Upon their return to the rebel camp, these officers unanimously pressured Vitalian to accept this settlement. Faced with no alternative, only eight days after his arrival before the capital, Vitalian retreated and returned with his men to Lower Moesia... Map of the Diocese of Thrace, the theatre of operations during Vitalian's rebellion. Anastasius then appointed as magister militum per Thracias an officer called Cyril, who proceeded to attack Vitalian's forces. After a few inconclusive skirmishes, Vitalian managed to bribe his army's entry into Odessus, Cyril's base, at night. Cyril was captured at his residence and killed.. At this point, Anastasius had Vitalian declared a \\"public enemy\\" and sent out a huge new army ‚Äì reportedly 80,000 men ‚Äì under Hypatius, with a Hun called Alathar as the new magister militum of Thrace. After winning a minor initial victory, the imperial army was eventually pushed back towards Odessus (autumn 513). At Acris, on the Black Sea coast, Vitalian's men attacked their fortified laager in darkness and dealt them a crushing defeat: the larger part of the imperial army was killed, and both imperial commanders were taken prisoner and held for ransom.. The victory consolidated Vitalian's position. With the spoils, he was able to lavishly reward his followers, and at the news of the imperial army's annihilation, the remaining cities and forts in Lower Moesia and Scythia surrendered to him. Soon after, he had another stroke of luck: at Sozopolis, his men captured an embassy sent by Anastasius to ransom Hypatius, including the ransom money of 1,100 pounds of gold. Hypatius, whom Vitalian hated because he had once insulted his wife, was not released until a year later.. In 514, Vitalian marched again towards Constantinople, this time gathering, in addition to his army, a fleet of 200 vessels from the Black Sea ports, which sailed down the Bosporus menacing the city from the sea as well. Anastasius was further disquieted by riots in the city, which left many casualties, and resolved to once again negotiate with Vitalian. Vitalian accepted, on the conditions of his nomination to the post of magister militum per Thracias and the receipt of ransom money and gifts worth 5,000 pounds of gold for the release of Hypatius. Anastasius also acceded to the removal of the changes from the Trisagion, the restoration of the deposed Chalcedonian bishops, and the convocation of a general church council at Constantinople on 1 July 515.; . The council never materialized, since Pope Hormisdas and Anastasius continued to be at loggerheads over the Acacian Schism. Neither were the deposed bishops returned to their sees. Seeing Anastasius failing to honour his promises, in late 515 Vitalian mobilized his army and marched again towards Constantinople.. Vitalian's army captured the suburb of Sycae (modern Galata) across the Golden Horn from the city and encamped there. The two magistri militum praesentalis, Patricius and John, were unwilling to engage their old friend Vitalian, thus Anastasius gave command of his forces to the former praetorian prefect of the East, Marinus, a trusted and influential aide. Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to the report of John Malalas, this was achieved through the use of a sulphur-based chemical substance invented by the philosopher Proclus of Athens, similar to the later Greek fire. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night.; . As a sign of his victory, Anastasius led a procession to the village of Sosthenion, where Vitalian had established his headquarters, and attended a service of thanks at the famed local church dedicated to the Archangel Michael.. Later life Once back in northern Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, while many of his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. Nothing is known of him for the next three years, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to indicate that he resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius's life. When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I, the comes excubitorum (commander of the imperial bodyguard). The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.. Upon his arrival, Vitalian was made magister militum in praesenti, named honorary consul, and soon after raised to the rank of patricius.. As a well-known champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was to play a role in the new regime's reaffirmation of the Chalcedonian doctrines and reconciliation with Rome. He played an active role in the negotiations with the Pope, and in 519, he was one of the prominent men who escorted a papal delegation into the capital.; . Vitalian also took vengeance on the staunchly Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, Severus, who had celebrated Vitalian's defeat in his panegyric On Vitalian the tyrant and on the victory of the Christ-loving Anastasius the king: Justin ordered Severus's tongue to be cut out, and Severus fled to Egypt along with Julian, Bishop of Halicarnassus.. Finally in 520, Vitalian was appointed ordinary consul for the year, sharing the office with Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565). Thus, in July of the same year he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus.. The month of Vitalian's death is taken from the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes, sub anno 520. Alan Cameron discussed the supporting evidence, concluding that Marcellinus is correct. According to John of Nikiou, he was killed because he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession..

It was the last novel Thackeray completed, and harks back to several of his previous ones, involving as it does characters from A Shabby Genteel Story and being, like The Newcomes, narrated by the title character of his Pendennis. In recent years it has not found as much favour from either readers or critics as Thackeray's early novels.H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. 54, p. 201.  Synopsis  Philip Firmin, son of Dr. Brand Firmin and of Lord Ringwood's wealthy niece, has been left a fortune at the death of his mother. He discovers that his father is being blackmailed by Tufton Hunt, a clergyman who once performed a sham marriage ceremony between Brandon and Caroline Gann (as related in A Shabby Genteel Story). Hunt now claims that the marriage was in fact valid, and urges Caroline to assert her rights and disinherit Philip by proving him illegitimate. Caroline, who is now working as a nurse and in this capacity has brought Philip through a serious illness, refuses to do this. Dr Firmin loses Philip's money and his own through unwise speculation and flees to America, and Philip's fianc√©e Agnes Twysden renounces him in favour of a wealthier rival. Philip now meets General Baynes, one of the trustees of his lost fortune, and falls in love with the General's daughter Charlotte. He marries her, in the teeth of her mother's opposition, and struggles to support her by becoming a journalist. His troubles are ended when the lost will of his great-uncle, Lord Ringwood, is discovered, and he is found to be the heir to the old man's riches.  Publishing history and reception  The Adventures of Philip was first published as a serial in the Cornhill Magazine (of which Thackeray was the editor) between January 1861 and August 1862, with illustrations by the author and Frederick Walker.Dominic Head (ed.) The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 866. It then appeared in book form published by Smith, Elder & Co. in three volumes in 1862, dedicated 'in grateful remembrance of old friendship and kindness' to Thackeray's friend Matthew James Higgins. The Leipzig firm of Bernhard Tauchnitz issued it the same year in two volumes.Catalogue entry at Copac. Critical reception of the book was on the whole not good, many reviewers suggesting that the author had written himself out. The anonymous notice in the Saturday Review, for example, claimed that Thackeray's readers \\"ask him for something from his pen; what it is they do not care; and as he really has no other method of easily satisfying them, he gives them reminiscences of his old novels in profusion.\\" Walter Bagehot, in The Spectator, said, \\"As far as 'plot' is concerned, Philip is a failure. No one of all its most numerous readers has probably read it with eager interest as a story.\\" Geoffrey Tillotson and Donald Hawes William Thackeray: The Critical Heritage (London: Routledge, 1995) pp. 310, 306. Nevertheless, Thackeray's fans must have found something to enjoy, since the book was reprinted frequently up the First World War. It fell into general neglect thereafter, very few reprints having been called for during the past 100 years, but in 2008 The Adventures of Philip was issued by Cambridge Scholars Publishing as volumes 12 and 13 of their edition of Thackeray's Complete Works, and a critical edition with commentary by Judith Law Fisher was published by the University of Michigan Press in 2010.Catalogue entry at Copac; Description at the University of Michigan Press website.

The baju kurung (Jawi: ÿ®ÿßÿ¨Ÿà ŸÉŸàÿ±Ÿà⁄†) is a traditional Malay costume which loosely translated as \\"enclosed dress\\". This type of costume is the national dress of Malaysia. In Indonesia, it is, one of the many regional dresses of this culturally and ethnically diverse country, seen most on the island of Sumatra, where many ethnic Malay and Minangkabau women wear it. It can also be seen in Singapore and Thailand. History The early baju kurung was longer and looser. It was popularised in the late 19th century by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor. It has been reported that the baju kurung has \\"not only survived, but prospered\\" in modern Malaysia, pointing to its popularity during the Islamisation of Malaysia in the 1970s and 1980s. Features Malaya, circa 1950. Although baju kurung is the generic name of the attire for both males and females, in Malaysia, the female dress is referred to as baju kurung while the male dress is referred to as baju melayu. Two versions of the costume are popular. One is the baju kurung teluk belanga and the other is the baju kurung cekak musang. The main difference between these two fashion styles is the style of cut at the neck, where the teluk belanga style has no collar and the neckline is stitched in the style known as tulang belut (\\"eel's spines or bones\\"). The baju kurung teluk belanga originated, as its name implies, from Teluk Belanga, in the island of Singapore, which was previously the capital of the state of Johor. On the other hand, the cekak musang style has a standing collar with holes for five buttons including two buttons for the collar. Baju melayu for men The cekak musang shirt also normally has three pockets ‚Äì two at the bottom, and one at the upper left breast. The teluk belanga shirt normally has only two pockets both at the bottom. The baju melayu is a loosely fitting shirt with long sleeves, worn with long pants with a sampin which is wrapped around the middle of the body from the stomach to the knee and sometimes lower. This sampin is usually a three-quarter length or full sarong-style cloth made of kain songket, tenun pahang diraja or other woven materials with traditional patterns. Baju kurung for women A Palembangese styled Baju Kurung. A baju kurung is a loose-fitting full length dress, consisting of a skirt and a blouse. The skirt is made from a long cloth with foldings on one side; the blouse is collarless, has long sleeves, and extends to between the hips and knees. It is sometimes made of silk, imported from Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Turkey or India, or from the Malaysian states of Terengganu or Kelantan. The modern baju kurung commonly uses lively colours and geometric patterns. Traditionalists prefer fabric from peninsular Malaysia's eastern states of Terengganu and Kelantan, where the culture of batik and other hand- designed fabrics is still strong. A woman will often wear a baju kurung with a headscarf (a tudung) in the more conservative states in northern Malaysia. Cultural significance The baju kurung is also worn by female non-Malays (including Malaysia's ethnic Chinese, Indian and Native Bornean minorities). This can be partially due to the baju kurung being one of the approved styles of dress for female civil servants and one of the approved styles of uniform for female school students. However, its peak sales occur in the month of Ramadan on the Muslim calendar, mostly due to the upcoming \\"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\\" (malay for Eid al-Fitr) after Ramadan ends which is celebrated by Muslims worldwide.

He was educated at King's College London and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1867. In 1874 he married Henrietta Gulland of Newton Wemyss, Fife. He established a conveyancing and equity practice, and \\"took silk\\" to become a Queen's Counsel in 1888, and attached himself to the court of Mr Justice Chitty. In 1892 he was selected to contest the South Western or Walthamstow Division of Essex as the candidate of the Conservative Party. He was elected, and retained the seat with an increased majority at the ensuing election in 1895. In January 1897 Mr Justice Chitty retired, and Byrne was selected to fill the vacancy as a judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. This required him to resign his seat in parliament. He was knighted in May of the same year. He continued to sit at the High Court until shortly before his death. He died at his London home, 33 Lancaster Gate, from acute bronchitis and pneumonia. He was buried at Brookwood Cemetery. Family Byrne married Henrietta Johnstone, on 13 August 1874.

Early life and service Albert Dossenbach was born on 5 June 1891 at Sankt Blasien in the Grand Duchy of Baden. Dossenbach was a medical student (member of ‚ÄûBurschenschaft Alemannia Freiburg‚Äú) working as an intern when World War I began in 1914. He joined the Imperial German Army as the war began and almost immediately became a lance corporal. Within his first month of his service, he carried his wounded commanding officer from the battlefield under fire. This feat won him the Iron Cross Second Class. His valor continued, as he won the First Class Iron Cross, the Military Merit Order, and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was then commissioned as a leutnant in January 1915.Franks et al 1993, p. 101. Flying service In early 1916, he transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte. He trained in Poznan and in Cologne, and graduated from Jastaschule in June. His first assignment as a pilot was in June to FA 22, a reconnaissance unit flying on the Western Front. With Leutnant Hans Schilling as his observer/gunner in an Albatros C.III reconnaissance craft, he began to rack up victories; by 27 September 1916, his tally was eight. However, they were shot down during their eighth victory, with Dossenbach suffering burns that sidelined him. Dossenbach's valor earned him further honors; on 20 October 1916, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern. The Pour le Merite, or Blue Max, was awarded to him on 11 November 1916; it was the first of only two ever awarded to a two-seater pilot.The Pour le Merite website http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Retrieved 22 January 2013. While Dossenbach healed, Schilling had been assigned to fly with another pilot, and was killed in December 1916.Franks et al 1993 p. 198. On 9 December, Dossenbach received the Knight's Cross of his native Baden's Karl Friedrich Military Merit Order. Dossenbach scored once more with FA 22 before being transferred on 9 February 1917 to the famed Royal Prussian Jasta 2 (Jasta Boelcke) to train as a fighter pilot. Upon graduation, on 22 February 1917, he was appointed to command Royal Prussian Jasta 36. He began the new squadron's victory list by scoring five times during Bloody April, 1917. One of these triumphs, on 13 April 1917, was over French ace Marcel Nogues. On 2 May 1917, Dossenbach was wounded during a bombing raid; the wound removed him from command. Upon recovery, he requested his return to active duty. As a result, he took command of Royal Prussian Jasta 10 on 21 June 1917. He then turned balloon buster for his 15th and final victory on 27 June 1917. Death in action On 3 July 1917, Dossenbach's plane was set afire during a dogfight with four British machines, as he was shot down by Captain Laurence Minot and observer in an Airco DH.4 of No. 57 Squadron RFC. Dossenbach departed the flaming wreckage in midair as it fell. Leutnant Albert Dossenbach was buried in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.

In the volume, all the stories featuring Nick Adams, published in various collections during Hemingway's lifetime, are compiled in a single collection. The Nick Adams Stories includes 24 stories and sketches, eight of which were previously unpublished.

There, she appears as a high school student who starts investigating a dimension labeled as the TV World alongside her friends. The kidnapping of her best friend Yukiko Amagi leads Chie to join the Investigation Team in working in a murder case where the victims are sent to the TV World to be killed by creatures known as Shadows. Besides printed and animated adaptations of the Persona 4 game, Chie has also appeared in the fighting games Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, the dungeon crawler Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, and the rhythm game Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Critical reception to the character has been positive due to both of her fighting and feminine traits. However, critics were differing when commenting the English voice acting from Chie featured in the games. Concept and characteristics Chie is an upbeat girl with an obsession with kung fu, even using those techniques in battle. Chie serves as the player's Social Link to The Chariot; this is symbolized in the animated series by Yu's usage of the Persona . Writer Patrick Hayes stated that her Shadow \\"represents her desire to maintain dominance over Yukiko in their relationship as well as her jealousy of Yukiko's feminine qualities and skills.\\" In the designing of the character, various sketches were made with some of them being reminiscent to previous Persona characters. She is voiced by Yui Horie in Japanese. In English, she is voiced by Tracey Rooney for Persona 4, and Erin Fitzgerald provides her English voice for all other appearances. Minami Tsukui portrays her in the musical. A limited edition of Persona 4 Arena featured the buttons Chie wore in Persona 4 as a bonus. Appearances Chie first appears in the 2008 video game Persona 4, where she and her friends Yu Narukami and Yosuke Hanamura discover a world within the TV and meet a creature named Teddie and discover that someone is throwing people into the television which eventually leads to their death. Although initially reluctant, she goes into the TV world when her best friend Yukiko Amagi is thrown in, putting her in danger. There, Chie encounters her Shadow who represents her jealousy of Yukiko's feminine side and talents, as well as her wish and need to maintain control over Yukiko. With Yu and Yosuke's help, Chie confronts her other self and joins the Investigation Team. Following the encounter with her Shadow, Chie receives the Persona , a muscular female figure wearing a yellow outfit and armed with a naginata, that she uses in combat while she performs kicks. Throughout Yu's interactions with Chie (which can also be intimate), she discovers that she genuinely wanted to protect Yukiko without any underlying selfish motivations. After this, Tomoe evolves into , whose yellow jumpsuit turns black and is decked in silver samurai armor. The desire to protect people eventually inspires her to seek a career as a police officer. In the re-release Persona 4: Golden, Chie's Persona can evolve to a third level to become , which has golden armor and a long flowing cape. A promotional flash game for Persona 4 allowed players to \\"sneak a sexy peek\\" at Chie while she is in a hot springs. She is playable in Persona 4 Arena alongside Tomoe Gozen; In Persona 4 Arena, Chie joins Yu, Yosuke and Yukiko to investigate the TV world after seeing the Midnight Channel. When she enters, she is forced to fight her friends as well as a man, Akihiko Sanada. She also appears in Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, and in Persona 4: Dancing All Night. On October 20, 2017, it was confirmed by Arc System Works that Chie would appear in the upcoming fighting game BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle. It was further confirmed on January 13, 2018 that Chie would be in the base game. Reception Games journalist Leigh Alexander of Polygon felt that Chie was her favourite character due to her interest in strong women. She also cited her final Social Link sequence where she \\"realises that dedicating yourself to personal growth is cowardice, and that it's all meaningless unless you turn around and start fighting ‚Äî start /using/ this strength you've amassed.\\" Robert Boyd, creator of Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World, ranked Chie as the second best \\"JRPG warrior heroine.\\" He justified the ranking by saying that she \\"kicks things to death\\" and called her a \\"great foil to the main character‚Äôs best friend, Yosuke.\\" Chie was named GamesRadar's favourite Persona 4 character. Kotaku's Mike Fahey called Chie his favourite Persona 4 character and discussed \\"swoon[ing] over\\" her. Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton felt that Persona 4 featured more depth to its characters than its predecessor Persona 3. The writer cited Chie's \\"fear for her friend Yukiko and desire to be seen as feminine\\" as an example of this. He also compared her to Velma Dinkley from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! Bajo of the website \\"Good Game Stories\\" praised Chie's \\"spirited\\" personality. Critical reception to both of Chie's English voice actresses have been mixed. While reviewing Persona 4, IGN's Jeff Haynes felt that Tracey Rooney's delivery as Chie sounded at times like a 30-year-old woman instead of a teenager. Reviewing the same game, RPGamer's Michael Cunningham felt that Rooney felt \\"a little stiff\\" during battle lines, but was fine elsewhere. While Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton was initially reluctant about Erin Fitzgerald while reviewing Persona 4 Golden, he eventually grew to like her. VG247's Johnny Cullen expressed excitement at the prospect of Chie's playability in Persona 4 Arena. In reviewing Persona 4 Golden, Destructoid's Dale North revealed he was not a fan of Fitzgerald's voice, due in part to the fact that he preferred Yui Horie, Chie's Japanese voice actress. RPGamer's senior reviews editor Adriaan den Oueden's initial impressions of Fitzgerald in his review of the same game were positive. She was also listed as the 10th best Persona character by Kimberley Wallace from Game Informer who commented \\"Chie remains one of the most likable characters to date\\". IGN also listed her as the eighth best Persona character, praising her upbeat personality and her interests.

It moved to many locations, but was most associated with Daventry, where its most famous pupil was Joseph Priestley. It had a high reputation, and in time it was amalgamated into New College London. History An academy was started in Kibworth around 1715, and moved at some point to Market Harborough, where Philip Doddridge was chosen as its principal. The academy moved to Northampton in 1729. The academy attracted the support of the Coward Trust, funded through the philanthropy of William Coward (died 1738), a London merchant who used his money to train ministers for the \\"protestant dissenters\\". After the death of Doddridge in 1751, the trustees took over the academy. In 1752 the academy was moved to Daventry, back to Northampton, then to Wymondley, and finally in 1833 to London. Northampton While known as the Northampton Academy, several notable English Unitarian ministers were trained there, including Hugh Farmer and Lant Carpenter who studied there for a year in 1797, before the academy was closed by the trustees in 1798. When the school returned to Northampton in 1789, it was run by John Horsey with various assistant tutors. It had 38 or 39 students. The school, which was supposed to teach an Arian Christology, was probably closed due to growing Socinian influence in the Northampton Academy.Larsen, Timothy, A People of One Book: The Bible and the Victorians 2011 \\"Lant Carpenter recurringly found himself in Unitarian contexts in which he was considered the liberal. At the age of seventeen, he entered Northampton Academy. Here, Arianism was taught (the belief that Jesus was the incarnation of a pre-existent, exalted being who is, ... Lant Carpenter, however, was identified as 'a determined Socinian' ... This conviction was so radical that the trustees eventually took the drastic step of shutting Northampton Academy down for a period in order to keep the liberal, Socinian virus from infecting more students.\\" In the second quarter of the 18th century, it was \\"undoubtedly one of the best dissenting academies\\" according to Priestley's most recent biographers.Joseph Priestley, scientist, philosopher, and theologian. Ed. Isabel Rivers and David L. Wykes. OUP: 2008, p 26 Subsequently The academy later moved to Little Wymondley in Hertfordshire, in 1799, where it was known as Wymondley College. In 1833, it relocated again, this time to London, and was re-named Coward College. That proved to be the last incarnation as in 1850 it merged with Highbury College and Homerton College to form New College London. Principals and alumni Two of its principals were the Rev. Thomas Morell and Dr. Thomas William Jenkyn.'Coward College, Byng Place', Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road & neighbourhood (1949), pp. 91.

Joseph Priestley studied theology there in the 1750s. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip the first two years of coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasized the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.McEvoy, John G., \\"Enlightenment and Dissent in Science: Joseph Priestley and the Limits of Theoretical Reasoning\\".

In most versions of the Captain Marvel / Shazam! franchise, the Rock of Eternity is a cavern at the end of an abandoned subway tunnel which serves as the source of the character's power as the residence of his benefactor, the wizard Shazam - as well as seven statues representing the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man, which the keeper(s) of the Shazam power are tasked with watching and protecting humanity against. It first appears in The Marvel Family #1 (December 1945). Issue #7 (December 1947) further explores the Rock of Eternity in the story \\"The Marvel Family Reaches Eternity\\". The Rock of Eternity appeared in the 2019 film Shazam!, set in the DC Extended Universe. Fictional location history In the context of the original Fawcett stories published from 1940 to 1953, the Rock of Eternity is the lair of the Wizard Shazam, the ancient Egyptian mage who grants Captain Marvel and his Marvel Family associates Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. with their powers. Resembling a large, barren mountain and positioned at the center of space and time, the wizard's spirit remained at the Rock after his death during the initial creation of Captain Marvel, as depicted in Whiz Comics #2 (February 1940). He had previously lived in an underground lair on Earth, accessible by a magic subway car, which included his throne and imprisoned stone personifications of the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. Following the wizard's death, lighting the brazier in the underground lair would summon Shazam's spirit from the Rock of Eternity; alternately, the Marvels could choose to journey to the Rock itself by flying faster than the speed of light. Surrounding the Rock were mists representing space and time; navigating through them could allow the Marvels to travel to specific locations in time and space. After a lawsuit from DC Comics forced Fawcett Comics to cease publication of all Captain Marvel-related material in 1953, DC later elected to license the Captain Marvel properties from Fawcett. The Rock of Eternity is used as a locale in some of the 1970s-1980s DC Captain Marvel stories - published under the title Shazam! due to trademark issues with a \\"Captain Marvel\\" character that was published by Marvel Comics after Fawcett's Captain Marvel was out of publication. As it is located at the center of space and time in these stories, the Rock allowed the Marvels and other DC Characters to travel between the various dimensions of DC's Multiverse and travel to the company's various super-hero characters' alternate worlds.DC Comics Presents Annual #3 (1984). DC Comics. A 1994 reboot of Captain Marvel by Jerry Ordway under the title The Power of Shazam! featured prominent usage of The Rock of Eternity, merging it and Shazam's earthly underground lair so that the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man (later referred to by the more common Seven Deadly Sins) were now imprisoned at the Rock of Eternity along with many other demons captured by the Wizard Shazam. The Marvels now gained access to the Rock by using the subway car or by magic teleportation.The Power of Shazam! #5 (August 1995). DC Comics. The Rock of Eternity now resembled a giant stone diamond suspended in the middle of the mists of space and time; in one Power of Shazam! story, it was relayed as having been formed by the Wizard Shazam under his original persona as The Champion, the civilized world's first superhero, by taking a piece of stone from heaven and a mating slab from hell.The Power of Shazam! #10 (January 1996). DC Comics. A 2005 comic book miniseries, Day of Vengeance, features the Spectre destroying the spirit of the Wizard Shazam, causing the Rock to lose its tether outside of space and time and explode over Gotham City, freeing the Sins and other evils.Day of Vengeance #6 (November 2005).

In this revised setup, the Rock was a magical palace atop a mountain visible as a locale several millennia ago in the ancient North African kingdom of Kahndaq. A council of seven Wizards ruled over all earthly magic from the Rock, dispatching champions to serve them on Earth by harnessing their powers. Black Adam, the champion of Council of Eternity lead wizard Shazam, went rogue and killed the other Wizards, leading Shazam to imprison Adam and hide the Rock and all magic from the world.

Parts of the libretto are considered analogous with the libretto for Giovanni Pacini's Adelaide e Comingio, and the final scene is based on the Fran√ßois-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud play Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges. Donizetti worked on the opera in late 1839‚Äîits final page is dated 27 December 1839. Because the subject matter involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France. The theater company Donizetti contracted went bankrupt; the opera was reworked as La favorite in September 1840. L'ange finally received its premiere in its original form in 2018 in a concert performance at London's Royal Opera House. Composition history=Sources L'ange de Nisida incorporated many of the manuscript pages from Adelaide, an unfinished score that Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti was probably working on in 1834, from a libretto of unknown origin. This libretto contained elements from the 1790 Parisian play Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges by Fran√ßois-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud. In his book Donizetti and his Operas, musicologist William Ashbrook states that the Adelaide libretto has similarities to that of the Giovanni Pacini opera Adelaide e Comingio, whose libretto was written by Gaetano Rossi. Donizetti is believed to have taken the manuscript for Adelaide to Paris in 1838. Because the subject matter of L'ange involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France. Additionally, in September 1839, the French press had announced La Fianc√©e du Tyrol, a translation of Donizetti's 1833 opera Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo. In October 1839, he wrote to a friend in Naples: \\"La Fianc√©e du Tyrol will be Il furioso amplified, L'ange de Nisida will be new.\\" Donizetti began work on L'ange shortly thereafter; La Fianc√©e du Tyrol never materialized. Composition Donizetti completed L'ange de Nisida on 27 December 1839, the date on the final page of the autograph score. He had been working on Le duc d'Albe, but postponed work on the half-completed score in favor of L'ange and La fille du r√©giment. Although Donizetti noted in correspondence to his close friend Tommaso Persico in Naples that L'ange was \\"an opera in three acts\\", both the autograph score and Donizetti's contract with Ant√©nor Joly, the owner of the theater company Donizetti contracted, make clear that L'ange had four acts. Regardless, Donizetti's letter has caused confusion among opera journalists and scholars. For example, The Musical Times journalist Winton Dean wrote of the Italian version of La favorite in 1979: \\"[I]t was expanded from an unperformed three-act French opera, L'ange de Nisida.\\" Ashbrook speculates that Donizetti may have considered the first two acts as one. Contract and cancellation On 5 January 1840, Donizetti signed a rehearsal and performance contract with his librettists and Ant√©nor Joly, who was operating a company named Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance and giving performances at the Salle Ventadour in Paris. Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance chose L'ange over Richard Wagner's Das Liebesverbot. Joly's company had premiered the French version of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor the previous year, and L'ange was meant to be its successor. The contract, which is on display at the Biblioth√®que-Mus√©e de l'Op√©ra National de Paris, stipulates that L'ange be performed uninterrupted twenty times unless three consecutive performances sold poorly, and that Joly could not premiere any other opera until the revenue from L'ange started to decline. The contract contains nothing about Donizetti's compensation; therefore, it is possible that another contract existed. L'ange was set to begin rehearsal on 1 February 1840. Donizetti had two other operas in various stages of preparation at other theaters during this time: Les martyrs and La fille du r√©giment. Later in January, Joly terminated all opera productions of the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance company due to financial hardship, despite a reported 5,000-franc loan from Donizetti. Joly tried to keep the operation afloat by staging ballets, but it closed completely in May 1840. He filed for bankruptcy and therefore avoided paying Donizetti the large fee owed for backing out of the production. Writing for the Cambridge Opera Journal, Mark Everist referred to L'ange as one of \\"the most spectacular casualties of the collapse of music drama at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance\\". Reworked as La favorite Donizetti managed to retrieve the score of L'ange de Nisida from Joly's company and reworked it as La favorite (now more commonly known by its Italian title, La favorita) in September 1840 for a December premiere in Italy. To circumvent the Italian censors Donizetti agreed to plot modifications; La favorite is about a medieval King of Castile. A souvenir libretto from La favorita The presence and influence of L'ange is evident in Donizetti's autograph score of La favorite, which features \\"large chunks\\" of L'ange \\"cut up and interleaved\\" in which new character names and text for La favorite overwrite the old. The final page of L'ange was used as the final page of La favorite; therefore, both operas bear the same finish date on the last page. Donizetti's contract for La favorite demanded a 1 December 1840 premiere, leaving him little time for dramatic changes. In his 1965 biography Donizetti, Ashbrook surmises that this tight deadline gave rise to the legend that Donizetti actually composed the last act of La favorite in a single night. In fact, the libretto of L'ange and the autograph score of La favorite make clear that the final act of La favorite was completed long before Donizetti began the rest of it in September‚ÄîDonizetti lifted it from L'ange with the exception of two solo passages. He brought in librettist Eug√®ne Scribe to oversee the new text, which also required the approval of starring mezzo-soprano Rosine Stoltz. The finished product was an amalgamation of the unfinished Adelaide, the never- performed L'ange de Nisida, and new material worked into the score by Donizetti and into the libretto by Scribe. La favorite premiered on 2 December 1840. Ashbrook has compared the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange provided for the latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to the first half of La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical. A transcription of the L'ange libretto is kept at the Fondazione Donizetti library in Bergamo, and was printed in a 2002 issue of the Italian-language journal for The Donizetti Society. 2018 premiere L'Ange de Nisida received its world premiere on 18 July 2018 in a concert performance at the Royal Opera House in London, in association with Opera Rara. The performance was conducted by Mark Elder with the title role sung by Joyce El-Khoury. The score was reconstructed over a period of eight years by musicologist Candida Mantica from pages discovered in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France which were scattered in 18 different folders as well as archive research in both Europe and the US. She eventually identified approximately 470 pages of the L'Ange de Nisida score written in Donizetti's hand. Roles As the opera never got to the rehearsal stage, little is known about the intended cast. In a letter to his close friend Tommaso Persico, Donizetti expressed his desire to give the title role to Juliette Bourgeois, a temperamental soprano who requested a large sum of money to perform in France.

Leone knows she is a noble but little else. While on Nisida, Leone encounters Don Gaspar, Chamberlain to King Fernand of Naples. After hearing Leone's plight, Don Gaspar convinces him to travel to Naples to have his exile lifted. Leone and Sylvia meet in Naples, at which time Leone discovers that she is actually Sylvia de Linares, the King's mistress. She declares her love for Leone but implores him to abandon her and his plans in Naples. When he refuses, the King discovers him and orders Don Gaspar to arrest and imprison him. The King expresses to Sylvia his desire that she wed him. However, agents of Rome have been plotting to banish the mistress from Naples. When the King, dismayed, offers to grant her any request, she asks that Leone be set free. A monk appears, brandishing the Papal bull and threatening to banish Sylvia if she remains a mistress to the King. The King plots with Don Gaspar to free Leone and wed him to Sylvia, although Leone would be sent away and Sylvia would remain the King's mistress. Leone and Sylvia marry, but when Leone discovers the plot, he breaks his sword in front of the King and leaves under the monk's escort. Leone is preparing to take his vows as a monk when Sylvia appears, having followed him disguised as a novice. When she confronts Leone and asks for forgiveness, he realizes his feelings and attempts to flee with her. Sylvia, who has been near death, dies at Leone's feet despite his calls for help.

While working for the Franco-American division of the Campbell Soup Company in 1965, he invented SpaghettiOs, and was thereafter known as \\"The Daddy-O of SpaghettiOs.\\" Biography Born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Goerke played for the Waukesha South High School basketball team that won the Wisconsin state championship in 1944. He served in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II and received a bachelor's degree from Carroll College after the war. He also received an M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin. Goerke began his career as a market researcher for Blatz Brewery in Wisconsin. He worked for the Campbell Soup Company for 35 years from 1955 until 1990. In the early 1960s, Goerke was marketing research director of Campbell's Franco-American division when he was tasked with developing a canned pasta that would appeal to children. Goerke's team reportedly considered and rejected pasta in the shapes of baseballs, cowboys, spacemen and stars. Goerke settled on the \\"O\\" shape to make the pasta more resilient to canning and reheating, provide easier consumption using a spoon, and minimize the mess associated with children eating long pasta. The product, promoted in commercials with Jimmie Rodgers singing the jingle, \\"The neat, round spaghetti you can eat with a spoon: Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs,\\" became a major success. Goerke attributed the product's enduring popularity with mothers and children to the fact that \\"it was 'spoonable' and didn't make a mess.\\" Goerke earned the nickname the \\"Daddy-O of SpaghettiOs\\", and served as a goodwill ambassador for the Campbell Soup Company. He appeared on the television program \\"What's My Line?\\". and \\"hobnobbed with celebrities\\" including President Ronald Reagan and Martha Stewart. He would occasionally autograph a can of SpaghettiOs and appeared on The Today Show to celebrate the 30th anniversary of SpaghettiOs. In his 35 years with Campbell Soup Company, Goerke also created the company's \\"Chunky\\" soup line. He later served as the president of Campbell's Champion Valley Farms division that produced Recipe Dog Food, the sponsor of the Lassie television series.

It is located in the Misraq (East) Welega Zone of the Oromia Region at an elevation of above sea level. Bilo is the administrative center of Wama Bonaya woreda and was sometimes also known as Bila and Falle. Overview Local landmarks in Bilo include the Medhane Alem church.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 15 January 2010) The Russian explorer Alexander Bulatovich visited Bilo 8 November 1896. At the time, it was a crossroads for caravans travelling between south-western Ethiopia and Gojjam on their way to the traditional Ethiopian port of Massawa. Although it was in the territory of Dejazmach Demissew Nassibu, it was not part of it; instead it was under the rule of a nagadras or governor of its marketplace. Bulatovich noted that the settlement had fewer than 300 permanent residents and, in light of the colonial developments along the Red Sea coast, most of south Ethiopia's trade had shifted to the routes through Harar to the French port at Djibouti and the British-held port at Zayla.From Entotto to the River Baro (1897), translated by Richard Selzer, Ethiopia through Russian Eyes: Country in Transition, 1896-1898 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 2000) (accessed 2 November 2009) The opening of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway at Dire Dawa in 1901 drove still more of the trade along these routes at the expense of Bilo and nearby Leika. Dunlop mentions Bilo in his memoirs of travelling through western Ethiopia with Captain R.H.R. Taylor in 1935, as where they watched women spin thread and a man weave cloth to be sold at Addis Ababa. Dunlop describes Bilo as a \\"village of some size\\" east of the Dodu pass between Mount Konchi and Mount SoduA. Dunlop, \\"The Dadessa Valley\\", Geographical Journal, 89 (1937), pp. 511f Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Bilo has an estimated total population of 2,401 of whom 1,108 are men and 1,293 are women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.4 The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 1,346 of whom 601 were men and 745 women.

Initially, the club was founded as a social and literary society for those from Orkney and Shetland.The organisational meeting was held on 5 May 1892 in response to a circular sent out to members of the Orkney and Shetland Society of London. See J.A.B. Townsend, \\"The Viking Society: A Centenary History\\" in Saga-Book vol. 23 (1990), 180-212, p. 180; volume 23 pdf. The first Chairman, later renamed Jarl, was T. McKinnon Wood. After some debate, this was broadened to include all those interested in the Norsemen and the history of the North, and an inaugural session of the reconstituted Viking Club or Orkney, Shetland and Northern Society was held at the King's Weigh House Rooms on 12 January 1894. It was mocked in the Pall Mall Gazette under the headline \\"Vikings Drink Tea\\",\\"Vikings Drink Tea\\", Pall Mall Gazette, 15 January 1894, reported in Townsend, p. 189. whereupon a member retorted in a letter that \\"The fiercest warriors, even savages, drink tea and coffee nowadays\\".Townsend, p. 190. Punch made fun of the Nordic titles of its officers with a satirical \\"Saga of the Shield-Maiden\\": > There'll be many a black, black eye, mother, in the club to-morrow night, > For the Things-bothman and the Law-bothman have together arranged to fight; > While the stakes will be held by the Skatt-taker, and the Jarl will join > the fray, > And we Shield-maidens will shriek and whoop in Old Norse, as best we may! > Punch, 27 January 1894, p. 42.

Both publications also made fun of the \\"weaking\\" pronunciation of viking and of the ambitious statement of intent in the prospectus: \\"It behoves every one who is directly or indirectly connected with or interested in the North to give the Viking Club such support as will enable it to take its proper place among the foremost societies in Europe\\". In the words of Punch: > If we scratch up a scanty Skanian skill with skald and skal and ski, > In the foremost place of societies soon in Europe we'll be!Townsend, p. > 191, Punch. Townsend notes that The Times simply reported that the meeting > took place and was chaired by the Jarl, \\"Mr. W.

The mockery touched off vehement exchanges of letters in the Orkney Herald and the Shetland News in which St. Magnus was used as a pen name and reference was made to effeminacy and nithings.Townsend, pp. 191-93. The society soon became better known for scholarship than for the conviviality that had been half its intended purpose. The 'foys', or concerts, gave way starting in 1901 to an annual dinner, which has continued to the present with few interruptions.Townsend, pp. 194-96. In 1902 its name changed to the Viking Club or Society for Northern Research and in 1912 to the Viking Society for Northern Research.Townsend, p. 188. \\"Viking Gild\\" had been considered at the outset but rejected for its \\"association with temperance societies\\". The first volume of the journal, Saga-Book, appeared in 1895; the first volume of Old Lore Miscellany is dated 1907-08; in welcoming that, the Pall Mall Gazette praised the society for \\"fresh and meritorious work\\".Orkney and Shetland Miscellany of the Viking Club, Volume 1, Ed. Alfred W. Johnston and Amy Johnston, London: Viking Club, 1907, p. 54. In 1908, a correspondent reported approvingly in the American Journal of Philology on the Society's \\"very large\\" membership including \\"many names prominent in the literary life and the scientific world of England, Scotland and the North\\" and on its publications and expenditure of \\"large sums of money\\" on expeditions as far afield as Denmark.George T. Flom, \\"The Viking Society for Northern Research\\", American Journal of Philology 29 (1908), pp. 248-49. From 1920, Saga-Book occasionally published monographs as separate numbers, but there is also a short Extra Series of monographs which began in 1893. A translation series began in 1902 with W.G. Collingwood and J√≥n Stef√°nsson's The Life and Death of Kormac the Skald. A text series began with an edition of Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu in 1935by Peter Foote and Randolph Quirk, reprinted 1974, . and later broadened to include further monographs.For a summary of the publications, see Townsend, pp. 205-07 and Appendix 2, pp. 211-12. The Dorothea Coke Memorial Lectures at University College London, endowed in 1962 by Colonel B.E. Coke in memory of his wife, began in 1963 with G.N. Garmonsway lecturing on \\"Canute and His Empire\\"; these are published. The Society has also assisted in publishing the proceedings of the Viking Congress since the sixth Congress in 1969, and in making foreign publications available to members.Townsend, p. 207. The Viking Society both resulted from and encouraged the Victorian Viking revival.Wawn, p. 354: \\"regional enthusiasm eventually achieved national coordination with the formation of the Viking Club\\".Karl Litzenberg, The Victorians and the Vikings: A Bibliographic Essay on Anglo-Norse Literary Relations, University of Michigan Contributions in Modern Philology 3 (1947), p. 17: \\"among the most active of such societies\\". Collingwood, an art professor who became a philologist and translator as well as illustrator of Old Norse texts, presented his oil painting The Parliament of Ancient Iceland to the society and it hung in their meeting room.Wawn, pp. 339-40. From its earliest days the Society brought together the prominent scholars in the field: William Morris, Eir√≠kr Magn√∫sson, Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson and Frederick York Powell were among the active members in its early days, and its publications, lectures, and symposia have continued in the same vein, featuring Gabriel Turville-Petre, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula Dronke, for example. In 1917 the Viking Society was asked to help with the effort to establish Scandinavian Studies at the University of London, where it was by then holding its meetings, and it became traditional for the head of what is now the Department of Scandinavian Studies at University College London to be joint Honorary Secretary of the Society.Townsend, pp. 196-97. The Society's extensive library became part of University College's library in 1931 in exchange for permanent access to a meeting room; however, in 1940 the collection was almost entirely destroyed in a fire caused by wartime bombing and it had to be laboriously replaced.Townsend, pp. 198-99, 200.University College London , Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster, accessed 19 January 2010. World War I had little effect on the Society's meetings but interrupted its publications, which resumed only slowly; there had been financial problems early in its history (a Treasurer destroyed the year's financial records rather than take them with him in a move, and the printers sued to recover the cost of an overrun),Townsend, p. 194. and again in 1916 a large sum had to be promised to the printers to avert a lawsuit,Townsend, p. 196. but in the 1920s serious financial problems arose. Meetings were suspended during World War II but publications struggled on.Townsend, pp. 199-201. After the idea was raised at the fifth Viking Congress in T√≥rshavn in 1965, a Scottish offshoot of the Viking Society, the Scottish Society for Northern Studies, came into being in 1968. It publishes a journal called Northern Studies and holds an annual conference.Townsend, p. 203.

He was Vicar Apostolic of the Diocese of Gibraltar between 1857 and 1880. He spoke fluent English and his native Spanish. Scandella is mainly remembered in Gibraltar for seeing the return of the statue of Our Lady of Europe to Gibraltar from Algeciras in Spain and for his efforts to improve education in the territory. Early life He was born to a Gibraltarian family of Genoese descent. As a child, he was a pupil of the Christian Brothers during their first stay in Gibraltar (1835-1837) and since he was very young he felt the call of the vocation to priesthood. He was a gifted student who later obtained a Doctorate of Sacred Theology with the mark of magna cum laude. Career He was ordained priest on 25 March 1845 and was seconded to Corfu (then under British rule) as Vicar General to Bishop Nicholson. He remained there for ten years, returning to Gibraltar in 1855 to be appointed secretary to Vicar Apostolic Henry Hughes. Hughes resigned in 1856 and on 28 April 1857, Scandella was appointed new Vicar Apostolic of Gibraltar. He was also appointed Titular Bishop of Antino√´ (since 1840, all Vicars Apostolic of Gibraltar were also appointed Titular Bishops). Scandella was the first Gibraltarian to be appointed to such dignity which was welcomed by Gibraltarian society. According to Charles Caruana, current Bishop of Gibraltar: Return of the statue of Our Lady of Europe At the time of the Capture of Gibraltar by the Anglo-Dutch fleet, the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe was plundered and desecrated. The statue of the Virgin and Child was broken and its remains thrown out to sea. The pieces had been recovered by a fisherman and later delivered to Juan Romero de Figueroa, the priest in charge at the Church of St. Mary the Crowned and St. Bernard. Romero de Figueroa eventually took the pieces of the statue to Algeciras for safekeeping in a chapel that took the name of Our Lady: the Chapel of Our Lady of Europe. During the early 1860s Scandella petitioned for the return of the original statue from Algeciras. After long discussions, it was agreed that the original statue was to return to Gibraltar so long as an exact replica would be carved and placed in the Chapel of Our Lady of Europe in Algeciras. The original statue eventually returned to Gibraltar in 1864. As the original Shrine of Our Lady of Europe remained in military hands, a new location for the statue had to be found, provided that, at Scandella's wishes, the new shrine were as near to Europa Point as possible. After a popular fundraising campaign, a site was acquired along Engineer Road, and a new chapel was built, where Our Lady of Europe was enthroned in May 1866. Scandella attended the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) as Council Father. During his stay in Rome, he succeeded in bringing the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe to the attention of Pope Pius IX. The Pope later donated a marble altar to Our Lady of Europe in Gibraltar. Its front piece depicted the coat of arms of Pope Pius IX and that of Bishop Scandella, together with a monogram of Our Lady of Europe.Vatican-Gibraltar Joint issue folder (Vatican-Gibraltar Special Folder) Improving education His other concern was education, where he continued the efforts of his predecessor, Vicar Apostolic Hughes.Short history of the Diocese of Gibrlatar Scandella promoted the institution of new schools, both primary and secondary, for boys and girls, charging the wealthy parents to support the education of poorer children. He first opened a school at Rosia Parade. When the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul established itself in Gibraltar in 1860, Scandella asked them to promote children's education, so the society eventually opened two additional schools, one in Catalan Bay and another at Lime Kiln Road. Two more were erected in the crypt of St. Joseph's Parish Church when it was completed in 1865. He was also the main person responsible for bringing the Christian Brothers back to Gibraltar and for the establishment of the Loreto Nuns in Gibraltar. After a five-year battle, he managed to obtain a 50% increase in the Colonial Office grant for all the schools in the territory. The fame of the schools promoted by Scandella spread widely: Thanks to his efforts by the 1870s, the Roman Catholic Church took a position of pre-eminence in the Gibraltarian education that lasted until the twentieth century.  Civil society  Scandella was a prominent figure within Gibraltar's civil society, and had several clashes with the Governor or the colonial administration. In 1876, he rejected the imposition of a tobacco tax in order to avoid tobacco smuggling into Spain. He argued that if the British Government wished to impose such a tax, alternative employment had to be provided. He even traveled to London in order to lobby the Members of Parliament for the order to be withdrawn. Scandella tried to enlist the wealthiest classes of Gibraltar join his cause, however, the members of the Exchange and Commercial Library refused. This created a serious antagonism against Scandella, which worsened upon his death and the election of the new Bishop, Scandella's secretary, Gonzalo Canilla. Scandella has vigorously rejected the alien orders in council that prevented Spanish boys from attending his schools or refused to allow residence in Gibraltar to the children of native mothers and alien fathers (as it could incite illicit unions and the birth of illegitimate children). On the contrary, he rejected the presence of Maltese immigrants on the grounds that they were mostly criminals, an opinion shared with the majority of the Gibraltarian society at the time.

It specializes in animals of the Nordic fauna, although orphaned animals from elsewhere in the world are sometimes temporarily housed there until a new home can be found for them. The zoo has about 900 animals, representing almost 100 species. These animals are most often kept in large enclosures with natural environments. Some of the domestic animals displayed include: Sk√•neg√•s (Scania goose, a type of domestic goose), Gute sheep, Fj√§ll cattle, and J√§mtlandsget (J√§mtland goat, a type of domestic goat). History Founded in 1953, Sk√•nes Djurpark is operated as a foundation. It is a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. Camilla J√∂nsson has been chief of the zoo since 2008. The Sk√•nes Djurpark foundation is supported by the Sk√•ne Regional Council (Swedish: Region Sk√•ne), which provides the zoo with one to two million kronor each year. The entrance cost at Sk√•nes Djurpark is 200 kronor for an adult. The previous price of 160 kronor was increased in 2009 so that the zoo's budget could be met. The number of visitors at Sk√•nes Djurpark has increased in the past few years. There were a total 211,000 visitors at the zoo in 2008, and slightly more in 2009. Incidents Sk√•nes Djurpark became the subject of controversy in early 2010, when an entire pack of wolves escaped from their enclosure and were shot to death. These wolves were shot to prevent escape from the zoo, which led to criticism from animal rights activists. The security of the zoo's enclosures was also criticized, and a complaint was filed by Djurr√§ttsalliansen (English: Animal Rights Alliance) against Sk√•nes Djurpark.

It was published by Tokyopop in North America from November 8, 2005 to November 7, 2006. Plot The series focuses on two brothers, Ein and Leroux DeLaLune. Development Born in Syria, Hans Steinbach lived in many countries, including Germany, France, Turkey and Canada, before moving to the United States; there, he decided to submit a story idea to Tokyopop after seeing it was a major publisher in the States. Steinbach considered the story \\"a little too straight forward, too linear\\". Because it heavily focused on the missions Einblick carried out for the Catholic Church, Steinbech rewrote it, with help from his editor at Tokyopop, to allow Einblick's personality to develop. He changed Einblick from an assassin to \\"an undead, chain-smoking metalhead with a grudge\\". Steinbach was inspired by Phantom of the Opera, since it combined horror and music, something Steinbach wanted to do for A Midnight Opera. His goal for the series was \\"to combine fact and fiction, historical facts with fictitious (and not so fictitious) characters\\". Steinbach has been drawing since the age of ten and his art is influenced by manga artists, particularly Go Nagai and Akira Toriyama. Additionally, he is influenced by classical and metal music as well as the musician Yngwie Malmsteen and the bands Dark Moor, Metallica, Symphony X, Iron Maiden, Stratovarius, Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, and Judas Priest.

The episodes premiered on My Space along with the short episodes of Bizenghast, I Luv Halloween, and Riding Shotgun in summer 2007. Reception A Midnight Opera received mixed reviews from critics. About.com's Katherine Luther praised the series as \\"a gothic horror manga full of thrills, chills and okay, a little gore\\" and more appropriate for older readers. While noting that the plot and art lacked originality, KJB of IGN stated: \\"Steinbach has managed to take all of those elements and create a final product that is interesting enough to sit through until the last page.\\" Manga Life's Craig Johnson commented on the \\"brave and experimental\\" art and that \\"the story is not as revolutionary as the art...neither is it accessible.\\" Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network heavily criticized the series as \\"[h]orrifically clich√©d and hackneyed, with laughably bad dialogue and interior art\\", and wrote: \\"It's hard to tell if A Midnight Opera is an exercise in plain marketing hubris‚Äîpandering directly to the Hot Topic crowd‚Äîor simply a case of the author taking himself and his work far too seriously and churning out clich√© after clich√©, convinced of his own genius, unaware of the tripe he's created.\\" ReferencesExternal links *A Midnight Opera at Tokyopop's website *A Midnight Opera #1: Prelude to Good vs. Evil at YouTube Category:Horror comics Category:Tokyopop titles Category:2005 comics debuts Category:Original English-language manga ","title":"A Midnight Opera"},{"id":"25820671","text":"Baicoli () are an Italian biscuit, originating in Venice.
