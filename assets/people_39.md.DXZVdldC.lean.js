There are numerous theories on the settlement of the Americas; the most accepted currently, that of Paul Rivet, states that there were numerous arrivals for different reasons: those leaving Asia via the Bering Straits, but also those traveling from island to island in Polynesia and Melanesia, via Central America. The first people to arrive in the territory of Chile would have been in one of these population movements. The prehistoric site of Monte Verde in Chile, presently under consideration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, allows us to date the oldest habitations in Chile to around 13,000 to 15,000 years for \\"Monte Verde II\\" and around 33,000 to 35,000 years for \\"Monte Verde I\\". Various research taken on the first populations to have arrived in the country arrived around years BC, during the Pleistocene period for the prehistoric site at \\"Monte Verde I\\" and around years BC for the site at \\"Monte Verde II\\" (the end of the Pleistocene and start of the Holocene (close to the end of the Upper Paleolithic). Prehispanic Chile was peopled by diverse Amerindian people who were located around the Andes and the coast. In the area to the north of the country, the Aymara and the Atacama began to cultivate land from the 11th century in the style of the Incas (growing plants on terraces on the sides of mountains with canal systems). By the 15th century, the Incas had taken possession of the territory of modern-day Chile up to the Maule River. At the south of the Aconcagua, the semi-nomadic communities such as the Mapuche were set up. In the austral zone of the country, various Amerindian people such as the Chomos, Tamanas, Alacalufes and Onas were living. In the Easter Islands a Polynesian culture developed, which continues today. On the Pacific coast, different cultures and peoples coexisted: the Aymara, Chango, Chinchorro, Atacama, Diaguita in the north: the Picunche, Mapuche, Huilliche, Chono in the Central and Southern region; and the Ona, Yagan and Alakaluf in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The Mapuche formed a numerous community.  The Chinchorro  The Chinchorro culture of South America goes back to 9,000 years ago. These were sedentary fishing people of the northern Chile and southern Peru. They inhabited the arid coastal regions of the Atacama Desert from Ilo, southern Peru, to Antofagasta in northern Chile. Outcrops of fresh water on the coast facilitated human settlement in this region. The Chinchorro are famous for their detailed mummification practice (Chinchorro mummies). The culture lasted for several thousand years, evolving and adapting over the period. The Chinchorro were expert fishermen. They developed an extensive and sophisticated fishing tool assemblage. They had efficient fishing gear, such as fishing hooks made of shells and cacti, and stone weights for nets made of mesh fabrics. They became skilled weavers of baskets and mats.\\"Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art\\" Archaeology Magazine The Chinchorro type site is located in Arica, Chile; it was discovered by Max Uhle in the early 20th century.Bernardo Arriaza, Chile‚Äôs Chinchorro Mummies nationalgeographic.com 1995 Their mummies which were much more ancient than those of the ancient Egyptians.

The by-election marked the debut of Teo Chee Hean of PAP and Chee Soon Juan of Singapore Democratic Party. Background At the time of the by-election, both Deputy Prime Ministers, Ong Teng Cheong and Lee Hsien Loong, were suffering from cancer. Goh decided to hold a by-election in a safe constituency with the best chances of winning for ‚Äúpolitical self-renewal‚Äù to get people of ‚Äúministerial calibre‚Äù to join the government under PAP. While Goh, Othman bin Haron Eusofe and Matthias Yao were running again in the same constituency, Lim Chee Onn was replaced with Teo Chee Hean, the former chief of the Singapore navy, for the by-election. At the 1991 general election, Goh promised to hold a by-election in 12 to 18 months‚Äô time to allow J. B. Jeyaretnam, of the Workers‚Äô Party, to contest a seat in parliament.

He received on-the-job training for church architecture. Guild Book of Saint-Bernulphus, c. 1881 Wilhelm Victor Alfred Tepe (1840‚Äì1920) was a Dutch architect. He is considered an important and influential representative of Gothic Revival architecture in the Netherlands during the 19th century. He designed and built many churches as well as other buildings, especially in the territory of the Archdiocese of Utrecht. Tepe was a key member of the Guild of St. Bernulphus, a Dutch secret society and trade union. He built and remodeled mostly in brick and used natural stone only in the later part of his career. He had four distinct time periods of architectural style in his career. He was primarily a Catholic ecclesiastical architect and worked mostly for the church. His style of designs were carried forward by other future architects.  Early life  Tepe was the son of German immigrants and born in Amsterdam on 24 November 1840. His father, Friederich Anton Tepe, was a textile merchant. His mother's name was Maria Anna Sternenberg. Tepe grew up and received his primary education in the city of Delft in the province of South Holland, Netherlands. After graduating from Saint Willibrordus gymnasium in Katwijk in 1858 he first went to Saint Willibrord College in the town of Katwijk on the Rhine in South Holland. Then from 1861 to 1864 he studied construction at the college of Bauakademie in Berlin. Additionally he also studied medieval architecture, especially that of the French architect and expert Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Tepe afterwards went to M√ºnster in western Germany for mathematical studies.  Career  Tepe's first serious work in his career was when he joined German Gothic Revival architect Vincenz Statz in Cologne. There from 1865 into 1866 he was involved with the completion of the Cologne Cathedral. Tepe then traveled for a short time with Statz and ultimately returned to Amsterdam in 1867. While there met Gerard van Heukelum, then chaplain at St. Catherine's Cathedral in Utrecht. In 1871 Tepe moved to Utrecht and started working for Heukelum, who had become an architect and founded the Guild of St. Bernulphus. Tepe received some assignments from Heukelum on village schools and rectories. Tepe built or worked on churches in the period from 1871 to 1905 as a key member of the Guild of St. Bernulphus. Brick was the material he chose instead of natural stone in constructing Dutch brick gothic architecture. He took late-Gothic 15th- and 16th-century designs of the Lower Rhine region (Nederrijns) and Westphalia as \\"School of Utrecht\\" examples to work from for the exterior of the churches he was working on. Other members of the Guild of St. Bernulphus provided the interior parts of these churches in construction. Friedrich Wilhelm Mengelberg was the most influential of the interior designers from the guild and Tepe worked closely with him. From 1872 under Archbishop Andreas Ignatius Schaepman, until his death in 1882, Tepe had a virtual monopoly on the building of churches in the Diocese of Utrecht.  Architectural style  Tepe's architectural-style changed little throughout his career. There are four times in his career where some deviation in style is shown. His church designs between 1871 and 1876 were rarely decorated in the time period of his first phase. He increased his decorations from 1876 to 1890 in a second phase of his architectural style. In a third phase, of a time period of 1890 to 1900, he built several hall churches which represented a centralizing tendency. Tepe reverted to some of his original church designs after 1900 in a fourth phase of his architectural style. After 1900 he sometimes built churches in Germany, especially after some of his works were published in the authoritative German periodical Zeitschrift f√ºr christliche Kunst. He designed and built a slightly different style, which regularly made use of stone. For example, the church he built in Bawinkel was largely of sandstone. Tepe was primarily a Catholic ecclesiastical architect. He designed orphanages, monasteries, schools, and rectories. He did not work on public buildings and rarely on residential structures. Tepe's most important works include Saint Andreasgasthuis in Utrecht (1873), the Roman Catholic Orphanage and Oudeliedengesticht in Utrecht (1875), old people's homes in Utrecht built from 1875‚Äì1877, and the Mari√´nburg in Bussum (1889). Many of the Catholic churches Tepe designed took on nicknames rather than their official names, like De Krijberg - an Amsterdam church that he designed in 1884 that was officially the Franciscus Xaveriuskerk. Tepe was the leader of a clearly identifiable direction within the Dutch Gothic Revival architecture. His churches were characterized by a simple but often slender build and where possible with high towers. He nearly always had a three-aisled design, even in small churches. The exteriors of his churches were usually missing ornaments, except in the Rhineland, where niches, balustrades and pinnacles of decorated gables were applied in a number of churches. Tepe even applied flying buttresses on some rare occasions. His influence of the Dutch Gothic Revival architecture was eventually taken over by others like J.W. Boerbooms and Wolter te Riele. Personal life Tepe married Maria Josepha Savels Alexandrina on 24 May 1870. They had two sons. Maria died 13 July 1897. Tepe remarried on 15 December 1904 to Wilhelmine Margareta Kracht. There were no children from this marriage.  Later life and death  Tepe moved to Germany in 1905 with Kracht and designed churches there until his death in 1920. He died in D√ºsseldorf, a day short of being 80 years old.

Their biggest hit, \\"Can Can 62\\" reached the British singles chart in 1962. The group toured with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones before disbanding in 1966. Origins and career The group was formed around 1960 by Peter Jay (b. 29 January 1944, Southgate, North London, England), the son of Jack Jay who owned and managed the Windmill Theatre together with several cinemas and nightclubs in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. Peter Jay formed the group while studying at Norwich College. He played drums; other band members were Pete \\"Buzz\\" Miller, Tony Webster (rhythm guitar), Mac McIntyre (tenor sax and flute), Lloyd Baker (piano and baritone sax), Geoff Moss (bass guitar) and Johnny Larke (bass guitar). The band never contained the unusual set-up of an acoustic and electric bass, just two electric basses. From about 1962, the group were also noted for their use of coordinated Vox Phantom guitars on stage. Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers signed a recording deal with Decca Records in 1962. Their first record, a rocked-up version of the can-can music from Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld, produced by Joe Meek at Decca's studios in Hampstead and entitled \\"Can Can 62\\", rose to #31 after entering the UK chart in November 1962. The group released several further singles on Decca in 1963 and 1964, but none became hits. The group were a popular live act and were chosen as a support act to the Beatles on their UK tour in November and December 1963. They also appeared on national TV shows including Ready Steady Go! and Thank Your Lucky Stars. The group moved to Piccadilly Records in 1964 and released several further singles, with little commercial success. Miller left in 1965, and was replaced by guitarist Terry Reid. After further personnel changes, and billed as \\"Peter Jay and the New Jaywalkers\\", the group continued to appear on bills with leading bands of the time, and were included on a 1966 package tour of the UK with the Rolling Stones, Ike and Tina Turner and the Yardbirds starting at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1966. Following the tour, the group split up. Later activities In the late 1970s, Peter Jay, together with his father, purchased the Hippodrome in Great Yarmouth, and gradually restored it as a theatre and circus venue with a circular performing area which could be lowered to reveal a swimming pool. He also took over the lease of the Tower Circus in Blackpool in 1983. Since his father's death in 1985, he has continued to own and manage the Yarmouth Hippodrome. He has also published an autobiography, Jaywalking. Pete Miller became a solo artist, releasing the single \\"Baby I Got News for You\\" (credited as \\"Miller\\") in 1965, with backing by Peter Frampton and other members of The Herd. He then concentrated on songwriting and worked as a session musician, before re-emerging as \\"Big Boy Pete\\" in early 1968 with the single \\"Cold Turkey\\", a track which was later anthologised as an example of freakbeat and covered by The Damned. Miller moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970s, and has since recorded with his band, the Wildcats, as well as collaborating with other musicians in ventures such as \\"Shig & Buzz\\". Terry Reid continued his solo career, becoming a singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

She created the Campbell Soup Kids. She is considered to be one of the first and most successful American female cartoonists. Biography Drayton was born Grace Gebbie in 1878 in Philadelphia. Her father, George Gebbie, was an art publisher. Drayton attended Drexel Institute (now Drexel University) and the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (PSDW). While at PSDW, she was a student of the American artist and teacher Robert Henri during 1893 and 1894. Drayton began her career as a freelance artist in 1895. From 1905 to 1909, she was a member of The Plastic Club, an arts organization in Philadelphia. She created the Campbell Soup Kids which was used in advertisements for Campbell's Soup beginning in 1904. The Campbell Soup Kids and Drayton's other children characters were drawn in a cute cherubic style often with round faces, plump bodies, and rosy cheeks. With her sister Margaret G. Hays (1874-1925) as writer, Drayton produced The Adventures of Dolly Drake and Bobby Blake in Storyland and The Turr‚Äôble Tales of Kaptin Kiddo in the period 1905‚Äì1909. Drayton designed the popular Dolly Dingle paper dolls, which appeared in the women's magazine Pictorial Review. She also created syndicated newspaper comic strips for Hearst/King Features such as Naughty Toodles, Dottie Dimple, Dimples, 'Dolly Dimples and Bobby Bounce', and The Pussycat Princess. Drayton was the first woman to be a cartoonist for Hearst. The Pussycat Princess was started in 1935. After Drayton's death in 1936, the strip was continued by Ruth Carroll and Ed Anthony.  Personal life  In 1900 she married Theodore Wiederseim. In 1911, she divorced Wiederseim and married William Drayton, and started signing her work as Grace Drayton. She divorced Drayton in 1923. Grace Drayton died in 1936 and is buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery Yeadon, Pennsylvania  Legacy  The Campbell Soup Kids were an iconic staple of Campbell's Soup advertising strategy for decades. The Campbell Soup Kids drawings and memorabilia remain popular with antique collectors. It is possible that Drayton's work had some influence on Japanese Sh≈çjo manga in the late 1930s. Drayton's Dolly Dingle dolls are part of the Joseph Downs Collection at the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. Some of her work is also part of the collection at The Cartoon Museum.

They settled in Louisville, Kentucky, where Thomas became a schoolteacher and eventually editor and proprietor of the Louisville Daily Reporter.John E. Kleber, The Encyclopedia of Louisville (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 2001), 134. Browne briefly attended Louisville Medical Institute, an experience that inspired his first book, Confessions of a Quack (1841). In 1842, after working several years on a riverboat, he signed on to a whaling ship. In 1846 he published the book Etchings of a Whaling Cruise at Harper & Brothers, New York,John Ross Browne Library of Ireland Compendium of Irish biography, 1878, accessdate 5 January 2013 which earned him recognition as an artist and writer, and is thought to have influenced Herman Melville.

The genus Dendrophthoe comprises about 31 species spread across tropical Africa, Asia, and Australia. Despite being collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander in 1788, and depicted in Banks' Florilegium, it was not until 1860 that it was described by Ferdinand von Mueller as Loranthus vitellinus after being collected near Ipswich, and renamed by Philippe √âdouard L√©on Van Tieghem in 1895. Description It grows as shrubby plant, with either a spreading or pendant (drooping) habit, from a tree branch or trunk. It has external roots, and hairy new growth maturing to smooth branches and foliage. The leaves are spear- or oval-shaped with a blunt apex, and measure long and wide. The inflorescences are composed of 5 to 20 smaller flowers. The flowers are generally yellow or orange with red tips, though some northern populations have redder flowers. They are covered in a fine fur. Flowering is followed by the development of an egg-shaped fruit long and red to yellow in colour, which contains a single seed in a sticky coating. The similar-looking smooth- flowered mistletoe (D. glabrescens) has smooth flowers and leaves broader than in width, and is found west of the Great Dividing Range. Distribution and habitat The range is from far north Queensland along the east coast of Australia through New South Wales and into Victoria. In northern New South Wales, it extends inland to the Nandewar Range In Victoria it occurs to the east of Genoa in East Gippsland. It generally grows on trees of the family Myrtaceae in open sclerophyll forest, but also on Eucalyptus grandis in forest on the fringes of rainforest. Ecology At least 66 native plant species from 16 families (predominantly the genera Eucalyptus, Angophora and Melaleuca) have been recorded as host plants for Dendrophthoe vitellina, and in addition, a number of exotic species also. It has been recorded on an exotic plane tree, Platanus √ó acerifolia. Growing on a small red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) is hazardous for the host species. Dendrophthoe vitellina is the main host plant for caterpillars of the marbled line blue butterfly (Erysichton palmyra), while caterpillars of other butterfly species the black jezebel (Delias nigrina), red-banded jezebel (D. mysis), narcissus jewel (Hypochrysops narcissus), silky jewel (H. digglesii), dull oakblue (Arhopala centaurus), black-spotted flash (Hypolycaena phorbas), trident pencil-blue (Candalides margarita), dark purple azure (Ogyris abrota), golden azure (O. ianthis), orange-tipped azure (O. iphis), sapphire azure (O. aenone), southern purple azure (O. genoveva) and northern purple azure (O. zosine) also eat the plant. The fleshy fruit is consumed by the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The seed immediately begins to germinate and soon penetrates the vascular system of the tree and creates a physiological connection with the Xylem of the new host. From that point, the seedling begins to obtain water and mineral nutrients from the host.

It is known from the holotype, IVPP V 6026, a single well-preserved partial skeleton including the skull. It was found from the Heshanggou Formation of the Ordos Basin, Hazhen commune. It was first named by Xiao-Chun Wu in 1981 and the type species is Xilousuchus sapingensis. Wu (1981) referred Xilousuchus to the Proterosuchia. Gower and Sennikov (1996) found it to be an erythrosuchian based strictly on the braincase. A more detailed re-description of the genus was provided by Nesbitt et al. (2010) and found poposauroid affinities. In his massive revision of archosaurs which included a large cladistic analysis, Sterling J. Nesbitt (2011) found Xilousuchus to be a poposauroid which is most closely related to Arizonasaurus. Xilousuchus is the oldest archosaur to date, although Ctenosauriscus and Vytshegdosuchus might be even older by less than one million year. Since Xilousuchus is a suchian archosaur, its early age suggests that most of the major groups of archosaurs (ornithodirans, ornithosuchids, aetosaurs, and paracrocodylomorphs) developed by the Early Triassic, soon after the appearance of the first archosaur.  Features  Xilousuchus was probably quite a large animal when alive, possibly between three and four metres long. It had a small head, and a sail along its neck and back. It probably had long and quite powerful legs, and would have been an active hunter. Only the partial skull, cervical vertebrae, and a few other fragments are preserved. Xilousuchus has a relatively small head and long neck, with a skull length of approximately 25 cm and neck of 45 cm. The skull is fragmentary, but much of the snout and maxilla are present. Only one maxillary tooth has been fossilised. The maxilla has a partially-developed palatal process, and the angle of the dorsal process indicates that Xilousuchus had a large antorbital fenestra. The single preserved maxillary tooth is large, almost 15 mm long, and in other dental alveoli where the teeth are missing replacement teeth are sometimes visible, indicating that it was a polyphyodont. The tooth has small serrations, is curved backwards, and is laterally compressed, indicating that it could have punctured flesh or possibly sliced off chunks. The lacrimal and nasal bones are large but quite thin and fragile. The skull has a reasonably well-preserved braincase with thick walls and a small volume, and this shows that the brain was not large. It closely resembles that of Arizonasaurus, indicating that the two species are close relatives. The dentary bone is partially preserved for both left and right, and would have held thirteen teeth on each side, although only the nutrient foramina remain. Like that of most archosaurs from the Triassic, the dentary is unspecialised. The cervical vertebrae have large, flattened neural spines which make up most of their height and would have formed a sail-like structure in life, similar to other ctenosauriscids. Unusually, however, they curve slightly forwards. There is little space between the neural spines, indicating that Xilousuchus would probably not have had a very flexible neck. The spines gradually increase in height as they move backwards - that on the axis vertebra is 42 mm high, whereas that on the tenth cervical vertebra is 92 mm high. The height of the sail along the back is not known, as none of the dorsal vertebrae have been preserved, but it was probably similar to that in Arizonasaurus or Hypselorhachis. One sacral vertebra is present, and it shows a clear suture where it was joined to the sacral ribs and pelvis. The orientation of the sacral rib suggests that the ilium was downturned, although this is not certain. Two caudal vertebrae are present as well, and these are poorly preserved with missing neural spines, but show facets where chevrons would have been attached. The proximal ends of two cervical ribs have also been fossilised, and these have two heads - a tuberculum and capitulum. They are slender, unlike those of phytosaurs and crocodylomorphs. One clavicle and one ungual are also known, but it is not known where the ungual is from. They have few distinguishing features and resemble those of other ctenosauriscids very closely.

It is located at 87 15th Street NW in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia next to the High Museum of Art. After McMillan's death, the building long housed facilities for Atlanta's arts community. The City designated The Castle a landmark in 1989. 1958-1960: GOLDEN HORNE ESPRESSO CAFFE AT THE CASTLE was created and operated by James Henry Lukshus who became the famous internationally known artist and fashion designer (haute couturier): Tzaims Luksus. His cafe was in the Castle's carriage room at street level and he lived in the stone studio directly above it. The Golden Horne Cafe was covered, with his photo playing his Lute, in 1959 by the Atlanta Journal (newspaper). The Golden Horne at the time was not only the first espresso cafe but also the most internationally famous cafe in Atlanta. The Metropolitan Opera's famous soprano Leontine Price dined there whilst the Met Opera was on tour performing at the Fox Theater (Atlanta) In 1959. It was the writer James Dickey's favorite place for his poetry readings. Who's who in Atlanta frequented the continental Golden Horne Cafe for a cup of espresso new to Atlanta over regular coffee though the cost was several times that of a cup of regular coffee. The Golden Horne even though medieval in decor and relaxed it was a first class gathering place for famous artists, writers, students, professors and Atlanta's high cafe society known only by word of mouth and secret with no commercial advertising and unknown by tourists. It was the place to go after a symphony concert or grand opera for a late night cup of the best coffee, tea and a slice of its famous rum cake or strawberry cheese cake and French cheese. On many days philosophy and psychology professors from Emory University would hold their class discussions at the long trestle tables and with the art institute, directly across the street, art professors often held their art history discussions and life drawing classes at the Golden Horne Espresso Cafe in the Castle. Musicians famous or not were allowed by James to perform on various instruments and sing and James was expected to play his Lute and sing Elizabethen and early French ballads several times each evening. When Leontine Price, the conductor of the Met Opera and entourage visited Leontine asked James to sing for her. James Luksus managed his Golden Horne Cafe with princely and noble dignity similar to the finest cafes in Paris, France. It was Atlanta's Golden Age and the Golden Horne was Atlanta's Cafe de la Paix. In August 2010 the building was sold to Bryan Latham, an investor from New York. As of that date Latham's plans for The Castle were unclear. In 2014 it became Atlanta's first pop up living room bar and music emporium.

This area, which is a mix of mountains and rich fertile plains, is south of Rome but north of Calabria and Apulia. Most of the Jewish communities were settled in the Roman Era by Jewish merchants or by Jewish captives after the fall of Jerusalem in the year 70. However, the region was mostly abandoned by the Jews by middle of the 16th century. Today, only the city on Naples has a Jewish population. And, unlike the southern provences, there seems to be no interest by neofiti descendants to revive the Jewish faith. Basilicata=Matera The Jews lived in the region of Matera in a section behind the Lanfranchi Seminary. Later known as the Seminary Ghetto. www.turismomatera.it The town of Grassano, located in Matera, is the setting of the Jewish author, Carlo Levi's memoir, Christ Stopped at Eboli. The regions of Apulia, Calabria and Basilicata remained firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century. Venosa The town of Venosa, is located east of Naples and just outside Campania. The Jews settled in this Roman colony before the 3rd century. Many Jewish inscriptions were discovered there. Fifty-four epitaphs from a Jewish catacomb have been studied. They date from the third to the sixth centuries and are composed in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. By the 1970s more inscriptions were discovered including 23 epitaphs belonging to a cemetery. All are in Hebrew and date from the ninth century. The 11th-century Chronicle of Ahimaaz reads of an envoy of a Torah academy in Jerusalem who came to Venosa. He stayed and taught the Midrash in the town. In 1041, after the conquest of the town by the Normans, the Jews abandoned the area.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Lavello Lavello is a small town with a modest sized historical settlement of Jews. Like, Venosa, a few Jewish tomb inscriptions are known to exist. The Jewish population was engaged in trade and moneylending. The Jews emigrated from the area in the sixteenth century.google.com/booksbcrfj.revues.orgwww.italythisway.com Campania=Amalfi The port town of Amalfi is located in the Gulf of Salerno, southeast of Naples. The first records for the Jews living in Amalfi dates from the tenth century. The Chronicle of Ahimaaz mentions the Jews of Amalfi. The famous Cairo Geniza also mentions the Jews of Amalfi. The Jews of Amalfi were a small community, engaged in silk manufacture, garment dyeing and trade. Benjamin of Tudela writes of some 20 Jewish families there in about 1159. In 1292, measures were taken to convert the Jews to Christianity. Most Jews were banished along with the rest of the Jews in the area. The Jewish community in Amalfi was resurrected by 1306. However it finally ended when the Jews were banished again from the kingdom of Naples in 1541.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Benevento The town of Benevento is located in central Campania. Inscriptions in the town indicate that Jews resideded in Benevento in the 5th century. Around the year 950, Aaron of Baghdad visited the town. Hananeel ben Paltiel founded a yeshivah in the area. In 1065, the Prince of Benevento oversaw a number of Jews being forced to convert to Christianity, and was reproved by Pope Alexander II. In about 1159, Benjamin of Tudela recorded 200 Jewish families living in Benevento. Two Hebrew inscriptions on a sepulchral stone from 1153 also attest to the existence of a Jewish community in this period. Jewish trade and craftmanship included dyeing and weaving and later, moneylending. By the early 16th century they also traded corn. In 1442, Alfonso of Aragon became the ruler of the area and granted some privileges to the Jews. However, in 1458, after Alfonso's death, Benevento returned to pontifical rule. Under Papal rule, Benevento was spared the Jewish expulsion from southern Italy by the Spanish Crown in 1541. Unfortunately, after the election of Pope Paul IV in 1555, the Jews felt increasing pressure to convert and several Jews did convert, among them a Jew by the name of Raphael Usiglio. In 1569 the Jews were expelled from Benevento as well as the other small towns under Papal rule. The Jews returned to Benevento in 1617, but in 1630 they were expelled for the last time, and never to return again.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Capua The town of Capua, is north of Naples. The Jewish community dates back to the end of the Roman Empire. The Jews continued to live there after the area fell to the Byzantines. The Jewish community flourished in the 10th century, and the ancestors of Ahimaaz ben Paltiel were prominent within it. Paltiel ben Samuel (born in 988) was in charge of the finances of the town. And his son, Samuel ben Hananel was appointed supervisor of the treasury and the mint of Capua. Around 1167 when Benjamin of Tudela arrived in Capua, he recorded 300 Jews living there. In 1231, Emperor Frederick II granted the Jews the monopoly of the dye-works in the area. During the Jewish persecutions in southern Italy in 1290‚Äì94, many Jews in Capua were forcibly baptized to Christianity. From the 13th to 15th century, the Jewish community in Capua was known for its bankers and physicians. In 1464 the Jews of area, including Capua, complained to King Alfonso about the burden of taxation taxes were so large that many Jews threatened to leave the kingdom. The king obliged and lowed the taxes. The Jewish community grew when Sephardic refugees from Spain and Sicily arrived in Capua in 1492 and 1493. However, the Jews of Capua suffered their own expulsion, by the Kingdom of Naples in 1510. A few Jews resided there in the following decades, but the last few Jews were finally expelled in 1541.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Naples The history of the Jews in Naples go back to around the 1st century under the Romans. By the 6th century, the Jewish community of Naples was under rule of the Byzantines. In 1159, when Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, he noted the presence of 500 Jewish families. In 1288, the Kingdom of Naples issued an expulsion order for the Jews and in 1293 any Jews still in Naples were forced to convert. In 1492, many Jews who were expelled from Spain came to Naples, where King Ferdinand of Naples protected them. However, in 1495, the French conquered the kingdom and persecution resumed. In 1510, Spain won control of the city and expelled the Jews, but those who paid 300 ducanti were permitted to stay. In 1535, the last Jews in Naples were gone. In 1735, Jews were permitted to return to Naples. In 1831, a small group of Jews settled in the city. By 1841, the Rothschild family, acquired the Villa Pignatelli which served as the Jewish centre. Naples's Jewish population in the 1920s were almost 1,000 members. Between 1942 and 1943, 50 Jews of Naples were saved from German deportation by being hidden by villagers in the area of Caserta. After World War II, the Jewish community of Naples numbered between 600 and 700. Today, the city's Jewish population numbers about 200. Pompeii Archeological records have proven the existence of a Jewish population in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabia prior to the infamous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79. Most of the records are of Jewish inscriptions that hint of Jewish life in the area. For example, one inscription reads Sodom Gomor.www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org Some archeologists believe this inscription is a commentary about the wrath of God brought down upon Rome for the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by Rome in the year 70. Salerno The city of Salerno is located south of Naples. An inscription on a tombstone testifies to a Jewish settlement in Salerno, possibly as early as the 3rd or 4th century. By the Middle Ages, the town was known for a medical school founded by Jews around the year 800. Jews are mentioned in town records in 872. The Jewish quarter of Salerno is also mentioned in 1005. When Benjamin of Tudela visited Salerno in 1159, he found 600 Jews living in the area. Because of the persecutions in southern Italy around 1290‚Äì94, many Jewish families were forcibly baptized as Neofiti. However many Neofiti continued along as Crypto-Jews. In 1485, Rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham lived in Salerno and studied at the medical school.

Currently around 85% of Papua New Guinea's population lives from semi- subsistence agriculture.AusAID: About Papua New Guinea , retrieved 5 May 2011 Papua New Guinea produces and exports agricultural, timber, and fish products. Agriculture in 2017 accounted for 22.1% of the GDP and supported more than 80% of the population. Cash crops ranked by value are coffee, oil, cocoa, copra, tea, rubber, and sugar. The timber industry was not active in 1998, due to low world prices, but rebounded in 1999. About 40% of the country is covered with timber rich trees, and a domestic woodworking industry has been slow to develop. Fish exports are confined primarily to shrimp, although fishing boats of other nations catch tuna in Papua New Guinea waters under license. Papua New Guinea has the largest yam market in Asia. History People in Papua New Guinea started practising agriculture around 7,000 ‚Äì 10,000 years ago. The oldest evidence for this is in the Kuk Swamp area, where planting, digging and staking of plants, and possibly drainage have been used to cultivate taro, banana, sago and yam. Between the 17th to 19th centuries, a small number of plant species, including sweet potato, cassava and tobacco have been brought from the Americas by Europeans and introduced to Indonesia from where they spread to New Guinea. In the second part of the 19th century and especially after 1870 further crops have been introduced directly by Europeans, including beans, pumpkin, corn, watermelon, papaya, mangosteen, durian, orange, lemon, coffee, lime and guava. Major agricultural products=Sweet potato Sweet potato is a major food in PNG and dominates production in the highlands. It is one of PNGs top five staple foods taking the top position 99%, followed by banana with 96% and taro with 95%. Coffee Coffee production in Papua New Guinea accounts for a little over 1% of the total world production according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). After oil palm, coffee is Papua New Guinea's second largest agricultural export, employing approximately 2.5 million people. Copra Copra has been cultivated in New Guinea since the late 19th century, originally by German colonialists. Production has continued by Australian interests since World War II.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, swamps, freshwater marshes, and intermittent freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The common Suriname toad is similar in appearance to a mottled brown leaf, and is almost completely flat. Its feet are broadly webbed with the front toes having small, star-like appendages. Specimens of close to in length have been recorded, although is a typical size. The Suriname toad has minute eyes, no teeth, and no tongue. Behavior The Suriname toad is found in slow-moving streams and rivers throughout South America. Diet It is a predator and scavenger, capturing invertebrates and small fish with its star-fingered hands to eat, or swallowing dead creatures it comes across.Surinam Toad Reproduction Suriname toads are best known for their reproductive habits. Unlike the majority of toads, the males of this species do not attract mates with croaks and other sounds often associated with these aquatic animals. Instead, they produce a sharp clicking sound by snapping the hyoid bone in their throats.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. The partners rise from the floor while in amplexus and flip through the water in arcs. During each arc, the female releases 3 to 10 eggs, which get embedded in the skin on her back by the male's movements. After implantation, the eggs sink into the skin and form pockets over a period of several days, eventually taking on the appearance of an irregular honeycomb. The embryos develop through to the tadpole stage inside these pockets, eventually emerging from the mother's back as fully developed toads, though they are less than an inch long (25 mm). Once they have emerged from their mother's back, the toads begin a largely solitary life. After giving birth to the new toads, the mother slowly sheds the thin layer of skin that was used to birth them, and can begin the cycle again.https://www.wired.com/2013/12/absurd-creature-of-the-week-the- toad-whose-young-erupt-from-her-skin/ Gallery Pipa pipa 1.jpgThe gray shape is the Suriname toad.

It was released in some European territories at the end of April and was released on May 3 in the United States. Track listingReception James Christopher Monger of AllMusic stated that, \\"Composer Patrick Doyle, who brought a new-found boldness to the Harry Potter franchise in 2005 with his Goblet of Fire score, treats director Kenneth Branagh's big- screen adaptation of Marvel Comic's iconic Norse superhero Thor with appropriate gravitas. The longtime Branagh collaborator (Henry V, Dead Again) sets the stage with \\"Chasing the Storm,\\" a tense and surging unveiling of the main theme, which sounds a bit like a cross between the James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer's Batman Begins cue and Zimmer's \\"CheValiers de Sangreal\\" theme from The Da Vinci Code, and like Zimmer, Doyle knows how to whip a circular melody into a frenzy. Elsewhere, the lovely and appropriately stoic \\"Sons of Odin\\" is awash in traditional fantasy elements, while the epic \\"Compound\\" unveils a more modern, sci-fi action approach, resulting in a score that's wistful, heroic, and as grand as the fantastic realm of Asgard itself\\". Danny Graydon of Empire stated, \\"Reuniting with long-time collaborator Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Doyle's score successfully mixes Wagnerian \\"Sturm und Drang\\" (\\"Frost Giant Battle\\") with cues brimming with nobility (\\"Chasing The Storm\\") and dramatic richness (\\"Odin Confesses\\" and \\"Banishment\\"). He also creates an engaging melodic core via the opposing themes of Thor and Loki and reaps dividends from his concerted distinction of the worlds of Asgard and Earth.

A Moscow Mayakovsky Theater veteran (where throughout his fifty years career he played more than fifty parts) Lazarev appeared in more than 100 films, including One More Thing About Love (1968) which made him famous.  Biography  Alexander Lazarev was born in Leningrad, to the artist and designer Sergey Nikolayevich Lazarev (1899‚Äì1984) and Olympiada Kuzminichna Lazareva (n√©e Tarasova, (1907‚Äì1996). The family survived the first month of the Siege, then managed to get out of the city and make it to Orenburg. In 1944 they returned home and the next year Alexander went to school. By the time of graduation he's made a decision to become an actor, citing later Robert Taylor's performance in Waterloo Bridge as the major influence. In 1955 Lazarev joined the Young actors' studio at the Moscow Art Theater. After a short stint at the Nikolay Akimov-led Saint Petersburg Comedy Theatre, he moved to Mayakovsky Theater, led at the time by Nikolay Okhlopkov where the part of Boytsov the electrician in Aleksei Arbuzov's The Irkutsk Story was his first success. In 1961 Lazarev debuted in film, in thriller melodrama Free Wind (–í–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä, 1961), based on Isaak Dunayevsky's operetta of the same name. Among his other notable theatre roles of the 1960s were the sailor anarchist Gushcha in Between the Rainfalls (Okhlopkov's last production there), uber-lieutenant Schering in The Defector (1964) and Varavvin in Pyotr Fomenko-directed The Death of Tarelkin (1966). The leading part of physicist Yevdokimov in Georgy Natanson's 1968 film One More Thing About Love (–ï—â—ë —Ä–∞–∑ –ø—Ä–æ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å, co-starring Tatyana Doronina) brought Lazarev nationwide acclaim. The director Andrey Goncharov's arrival as Mayakovsky Theater marked the second phase of Alexander Lazarev's successful career there. First his performance as Don Quixote in A Man of La Mancha was lauded by critics, then the leading part in Venceremos!, after Genrikh Borovik's play, earned him the USSR State Prize. Among Lazarev's other important stage works of the period were General Khludov (in Flight, 1978, based on Mikhail Bulgakov's play), Rittmeister in The Life of Klim Samgin (1981, after an unfinished Maxim Gorky's novel, premiered as a TV play in 1986), and Vladimir Mayakovsky in Mark Rozovsky's The Beginnings (1983). In A Crayfish Laughs (1986, a play about the life of Sarah Bernhardt, the latter played by his wife Svetlana Nemolyaeva), Lazarev managed at last to realize his comedy actor potential to the full.C–º–µ—Ö –ª–∞–Ω–≥—É—Å—Ç—ã. - www.weekend.ru. Then followed Circle (1988, after W. Somerset Maugham's 1921 play), A Patron's Joke (1992, after Arkady Averchenko) and Victim of Our Age (1994, the adaptation of Alexandr Ostrovsky's The Last Victim), the latter earning Lazarev the Moscow Prize for Literature and Arts. He received another prestigious award, Chrystal Turandot, for the leading part of Edmund Kean in Kean the Fourth, Tatyana Akhramkova's production of Grigory Gorin's play. Lazarev continued to appear in films throughout the 2000s but none of those were particularly successful. \\"In theater he was continuously demonstrating his brilliance, his versatility, his comedy actor's potential. In cinema? Silence. Not one of our famous film directors has ever invited him to play a more or less substantial part. 'What we have we neglect, once we lose it ‚Äì mourn it',\\" author and critic Edward Radzinsky, speaking on the Russian TV (and quoting the Russian proverb) commented in 2011. Alexander Lazarev died in Abramtsevo, Moscow Oblast, on May 2, 2011. He is interred in Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Family On March 27, 1960, Alexander Lazarev married a fellow Mayakovsky Theater actress Svetlana Nemolyaeva. They lived happily with for 51 years, until his death.

They have historically inhabited the North Eastern Province, previously called the Northern Frontier District, which was carved out of the Jubaland region of present-day southern Somalia during the colonial period. Following the civil war in Somalia that broke out in 1991, many Somalis sought asylum in the Somali-inhabited enclaves of Kenya. An entrepreneurial community, they established themselves in the business sector, particularly in the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh. Population According to the 2019 Kenya census, approximately 2,780,502 ethnic Somalis live in Kenya. Among these individuals are a number of ethnically Somali international migrants, around 300,000 of whom inhabit the wider East and South Africa regions. These ethnic Somalis are distinct from the Bantus and other minorities of Somalia, who according to USAID constitute most of the estimated 413,170 refugees from Somalia in Kenya. SIL Ethnologue reports a breakdown of the Somali population in Kenya from the 1989 census, consisting of 312,339 individuals. Of the latter, 45,098 were from unspecified Somali clans, 27,244 from the Murule clan, 200,000 from the Degodia clan, and 139,597 from the Ogaden clan. However, The Somalis in Kenya are over 2.5 Million as per 2009 Kenya Population Census. It is expected that, by 2027, Somalis in Kenya would be among top two ethnic communities by Population in Kenya. History Somali- owned businesses in Eastleigh, Nairobi Somalis in Kenya, being Cushites were among the first to have arrived in Kenya long before the bantus who came all the way from Congo. They have historically inhabited the North Eastern Province, previously called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). The NFD came into being in 1925, when it was carved out of the Somalia. At the time under British colonial administration, the northern half of Jubaland was ceded to Italy as a reward for the Italians' support of the Allies during World War I. Britain retained control of the southern half of the territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District. thumb On 26 June 1960, four days before granting British Somaliland independence, the British government declared that all Somali-inhabited areas of East Africa should be unified in one administrative region. However, after the dissolution of the former British colonies in the region, Britain granted administration of the Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists. This was despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the Somalis in Kenya population to join the newly formed Somali Republic,David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.75 and the fact that the NFD was almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Somalis.Africa Watch Committee, Kenya: Taking Liberties, (Yale University Press: 1991), p.269Women's Rights Project, The Human Rights Watch Global Report on Women's Human Rights, (Yale University Press: 1995), p.121Francis Vallat, First report on succession of states in respect of treaties: International Law Commission twenty-sixth session 6 May-26 July 1974, (United Nations: 1974), p.20 Nonetheless, the Somali residents had by then successfully lobbied for a separate classification from the adjacent Bantu and Nilotic populations. In the 1962 British Kenya census, the Somali expatriates were accorded their own \\"Somali\\" entry separate from the \\"African\\", \\"Arab\\", \\"Asian\\" and \\"European\\" designations.

Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north.Bruce Baker, Escape from Domination in Africa: Political Disengagement & Its Consequences, (Africa World Press: 2003), p.83 In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what came to be known as the Shifta War.Rhoda E.

Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their bank accounts, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia.

Computer classrooms allow students access to learning technologies including their own Mac desktop computer. Instructors control a teacher station through which they are able to project images, websites and video. All students enrolled in courses conducted in computer classrooms have access to a computer lab.  History = Origins  The DWRL began in 1985 with the acquisition of twelve IBM microcomputers as a result of a Project QUEST grant to the University of Texas at Austin. English department faculty member Jerome Bump and his graduate students later arranged for the machines to be moved from the University Writing Center (housed in the English department) to vacant space in the basement of the Undergraduate Library. This space was deemed the Computer Research Lab (CRL) and marked the beginning of the research into computer-based writing at The University of Texas at Austin. In fall 1986 Bump offered a graduate seminar on rhetoric and computers, which he co-taught with Lt. Col. Hugh Burns. Burns, who worked in the Intelligent Systems Division at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, had written the first dissertation in what became the academic field of Computers and Writing. Graduate students in this seminar sought to advance Burns's efforts to explore how the computer could serve less as a ‚Äúteaching machine‚Äù and more as a constructive partner in dialogue with student-writers.Slatin, John. \\"The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History\\" Language Learning Online. Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 22. Theoretically, this work aligned well with the emerging ‚Äúprocess‚Äù model of writing instruction, and Burns's presence lent national credibility to the group. Burns coined the name of the new Computer Research Lab. Participants in the newly established lab dedicated their efforts to finding alternative models for the writing classroom. The lab's first local area network (LAN) allowed computers in the lab to be linked to one another, as well as to machines in an adjacent instructional room. This arrangement eventually enabled colleagues from the English department to teach first-year English courses in the CRL's first \\"computational classroom\\" as Bump and his graduate students called it.  Early products  Graduate student Fred Kemp's software Idealog focused on invention or pre-writing, while his colleague Paul Taylor's Descant assisted revision. Other students, moving away from the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù instructional model that underpinned these two, developed programs of their own that prioritized social interaction. These included Locke Carter's In-Class Mail and Paul Taylor's Forum5. Even though the programs emerged from different theoretical assumptions, they could be used together.Slatin, John. \\"The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History\\" Language Learning Online. Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 23. They also supplied the foundation for the most notable achievement of the lab's formative years, the Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment (DIWE), a suite of applications that integrated elements of the writing process. DIWE included four major modules: Invent, Respond, Mail (an asynchronous, internal messaging system), and InterChange (a conferencing system that allowed for synchronous‚Äîreal-time‚Äîinteraction among students and instructors). Several scholars went on to praise InterChange, in particular, for its capacity to transform the dynamics of a writing classroom.Slatin, John. \\"The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History\\" Language Learning Online. Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998.p. 24.  Focus on Digital Pedagogy  In January 1989, under the leadership of director John Slatin, the lab's staff began to assemble an archive of pedagogical texts‚Äîmaterials associated with the lab's attempts to conduct writing instruction in computer classrooms‚Äîand co-hosted the sixth Conference on Computers and Writing. Slatin wrote a funding proposal that increased the university-wide visibility of the CRL, eventually establishing computer labs and networks and disseminating new DIWE software across departments on UT- Austin's campus. Funding for additional labs and multimedia hardware also tightened the ties between the CRL and the English department and, later, the new Division of Rhetoric and Composition (which, upon its creation in 1993, assumed administrative oversight of the CRL).Slatin, John. \\"The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History\\" Language Learning Online. Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. pp. 30-32. The lab's institutional growth continued with the hiring in 1994 of faculty member Margaret Syverson, trained in Computers and Writing, and the recruitment of additional graduate students. Syverson directed the rechristened Computer Writing and Research Lab from 1994 to 2004. From 2004 to 2008 Clay Spinuzzi directed the CWRL. In 2004 the CWRL hired current systems administrator D. Hampton Finger, who facilitated the lab's switch to Drupal for its web content management. This shift allowed for greater accessibility and made personal Drupal installations available for instructors. As a result of a university pilot program using WebXM to ensure web accessibility, in October 2006 the CWRL lowered its webpage's structural accessibility violations from 3100 pages to zero. During 2004-2005, the CWRL created a workgroup model in which workgroup leaders assemble small teams to work on particular projects, allowing for greater continuity from year to year. From 2006 to 2008, the CWRL pursued outside partnerships. The lab redeveloped and rationalized archives of English and rhetoric exercises in a system called eFiles, and developed viz., a blog about visual rhetoric.

The Old Navarino castle () is a 13th- century Frankish fortress near Pylos, Greece. It is one of two castles guarding the strategic bay on which it sits; the other is the Ottoman-built New Navarino fortress. In juxtaposition with the latter, it is frequently known simply as Palaiokastro or Paliokastro (, \\"old castle\\"). It occupies the site of the Athenian fort at the 425 BC Battle of Pylos. Name In Frankish times, it was known as Port-de-Jonc (\\"Cane Harbour\\") or Port-de-Junch in French, with some variants and derivatives: in Italian Porto-Junco, Zunchio or Zonchio, in medieval Catalan Port Jonc, in Latin Iuncum, Zonglon/Zonglos (ŒñœåŒ≥Œ≥ŒªŒøŒΩ/œÇ or ŒñœåŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒøŒΩ/œÇ) in Greek, etc. In the late 14th/early 15th centuries, when it was held by the Navarrese Company, it was also known as Ch√¢teau Navarres, and called Spanochori (Œ£œÄŒ±ŒΩŒøœáœéœÅŒπ, \\"village of the Spaniards\\") by the local Greeks. History The castle sits atop an imposing rock formation on the northern edge of the bay, flanked by sheer cliffs; the naturally defensible site has probably been occupied since classical times. Although there are no physical barriers to access, the castle ruins have been declared \\"closed\\" because the structure is considered dangerous. In 1204, following the Fourth Crusade, the Peloponnese or Morea came under the rule of the Principality of Achaea, a Frankish Crusader state. According to the French and Greek versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, the castle was built by Nicholas II of Saint Omer, the lord of Thebes, who in c. 1281 received extensive lands in Messenia in exchange for ceding his wife's possessions of Kalamata and Chlemoutsi to the princely domain. According to the Greek version, he intended this as a future fief for his nephew, Nicholas III, although the Aragonese version attributes the construction to Nicholas III himself, a few years later. According to the medievalist Antoine Bon, a construction under Nicholas II in the 1280s is more likely, possibly in the period 1287‚Äì89 when he served as the viceroy (bailli) of Achaea. Despite Nicholas II's intentions, however, it is unclear whether his nephew did indeed inherit Navarino. If he did, it remained his until his death in 1317, when it and all the Messenian lands of the family reverted to the princely domain, as Nicholas III had no children. The fortress remained relatively unimportant thereafter, except for the naval battle in 1354 between Venice and Genoa, and an episode in 1364, during the conflict between Mary of Bourbon and the Prince Philip of Taranto, due to Mary's attempt to claim the Principality following the death of her husband, Robert of Taranto. Mary had been given possession of Navarino (along with Kalamata and Mani) by Robert in 1358, and the local castellan, loyal to Mary, briefly imprisoned the new Prince's bailli, Simon del Poggio. Mary retained control of Navarino until her death in 1377. At about this time, Albanians settled in the area, while in 1381/2, Navarrese, Gascon and Italian mercenaries were active there. From the early years of the 15th century, Venice set its eyes on the fortress of Navarino, fearing lest its rivals the Genoese seize it and use it as a base for attacks against the Venetian outposts of Modon and Coron. In the event, the Venetians seized the fortress themselves in 1417 and, after prolonged diplomatic manoeuvring, succeeded in legitimizing their new possession from the Prince of Achaea, Centurione II Zaccaria, in 1423. In 1423, Navarino, like the rest of the Peloponnese, suffered its first Ottoman raid, led by Turakhan Bey, which was repeated in 1452. It was also at Navarino that Emperor John VIII Palaiologos embarked in 1437, heading for the Council of Ferrara, and where the last Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, embarked with his family in 1460, following the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea. After 1460, the fortress, along with the other Venetian outposts and Monemvasia and the Mani Peninsula, were the only Christian-held areas in the peninsula. Venetian control over Navarino survived the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì79), but not the Second (1499‚Äì1503): following the Venetian defeat in the Battle of Modon in August 1500, the 3,000-strong garrison surrendered, although it was well provisioned for a siege. The Venetians nevertheless recaptured it shortly after, on 3/4 December, but on 20 May 1501, a joint Ottoman land and sea attack under Kemal Reis and Hadƒ±m Ali Pasha retook it. attack on Sphacteria (middle), flanked by the attacks on Navarino (left) and Palaiokastro (right) in 1825 In 1572/3, the Ottoman chief admiral (Kapudan Pasha) Ulu√ß Ali Reis built the New Navarino fortress, to replace the outdated Frankish castle, and the latter declined rapidly in importance: the new fortification covered better the main practical entrance to the bay towards the south, especially as the narrower northern entrance was blocked in 1571 by ships scuttled in the aftermath of Lepanto; the new site also had a more secure water supply. By the late 16th century, the old castle had only a token garrison, and it became increasingly dilapidated and partly ruined through the 17th century. During the Morean War, the Ottomans concentrated their defenses at the new castle, and the old castle's 100-man garrison surrendered to the Venetians under Francesco Morosini without a battle on June 2, 1686. Along with the rest of the Peloponnese, the fortresses remained in Venetian hands until 1715, when the Ottomans recaptured them. The Venetians considered either improving or demolishing the fortress, but ended up making few modifications before it was retaken by the Ottomans. Neither were any major repairs or improvements made by the Ottomans, though it was garrisoned with a token force. In April‚ÄìJune 1770, the area was temporarily held by the Russians, during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì74 and the Russian-inspired Orlov Revolt in Greece. After the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in March 1821, the Greeks captured the New Navarino fortress and slaughtered its garrison on the first week of August 1821. The area remained in Greek hands until 1825, when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured the old castle on 29 April, followed by the fortress on 11 May. The Ottoman-Egyptian garrison remained there until it was handed over to the French troops under General Nicolas Joseph Maison in spring 1828. The French found the old castle essentially a ruin.

Always known as Syd, he learned the trade of guiding safari hunts from an older generation of professional hunters, including his early mentor Philip Percival. He teamed up with Donald Ker to create Ker and Downey Safaris Ltd., a company that was at the forefront of the move away from hunting and towards photographic safaris. Early life Downey was born to a British expatriate family ranching cattle in Argentina. He spent most of his early childhood in Argentina, leaving the country for England to attend secondary school. Upon graduating school he sailed to Kenya, where he found a job working on a coffee plantation outside of Nairobi. Hunting life Downey became a professional hunter in 1933 when he joined Leslie Tarlton‚Äôs Safariland. In the early days with the company, Downey worked with Philip Percival on several safaris as his \\"second hunter.\\" Percival quickly became Donwey's mentor. Downey soon met Ronald Ker, another Kenyan hunter with whom he developed a rivalry. During the 1930s Ker and Downey were known for having opened up much of the Masai Mara to hunting. However, both hunters took a break from their trade when World War II broke out in 1939, joining the British effort in East Africa against the Italians. Ker and Downey Safaris As the war in Africa was winding down the British successfully ousted the Italians from Ethiopia, taking back the city of Addis Ababa. It was at this time that Ker and Downey met again, during an \\"impromptu meeting of the East African Professional Hunters‚Äô Association,\\" in an Addis Ababa bar. During their meeting Ker pitched Downey on the idea of going into business together as soon as the war ended. When the war ended the pair kept their promises and founded Ker and Downey Safaris. Their first paying safari was The Macomber Affair, starring Gregory Peck and Joan Bennett. They hired some of the most well known East African hunters including Harry Selby. In fact the company eventually became Ker, Downey and Selby Safaris, as Selby expanded the operation down in Botswana. However the partnership with Selby did not last in the end. Ker and Downey had both been moving away from hunting safaris and towards photographic trips, since neither of them particularly enjoyed killing animals, instead preferring the chase. Downey eventually became just as well known for his conservationism as his hunting.

According to Graham Seaman, \\"The Roots of the Mountains seems to be the story that inspired the subplot of the Dunedain, wanderers of a fading heroic past defending the frontiers of the Shire against the Orcs, and the loves of Aragorn, Eowyn, Faramir, and Arwen in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.\\"Graham Seaman, \\"William Morris: The Roots of the Mountains - Introduction,\\" 16 April 2003. This work and its predecessor, The House of the Wolfings, are to some degree historical novels, with little or no magic. Morris went on to develop the new genre established in these works in such later fantasies as The Wood Beyond the World, Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, The Well at the World's End, The Water of the Wondrous Isles and The Sundering Flood.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, Arkham House, 1976, pp. 42-5 Plot summary The story is set in Burgdale, a small Germanic settlement in a valley at the foot of a mountain range, and the neighbouring woodlands, pastures and dales. The area is inhabited by the interdependent Dalemen, who are weavers, smiths, and traders, the Woodlanders, who are hunters and carpenters, and the Shepherds. Their society is challenged by disruptions from the outside world in the form of the Sons of the Wolf, the descendants of the Wolfings from the previous novel, and the invading Dusky Men (the Huns). The Sons of the Wolf, driven from their original country by the Dusky Men, continue to resist the invaders as a frontier force guarding their new home. The somewhat troubled integration of the Sons of the Wolf into the society they are protecting is told in the story of five lovers representing both peoples, four of whom eventually marry. Morris projected a sequel to The Roots of the Mountains to be called The Story of Desiderius, but he never completed it.Graham Seaman, \\"William Morris: The Roots of the Mountains - Introduction,\\" 16 April 2003.

The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop Elipandus of Toledo that ‚Äì in respect to his human nature ‚Äì Jesus Christ was adoptive Son of God. Another leading advocate of this Christology was Felix of Urgel. In Spain, Adoptionism was opposed by Beatus of Liebana, and in the Carolingian territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by Pope Hadrian I, Alcuin of York, Agobard, and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794). Introduction Despite the shared name of \\"Adoptionism\\" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the Adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term adoptivus of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son of God \\"emptied himself\\" of divinity and \\"took the form of a servant\\" (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was \\"adopted\\" as divine.James Ginther, Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 3. The purpose of introducing the category of adoption was to make clear the right of Christ's humanity to the title \\"Son of God\\".Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, vol. 3, The Growth of Medieval Theology (600‚Äì1300), (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), 53. Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of \\"Nestorian\\" Christology.For an example of this characterization, see Adolph Harnack, History of Dogma, vol. 5, trans. Neil Buchanan, (New York: Dover, 1961), 280. John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his important study, The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785‚Äì820.John C. Cavadini, The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785‚Äì820, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 4‚Äì5. Spanish disputants=Elipandus of Toledo Elipandus (c. 716‚Äì805), bishop of Muslim-controlled Toledo, was the first well-known advocate of this \\"Adoptionist\\" christology, which he articulated in response to the position of another Spanish writer, Migetius. Migetius apparently taught a form of Trinitarian theology which Elipandus found troubling; in his \\"Letter to Migetius\\", Elipandus defended the single persona of Christ in the face of this issue.Cavadini, The Last Christology, 19. Contrary to what the label ‚ÄúAdoptionist‚Äù might suggest, Elipandus accepted the full humanity and divinity of the person of Jesus Christ; Elipandus‚Äô use of adoptivus in reference to Christ appears in his exegesis of the \\"kenotic hymn\\" of Philippians 2:6‚Äì7. Here, Elipandus argued that Christ, after ‚Äúemptying himself‚Äù of divinity and becoming a human being, was ‚ÄúSon of God‚Äù by virtue of adoption: Elipandus, unlike Arius or Nestorius, held to a strict singular personhood in the incarnation, that of the eternal, divine Son. Some, like Ansprenger, have claimed that Elipandus' Christology bears similarities to that of the earlier Antiochene theologian Theodore of Mopsuestia and may indicate a line of influence from Nestorian sources.F. Ansprenger, \\"Untersuchungen zum adoptianistischen Streit des 8. Jahrhundert\\", Ph.D. thesis (Freie Universit√§t Berlin, 1952), here 42. Beatus of Liebana Beatus of Liebana (or Lieban), was, like Elipandus, a native of Spain, but unlike Elipandus, he lived outside of Muslim territory in the small Christian kingdom of Asturias. A monk, Beatus appears to have been a person of influence in Asturias, possibly counselor to the Queen of Leon. Beatus was also a skilled exegete, best known for his Commentary on the Apocalypse of John.Cavadini, The Last Christology of the West, 52‚Äì53. In Adversus Elipandum, written in response to Elipandus‚Äô Adoptionist teachings, Beatus chastised Elipandus for what he saw as a misuse of the word servus (\\"slave\\" or \\"servant\\"), arguing that Philippians 2 referred to Christ‚Äôs servanthood in relation to God. The \\"self-emptying\\" of the Son in the incarnation was not to be understood as a humiliation to the point that the human Christ would have to be adopted once more in divinity, he claimed.Ginther, \\"Adoptionism\\", in Westminster Handbook of Medieval Theology, 3. Additionally, Beatus criticized Elipandus for his emphasis on Christ sharing in humanity. Beatus saw this as unnecessary, and dangerously close to ignoring Jesus' distinctness from the rest of humanity; instead, he focused his attention on Christ's mediatorial position on the cross as a sufficient salvific bridge between God and humanity. In Adversus Elipandum, Beatus distinguished between the adoption of Christians as children by God, rejecting the adoption of Christ: Felix of Urgel In the midst of his dialogue with Beatus on the issue of adoption, Elipandus wrote to Felix of Urgel (d. 818), bishop of Urgell in Carolingian-occupied territory in the Pyrenees, for another opinion on the matter.Elipandus of Toledo, \\"Letter to Felix\\", PL 96: 880‚Äì882. It was Felix's teaching that first caught the attention of Frankish scholars and churchmen. None of Felix's works survive, and his teachings only survive as they were portrayed by the Carolingian scholars who opposed him. Felix appears to have relied heavily on the language of adoption, tying the adoption of Christ's humanity by the divine to Christ's mediation of adoptive son-ship for all believing Christians. Cavadini sees in this position a moderating stance between Elipandus and Beatus.Cavadini, The Last Christology of the West, 120‚Äì121. Ultimately, Felix's Christology became the prime target for Carolingian interlocutors. Facing ecclesiastical and political pressure, he recanted before the pope. In 799, Felix composed his Confessio, in which he renounced \\"Nestorian\\" teachings and agreed to no longer use the term adoptivus.Cavadini, The Last Christology of the West, 126; Felix of Urgel, Confessio Felicis, PL 96:881‚Äì888. The Carolingian response  In 785, Pope Hadrian I appears to have been the first to attack Elipandus' Adoptionist Christology as a form of Nestorianism, although the pope does not seem to have been fully informed on the content of the teaching. The pope‚Äôs initial negative response ‚Äì describing Adoptionism as Nestorian in separating the Son of God from the human son of Mary ‚Äì shaped the perception of the theology for later Carolingians.Pope Hadrian, \\"First Letter to the Bishops of Spain\\", Codex Carolinus #95 in MGH, Epistolae, III, ed. W. Gundlach (Berlin, 1892), 636‚Äì643. Charlemagne as well grew concerned by reports of heresy in his new Pyrenees territories, and commissioned his own response to the Adoptionist teaching, spearheaded by his erudite court scholar Alcuin of York.Ginther, Westminster Handbook, 4. This Carolingian response developed in three regional councils called by the king in 792 (Regensburg), 795 (Frankfurt), and 799 (Aachen). The Council of Frankfurt in 795 was particularly significant, commissioning three documents to address the Adoptionist position: the \\"Letter of the Bishops of Frankland to the Bishops of Spain\\" (written by Alcuin),Alcuin of York, Epistola episcoporum Franciae, MGH, Concilium, II, 152.9‚Äì10. the Liber sacrosyllabus of Paulinus of Aquileia,Paulinus of Aquileia, Libellus Sacrosyllabus Episcoporum Italiae, PL 99:151‚Äì182. and the \\"Letter of Charlemagne to Elipandus\\".Charlemagne, Epistola Karoli Magni ad Elipandum et episcopos Hispaniae, MGH, Concilium, II, 157-64. All three works followed Pope Hadrian's early characterization of the Adoptionist position as Nestorian. Alcuin in particular developed his critique around the classical orthodox Christological dichotomy which emerged from the eastern Christological controversies of the fifth and sixth centuries: Nestorianism on one extreme and Monophysitism on the other. Alcuin refined this view in his writings against Felix of Urgel: \\"Letter 23 to Felix\\", Adversus Felicem Urgellitanum Episcopum Libri VII,Alcuin, Seven Books Against Bishop Felix of Urgel, PL 101:119‚Äì230. and Liber Adversus Haeresin Felicis.In Liber Alcuini Contra Haeresim Felicis: Edition with an Introduction, ed. Gary B. Blumenshine, Studi e testi 285 (Vatican City: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, 1980). Other Carolingian attacks on Adoptionism were composed by Benedict of Aniane,Benedict of Aniane, Disputatio Benedicti levitate adversus Felicianam impietatem, PL 103:1399B‚Äì1411B. Paulinus II of Aquileia (Three Books Against Felix),Paulini Aquileienses Opera Omnia Pars I: Contra Felicem Libri Tres, ed. Dag Norberg, CCCM 95 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1990) and later, by Agobard.Adversum Dogma Felicis, ed. L. Van Acker, in Agobardi Lugdunensis Opera Omnia, CCCM 52 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1981), 71‚Äì111. An official condemnation by Pope Leo III in 798 ended with Felix's final recantation in 799. According to Pelikan, the orthodox Catholic consensus held that the key error of Spanish Adoptionism was to make Christ's sonship a predicate of his two natures rather than on his single personhood.Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, vol. 3, The Growth of Medieval Theology (600‚Äì1300), (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), 57. Paulinus of Aquileia In his anti-Adoptionist works, Paulinus explained that Catholics proclaim and adore Jesus Christ as \\"true God\\", but also confess him to be \\"true man\\". However, calling him \\"true man\\" is not the same as calling him an ordinary man which was the implication of the idea that his humanity had been adopted to be the Son of God. He further rejected the Spanish Adoptionists' equation of adoption with assumption, since not every assumption is properly an adoption, even though every adoption is a kind of assumption. Elipandus had compared the adopted humanity of Christ with that of the other saints. Felix seemed to have taught that Christ needed to be baptized to be adopted as Son of God. But Paulinus countered that if Christ had been adopted by God, as Moses had been adopted by Pharaoh's daughter or as Christ himself had been adopted by Joseph, Christ would only be Son of God in an improper, not essential, sense. Paulinus, admitted, however, that the term \\"adoption\\" was fitting for Christians and it is Christ who confers adoption on them.Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, vol. 3, The Growth of Medieval Theology (600‚Äì1300), (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), 54‚Äì55. Modern assessment Modern scholars have often followed the critiques of Hadrian, Alcuin, or Agobard in constructing an interpretation of Spanish Adoptionism. Both Ansprenger and Harnack, noting similarities between Theodore of Mopsuestia's Christology and that of the Spanish Adoptionists, concluded that the Spanish must have had access to Theodore‚Äôs biblical commentaries.Harnack, History of Dogma, 283. However, John C. Cavadini has argued that the Carolingian attack on Spanish Adoptionism as \\"Nestorian\\" was based on a misunderstanding of the Spanish debate. Cavadini stresses that for all that Beatus and Elipandus might disagree, they drew inspiration from a common Christological tradition different from that of the theologians on the other side of the Pyrenees. Neither Spaniard referred to the eastern Christological debates, nor did they cite the teaching of the Council of Chalcedon (451). Rather, Cavadini claims, they drew on the unique theological heritage of Iberian Christianity, with a heavy reliance upon Augustine of Hippo, Hilary of Poitiers, and Isidore of Seville.Cavadini, The Last Christology of the West, 105.

She was potential heiress to the Danish throne and was the older sister of Margaret I of Denmark.

Squadron history VAW-120 E-2C at NAS Oceana in 1989 VAW-120 C-2A at NAS Oceana in 1989 VAW-120 E-2C lands aboard The squadron was originally established on 6 July 1948 as Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VAW-2) at NAS Oceana. It later relocated to NAS Norfolk.  1960s  In July 1966, VAW-12 received the first E-2A Hawkeye and was supplying detachments utilizing two different aircraft aboard ten Atlantic Fleet aircraft carriers in addition to training personnel for those detachments. With over 200 officers and 800 enlisted personnel, VAW-12 was reorganized as an Air Wing, and on 1 April 1967, Admiral T.E. Moore, Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, commissioned Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing Twelve with six operating squadrons. Later renamed RVAW-120, it became the Atlantic Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS).  1970s  The squadron received the E-2B Hawkeye aircraft in 1970, followed by the arrival of the E-2C on 31 May 1973. With the delivery of the first Advanced Radar Processing System (ARPS) aircraft in 1978, RVAW-120 trained Naval Flight Officers (NFO), Flight Technicians and maintenance personnel in both the APS-120 and APS-125 radars. This continued until 1980 when all east coast VAW squadrons completed the transition to the APS-125.  1980s  In 1983, RVAW-120 officially became VAW-120, reflecting the task load of a fleet squadron and a training squadron. NFO training was moved to a new site in April 1983. Pilot training was also moved to the new E-2 Training Building in late 1984 for consolidation of the training mission. In June 1985, VAW-120 received the first re-procured C-2As delivered to the Navy. This delivery marked the commencement of a long-range procurement program designed to greatly enhance the Carrier onboard delivery (COD) capability for Carrier Battle Groups. The addition of the re-procured C-2A Greyhound brought the added responsibility of creating a new training program for the pilots and aircrew of Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons VRC-30 and VRC-40 which included the first ever C-2A night carrier qualifications.  1990s  In November 1993, VAW-120 received its first E-2C+ aircraft. The E-2C continued its technological growth and in February 1994 the command took custody of its first E-2C (Group II) aircraft. This version of the E-2C introduced the APS-145 radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) to aid in navigation. VAW-120 became the single site Fleet Replacement Squadron in September 1994 when VAW-110, its west coast counterpart, was decommissioned.  2000s  In response to the September 11 attacks, VAW-120 launched aircraft in support of homeland defense operations. their missions included airborne surveillance, ground communication relay, and track management along the east coast.  2010s  In 2010, VAW-120 received its first C-2A Greyhound aircraft upgraded with a new 8-bladed propeller. In addition, VAW-120 received the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.

The scenes included artistic representations of oil fields, agricultural fields, pecan groves, granite quarries, and ranch scenes.The New York Times. September 18, 1903, p. 8. To date, only one of White's World's Fair Commission paintings is known to survive. It is thought that maybe the others were destroyed by a fire in his St. Louis studio in 1915.St. Louis Post Dispatch. July 25th, 1915. The surviving panorama, The Harbor at Galveston was donated to the Houston Public Library by White's widow, Mertie Boughton White, after his death. White's work in St. Louis White moved to St. Louis, Missouri with his newlywed wife, Mertie Boughton White, in 1904 to curate the Texas exhibit in the World's Fair. While White's Texas panoramas represented the majority of the exhibit, works from other well-known Texas artists were also included such as those from Elisabet Ney, Pompeo Coppini, and Robert Jenkins Onderdonk's The Fall of the Alamo. White earned praise at the fair including being awarded a first prize for a still life titled Basket of Peaches in the Love Orchard at Jacksonville.Obituary, \\"Mr. Verner White,\\" The Chautauquan Weekly, Chautauqua Press, Chautauqua, New York, 1923.

Southwestern Historical Quarterly Vol CXIII, April, 2010, p. 423. During his St. Louis period, White continued to paint marine and hunting scenes, but may have been best known for his depictions of blossoming fruit trees. The apple trees near his home in St. Louis would become one of his favorite motifs, and White would become widely recognized for the theme.Baker, James Graham.

He was not a Kuwaiti, but rather was an ethnic Pashtun and a Pakistani citizen. He adopted the last name Al-Kuwaiti because his Pakistani parents lived in Kuwait. According to secret documents, he was one of the few men bin Laden completely trusted and was said to be his \\"favorite courier and right-hand man\\". He sheltered and lived with bin Laden for a number of years and was killed along with him by the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group on 2 May 2011. 2000s Al-Kuwaiti was a Pashtun, an ethnic Afghan background who was born and grew up in Kuwait and spoke Pashto (in a cultivated, urbane accent) and Arabic. He was a prot√©g√© of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and had reportedly given computer training in Karachi to the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. He was implicated in the attacks and was contacted in the aftermath by Riduan \\"Hambali\\" Isamuddin. Al-Kuwaiti provided a safe haven to Isamuddin and several of his close associates in his home in a quiet residential neighborhood of Karachi. Guantanamo Bay documents dated 16 January 2008 revealed that Mohamedou Ould Salahi had claimed that Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti was wounded while fleeing Tora Bora after the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001 and had later died from his arm injuries. The document claimed he was a mid-level al-Qaeda operative who facilitated the movement and safe haven of senior al-Qaeda members and families. As a speaker of Arabic and Pashto he could communicate and move easily among both the Arab members of al-Qaeda and the Pashtun tribesmen of Pakistan. Contradicting the claims by Salahi that al-Kuwaiti had died in December 2001, in 2007 U.S. officials discovered the courier's real name and, in 2009, that he lived in Abbottabad, Pakistan. These findings were based on information collected from Guant√°namo Bay detainees, notably Hassan Gul in 2004. From Gul, the United States intelligence learned that al-Kuwaiti was also close to Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libi. Gul further revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, a fact which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with Bin Laden. the compound He was reportedly tracked from Peshawar by Pakistanis working for the CIA. \\"The National Security Agency reportedly tracked phone calls between the courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's relatives in the Persian Gulf to all numbers in Pakistan, and NSA surveillance eventually tracked Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's location in Pakistan via one such phone call\\", the AP writes. \\"In August 2010 they tracked al-Kuwaiti as he drove from Peshawar to a residence in Abbottabad ‚Äì and as analysts inventoried the compound's striking security features they became convinced that it housed a high-level al-Qaeda figure.\\" Compound where al-Kuwaiti hid Osama bin Laden and his family 2010s Using satellite photos and intelligence reports, the CIA sought to identify the inhabitants of the fortified compound in Abbottabad. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was \\"custom built to hide someone of significance\\" and that it was very likely that Osama bin Laden was residing there. Al-Kuwaiti was said to be one of the two tall fair-skinned bearded men who claimed to be ethnic Pashtuns and were known in the community to be living at the house and occasionally attended local funerals. He went locally by the name Arshad Khan, and his brother (or cousin as some neighbors thought) went by the name Tareq Khan. They claimed to be from a village near the town of Charsadda. Some people believed he was from Shangla (Khakhtagatta area). Charsadda lies about 180 kilometres to the west, while Shangla is situated on the northern side 190 kilometres from Abbottabad in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (old name NWFP). Some locals thought that the Khan brothers had obtained their wealth from a family-owned hotel in Dubai. Al-Kuwaiti also claimed that because of his occupation as a money changer, he needed high walls to keep out enemies he had encountered in his profession. He was described as \\"a friendly man from the tribal-areas\\". Death Kuwaiti along with Bin Laden was killed during the raid on the compound by a United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group team on 2 May 2011.

It is operated by the Northern Railways. Its number is 14645/14646. It comes in the Non Superfast (Mail/Express) trains category of the Indian Railways. History and etymology The Shalimar Express is one of the oldest trains to Jammu Tawi. It has been given the name 'Shalimar' with reference to the Shalimar Gardens of Srinagar, as Jammu Tawi was the nearest railway station to Srinagar at that time. Arrival and departure The train leaves at 15:50 every day from Delhi to Jammu Tawi. It reaches Jammu Tawi the next morning, early, at around 05:20. While heading towards the Capital, it leaves Jammu Tawi at 20:45 from #platform 3 and arrives at Delhi at about 10:50 at platform 1 at the next morning. Route and halts Unlike all other trains to Jammu Tawi, this train does not take the Delhi - Jammu Tawi main route. This train goes via Ghaziabad, Meerut, khatauli, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Amabla Cantonment Junction, Ludhiana Junction, and Jalandhar; instead of Sonipat, Panipat, [Karnal], and Kurukshetra. The train passes through parts of Delhi NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. It has 26 halts before reaching Old Delhi. It is one of two trains travelling through this route. With the doubling and electrification of the entire Jalandhar - Pathankot - Jammu Tawi section, it is expected that the average speed of the Shalimar Express will increase in the near future.

The domain is named after the acronym cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases. Many of these proteins are uncharacterised, but it has been proposed that they may function mainly in peptidoglycan hydrolysis. The CHAP domain is found in a wide range of protein architectures; it is commonly associated with bacterial type SH3 domains and with several families of amidase domains. It has been suggested that CHAP domain containing proteins utilise a catalytic cysteine residue in a nucleophilic-attack mechanism. The CHAP domain contains two invariant residues, a cysteine and a histidine. These residues form part of the putative active site of CHAP domain containing proteins. Secondary structure predictions show that the CHAP domain belongs to the alpha + beta structural class, with the N-terminal half largely containing predicted alpha helices and the C-terminal half principally composed of predicted beta strands. Some proteins known to contain a CHAP domain are listed below: * Bacterial and trypanosomal glutathionylspermidine amidases. * A variety of bacterial autolysins. * A Nocardia aerocolonigenes putative esterase. * Streptococcus pneumoniae choline-binding protein D. * Methanosarcina mazei protein MM2478, a putative chloride channel. * Several phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases. * Cysteine peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family C51 (D-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase, clan CA).

It is part of the Greater St. Albert Catholic Schools. MCHS is the only high school serving the Morinville community. Greater St. Albert Catholic SchoolsMorinville Community High School About Us The school was founded in November 1994 and teaches students from grade 9-12. Their athletic teams are called the \\"Prairie Wolves,\\" or just the \\"Wolves.\\" History Morinville was for a long time served by high schools in neighbouring towns: the much older and larger settlement of St. Albert to the south, and the small agricultural village of Legal to the north. The Grey Nuns had established a small convent, schoolhouse, and hospital in what was to become the settlement of St. Albert in 1864. The Catholic Church continued to dominate education in the region even after the first public school boards were formed, as most the population was Catholic. In the earliest days, each school had its own board, and St. Albert had a school board as early as 1885 when both St. Albert Roman Catholic Public District no. 3 and nearby Bellerose Roman Catholic Public District no. 6 were both formed to operate one-room schools that went up to grade 8, the legal requirement at the time (Bellerose School was later moved to Fort Edmonton Park where it still stands). The first school district founded in the Morinville area was the Thibault Roman Catholic School Public District. The school was named after the founder, Father Thibault who started a mission and a school in 1892. Nearby Legal, Alberta got its school district in 1907, and later a secondary school: St. Emile High School. Morinville then had the same schooling situation for several decades, with elementary in town, and high schools to the north and south. The most notable change of that period was in 1980 when French immersion was officially offered in the Morinville schools, reversing decades of \\"English-only\\" policy in what that originally been a francophone settlement. In 1993, Legal‚Äôs St. Emile High School closed. The Thibault School District opened Morinville Community High School on November 3, 1994. The first principal of MCHS was Paul O‚ÄôDea. On January 1, 1995, the three main schools in Legal and Morinville were joined into the Greater St. Albert Catholic Regional Division or GSACRD as part of a wave of school board consolidations across Alberta at that time. When MCHS was first opened the grade 9 hallway was not part of the school. It was only added later when the number of grade 9s in G.H. Primeau School was too high. Courses and programs Morinville Community High School offers many different Courses, including all courses required by the Province of Alberta, plus a wide selection of options. It also provides programs called iLearn and RAP. Quite a few of these courses are offered in French as well.

Margerique was an unraced mare by the imported British stallion Order out of Margerine, who also foaled another successful racer The Commoner. Racing career Haggin sold Nasturtium as a yearling to Follansbee and Chanler, who in turn sold him to Anthony L. Aste for $4,300 at auction in 1901.\\"American Horse In The English Derby,\\" The Patriot, 3-15-1902; p. 11; Harrisburg, PA. Nasturtium was sold to William C. Whitney on June 22, 1901 for $50,000. His training was then taken over by John W. Rogers. Nasturtium won three of his five starts in 1901. He was a disappointing 9/5 favorite when finishing tenth behind Yankee in the Futurity Stakes on August 31 at Belmont, but won the Flatbush Stakes at Sheepshead Bay Race Track four days later. He took the race \\"cleverly, almost easily\\" from his stablemate Goldsmith in a track record time of 1:25.6. Whitney's target for the colt was the 1902 Epsom Derby, having won the race in 1901 with Volodyovski.

His arrival at Newmarket, Suffolk was reported to have caused \\"considerable interest,\\" and was offered at odds of 6/1 for the Epsom Classic. Despite all Whitney's precautions however, Nasturtium fell ill shortly after his arrival and was unable to run in England as intended. Stud career After William Whitney's death, Nasturtium was sold in the October 1904 dispersal sale for $10,000 to Col. Milton Young. Nasturtium was later sold to George J. Stoll.

Born in Portsmouth, England, he was known principally for his contribution in the Middle East and designing 7 star hotel Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.  Biography = Education  John Elliott (Richard John Anthony Elliott), was born in Portsmouth, England. After leaving home at the age of 15, he travelled around Europe before winning a scholarship at the Architectural Association School of ArchitectureArchitectural Association School of Architecture in London. Upon graduating, he took a short course in product design at the Central School of Art,Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design before winning a prestigious Finnish government scholarship and finishing his post graduate studies at the Institute of Technology in Helsinki, Finland.  Early career  After Finland he moved to Sweden where he spent three years in the office of Ralph Erskine. His years in Sweden and Finland had a profound influence on his design approach to the practice of architecture, and it was this practical experience that started a lifetime of wide angle focus on design. In 1967, John became the first official town planner of Abu Dhabi, where his specialisation in the Arabian peninsula began. Initially involved with the first developments of Abu Dhabi, John had a close working relationship with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918‚Äì2004), ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates (1971‚Äì2004). His work later took him to Saudi Arabia designing projects such as the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah and consulting for the town planning of Jeddah and Riyadh for the royal family.  Sultan of Brunei  In addition to architecture, John also worked in interior design, as managing partner of Dale Keller & Associates' London Office. Here, he designed a 3 million square meter stately palace commissioned by the Sultan of Brunei.  Hong Kong  He moved to Dale Keller & Associate's Hong Kong office, and was involved in several new hotels in China and other parts of the Far East. John stayed in Hong Kong for 13 years and began working with Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo's founder, George J. \\"Pete\\" Wimberly.  WATG  In 1991, John moved back to the UK as founder member and managing director of Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo's (WATG) London office. He became a member of the board of directors and senior vice- president, specialising in Middle East projects.  Personal life  John Elliott had four children, two from his first marriage to Lisbet Frolich, Timo and Maja, and two children from his marriage to Erika Grohmann, Kelsey and Yolande. John and Erika raised Kelsey and Yolande in Hong Kong before moving back to the UK, where they lived in Sandbanks, Dorset.

The lands were laid out after the drainage of Holland Fen by Act of Parliament in 1776. Pelhams Lands was formerly an extra-parochial area, but was formed into a parish in 1883.

There are two further Grade II listed 18th-century buildings on the Farm, a stable with granary and an earth closet. There was a tower windmill at Pelhams Lands, built in 1838 to replace an earlier post mill which had blown down. The mill lost its cap in 1926, after which it was engine driven.

History  When the Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol was completed in 1841 a hotel was needed for people visiting the town. According to English Heritage, the building is likely to have been designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was GWR's Chief Engineer at the time of its construction and who incorporated similar features in the Royal Station Hotel at Slough (which was demolished in 1938). The building was completed in 1844 and was used as a hotel until a fire in the 1960s.

Biography B√©la Kov√°cs was born in Hungary in 1908. He became involved in politics and joined the Smallholders Party (FKGP). It drew most of its support from the peasants who formed more than 50 percent of the country. However, until 1939, the ballot had been open in rural constituencies, and therefore large landowners were able to force most peasants to vote for the government party. The leaders of the Smallholders Party were mainly members of the middle class and their political views varied from liberals to socialists. The Soviet Army invaded Hungary in September 1944. It set up an alternative government in Debrecen on 21 December 1944 but did not capture Budapest until 18 January 1945. Soon afterwards Zolt√°n Tildy (FKGP member) became the provisional prime minister. In elections held in November 1945, the Smallholders Party won 57% of the vote. The Hungarian Workers Party, now under the leadership of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi and Ern≈ë Ger≈ë, received support from only 17% of the population. The Soviet commander in Hungary, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, refused to allow the Smallholders to form a government. Instead Voroshilov established a coalition government with the communists holding all the key posts. Kov√°cs became minister of agriculture (1945‚Äì46). Statue of B√©la Kov√°cs in Budapest The Hungarian Communist Party became the largest single party in the elections in 1947 and served in the coalition People's Independence Front government. The communists gradually gained control of the government and by 1948 the Smallholders Party ceased to exist as an independent organization. Kov√°cs was arrested and charged with plotting against the occupation forces. He was found guilty and sentenced life imprisonment in Siberia. M√°ty√°s R√°kosi also demanded complete obedience from fellow members of the Hungarian Workers Party. When L√°szl√≥ Rajk, the foreign secretary, criticised attempts by Joseph Stalin to impose Stalinist policies on Hungary he was arrested and in September 1949 he was executed. J√°nos K√°d√°r and other dissidents were also purged from the party during this period. R√°kosi now attempted to impose authoritarian rule on Hungary. An estimated 2,000 people were executed and over 100,000 were imprisoned. These policies were opposed by some members of the Hungarian Workers Party and around 200,000 were expelled by R√°kosi from the organization. Kov√°cs was released from prison in 1956. The Hungarian Uprising began on 23 October by a peaceful demonstration of students in Budapest. The students demanded an end to Soviet occupation and the implementation of \\"true socialism\\". The following day commissioned officers and soldiers joined the students on the streets of Budapest. Stalin's statue was brought down and the protesters chanted \\"Russians go home\\", \\"Away with Ger≈ë\\" and \\"Long Live Nagy\\". On 25 October, whilst personnel of Soviet tanks and Hungarian demonstrators were fraternizing in front of the Parliament in Kossuth t√©r, a detachment of Hungarian secret policemen in position on the top of the buildings opposite to the Parliament opened fire on the crowd in Kossuth Square. One journalist at the scene saw 12 dead bodies and estimated that 170 had been wounded. Shocked by these events the Central Committee of the Communist Party forced Ern≈ë Ger≈ë to resign from office and replaced him with J√°nos K√°d√°r. Imre Nagy now went on Radio Kossuth and promised \\"the far-reaching democratization of Hungarian public life, the realisation of a Hungarian road to socialism in accord with our own national characteristics, and the realisation of our lofty national aim: the radical improvement of the workers' living conditions.\\" On 3 November, Nagy announced details of his coalition government (third Imre Nagy cabinet). It included Kov√°cs, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Anna K√©thly, Zolt√°n Tildy, Ferenc Farkas, G√©za Losonczy, , , J√≥zsef Fischer, P√°l Mal√©ter, Zolt√°n Sz√°nt√≥ and Istv√°n Bib√≥. On 4 November 1956 Nikita Khrushchev sent the Red Army into Hungary and Nagy's government was overthrown. B√©la Kov√°cs, who remained a member of parliament, died in 1959.

In 1992, he and William Anthony Devane isolated and first described the structure of anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitter. Biography Lum√≠r Hanu≈° was born in 1947 in Olomouc, in what was then Czechoslovakia. He is a distant relative of Czech chemist Josef Hanu≈° (1872‚Äì1955). Academic career In 1966, Hanu≈° began studying at the Faculty of Science of Palack√Ω University Olomouc. In 1970, professor Zdenƒõk Krejƒç√≠ of the Faculty of Medicine's Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology (where the anti-bacterial effects of cannabis were described in 1955) needed an aide. Hanu≈° started to work as Krejƒç√≠'s assistant in the research of cannabis and hashish in December of that year. There, Hanu≈° also met professors Jan Kabel√≠k and Franti≈°ek ≈†antav√Ω, who, together with Krejƒç√≠, laid the foundations of the research of cannabis and its curative effects. Hanu≈° grew cannabis for research purposes on two fields in the Research Institute of Vegetable Growing and Breeding in Olomouc from 1971. The extracts were also used at the University Hospital Olomouc as a cure for aphthous ulcer, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pressure ulcers. Hanu≈° graduated with a Master of Science in 1972 and he earned a Doctorate in Science at Olomouc in 1974. He pursued his academic and research activities there until 1990. Hanu≈° also took part in research at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and continued post- graduate research study at Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ University in Brno (today Masaryk University). In years 1978‚Äì1979 he worked as a research associate at the University of Mississippi, focusing not only on cannabis, but also on coca leaves. He became associate professor in organic chemistry in Olomouc in 1994 and obtained a Doctorate of Sciences in pharmaceutical chemistry at Charles University in 1995. Hanu≈° was for many years in contact with Israeli cannabis researcher Raphael Mechoulam by letter. Following the Velvet Revolution, Hanu≈° was invited to continue his research at Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. In Israel, Hanu≈° and American molecular pharmacologist William Anthony Devane in 1992 first described the structure of Anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitter. Hanu≈° continues his research in Jerusalem on cannabinoids, endocannabinoids and their derivatives. Views on cannabis Hanu≈° marks cannabis as \\"one of the safest known medications\\". According to Hanu≈°, alcohol and tobacco should be \\"blacklisted\\" rather than cannabis, as there is a possibility of both physical and psychological addiction to the first two, while there is no possibility of physical, and only limited possibility of psychological addiction to marijuana. Moreover, people under the influence of marijuana are not dangerous to others. He does not support smoking marijuana because of the dangers of smoke inhalation. Hanu≈° is against uncontrolled use of marijuana, but he fully supports its use for medical purposes. In April 2010 and September 2011, Hanu≈° took part in a seminar of the Czech Parliament aimed at introduction of cannabinoid treatment.

It was released by Rykodisc in the US on March 29, 2011, and featured the single \\"Needle and Thread\\".  Background  Following a tour and collaboration with Jay Nash and Tony Lucca that resulted in the EP TFDI, Duke began assembling material for his next full-length album. He enlisted producer Jason Finkel, who had been the producer of the Acoustic Kingdom Underground EP that he had recorded earlier that year, to help lead the album. Duke and Finkel began pre-production in September 2009, working on songs such as \\"Seriously, Indulge Me\\" and \\"Needle and Thread.\\" However, production for the album was stopped indefinitely when Duke broke his right hand in an accident in November. Unable to play guitar, Duke spent the next four months tending and rehabbing his hand, while also focusing on writing. The inability to play guitar and time off lead Duke to rethink his album and when it was determined that he'd be able to play again, he went into the studio with a changed direction for the album. Recording continued in February and mixing was finished around August 2010. The single \\"Needle and Thread\\" was released on January 18, 2011 while the album was released on March 29, two and a half years after Kingdom Underground was released. Matt Duke performing at the City Winery in NYC on April 28, 2011, to help promote the album  Songs and themes  While the previous albums Winter Child and Kingdom Underground could be described as records built around others, meaning songs were interpretations of people and events as seen through Duke, One Day Die was about Duke himself. Duke said that the time of not being able to play because of his hand injury caused him to turn inward and reexamine events from his life, which provided much of the material for the record. Previously written songs were reworked and new songs were created when Duke returned to the studio. A total of 14 songs were recorded for the album, but three were cut before the album was mastered. The three cut songs included: \\"Slip and Fall,\\" which appeared as an acoustic song on the iTunes single release of \\"Needle and Thread;\\" \\"Dead Meat\\" which was described as a rock blues song; and an unnamed cover of a Nine Inch Nails song. During a live show at the City Winery in New York City on April 28, 2011, Duke talked about the song inspiration for \\"The Hour\\" which contains the lyrics \\"One Day Die,\\" that later became the title of the album. Duke said that the song is primarily about his mother coping with the death of a close friend and next-door neighbor, and is the first song that he had written for his mother.

Background The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) was incorporated in 1885 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Bell. On December 30, 1899, AT&T; acquired the assets of American Bell and became the parent company of the Bell System. For extending telephone service nationwide, new technologies had to be developed to propagate telephony signals over ever-increasing distances. Until Bell's second patent expired in 1894, Bell Telephone was the only company that could legally operate telephone systems in the United States. Between 1894 and 1904, after Bell's patents expired, over six thousand independent telephone companies arose in the US. The rise of these new companies brought new problems. Telephone customers on different carriers had no way of contacting each other‚Äîthere was no inter- connectivity between carriers. In order to connect all of the telephone customers, AT&T; began acquiring independent telephone providers, much to the dismay of remaining independents. These independents complained to the attorney general that AT&T; was eliminating the competition. In response to this, the attorney general referred the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which began an investigation. AT&T; then agreed to a settlement, now known as the Kingsbury Commitment. This consisted of a letter from AT&T; stating that \\"Bell agreed to provide interconnection to the independents and to refrain from further acquisitions.\\" However, AT&T; continued to acquire more noncompeting companies. The Willis-Graham Act, which was passed in 1921, shifted merger oversight to the ICC, lessening AT&T;'s constraints on the acquisition of competitors. This essentially repealed the Kingsbury Commitment. Because of this, by 1924 AT&T; had acquired 223 of the 234 independent telephone companies with approval of the ICC.

Plot In 1519, the teachings of Martin Luther sweep through the German principalities. They are welcomed by the peasants, who hope that the new doctrines will help to liberate them from the oppressive yoke of the nobility and the magistrates. The young pastor Thomas Muentzer embraces Lutheranism, but he is more radical in his support for the peasants. In 1523, Muentzer arrives in Allstedt to assume the office of the local pastor. When a local villager is arrested after assaulting an overseer who tried to rape his sister, the priest helps him escape. He also carries a first Mass in German rather than Latin, and preaches his flock to destroy all the saints' icons in the local chapel, which he deems to be heretical. The people burn it down. The local baron retaliates by destroying the village. The priest now realizes that he is no longer a follower of Luther, who called to refrain from violence. He flees to southern Germany, where he and his friend Heinrich Pfeiffer take over the city of Muehlhausen and form a peasant rebel army, intending to liberate the people. But betrayal and the schemes of the nobility bring about their defeat in the Battle of Frankenhausen. Muentzer is captured; as he is tortured, he refuses to deny his religious doctrines and is then executed.

Production The communist leadership of East Germany, in its attempts to create a unifying narrative for the citizens of their country, attempted to portray the history of the land as a chain of events which developed according to the rules of Marxism-Leninism, leading unavoidably to the consolidation of socialist power in the state. The figure of the preacher Thomas Muentzer held an especially important status in the eyes of the establishment, both because of his radical theology that was regarded as a precursor to communism and his recognition by Friedrich Engels, who viewed him as a revolutionary leader - as stated in Engels' book, The Peasant War in Germany.Robert Walinski-Kiehl.

Reception The film had its premiere on 17 May 1956, on the tenth anniversary to DEFA's founding.Thomas Muentzer on DEFA Foundation's website. It was commercially released on the following day. The Der Spiegel film critic wrote that the picture was \\"intended to depict the 16th-Century Iconoclast as Walter Ulbricht's ideological predecessor\\" and that its plot culminated in \\"a complete confusion.\\" West Germany's Catholic Film Service described it as \\"an immense production... with a superficial and biased interpretation of history... in spite of the expensive crowd scenes, it is anemic.\\"The critic, quoted on film-zeit.de. In 1970, a review of the German Film Studies' Institute noted that for uncertain reasons, Martin Luther was not seen in the film at all.Institut f√ºr Filmwissenschaft.

In a special 13-minutes-long supplement to the new edition, historian Susanne Galley noted several inaccuracies in the plot: Muentzer is shown to have held to his beliefs under torture, while in reality he agreed to deny them before his execution; the peasants' defeat in the Battle of Frankenhausen is attributed to betrayal and sabotage, rather than to the weakness of their army. Galley believed that the plot was affected by the government's ideological tendencies.The DVD edition on icestorm.de. The supplement is in the extended package.

Team Oreca have not entered a race yet but plan to race at the 1000 km of Spa and Le Mans. The first race the Oreca 03 competed in was the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, the first round of the American Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, where the French team of Signatech Nissan competed for ILMC glory in the LMP2 class with drivers Franck Mailleux, long term Oreca driver Soheil Ayari and 2009 GT Academy winner Lucas Ordo√±ez. The trio had been quick throughout practice and took pole at the Sebring International Raceway, almost four seconds quicker than the next nearest LMP2 class car. Unfortunately, because the car was brand new, problems occurred including continuous gearbox problems. In the end, the No. 26 car finished 30th overall and second in class as there were very little LMP2 entrants. 2013 Oreca 03-Nissan LMP2 Le Mans series racing car The next race on the calendar was the 6 Hours of Castellet, round one of the 2011 Le Mans Series season.

The film was released on December 19, 2012, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $41 million on a production budget of $40 million. Plot Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen) is a UCLA-graduate organic chemist and inventor. He is attempting to get his environmentally friendly cleaning product, ScieoClean, in a major retail store. However, each retail store he visits dismisses him before he can end his pitch. After a disappointing sales pitch to K-Mart, he visits his mother, Joyce Brewster (Barbra Streisand), in New Jersey before leaving on a cross-country trip to Las Vegas, lying to her that his pitch ended well so she won't worry about him. While there she reveals to him that he was named after a boy she fell in love with in Florida named Andrew Margolis, whom she hoped would object to her marriage with Andy's father. However, he never did and she felt that she never mattered to him afterwards. After a little research, he finds Andrew Margolis is still alive and unmarried living in San Francisco. He invites his unknowing mother on the trip, claiming he wants to spend some time with her. The road trip quickly becomes hard for Andy as his mother continues to intervene in his life. After their car breaks down in Tennessee, Joyce calls Andy's ex-girlfriend Jessica (Yvonne Strahovski), whom Joyce insists Andy should get back together with, to pick them up. At a pregnant and married Jessica's house she reveals that Andy proposed to her before college and she turned him down, shocking Joyce, who believed Andy had trouble proposing to women. Andy is glum afterward and Joyce apologizes for calling Jessica, which Andy half-heartedly accepts. In Texas, Andy has a meeting with Costco executive Ryan McFeer (Brandon Keener) however Joyce stays at the meeting and criticizes the products bottling and name along with Ryan to the point that Andy snaps at him. At the motel that night a depressed Andy begins drinking and Joyce attempts to make up with him however Andy snaps at her, only to have Joyce snap back and leave for a nearby bar. Later Andy attempts to retrieve his mother but gets in a fight with a bar patron who attempts to stop her from leaving, receiving a black eye in the process. At a steak restaurant the next day the two exchange apologies and Andy reveals that he is failing at selling ScieoClean. Joyce enters a steak eating challenge where she is noticed by cowboy-styled businessman Ben Graw (Brett Cullen), who gives her tips on eating and helps her finish the challenge. Afterwards he reveals he does a lot of business in New Jersey and asks her to dinner. Joyce, who has never been in a relationship after Andy's dad died when he was eight, balks at the offer so Ben merely leaves his number and asks her to call if she reconsiders. Andy and Joyce begin to genuinely enjoy each other's company after, taking time out of their trip to visit the Grand Canyon (which Joyce has always wanted to visit) and having many other adventures. At Las Vegas, Joyce has such a good time that she asks Andy to leave her while he visits San Francisco, forcing him to reveal that there is no sales pitch in San Francisco and he only invited her to get her to meet Andrew Margolis. Joyce is very distraught as she believed Andy invited her because he actually wanted to spend time with her. He goes to make his pitch at the Home Shopping Network but finds that his science-fact based pitch bores the network's executives and makes them uninterested. He then sees Joyce in the filming crew and takes her advice by appealing to the Network's host family safety and drinking his own product, proving that it is organic and safe for children. Afterwards the Network CEO approaches him and shows genuine interest in selling ScieoClean on the Network. Later, a jubilant Andy and Joyce decide to visit Andrew Margolis's house. However, when they arrive they are informed by Andrew's son, Andrew Margolis Jr. (Adam Scott) (whom Andy mistakenly researched instead of the father) that his father died five years ago. After seeing Joyce's grief he invites them inside, where he learns that his father and Joyce were close. She asks if Andrew's father ever mentioned her, but he says he never did as he only confided personal information to their mother, who is away. However he then introduces his sister (Ari Graynor), who is named Joyce after Andy's mom. Joyce is overjoyed by this as she had previously stated her belief that you name your children after someone you cherished and want to remember. This shatters her belief that she didn't matter to Andrew and makes her overjoyed. Afterwards they part ways at the San Francisco Airport; Andy to make his next sales pitch and Joyce back to New Jersey, where she arranges a date with Ben Graw. The two leave content and much closer than they had been.

It was released December 19, 2012. This film marks Streisand's first starring role since The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996. She appeared in supporting roles in Meet the Fockers in 2004 and Little Fockers in 2010, as well as in a number of television series. Release=Box office The Guilt Trip grossed $5.3 million in its opening weekend, coming in at No. 6. It ultimately grossed $37.1 million in the US and $4.7 million elsewhere, for a total of $41.9 million worldwide. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 5.05/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand have enough chemistry to drive a solidly assembled comedy; unfortunately, The Guilt Trip has a lemon of a script and is perilously low on comedic fuel.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B-\\" on scale of A to F. Mary Pols of Time stated, \\"The Guilt Trip works because we all know and like a Joyce Brewster (or dozens of them)\\". At the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards, Streisand was nominated for Worst Actress, where she lost to Kristen Stewart for both Snow White and the Huntsman and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 2.

Approximately three quarters of college students aged 18‚Äì20 years old drank alcohol in 2009. Within the U.S., youth are being targeted by social media in order to drive sales higher by highlighting alcohol consumption in a positive way.

A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration evaluated 12 sustainably designed GSA buildings, and found they cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were more satisfied with the overall building than those in typical commercial buildings. Wood products from responsible sources are a good choice for most green building projects ‚Äì both new construction and renovations. Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun, is renewable, sustainable and recyclable. It is an effective insulator and uses far less energy to produce than concrete or steel.WoodWorks Sustainable Design Wood can also mitigate climate change because wood products continue to store carbon absorbed by the tree during its growing cycle, and because substituting wood for fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete result in ‚Äòavoided‚Äô greenhouse gas emissions. Wood's natural beauty and warmth have been shown to generate improved productivity and performance in schools, offices and better patient outcomes in hospitals. Life cycle assessment A life cycle assessment can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing each and every impact associated with all the stages of a process from cradle-to-grave (i.e., from raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling). A comprehensive review of scientific literature from Europe, North America and Australia pertaining to life cycle assessment of wood products concluded, among other things, that: * Fossil fuel consumption, the potential contributions to the greenhouse effect and the quantities of solid waste tend to be minor for wood products compared to competing products. * Wood products that have been installed and are used in an appropriate way tend to have a favourable environmental profile compared to functionally equivalent products out of other materials. A study by the Canadian Wood Council compared the life cycle impacts of three homes designed primarily in wood, steel and concrete over the first 20 years of their lifespans. Relative to the wood design, the steel and concrete designs released more air pollution, produced more solid wastes, used more resources, required more energy, emitted more greenhouse gases and discharged more water pollution.Canadian Wood Council When the complete life cycle is considered, including use and disposal, the great majority of the studies indicate that wood products have lower greenhouse gas emissions. In the few cases where wood products cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than their non-wood counterparts, the cause was inappropriate post- use disposal. Tools are available that enable architects to judge the relative environmental merits of building materials. They include the ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings, which is capable of modeling 95% of the building stock in North America, and the ATHENA¬Æ EcoCalculator for AssembliesATHENA Institute EcoCalculator for Assemblies provides instant life cycle assessment results for common assemblies based on detailed assessments previously conducted using the Estimator. The EcoCalculator is available free from the non-profit Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in order to encourage greater use of LCA by design and building professionals. Wood and climate change As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass (wood, leaves, roots). When trees decompose or burn, much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide, and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils. When a tree is cut and the wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture, the carbon is stored for decades or longer. A typical home in North America contains 29 metric tonnes of carbon, or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years (about 12,500 litres of gasoline.) When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime than other major building materials. Substituting a cubic metre of blocks or brick with wood results in a significant saving of 0.75 to one tone of carbon dioxide. Increasing the use of wood products in construction and for other long-lived uses, plus the use of wood byproducts and wood waste as biomass replacement for fossil fuels, can contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas stabilization. The sustainable management of forests for the production of wood products is a feasible and beneficial part of an overall strategy to mitigate climate change. Securing the Future, a United Kingdom government strategy for sustainable development, stated: ‚ÄúForestry practices can make a significant contribution by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the national forest estate, by burning wood for fuel, and by using wood as a substitute for energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel.‚Äù The role of wood in carbon balances FPInnovations, a Canadian non-profit research organization, conducted a literature review of 66 scientific peer-reviewed articles regarding the net impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases due to wood product use within a life cycle perspective. It showed several ways wood product substitution affects greenhouse gas balances, including: * Less fossil fuel consumption in manufacturing; * Avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions from cement manufacturing when wood products replace cement-based products; * Carbon storage in wood products and in the forest; and * Avoided fossil fuel emissions when wood biofuels replace fossil fuels. Energy efficiency As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete or steel. A recent case study of the Eugene Kruger Building in Quebec, Canada determined that the all-wood solution adopted for this 8,000-square-metre academic building resulted in a 40% reduction in embodied energy compared to steel and concrete alternatives. A 2002 study compared production energy values for building components (e.g. walls, floors, roofs) made predominantly of wood, steel and concrete, and found that wood construction has a range of energy use from 185 to 280 Gigajoules (GJ), concrete from 265 to 521 GJ, and steel from 457 to 649 GJ. Wood construction will generally use less energy than other materials, although the high end of the range of wood construction energy overlaps with the low end of the range of concrete construction. Passive design uses natural processes ‚Äì convection, absorption, radiation, and conduction ‚Äì to minimize energy consumption and improve thermal comfort. Researchers in Europe have identified wood as a suitable material in the development of passive buildings due to its unique combination of properties, including thermal resistance, natural finish, structural integrity, light weight and weatherproof qualities. Passive design is beginning to be incorporated in small buildings in North America through the use of structural wood panels. Due to its cellular structure and lots of tiny air pockets, wood is a better natural insulator in most climates ‚Äì 400 times better than steel and 10 times better than concrete. More insulation is needed for steel and concrete to achieve the same thermal performance. A 2002 study prepared by the National Association of Home Builders Research Center Inc. compared long-term energy use in two nearly identical side-by-side homes, one framed with conventional dimensional lumber and the second framed with cold-formed steel. It found the steel-framed house used 3.9% more natural gas in the winter and 10.7% more electricity in the summer. Health and well- being Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity. A study at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations found that the visual presence of wood in a room lowers sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in occupants, further establishing the positive link between wood and human health. SNS activation is the way human bodies prepare themselves to deal with stress. It increases blood pressure and heart rate while inhibiting digestion, recovery and repair functions in order to deal with immediate threats. While necessary in the short term, prolonged periods in an SNS-activated state have a negative effect on the body's physiological and psychological health. The study supports wood's value as a tool in evidence-based design (EBD) ‚Äì a growing field that seeks to promote health and other positive outcomes such as increased productivity and well-being based on scientifically credible evidence. So far, EBD has focused largely on healthcare and, in particular, patient recovery. Reducing waste Green building seeks to avoid wasting energy, water and materials during construction. Design and building professionals can reduce construction waste through design optimization, using right-sized framing members, for example, or pre-manufactured and engineered components. The wood industry reduces waste in a similar way by optimizing sawmill operations and by using wood chips and sawdust to produce paper and composite products, or as fuel for renewable bioenergy. North American wood producers use 98 percent of every tree harvested and brought to a mill. Rather than demolishing structures at the end of their useful life, they are deconstructed to reclaim useful building materials rather than dumping them in the landfill.In Business magazine Green Builders Get Big Help from Deconstruction When used properly, wood, concrete and steel can last for decades or centuries. In North America, most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values. Designing for flexibility and adaptability secures the greatest value for the embodied energy in building materials. Wood is versatile and flexible, making it the easiest construction material for renovations. Wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs, whether this involves adding a new room or moving a window or door. Wood structures are typically easy to adapt to new uses because the material is so light and easy to work with. Few homeowner or professional remodelers have the skill and equipment needed to alter steel- frame structures. Structural wood members can typically be reclaimed and reused for the same or similar purpose with only minor modifications or wastage, or remilled and fashioned into alternate products such as window and door frames. To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, the CO2 Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling. Responsible sourcing Wood is a responsible environmental choice for construction as long as it comes from forests that are managed sustainably. Illegal logging and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major problem for many timber-producing countries in the developing world. It causes environmental damage, costs governments billions of dollars in lost revenue, promotes corruption, undermines the rule of law and good governance and funds armed conflict. Consumer countries can use their buying power by ensuring the wood products they buy are from known and legal sources. Deforestation, which is the permanent removal of forests where the land is converted to other uses such as agriculture or housing, is also a significant problem in developing countries, and globally accounts for 17% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. The forests most vulnerable to destruction are in tropical regions of the world, where the rate of deforestation was estimated at a year from 1990 to 2005. According to the State of the World's Forests Report, 2007, ‚Äúthe world lost about 3 percent of its forest area from 1990 to 2005; but, in North America, the total forest area remained virtually constant.‚Äù When forest land is converted for other uses, a portion of the deforestation can be offset by afforestation‚Äîsuch as the planting of trees on land that has been bare of trees for a long time.Tackle Climate Change ‚Äì Use Wood book Voluntary third-party forest certification is a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations. With forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. This certification verifies that forests are well-managed ‚Äì as defined by a particular standard ‚Äì and ensures that certified wood and paper products come from legal and responsible sources. Green building rating systems A 2010 study by the Light House Sustainable Building Centre in British Columbia, Canada examined the ways in which the world's major voluntary green building rating systems incorporate wood. It found that rating systems for single family homes in North America were the most inclusive of wood products and rating systems for commercial buildings and buildings outside of North America were the least inclusive.Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems Systems studied included BREEAM (United Kingdom), Built Green (United States and Canada), CASBEE (Japan), Green Globes (United States), Green Star (Australia), LEED (launched in United States and used in countries such as Canada, China, India and Mexico), Living Building Challenge (United States and Canada), the NAHB ‚Äì National Green Building Program (United States), and the SB Tool (Canada and UK). In most cases, the rating systems offer credits/point for the use of wood in the following areas: certified wood; recycled /reused /salvaged materials; and local sourcing of materials. In some cases, building techniques and skills (such as advanced framing) and waste minimalization are recognized, and most demand that all wood adhesives, resins, engineered and composite products contain no added urea formaldehyde and have strict limits on VOC (volatile organic compound) content. LEED certified wood credit In December 2010, the U.S. Green Building Council failed to get enough yes votes from members for a proposed rewrite of the certified wood policy in its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Since its inception, LEED has only accepted wood certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards. The two largest third-party forest certification standards in the United States ‚Äì the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) ‚Äì opposed the proposed benchmarks. FSC questioned their rigor and SFI claimed the process was overly detailed and complex. A number of organizations, including the National Association of State Foresters, the Canadian Institute of Forestry, and the Society of American Foresters called for LEED to recognize all credible certification programs to encourage the use of wood as a green building material. In its 2008-2009 Forest Products Annual Review, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated that green building initiatives (GBI) can be a mixed blessing for wood products. ‚ÄúGBI standards giving exclusive recognition to particular forest-certification brands may help drive demand for these brands at the expense of wider appreciation of the environmental merits of wood.‚Äù In its 2009-2010 review, the UNECE/FAO reported growing convergence between certification systems: \\"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\\"  References  Category:Sustainable building Category:Wooden buildings and structures Category:Waste minimisation Category:Forest certification Category:Sustainable forest management Category:Sustainable building in the United States ","title":"Green building and wood"},{"id":"31686421","text":"Jason Dormon (born 2 May 1971) is a British bassist and venue owner. He is most noted for his work in Joeyfat and also for his running of the Tunbridge Wells Forum. Early life Dormon was born in Tunbridge Wells and educated at Bethany School. Music career In 1991, he formed the post-hardcore collective Joeyfat and spent the early 1990s releasing music with a number of independent record labels including Fierce Panda, as well as touring with the likes of Green Day, China Drum, Jawbox, and Scarfo. In 1996, Joeyfat broke up and Dormon went on to form Unhome, alongside Alex Tucker, who were a post-rock hardcore 5-piece. The band released one album, A Short History of Houses, and a split single with Papa M. Unhome split in late 1999 and at this point he formed the band Rebus who played for a few years before splitting. Around 2000 Jason got back together with Joeyfat to play a series of shows to promote The Unwilling Astronaut, a sixteen track collection of studio, live and session work spanning the years 1991 to 1996. They have since remained together, and have been playing gigs at a steady rate and releasing occasional tracks. Their debut thirteen-track album, You Can Change People's Lives With Your Mouth / The House of the Fat was released on CD, and limited edition vinyl, in 2003 on Unlabel. Also in July 2003, Joeyfat recorded a Peel Session for BBC Radio 1. This was followed by a 2CD collection of tracks from singles and compilations, Ye Bloody Flux in 2011, and a second studio album, the double vinyl Suit of Lights in 2013. Joeyfat recorded a session for Marc Riley on BBC Radio 6music in June 2017. The Forum Dormon's career in music promoting began on 17 May 1988 when, along with a group of friends (including Ian Carvell, Stephen Cookson, David Jarvis and Haydn Wood), they put on The Brilliant Corners at the Rumble Club in Grosvenor Park Rec hall in Tunbridge Wells. The Rumble Club, as a music venue went on to use various premises in the area, including The Watson Hall, Langton, The Hand & Sceptre in Southborough, and the lower floor of the former Winchester pub on Nevill Street, Tunbridge Wells (now the Thorins wine bar). Jason has said that he and his friends put on shows because they were fed up with the cost and travel of going to London to watch bands. In December 1992 Dormon and a group of friends opened Tunbridge Wells Forum as a new music venue in a building on Tunbridge Wells Common which was previously used as a public toilet and a brass rubbing centre. It has since hosted a number of acts who have gone on to achieve significant commercial success. In 2010, Dormon was featured in The Independent's \\"Happy List\\", profiling people who make Britain a better place to live.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_List In 2011, Jeremy Pritchard, bassist with the band Everything Everything, named Dormon as the person who has creatively influenced him the most. In 2012, The Forum was named as the NME Best Small Venue. The Music Venue Trust came into being in 2014 to protect and nurture small independent venues. Dormon was appointed a trustee.

In addition to the full marathon race (42.195 km, 26 miles 385 yards), there is also a half-marathon race and a race. Children run stages of between to in relays over the whole marathon course. The event was held for the first time on May 5, 2011, attracting more than 1,500 participants. In 2012, Gaza held the first international marathon welcoming runners from different parts of the world to run along around 2,000 runners from Gaza including participants with special needs, women and girls to raise funds for Palestine refugee children. In 2013 the marathon was scheduled for April 10, but was cancelled following \\"the decision by the authorities in Gaza not to allow women to participate\\". Course and conditions The course spans the entire Gaza Strip, from Beit Hanoun near the border with Israel in the northeast to Rafah, near the Egyptian border in the south. From Beit Hanoun the course runs west toward the Mediterranean coast, and then follows the coastal road southwest, parallel to the coast, before turning inland to Rafah. The route passes battered towns, refugee camps, the fishing harbor, the ruins of Yasser Arafat's former presidential compound, and the shells of other buildings hit in Israeli air strikes. The course is mostly flat but conditions in May tend to be very hot. There are no road closures, and in addition to potholes, runners have to negotiate traffic, including donkey carts and vans. The organizers work with the local security authorities, currently run by the Hamas government, to ensure the runners' safety and also have to consider local sensitivities regarding male and female athletes running side-by-side. Following the inaugural race in 2011, UNWRA spokesman Chris Gunness said, \\"The Israeli authorities have kept many things out of Gaza but we are trying to make sure that the one thing that can get through the blockade is fun. The marathon definitely achieved that not just for the competitors but for the thousands and thousands of onlookers who applauded every runner.\\"  2011 race  The race started at sunrise, 6 a.m. on May 5, when the temperature had already reached . About fifty runners started the course, with just nine runners completing the full distance. Of these, seven were Palestinian athletes training for the next year's Olympics. Six more ran the half marathon, and 150 runners from the Gaza Athletics Federation joined for the last stretch of . More than 1,000 schoolchildren took part in relays of between and , and a group of around 100 women participated in a walk. The winner, with a time of 2:42:47, was Nader al-Masri, who competed for Palestine at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the 5,000-meter race, and who was training for the 2012 Olympics in London. There were two international participants, both of them UNRWA employees running a marathon for the first time. One of them, Gemma Connell, was the only woman who ran the entire race. She finished with a time of 4 hours and forty-five minutes. UNRWA organized the event as a fund-raiser for its Summer Games for Gaza school children. The goal was to raise one million US dollars for the Summer Games; UNRWA said the goal was exceeded.

It did not have major competition success but some remain in use in 2017. Design and development It was built in 1961 as a completely new Standard Class glider. The name Eon 460, sometimes written as Eon Olympia 460, stands both for a series of gliders and for the prototypes of the series, all described by EoN as Type 10. Five slightly different model 460 prototypes were followed by 48 production model 463s. Two model 465s, with slimmer, slightly longer fuselages made possible by a semi-reclining pilot's position, were built for the 1965 World Gliding Championships. They were the last gliders designed and built by Elliotts of Newbury before their takeover by Slingsby Sailplanes in March 1966. All the 460 series have wooden structures and are largely plywood skinned. They have straight-tapered cantilever shoulder wings with 5¬∞ of dihedral and fabric covering over the plywood skin. The prototypes and production 463s have fabric-covered Frise type ailerons; the type 465 has sealed, pendulum-type ailerons. All have plywood DFS type airbrakes extending above and below the wings; standard class gliders do not carry flaps. The straight-tapered tail surfaces are fabric covered. The rudder runs to the keel via a cut-out in the horizontal trailing edge. The tailplane is a cantilever structure, mounted on top of the fuselage, folding upwards for transport and carrying conventional split elevators with a starboard trim tab on the prototypes and production 463s. The 465s have non- folding all-moving tailplanes with tabs on both trailing edges. The fuselage is a flat-sided Warren girder structure, plywood covered apart from the curved glass fibre rear decking. Wing attachment involves some aluminium fittings. The single seat cockpit is ahead of the wing leading edge under a single piece canopy. All 460 series aircraft use a fixed, unsprung monowheel main undercarriage. On the first four prototypes at least, this was mounted below the fuselage in a fairing which exposed only the edge of the wheel. On the 463s, the wheel is unfaired but assisted by an integral skid. The 465s have no skid and the wheel mounting is instead raised into the fuselage. All have a tail bumper with a \\"roller skate\\" tailwheel. The Eon 460 first flew on 26 April 1960 then went to RAE Bedford for testing and, whilst there, took part in the RAF and Interforces Competition held at RAF Odiham in July that year. This machine, registered as G-APWL and designated 460 Type A had a wing with aspect ratio 20 and an all-up weight of 600 lb (272 kg), well in excess of its design weight. It was followed by the Type B with aspect ratio of 18 and an all-up weight of 630 lb (286 kg), the values adopted for production machines. Both these aircraft had performances limited by turbulence generated behind the canopy and at the wing roots. They were followed by the Type C which was like the Type A but had a longer, lower hood and upper decking. The final prototype variant was the Type D, like the Type C but with modified outer wing sections. The less competitive production machines, produced from April 1963, were as the Type D but with wings of aspect ratio 18. despite opposition from the designer, Harry Midwood, and the chief test pilot, David Ince. Operational history Three EoN 460s, the first three prototypes with the Type A modified to Type C canopy style, competed without success in the 1961 National Championships, failing to finish in the top five places and outperformed by earlier EoN Olympia variants. Both the EoN 465s competed in the 1965 World Gliding Championships held in the UK at South Cerney but performed poorly, placed 9th and 41st out of a field of 45 in the Standard Class. A 463 also competed, finishing 40th. Most of the 460 series aircraft flew with clubs and private owners in the UK, including five used by Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association branches. Some are still flying, including BGA1296 (\\"BWE\\"), which was at the Vintage Glider Club rally held at Tibenham in August 2010.

After Loux attended Stratford High School and Texas A&M; University, the Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Loux with the sixth overall selection in the Major League Baseball (MLB) 2010 draft. Arizona opted not to sign Loux, due to injury concerns with the shoulder and elbow of his pitching arm. Due to his unique situation, MLB declared Loux a free agent, and he signed with the Texas Rangers. The Rangers later traded Loux to the Chicago Cubs, and he last pitched professionally in 2016, in an independent baseball league. Career=Amateur career Loux attended Stratford High School in Houston, Texas, where he played for the school's baseball team. While pitching for Stratford, Loux dealt with arm injuries. He discovered stretching exercises that increased his strength and flexibility. After his senior season at Stratford, he participated in a scouting combine and all-star games sponsored by the Houston Area Baseball Coaches Association. Out of high school, the Detroit Tigers selected Loux in the 24th round of the 2007 MLB draft. While the Tigers made Loux a strong offer, he did not sign, opting to play college baseball for the Texas A&M; Aggies baseball team in the Big 12 Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. In 2008, as a true freshman, Loux had an 8‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and led Texas A&M; in strikeouts with 81. Loux was named a Second Team NCAA Division I Freshman All-American starting pitcher. As a sophomore, Loux pitched to a 3‚Äì3 record with 62 strikeouts. He was named a Second Team Academic All-Big 12 pitcher. After the season, Loux had elbow surgery. In his junior season, Loux routinely started on Friday nights, traditionally the night when a team's ace pitcher appears. He pitched to an 11‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record with a 2.83 earned run average (ERA), while leading the Big 12 Conference with 136 strikeouts. He was named the Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Week for the weeks ending on March 8 and May 17. He was named a First Team NCAA Division I All-American by Baseball America, a Third Team All-American by the American Baseball Coaches Association, and a Big 12 Conference All-Star starting pitcher. He was also named a semifinalist for the Golden Spikes Award, given to the top amateur baseball player in the United States. Professional career ;Arizona Diamondbacks organization Heading into the 2010 MLB draft, Loux was seen as a potential late-first round pick. Surprising many, the Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Loux with the sixth overall selection, agreeing to a pre-draft deal with Loux with a $2 million signing bonus. However, Loux failed his physical with the Diamondbacks due to a torn labrum and elbow damage that doctors felt might require ligament replacement surgery in the future. As a result, the Diamondbacks did not offer Loux a contract, as the franchise chose to take advantage of compensation rules that instead would grant them the seventh overall pick in the 2011 MLB draft if they did not sign Loux. ;Texas Rangers organization Though unsigned draft picks typically cannot begin their professional careers until the next season, MLB declared Loux a free agent in an unprecedented move. After throwing for scouts, Loux signed a contract with the Texas Rangers, receiving a signing bonus of $312,000. In an attempt to prevent this situation from happening again, the new collective bargaining agreement negotiated that winter by MLB and the MLB Players Association added clauses that included mandatory physicals for all top 200 prospects prior to the draft, and a rule that makes all future draft picks who fail a physical and do not receive an offer of at least 40 percent of the assigned value for that pick are to become free agents, with the team facing a reduction in the amount of money they can spend on their draft picks. The Rangers assigned Loux to pitch for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League during the 2011 season. With the Pelicans, Loux had an 8‚Äì5 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.80 earned run average (ERA) in 21 games started. In 2012, with the Frisco RoughRiders of the Class AA Texas League, Loux began the season with a 9‚Äì0 record and 2.20 earned run average. After finishing the season with a 14‚Äì1 record, a 3.47 ERA and 100 strikeouts, Loux was named the Texas League Pitcher of the Year. ;Chicago Cubs organization At the 2012 trade deadline, the Rangers acquired Geovany Soto from the Chicago Cubs for Jake Brigham; however, the Cubs were concerned about Brigham's health and agreed to the trade on the condition that if Brigham was unable to play, the Cubs would send Brigham back to the Rangers and acquire Loux and a player to be named later in his place. After the 2012 season, with Brigham experiencing an elbow injury, Loux was traded to the Cubs. Loux pitched for the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in 2013. He suffered a shoulder injury and underwent Tommy John surgery, which forced him to miss the 2014 season. In 2015, Loux experienced an elbow injury after making three starts for Iowa, and was released on July 17. ;Independent baseball In 2016, Loux pitched in two independent baseball leagues. He pitched for the Laredo Lemurs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, and for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Loux has not pitched professionally since 2016. Scouting report Loux throws four pitches, of which he considers his fastball to be his best. It can reach . He also throws a curveball, a slider, and a changeup.

Biography He was born in Jena, the son of the Baltic- German historian Alexander Br√ºckner and Lucie Schiele. After an education at the Karlsruhe gymnasium, beginning in 1881 he studied meteorology and physics at the University of Dorpat, graduating in 1885. He joined the Deutsche Seewarte (German Hydrographic Office) in Hamburg, then, following studies at Dresden and Munich, he became a professor at the University of Bern in 1888. The same year he married Ernestine Steine. In 1899, he was rector at the university. He moved back to Germany in 1904, becoming a professor at the University of Halle. Two years later in 1906, he was a professor at the University of Vienna. He died in Vienna. Professor Br√ºckner was an expert on alpine glaciers and their effect upon the landscape. Between 1901‚Äì1909 he collaborated with German geographer and geologist Albrecht Penck to produce a three volume work titled Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter (The Alps in the Ice Age). This served as a standard reference on the ice ages for several decades thereafter. Br√ºckner was a proponent of the importance of climate change, including the effects on the economy and social structure of society. His research included studies of past climate changes and he proposed the 35-year- long Br√ºckner cycle of cold, damp weather alternating with warm, dry weather in northwest Europe. The GKSS Research Centre's Eduard Br√ºckner Prize, for outstanding achievement in interdisciplinary climate research, is named after him.

The Women's Division of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries paid the way of 46 top staff members to attend the event. Presbyterians sent 20 staff members, and officers in both denominations helped plan Re-Imagining. According to the invitational conference brochure mailed in November 1992, cost per person ranged from $100 for early registration to $150 for late registration. Several months afterward, conservative newsletters, Good News and The Presbyterian Layman, within the mainline United Methodist Church and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) denominations respectively, ran articles expressing outrage over what they called goddess worship and heresy at the conference. The controversy they stirred resulted in enough members dropping donations to cause a serious backlash. Mary Ann Lundy was fired seven months later. No United Methodists were fired at a national level.Gwen Veazey, \\"Women find new ways to talk of God,\\" Charlotte Observer [Charlotte, North Carolina], 12 January 2004, p. 11A  Concerns raised  * Goddess worship due in part to the \\"Bless Sophia\\" chant used throughout Re-Imagining.

One example: Dr. Delores Williams stating, \\"I don't think we need a theory of atonement (Atonement in Christianity),\\" and, \\"I don't think we need folks hanging on crosses, and blood dripping, and weird stuff.\\" These comments came during the question and answer session after her presentation.

I don't think we need folks hanging on crosses, and blood dripping, and weird stuff. We need the sustenance, the faith, the candles to light. Jesus' mandate is that we pass on tough love, love that's whipping the thieves out of the temple. I don't see that the cross does that. I think the cross ought to be interpreted for what it was, a symbol of evil, the murder of an innocent man and victim. When we confront the status quo as Jesus did, when we raise questions about the poor and empowering people who've never had power before, we're more than likely going to die for it.\\"  Program and Speakers  According to conference materials, organizers called their schedule a \\"Time Flow\\" and encouraged participants to express themselves via art materials at every table, dance movements, and Talking Circles.

She spoke of the way Jesus has historically been presented to American blacks: as one who condoned slavery, as a white, blue-eyed, serene middle class or better man looking up to heaven. \\"Black Americans have always had to re-image Jesus.\\" Deloris Williams, \\"Re- Imagining Jesus,\\" 1993 Re-Imagining Conference Audiotapes, Resource Express, Apple Valley, MN, Album One, Tape 3-1. Otherwise, his image would have borne \\"no agony, no Jew-ness, no poverty or struggle.\\" Williams' Womanist theological framework derives from the idea that the \\"Holy Spirit came through a woman's body . . . the Word was made flesh in a woman's body. This is how the Spirit came into the world . . .,\\" and \\"understanding God as male or female is limiting.\\" She advocated for understanding deity as Holy Spirit. She ended with a quotation from theologian Karl Barth which reminded her of her grandmother's faith: \\"The righteousness of God is higher than pain and deeper than joy. God is faithful. We're not, but God is faithful, and we've found Jesus to be.\\"Deloris Williams, \\"Re-Imagining Jesus,\\" 1993 Re-Imagining Conference Audiotapes, Resource Express, Apple Valley, MN, Album One, Tape 3-1B. Earlier in her remarks, Williams said it's problematic for black women to accept the substitution theory of atonement (that Jesus's purpose was to die on the cross for our sins,) because black women's experiences of \\"substituting\\" such as rearing white babies and being sexual partners for white men during slavery were in no way just or salvific. She advocated an emphasis on Jesus's life, his justice work, his healing, not his death. \\"Jesus conquered sin in the wilderness, in life.\\" Kwok Pui-lan (see Postcolonial feminism): \\"How many of you could imagine Jesus as something like me? . . . Asking me to speak? it is indeed iconoclastic. . . The colonizers need a white Jesus. We need to save ourselves from the white folks.\\" Kwok Pui-lan, \\"Re- Imagining Jesus\\", 1993 Re-Imagining Conference Audiotapes, Resource Express, Apple Valley, MN, Album One, Tape 3-1B. She encouraged listeners to \\"ask the questions we always wanted to ask,\\" and focused on differences in language, history, and imagery among cultures which have made accepting traditional Christianity difficult for the Chinese. \\"We want to be 100% Asians and 100% Christians.\\" She invoked three images: students massacred in Tiananmen Square, 400,000 prostitutes in Thailand, 60% of them HIV positive, and the \\"victory,\\" her way of seeing Jesus..\\"Kwok Pui-lan, \\"Re-Imagining Jesus\\", 1993 Re- Imagining Conference Audiotapes, Resource Express, Apple Valley, MN, Album One, Tape 3-2A. Lundblad invoked the pregnancy story of John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth, in Luke to illustrate an emphasis on birthing something new and different and asking listeners to trust the \\"stirring in your wombs.\\"Barbara Lundblad, \\"Re-Imagining Jesus,\\" 1993 Re-Imagining Conference Audiotapes, Resource Express, Apple Valley, MN, Album One, Tape 3-2B. In closing her remarks, said, \\"I do not need Jesus to be a woman. I need to believe that I am called to take the scroll of Isaiah in my hands and read the words with my name attached: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, anointing me to preach good news to the poor, release to the captive, recovery of sight to all those who refuse to see.' (Luke 4:18, author's paraphrase.).\\" She confessed that in her deepest moments of doubt, she cannot leave Jesus. She hears Him say to her, \\"Do not hold me in the old categories which no longer touch you . . . do not hold on to those telling you this is a story of death not life. Do not hang on to the right answers which came from somebody else because you fear they will say you are blaspheming and you are a heretic. No, say instead, you are pregnant.\\" = Re-imagining Creation = * Anne Primavesi, Ph.D, member of Associate Faculty at Schumacher College * Sister Jose Hobday, O.S.F., Holy Names College, Oakland, CA * Elizabeth Bettenhausen, Ph.D., Women's Theological Center, Boston and the Divinity School at Harvard University Bettenhausen (excerpt) \\"We need to re-imagine the doctrine of creation because, if you create out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo,) the something is always a problem.

By God's grace we recognize that the word of judgment has come especially to patriarchal hierarchies that possess the temple. We know that the axe has been laid to the root of that tree.

The continuation was on a much smaller scale supported by memberships and individuals, with less than 300 registered for the last meeting in 2003.

In 1932, a third wing, designed by Waldemar Schmidt, was built along Vestergade. The Hotel Bristol closed in 1917 after a bankruptcy caused by a fire.

After serving on merchant ships for the East India Company from a young age, he entered the Royal Navy in 1774. Wood served in the navy for almost his whole life, and took part in several of the wars fought by Kingdom of Great Britain throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century. During his career he was involved in several personal conflicts and feuds, which resulted in him being the subject of two courts-martial. Biography=Early life and the American Revolutionary War Born in 1756, James Athol Wood was the third son of Alexander Wood (died 1778) of Burncroft, Perthshire. He was younger brother of Sir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet, and of Major-General Sir George Wood. First going to sea, for the East India Company, in 1772, he entered the navy in September 1774, as able seaman on board the sloop Hunter on the coast of Ireland and afterwards on the North America station. In July 1776, as master's mate, he joined HMS Barfleur, flagship of Sir James Douglas at Portsmouth. In April 1777 he was moved into , the flagship of Sir Thomas Pye, and from her was lent to , as acting lieutenant, during the spring of 1778. He rejoined his ship in time to go out with Vice-Admiral John Byron to North America, where, on 18 October 1778, he was promoted to be lieutenant of the 50-gun ship , with Captain George Dawson. After taking part in the Siege of Charleston in April 1780, Renown returned to England; for some months Wood was employed in small vessels attached to the Channel Fleet, but in November 1781 he was appointed to the 64-gun ship with Captain William Blair, in which he was in the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, and continued till the peace. The next two or three years he passed in France, and then, accepted employment in merchant ships trading to the East Indies, and later on to the West Indies. The West Indies and shipwreck off Madagascar When the fleet under Sir John Jervis (afterwards Earl of St. Vincent) arrived at Barbados in January 1794, Wood happened to be there, and, offering his services to Jervis, was appointed to the flagship, . After the reduction of Martinique he was sent to France with the cartels in charge of the French prisoners; but on their arrival at Saint- Malo in the end of May the ships were seized and Wood was thrown into prison. The order to send him to Paris, signed by Robespierre and other members of the committee of public safety, was dated 13 Prairial (1 June), the very day of Lord Howe's victory. In Paris he was kept in close confinement till April 1795, when he was released on parole and returned to England. He was shortly afterwards exchanged, was promoted (7 July 1795), and was appointed to command the sloop , which he took out to the West Indies. There he was sent under (Sir) Robert Waller Otway to blockade St. Vincent and Grenada. While engaged on this service he had opportunities of learning that Trinidad was very insufficiently garrisoned; and after the reduction of the revolted islands he suggested to the commander-in-chief, Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, the possibility of capturing it by an unexpected attack. Christian was on the point of going home and would not commit his successor (Sir) Henry Harvey, to whom, on his arrival, Wood repeated his suggestion. Harvey sent him to make a more exact examination of the state of the island, and, acting on his report, took possession of it without loss. Of four ships of the line which were there, only half manned and incapable of defence, the Spaniards burnt three; Wood was appointed, by acting order, to command the fourth, and sent home with convoy. His captain's commission was confirmed, to date 27 March 1797. Early in 1798 he was appointed to the frigate HMS Garland, which had been sent to the Cape of Good Hope in February. He received information that a large French ship was sighted close in shore at Port Daupine, Madagascar. Wood sailed there, but when still a mile offshore Garland struck heavily on a sunken reef, and was irretrievably lost, 26 July. The French ship proved to be a merchantman, which Wood took possession of and utilised, together with a small vessel which he built of the timber of the wreck, to carry his men and stores to the Cape. Wood returned to England, where on 15 December 1798 he and his officers were acquitted at the court-martial for the loss of their ship. Feud with Duckworth and court-martial Sir John Thomas Duckworth In April 1802 he was appointed to the 40-gun , which, on the renewal of the war in 1803, was attached to the fleet off Brest and in the Bay of Biscay under Admiral (Sir) William Cornwallis. In November 1804 the Acasta was sent out to the West Indies in charge of convoy, and there Sir John Thomas Duckworth, wishing to return to England in her, superseded Wood and appointed his own captain. As no other ship was available for Wood, he went home as a passenger in Acasta, and immediately on arriving in England applied for a court-martial on Duckworth, charging him with tyranny and oppression and also with carrying home merchandise. The court-martial, however, decided that, in superseding Wood, Duckworth was acting within his rights, and, as Duckworth denied that the goods brought home were merchandise, the charge was pronounced \\"scandalous and malicious.\\" When Wood's brother Mark moved in the House of Commons that the minutes of the court-martial should be laid on the table, the motion was negatived without a division. Later years Public opinion, however, ran strongly in favour of Wood, and he was at once appointed to , from which, a few months later, he was moved into , again attached to the fleet off Brest, and again sent with convoy to the West Indies, where in January 1807 he was second in command under (Sir) Charles Brisbane at the reduction of Cura√ßao ‚Äî a service for which a gold medal was awarded to the several captains engaged. In December 1808 Wood was moved into the 74-gun ship , in which he took part in the Invasion of Martinique in February 1809. In July he was transferred to , and sailed for England with a large convoy. On his arrival he was knighted, 1 November 1809, and in the following March he was appointed to , one of the Channel fleet, off Brest and in the Bay of Biscay. On 10 March 1812 broad off Ushant he sighted a French squadron some distant. Of their nationality and force he was told by the frigate which had been watching them. It was then late in the afternoon, and when, about six o'clock, two other ships were sighted apparently trying to join the enemy's squadron, and that squadron wore towards him as though hoping to cut him off, Wood judged it prudent to tack and stand from them during the night. The night was extremely dark, and in the morning the French squadron was no longer to be seen; but the other two ships, still in sight, were recognised as English ships of the line. The affair gave rise to much talk; Lord Keith was directed to inquire into it, and as his report was indecisive, the question was referred to a court-martial, which, after hearing much technical evidence‚Äîas to bearings, distances, and times‚Äîpronounced that Wood had been too hasty in tacking from the enemy, and that he ought to have taken steps at once to ascertain what the two strange ships were; but also, that his fault was due to \\"erroneous impressions at the time, and not from any want of zeal for the good of his majesty's service.\\" That the sentence was merely an admonition which left no slur on Wood's character is evident from the fact that he remained in command of Pomp√©e ‚Äî sent to join Lord Exmouth's flag in the Mediterranean ‚Äî till November 1815. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a C.B.; on 19 July 1821 he was promoted to rear- admiral. He died at Hampstead, apparently unmarried, in July 1829. ReferencesFurther reading *R. G.

Lochner published by the People's Freedom Union, circa December 1919. The People's Freedom Union was a left wing American political group which existed from 1919 to 1920. Established as a federation of liberal and radical organizations in New York City, the People's Freedom Union conducted marches in support of political prisoners detained under the Espionage Act during World War I, campaigned for a restoration of American civil rights suspended under the war, and agitated against American intervention in Mexico and Soviet Russia. Organizational History=Establishment The People's Freedom Union was the organizational successor of the People's Council of America, an anti-war organization established in New York City by pacifist and socialist political activists in an effort to end American participation in the European war.Archibald E. Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism: Its History, Purpose and Tactics with an Exposition and Discussion of the Steps Being Taken and Required to Curb It: Being the Report of the Joint Legislative Committee Investigating Seditious Activities, Filed April 24, 1920, in the Senate of the State of New York: Part 1: Revolutionary and Subversive Movements Abroad and at Home, Volume 1. Albany, NY: J.B. Lyon Co., 1920; pg. 1105. The group was headquartered at 138 West 13th Street, premises it shared with the American Civil Liberties Union. The organization declared itself a federation of \\"several New York groups\\" which intended to practice \\"the One Big Union idea applied to the peace-and-freedom movement.\\"The People's Freedom Union: What It Is and Why It Is. New York: People's Freedom Union, 1919. Reprinted in Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism, part 1, vol. 1, pp. 1105-1110. The People's Freedom Union was organized in opposition to the expansion of militarism and imperialism in the post-war world. It declared in its literature that \\"imperialism is not dead, even though the kaiser and the other emperors have gone\\" and postulated that the empire-building foreign policy of Great Britain, France, Japan, the United States, and other nations was setting the table for a new round of war. The group therefore sought to organize \\"liberal and radical forces of the world\\" in advance of the next conflagration, to \\"get ready now before the passions of war again sweep them aside.\\" The group also sought the reestablishment of American civil liberties suspended during the World War I under the Espionage Act, declaring that \\"democracy without the unrestricted right to discuss public policies is the shabbiest of pretenses.\\" It cited the recent banning and dispersal of public meetings, suppression of dissident newspapers, and the deportation and imprisonment of critical public speakers as examples of the abusive state of then-current law. The People's Freedom Union declared its intent to take on \\"concrete tasks not already covered\\" by other groups participating in the federation, with a design to \\"gradually absorb other groups.\\" The group was governed by an Executive Committee, with permanent officers and committees organized around specific projects handling day-to-day affairs. The People's Freedom Union maintained a publication department under the imprint of \\"The People's Print,\\" which issued weekly leaflets on pertinent topics in the news and was responsible for the issuance and sale of occasional pamphlets. The group also established a speaker's bureau which coordinated speaking tours of \\"men and women of national and international note who have a message bearing upon the objects for which the organization stands.\\" Activities The People's Freedom Union organized a march up Fifth Avenue in New York on Christmas morning, 1919, in support of political prisoners.\\"March in Manacles, Plan of Radicals,\\" New York Times, December 16, 1919. The march was to be followed by a dispersal in groups of 10 to picket on behalf of prisoners outside churches throughout New York City in hopes of stirring attendees in support of the cause of freeing prisoners of conscience jailed under the Espionage Act during the war.

Levis (born 1937) is a Greek psychiatrist and author of the Formal Theory of Behavior. He is also the founder and director of the Museum of the Creative Process in Manchester, Vermont. He along with his late wife, Georgette Wasserstein Levis, is the innkeeper of the Wilburton Inn, also in Manchester.  Biography  Albert Levis was born in 1937 in Athens, Greece. to a Romaniote Jewish family with deep roots in the Greek history and culture. After surviving the Holocaust in hiding, Levis continued his studies at Athens College where he graduated in 1957 and was awarded the Capps prize for an essay on the history of the Jewish diaspora as cycles of emancipation and justification for persecutions. He studied medicine in Switzerland at the Universities of Geneva and Zurich, 1958-1963, immigrated to the United States in 1964, married Georgette Wasserstein (sister of Bruce Wasserstein) in 1966 and completed his psychiatric residence at Yale University in 1968. He settled with his family in Hamden, Connecticut, where in 1970 he founded a clinical research and training practice, the Center for the Study of Normative Behavior. There he conducted his research work and writing of books. He retired in 2002 to dedicate his attention to the Wilburton Inn, and incorporated the Art to Science project with the vision to develop a forum for his theoretical position. Levis also holds a wide collection of international and modern art, pieces that are now installed in the permanent exhibits at the Museum of the Creative Process. Additionally, the Museum features the Henry Gorski retrospective, a collection of the lifetime work of Gorski, as well as the Sanctuary of Wisdom, Levis's Holocaust memorial. Many items from the museum's collections have been featured in museums and gallery exhibits around the New England region.  Career  Levis is best known for his Formal Theory, an integrative approach to behavioral analysis and personality assessment. The Formal Theory of Behavior seeks to qualify the physical properties of behavior through applying principles of Physics to the study of emotional energetic transformation. Levis has published several volumes on this research, including Conflict Analysis: The Formal Theory of Behavior and Conflict Analysis Training. Levis' Conflict Analysis Training includes among other tests the Animal Metaphor Test, an integrative projective assessment. His study of the creative process introduced the cross-disciplinary integration of psychology, religion, art and science, revamping psychology‚Äôs epistemology, diagnostic categories, modes of assessment, features of morality as a science, and therapy as a concise program of emotional education. The Moral Science spiritualizes psychology, demystifies religions and reconciles them, while it popularizes psychotherapy as a mandatory education for the general public. Levis, born to a Jewish family, was inspired to the discovery of the creative process working through his childhood experiences of WWII, the Holocaust and the Communist Civil War in the light of the wisdom of the Greek culture. He spent his career pondering on behavior and religions seeking to heal the person and the world. He departed observing a phenomenon repeated five times in the Greek Cosmogony. He proceeded to unite conceptually behavior and morality with science and validated this theory demonstrating the scientific and moral nature of the creative process. He used art exhibits, and devised two technologies demonstrating the creative process as a scientific phenomenon: A self-assessment available online and a card game called Moral Monopoly. His work was articulated in seven self-published volumes. They departed from a dramatic play, The Argives, continued with an overview of the Contributions of the Formal Theory, then a thorough presentation of the concepts in a textbook, simultaneously with a workbook that introduced the self-assessment; he continued with three volumes of evidence validating the theory. One book was on the museum exhibits, and two volumes on case studies. His research work is summed up with the Moral Monopoly, an educational card- game, applying the formal analysis to eight cultural stories integrating the religions of the world as a progression of scientific discoveries of the relational modalities improving the family institution and the abstraction on the nature of the divine. The game clarifies the six role structure of stories, their leading to alternative relational modalities, and points out the progression to improving resolutions promoting mutual respect as the key to the Moral Science. The game promotes the scientific analysis of the creative process as transformative.  Publications  * Conflict Analysis: the Formal Theory of Behavior, outlines the principles of the Formal Theory, and develops a scientific method for understanding behavior. The textbook formulates a method of studying emotional energetic transformations with the guidance of physics, studying the dialectics of unconscious dynamics as a scientific phenomenon. * Conflict Analysis Training is a workbook of exercises and assessments that lead towards greater self awareness and understanding. The book guides its readers to an understanding of their relational modality, how they deal with conflict, and how they can best improve. * Science Stealing the Fire of the Gods and Healing the Worlds, published Summer 2011, explores in detail the Museum‚Äôs exhibits, investigating the emotional discovery present in the Gorski Retrospective, and retracing the evolution of abstraction in religious paradigms. Based upon the myth of Prometheus stealing the fire of Olympus, the book presents science as now demystifying religion and offering humanity the tools of moral life. * Creativity & Power Management, A Concise Program of Emotional Education I: The Clinical Delivery of the Conflict Analysis Battery: A Didactic, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Self-Assessment, published in Spring 2016, is book of clinical case studies, illustrates a new theory, the Formal Theory, and a new therapy, Creativity and Power Management, as a concise program of emotional education utilizing the Conflict Analysis Battery and the simple scientific principles of the Formal Theory . * Creativity and Power Management, A Concise Program of Emotional Education II: The Psychoeducational Delivery of the Conflict Analysis Battery, published Fall 2016, is a book of case studies from clients that have completed the online emotional education program as well as cases from students and other- non clinical clients.

Before the Event  The Tolowa Tribe, or the Taa-laa-wa Dee-ni' is a Native American tribe from northwestern California and southern Oregon. In the Spring of 1853, a group of prospectors headed by a man by the name of \\"California Jack\\" started from Crescent City on a prospecting journey. They planned to go to a place near the Smith River. Not long after, a Native American was spotted in town carrying a pistol with the name \\"California Jack\\" engraved on it. Believing that the prospectors had been killed by the Native Americans, a group of townspeople attacked the Native Americans at Battery Point. They killed the Native American who had the pistol and several others in the area. They immediately began to assemble a search party to look for the men's camp and bodies. When they found them, they became increasingly more angry. After the killing of the Native Americans at Battery Point, a large number of the Tolowa survivors fled to a rancheria (a small Native American settlement) close to the mouth of Smith's River. The rancheria was known as Yontocket Ranch. A group was formed who were ready to fight. The manner of the attack displayed that someone in the group had knowledge of the country near the ranch. Yontocket was the location of the tribes arrival on the coast and it was a village on the south side of the Smith River. The Needash is the Tolowa's feather dance that occurs twice a year. This Needash was after fall harvest. Native Americans gathered from the surrounding areas to celebrate their religion. It was common for the tribes in the area (Chetko, Pistol River, Tolowa, Tututni, and some Rogue River tribes) to meet at the Center of the Tolowa World, Yontocket, at both the Summer and the Winter solstices. On the third night of the ten night gatherings, the town mob invaded the village and the massacre began.3 One Tolowa man said that more than 450 people were killed in the attack. The massacre was conducted by a \\"company\\", a militia organized by American citizens of Crescent City. At the time of the attack, the Tolowa had been engaged in a prayer ceremony. After the initial massacre, a Tolowa man reported that those responsible for the attack started a bonfire, in which they burned sacred ceremonial clothing and feathers, as well as babies, some of them still living.  The Massacre  When Peter H. Burnett found out where the survivors of the Battery Point Massacre were located, they formed a thirty-three man company. California Jack and his men said that they were \\"well armed and resolved upon the extermination of all Indians\\". The men trapped the Indians by encircling around the Indians. Just when the sun came of on the Eastern horizon, they opened fire at Yontocket. The Indians immediately came running out of their huts, armed with their bow and arrows, fighting for their lives. Their primitive weapons were no match for the modern weapons of the white men. All around the white men, the Indians attempted to escape, but there was no chance of surviving. The Indian men's scream was intermingled with the screams of the women and children, which caused even more confusion to the Indians. Hundreds of people were killed in the attack, but the white men were not done yet. An eyewitness said \\"The white people got all around them‚Ä¶ Every time someone go out, never come back in‚Ä¶ they set fire to the house, the Indians' house. You could see them just cutting heads off. They stick them things into them; pretty soon they pick them up and throw them right into the fire. Some of 'em tried to get away, run down the slough. Soon as they get down there, if they don't get 'em right away, they get 'em from the other side when they come up. Shoot 'em right there, waiting for them.\\" After the attack, the white men built a huge fire and threw almost everything the Indians had into it. They threw in the Indian's sacred ceremonial dresses into it and they even threw babies, some of which were still alive, in the fire too. Finally, Burnett's men burned Yontocket to the ground and only a few Indians were scarcely left alive. The men reported no intentional kills of women and children. So many victims were incinerated, submerged, or have floated away that the attackers could not obtain a complete body count. White sources estimated to only 150 lives lost that morning. This may have been an understatement and Tolowa sources insist that 600 people were massacred at Yontocket. Even if the white sources were right, this is still ranked as one of the most lethal massacres in U.S. history.  After the Massacre  After the event, as many as 450 to 500 Tolowa people were recorded dead. Because their homes had burned down, the place received the name \\"Burnt Ranch.\\" The Yontocket Massacre decimated the cultural center of the Tolowa peoples. The Natives from the surrounding areas would gather there for their celebrations and discussions. The survivors of the massacre were forced to moved to the village north of Smith's River called Howonquet. The slaughtering of the Tolowa people continued for some years. They were seemingly always caught at their Needash celebrations. These massacres caused some unrest which led in part to the Rogue River Indian war. Many Tolowa people were incarcerated at Battery Point in 1855 to withhold them from joining an uprising led by their chief. Adding to the number of dead from the Yontocket Massacre and the Battery Point Attack are many more in the following years. They are the Chetko Massacre with 24 dead, the Smith creek massacre with 7 dead, the Howonquet Massacre with 70 dead, and the Stundossun Massacre with 300 dead. In total, 902 Tolowa Native Americans were killed in 7 years. There are no records that any of the perpetrators were ever held accountable. Little or no loss of life was reported on the American side.

The mid-wing taildragger aircraft featured short-legged retractable landing gear. The engine was prepared to turn clockwise (as normal for some British inlines of the era) in anticipation of mounting a custom French propeller, but the propeller was also customized for American engines, and the engine needed to be modified again to rotate normally. During the 1956 rebuild, a 190 hp Lycoming O-435-1 engine was installed in place of the Menasco, including a cut down Beech-Roby propeller and wheel brakes.

Pedigree Sainfoin was sired by Springfield out of the mare Sanda and was foaled at Hampton Court Stud, owned by Queen Victoria, in 1887. Most of the yearlings produced by Hampton Court Stud were underfed and skinny, which resulted in little interest in Sainfoin as a racing prospect. He was sold as a yearling for 500 guineas to horse trainer John Porter and Sir Robert Jardine. Racing career Sainfoin's only start and win as a two-year-old was in the ¬£928 Astley Stakes at Lewes Racecourse. He carried 120 pounds and won easily by one and a half lengths from Garter, from whom he was receiving eight pounds. In 1890, he made his first appearance in the Esher Stakes, a handicap race at Sandown. After the race, Porter felt that the colt would have little chance in the Derby, and accepted an offer of ¬£6,000 for the colt from Sir James Miller, an officer in the 14th King's Hussars. The sale contract however, contained a clause which stated that if Sainfoin won the Derby, his previous owners would receive half the prize money. On 8 May, Sainfoin won a two runner race for the Dee Stakes at Chester. On 4 June he started at odds of 100/15 (approximately 6.7-1) in The Derby for which Surefoot was favourite. Surefoot was always expected to be favourite, especially after he had won the 2000 Guineas and on the day of the race he was the subject of very heavy betting, so that he started at odds of 40/95. There was an unusually small field of eight runners and the race took place on heavy ground in driving rain. Sainfoin, ridden by John Watts, was prominent from the start and disputed the lead with his stable-companion Orwell after a mile. In the straight it became apparent that Surefoot was beaten and Sainfoin gained the advantage over Orwell and then held off the late challenge of Le Nord to win by three quarters of a length. The winning time was an unusually slow 2:49.8. He did not win any races after the Derby at age four, securing a third place in the Imperial Plate and an unplaced finish at the 1891 City and Suburban Handicap. He was retired to stud in 1892. Stud career After Miller's death in 1906, Sainfoin was sold to Lord Carnarvon for 700 guineas and stood as stud at the Cloghran Stud in Dublin. Sainfoin's most notable son was Rock Sand, winner of the Triple Crown in 1903, but he was also the damsire (through Tout Suite) of 1926 leading sire and St. Leger winner Hurry On. His name appears in the pedigrees of most top class modern thoroughbreds owing to his daughter, Bromus, who produced the influential stallion Phalaris. Sainfoin died in Carlow, Ireland in October 1911. His death was not reported to the press for more than a year after he died. was named after Sainfoin in 1943.

Early life He was born in Rossville, Georgia, United States, to Robert L. Coffey, a brick manufacturer and Curie Ethel Brindley, a milliner. He is the 2nd of three sons, between Robert L. Coffey, Jr. born 1921, and William B. Coffey born 1923. Both his brothers became pilots in the USAAF, and both died in plane crashes. After the failure of his business during the Great Depression, Robert Coffey, Sr. moved the family first to Philadelphia and finally to Johnstown, Pennsylvania where he found work as supervisor in a coal mine. John Coffey followed his father into the mine and became a member of the UMWA.  Military career  He joined the USAAF in 1939, in Santa Ana,California, training as a glider pilot in Pittsburg, Kansas. In 1943 the glider pilot program was winding down; he became a cadet/navigator and received training in Albuquerque, Santa Ana, and Sacramento before shipping out. Stationed in Molesworth, England, one of the first Eighth Air Force stations attached to the USAAF, he was assigned to the 303d Bombardment Group, 427th Bombardment Squadron. In two B-17 Flying Fortress tours, he was credited with 35 bombing missions over Nazi Germany. Midway through the missions, after developing and conducting a navigational training curriculum for pilots, he was promoted to lead navigator. In 1948 he left active service, and returned to the United States, and while still in the Military Reserves, enrolled in the University of Miami on the GI Bill. There he met Valerie Kendall, and they were married in 1949. They honeymooned in Havana, Cuba, and had three sons: Christopher, Kendall, and Kevin.  Cold War  In 1950 at the beginning of the Korean War, he was recalled to active duty and began training in the new technologies that the Strategic Air Command in the early years of the Cold War was developing under the leadership of then- Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay. The stated mission was being able to strike anywhere in the world. To do so demanded development and integration in the areas of jet engines, in-air refueling, ballistic missiles, and ultimately nuclear missiles. Lt. Col. Coffey became part of War Planning Operations and was stationed variously at Loring Air Force Base, Robins Air Force Base, and Westover Air Force Base, headquarters of the Eighth Air Force, where he was on the IG team inspecting Strategic Air Command facilities for standards. In 1966 he was redeployed overseas and assigned to Lindsey Air Station in Wiesbaden, Germany, headquarters for United States Air Forces in Europe ‚Äì Air Forces Africa (USAFE), while the family found housing at Finthen Army Airfield in Mainz. While in Mainz his skills as a community liaison prompted an invitation for him to join the Reitercorps of the Mainzer Ranzengarde, a local equestrian club, an honor normally reserved for Germans. As Deputy of Operations, headquarters, USAFE, he served as Chief of the Special Plans Branch where he was responsible for HQ USAFE \\"planning for all aspects of unconventional warfare in the European theater, supervision and coordination of all Berlin contingency planning, involving frequent and very sensitive high-level coordination and conferences with military and civilian planners of four nations.\\" He created an operational planning concept covering all aspects of conventional warfare that became a basic reference for the work of the USAFE Force Employment Panel on which Lt. Col. Coffey was assistant chairman and coordinator. The panel's determinations largely affected strategy and tactics for U.S. and Nato war planning in Europe. In 1969 he officially retired and was transferred back to Homestead Air Force Base and then into civilian life. Among the decorations Lt. Col. Coffey received were the Air Force Commendation Medal, the First Oak Leaf Cluster to the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal. Private life In 1977 the Coffeys moved to Moore Haven, Florida, where they bought a ranch and raised cattle. In 1980 he entered the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate but did not qualify for the runoff which went to Bill Gunter. Gunter ultimately lost to Republican Paula Hawkins, the only woman elected to the US Senate from Florida. He became active in local politics and served as a Glades County Commissioner from 1982‚Äì1990, and as Commissioner Chairman for two years. He also played a prominent role in the movement to preserve public access for Fisheating Creek when private interests threatened to abolish it. Valerie Coffey died in 2005, and Lt. Col. Coffey died on Nov. 26, 2013 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

In 1979, Paoletta ran unsuccessfully for mayor against Democratic incumbent John C. Mandanici, although Paoletta held Mandanici to his smallest margin of victory in his three elections. In 1981, Paoletta (then age 48) again challenged Mandanici and was successful, narrowly edging out the incumbent by just 64 votes (17,950 to 17,886 votes, following a recount).Richard L.

It is the administrative and executive body of the Spanish Armed Forces. According to the Constitution of 1978, the Monarch is the Commander in Chief of the Spanish military. He can declare war or conclude peace with authorization of the Cortes Generales, provided this act is countersigned by the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Defense is headed by the Minister of Defence, a Cabinet member who depends directly from the Prime Minister. Beneath the Ministry of Defense are five subordinate principal departments: the Armed Forces headed by the Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD) which is divided in three military branches led by the Chief of Staff of the Army (JEME), the Chief of Staff of the Navy (AJEMA) and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (JEMA); the Secretariat of State for Defence (headed by the Secretary of State, SEDEF); the Undersecretariat of Defence headed by the Ministry's Under-Secretary (SUBDEF) and the General Secretariat for Defence Policy head by the Secretary-General (SEGENPOL). In addition, the National Intelligence Center (CNI) is subordinated to the Ministry of Defence. The current holder of the Ministry is Margarita Robles. History= Primitive military administration  Since the first origins of Spain, the monarchy has been the main form of government. That is the main reason why the first government departments appeared in the 18th century because for centuries, the monarch controlled all the power. At the beginning, the King controlled the military through its Council of State which was divided in different sections dedicated to advise the King in the different areas of government.  Single and double secretariat  On July 11, 1705, King Philip V created a Secretariat for war and treasury matters, called Secretariat of the Dispatch of War and Treasury mainly because of the War of Succession. Once the war was over, in 1714 the Administration was reformed and two secretariats appeared: one dedicated to the Army called Secretariat of the Dispatch of War and another to the Navy called the Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Navy and Indies. The Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Navy and Indies was suppressed in 1715 and the competences over the Navy were transferred to the Secretariat of War. In 1721 the Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Navy was re-created assuming the competences on the naval forces but on 30 January 1776, the Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Indies was recovered assuming the control of the overseas's naval forces. Since then, the Secretariat of the Navy had competences only on the naval forces of the Peninsular Spain, the Canaries and the Balearics because the Secretariat of the Dispatch of the Indies assumed the responsibilities on the naval forces in the rest of the Empire. It wasn't until 1790 that this Secretariat also assumed the competences on the Overseas Navy when the Indies Secretariat was suppressed. The same did the Secretariat of War with the competencies on the land forces in the Indies.  Ministries  This organization was maintained through decades and at the beginning of the 19th century, the terms Secretariat and Ministry were used as synonymous, until 1851 when the Ministry of War and Ministry of the Navy were officially renamed. Since the Constitution of 1812, which creates the Secretary of State and of the Dispatch of the Overseas Government, until the creation of the Ministry of Overseas in 1863, there were constant hesitations in the allocation of powers over those domains and which advisory body to go in case of doubt in the resolution of the issues. In 1836 it is the Ministry of the Navy who assumes these functions; A few years later, they move to the Ministry of the Interior. In 1851 an Overseas Council and an Overseas Directorate were created under the Office of the Prime Minister. Manuel Guti√©rrez Mellado, first Defence Minister of the democratic period. The hesitations continue regarding the advisory body (the Overseas Council alternates with the Royal Council and the Advisory Board) the vacillations also occur in terms of the dependence of the Directorate that passes to the Ministry of State in 1854, it is added to the Development in 1856, to return to State a few months later and depends on the Ministry of War from 1858 until the creation of the Overseas Ministry by Royal Decree of 20 May 1863. It subsists until the loss of those imperial provinces and is definitively suppressed by Royal Decree of 15 April 1899.  First attempt and final unification  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Air Force started to make its firsts steps and at the very start they were just the air branch of the Army and later it was also created a Naval Air Force subordinated to the Navy. During the Civil War, the armed forces split into two sides: the republican and the nationalist. In the republican side, there were two main ministries: the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy and Aire Force; in the national side, there were only one unified ministry, the Ministry of National Defence that had all the competences over the three branches. After the Civil War, the francoist regime divided again the former Ministry of National Defence intro three ministries: Ministry of the Army, Ministry of the Navy and the new Ministry of the Air Force (created in 1939). This three military departments disappeared in 1977 when they merged into the current Ministry of Defence. This new Ministry of Defence established its headquarters in a building belonged to the Ministry of Culture and the three headquarters of the military ministries were destined to hold the main headquearters of each military branch. The position of Under Secretary of Defence was created in 1977. The new military organization was established in 1984 with the JEMAD as the Chief Operative of the Armed Forces and the Prime Minister (through the Defence Minister) as de facto leader of the Armed Forces. The Monarch remained as the symbolic commander-in-chief and the position of Secretary of State for Defence was created too. In 2020, the National Intelligence Center returned to the department's structure with Paz Esteban L√≥pez as its first female director.  Structure  Margarita Robles, current Minister of DefenceThe Department is organized as follows: * The Armed Forces. ** The Chief of the Defence Staff. ** The Chief of Staff of the Army. ** The Chief of Staff of the Navy. ** The Chief of Staff of the Air Force. * The Secretariat of State for Defence. ** The Directorate-General for Armament and Materiel. ** The Directorate-General for Economic Affairs. ** The Directorate-General for Infraestructure. **The Center of Systems and Technologies of the Information and Communications. * The Undersecretariat of Defence. ** The Technical General Secretariat. ** The Directorate-General for Personnel. ** The Directorate-General for Military Recruitment and Teaching. **The Deputy Directorate-General for the Internal Regime. **The Deputy Directorate-General for Economic and Payroll Services. **The Legal Department of the Defence. **The Office of the Comptroller General of the Defence. **The Inspectorate-General for Defence Health. ** The Military Prison of Alcal√° de Henares. * The General Secretariat for Defence Policy. ** The Directorate- General for Defence Policy. **The Division for Security and Defense Studies and Coordination. * The Directorate for Institutional Communication of Defense.

Chain of Command Philip VI is the current Captain General of the Armed Forces. The Chain of Command of the military is regulated in the National Defence Organic Act of 2005. Like the Constitution, the law recognizes the Monarch as the supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The Government is the body in charge of establishing the defense policy as well as control of the military administration. The Prime Minister is the civilian authority in command of the Armed Forces. The Minister of Defence, under the authority of the Prime Minister, control the Armed Forces and establish the military policy. The Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD) is the fourth military authority, in charge over the operative command of the Armed Forces. After the Chief of the Defence Staff are the Chief of Staff of the different branches. The Parliament is the responsible for authorising the signing of military treaties, approving the defence laws and military budgets and authorize the Sovereign to declare war and to make peace. In particular, the Congress is responsible for authorising the use of the Armed Forces abroad in missions that are not of national interest, if they are of national interest, the Government can use them without authorization but communicating it to the Congress. # The King. # The Prime Minister. # The Minister of Defence. # The Chief of the Defence Staff. # The Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Navy and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. # Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy and the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

It was discovered on 28 December 2005 by Robert S. McMillan at Steward Observatory, Kitt Peak. On 8 November 2011 it passed 0.85 lunar distances (324,900 kilometers; 201,900 miles) from Earth.  8 November 2011 flyby  Trajectory of asteroid compared with the orbits of Earth and the Moon on 8‚Äì9 November 2011. Apparent trajectory on 8‚Äì9 November 2011. In February 2010, was rated 1 on the Torino Scale for a potential pass near Earth on 10 November 2103, that posed no unusual level of danger. On 19 April 2010, radar ranging by the Arecibo radio telescope reduced uncertainties about the orbit by 50%. This improvement eliminated any possibility of an impact with Earth within the next 100 years. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 22 April 2010 and as such it now has a rating of 0 on the Torino Scale. It is now known that on 10 November 2103 will be roughly 2 AU from Earth. On 8 November 2011 at 23:28 UT the asteroid passed from Earth. On 9 November 2011 at 07:13 UT the asteroid passed from the Moon. During the close approach the asteroid reached about apparent magnitude 11, and would have been visible to experienced observers using high-end binoculars with an objective lens of 80 mm if it were not for bright moonlight preventing a true dark sky. Since the gibbous moon did interfere with the viewing, observers trying to visually locate the asteroid required a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches (15 centimeters) or larger. The next few times a known asteroid this large will come this close to Earth will be in 2028 when passes 0.65 LD from Earth, and in 2029 when the 325-meter 99942 Apophis comes even closer at just 0.10 LD. According to Jay Melosh, if an asteroid the size of (~400 m across) were to hit land, it would create a crater across, deep and generate a seven- magnitude-equivalent-earthquake. The chances of an actual collision with an asteroid like is about 1 percent in the next thousand years.  Study  Swift captures flyby of asteroid . During the 2011 passage was studied with radar using Goldstone, Arecibo, the Very Long Baseline Array, and the Green Bank Telescope. The Herschel Space Observatory has made far-infrared measurements of on 10 November, helping determine its temperature and composition. Radar analysis has also helped to pin down the asteroid's albedo, or diffuse reflectivity. Although radar measurements do not detect visible light they can determine the distance and size of an object with a high degree of accuracy. This information, coupled with visible light measurements, provides a more accurate measure of an object's absolute magnitude, and therefore its albedo. On 8 November 2011, NASA released a statement mentioning a number of structures on the surface of the asteroid, which were detected as it passed near Earth. On 11 November 2011, higher-resolution images showed concavities, a ridge near the asteroid's equator, and numerous features interpreted as decameter-scale boulders. Shape modeling based on the radar images shows that YU55's shape is close to spheroidal, with maximum dimensions of 360¬±40 m, and an equator-aligned ridge. A 150‚Äì200 meter-long, ~20 meter-high rise forms a portion of the ridge-line, and the number of boulders on the surface is comparable to that seen on the asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft. Optical lightcurve measurements during the flyby provided a more accurate estimate of the asteroid's spin period about 19.3 hours. Because is so nearly spheroidal, it was not significantly torqued by Earth's tides during the flyby, and there is no evidence of non-principal-axis rotation. Optical, near-infrared, and ultraviolet spectroscopy confirmed that is a C-type asteroid.  Future trajectory  On 19 January 2029, will pass from Venus. The close approach distance to Venus in 2029 will determine how close the asteroid will pass to Earth in 2041. Before the November 2011 observations, the uncertainties in the post-2029 trajectory showed that the asteroid would pass somewhere between and of Earth in 2041. Radar astrometry in November 2011 clarified the Earth passage in 2041 and beyond. As a result of the November 2011 radar observations, it is now known that will pass between and 0.1020 AU of Earth on 12 November 2041. Using the current uncertainty region integrated until the future, the 2075 approach will be between and .

He took part in the fifth congress of the Communist International in 1924 as a non-voting delegate, representing of the inner-party minority in Austria. He was expelled from the party on August 31, 1924. In August 1925 he was readmitted to the Communist Party as a member. He worked with the Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern), having been appointed secretary of the Trade Union Sector of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1928. At the Profintern congress of 1930, held in Moscow, Toman was elected to the central council of the international body. He moved to Moscow, working as instructor at the Organizational Department of Profintern. Toman relocation to the Soviet Union was seen as a way of resolving the fractional frictions inside the Austrian Communist Party. In the Soviet Union, Toman was accused of mismanagement of funds. In September 1931 he was sacked from Profintern. He was given a new employment at a sailor's club in Leningrad, politically demoted. Having returned to Austria in 1932, Toman was finally stripped of his Communist Party membership. Toman joined the Revolutionary Socialists in 1934. He was detained at the W√∂llersdorf prison camp, but was released in 1935. After Anschluss (German annexation of Austria in 1938) Toman was threatened with imprisonment at the Dachau concentration camp. He was however able to negotiate a release from captivity, citing his expulsion from the Communist Party. He undertook a loyalty oath to the Third Reich. In April 1938 German authorities appointed him as a member of the local administration of Eichgraben. In January 1940 he joined the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) and SA. Toman was captured by Soviet troops in May 1945. He died in a Soviet Gulag on February 5, 1950. There are very few documented cases of former Austrian communists having joined the NSDAP, Toman being the most prominent amongst them. There is little written about Toman's political journey, but speculation points towards blunt opportunism.

It is native to the colder seas of the northern hemisphere. Description Unlike most crustaceans, barnacles are unable to move from place to place. Cement glands near the base of the antennae fix them to the rock. The carapace of this species is conical with a circular base which has an irregular edge and a diameter of up to three centimetres. The surface is ridged and white or pale brown. The cover plates protecting the opening are shaped like the beak of a bird. Ecology This species is found at depths of up to and grows on bedrock, boulders, pebbles and shells. It seems to favour habitats with strong currents and when overcrowding occurs, adopts different shapes to fit the space available. It is often found growing alongside another barnacle, Balanus crenatus. Other species often found in its vicinity include Tubularia larynx, Obelia geniculata, Pomatoceros triqueter, Pecten maximus, Hydroides norvegica, Chlamys opercularis and Sertularia species. Coralline algae was often present as were the whelk, the European edible sea urchin (Echinus esculentus), the great spider crab (Hyas araneus) and the shore crab (Carcinus maenas). The main predator is the juvenile common starfish (Asterias rubens). Medium sized barnacles seem to be at greatest risk. Small specimens are ignored while large specimens seem able to withstand attack. Distribution Balanus balanus is found in the Arctic Ocean and the more northerly seas of the northern hemisphere. It has been introduced to Argentina where it is displacing other species and is considered invasive. Biology Larvae settle out of the zooplankton in about April and attach themselves to objects on the sea floor. The newly metamorphosed cyprid develops slowly reaching diameter in a few weeks and by September. The growth rate then slows over the winter so that the year old barnacle averages . Thereafter it grows at a year and the largest specimens, across are probably four to six years old. Under experimental conditions of total submersion growth is faster and more nearly resemble growth rates of Semibalanus balanoides and Balanus crenatus. This may be because these barnacles, being always under water, have a greater continuity of food supply. There is a wide variation in rate of growth and the factors affecting it include currents and nutrient content. A scarcity of diatoms in mid-summer may slow growth at this time. B. balanus is a cross-fertilising hermaphrodite and the single brood of nauplii is produced in the middle of winter. In mature individuals (barnacles at least ten millimetres in diameter) the white vesiculae seminales are very much enlarged at this time and filled with spermatozoa, occupying much of the body cavity and the penis is also greatly enlarged. At the same time, a creamy mass of eggs are present in the ovarian tubules. Fertilisation takes place over the course of a few days in each group of barnacles and the fertilised eggs change to an orange colour and then to a greyish-brown as the nauplii develop. New ovaries begin to form soon after fertilisation, and the testes re-develop during the summer with the size of the penis being reduced. After about forty days of embryonic development, the nauplii are liberated into the water. Many first year specimens are not fully mature in their first winter but those that are liberate 3,000 to 4,000 nauplii. Second year individuals at an average size of twenty millimetres will produce about 20,000 nauplii, whilst larger individuals of thirty millimetres may produce over 100,000. The nauplii feed, moult five times and swim with their antennae. It takes about one month for them to develop into the cyprid larvae, the non-feeding stage before adulthood.

Mandanci Jr. was convicted in May 1983 by a jury in the U.S. District Court in New Haven of three charges of fraud in connection with a federal housing subsidy application that he had filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; he was acquitted on a fourth charge of lying to a bank officer.Ex-mayor's Son Convicted, Associated Press (March 7, 1983). Judge Robert C. Zampano sentenced Mandanci Jr. to a five-year suspended sentence, a $20,000 fine, and three years' probation.Ex-mayor's Son Gets Suspended Term, Associated Press (June 18, 1983). Mandanici Sr.'s \\"biggest antagonist\\" during this period was Richard Blumenthal-then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut--who aggressively pursued Mandanici. Blumenthal later became Connecticut Attorney General and then U.S. senator.Sullivan, p. 61. In the highly contentious 1981 campaign, Mandanici was the target of death threats and wore a bulletproof vest while campaigning.Paul von Zielbauer, Bridgeport Mayor Joins List of Corruption Defendants, New York Times (January 8, 2003). According to one author, the election of 1981 was \\"without question\\" the \\"wildest election\\" in city history, a clash \\"between two bombastic politicians with hard-charging styles\\" --Mandanici and Paoletta--\\"who did not much care for each other.\\"Sullivan, pp. 66-67. In that campaign, a car was firebombed outside the city Republican headquarters and two cars were blown up in Mandanici's driveway.Burns, p. 15. Mandanici lost the election by just 64 votes. His loss was attributed to the federal indictments as well as Mandanici's unpopular demand for a 50% pay raise, which the common council approved.Sullivan, p. 66. In 1982, the state Elections Commission fined Mandanici $800 for establishing an illegal campaign committee and soliciting funds for it the previous year. Mandanici's son John C. Mandinici Jr., the special committee chairman Mario Testa, and the special committee treasurer George H. Farrell Jr., along with several Bridgeport-area businesses, were also fined. The fines were levied as part of an agreement with the Commission, absolving the parties of any intentional violation of the law.Panel Fines Ex-Bridgeport Mayor, Associated Press (June 10, 1982). In 1983, Mandanici unsuccessfully attempted to make a comeback as mayor. He failed to win the Democratic nomination and ran as an independent candidate instead.Mandanici Challenges Registrar, Associated Press (November 26, 1983). In 1985, Mandanici again sought election as mayor but was defeated in the Democratic primary. Death Mandanici died on January 7, 1986, at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, at age 68. Family John C. Mandanici Sr., had two sons: Francis Mandanici, who became a public defender in Bridgeport,Thomas Schultz, Lawyer in State Files Grievance Against Whitewater Counsel, Hartford Courant (September 20, 1996). and John C. Mandanici Jr, a former Connecticut State Trooper.Policeman's Suit Tentatively Settled, Associated Press (April 4, 1979). He also had two daughters, Marylou Mandanici who was a 7th grade school teacher and Cecilia Mandanici who also became a school teacher in Bridgeport at Black Rock School and taught kindergarten.

The Seine has been an integral part of Parisian life for centuries for commerce, travel and entertainment. Here van Gogh primarily captures the respite and relief from city life found in nature. A few of the paintings were made in Paris and the rest in the northwestern suburbs of Paris in Clichy and Asni√®res. Through these works the audience can see a transition in his work from one of dark colors and serious themes to more joyous use of color and light and choice of themes. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as cousin-in-law Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School. In Paris van Gogh was exposed to and influenced by Impressionism, Symbolism, Pointillism, and Japanese woodblock print genres which were overtime integrated into his works. The spring of 1887 seemed to trigger an awakening within van Gogh where he experimented with the genres to develop his personal style. Background=The Netherlands In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a Dutch realist painter and leading member of the Hague School, who had a significant early impact on Vincent van Gogh. To dull colors, van Gogh often added black to his paintings. Paris In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris never to return. His brother Theo, a successful Parisian art dealer, provided Vincent the support and connections for an immersion in modern art. Starting March 1886 van Gogh studied with Fernand Cormon. During that time he lived with Theo who leased a large apartment on Rue Lepic in Montmartre with space for a studio for his brother. Three months later Vincent abandoned his studies with Cormon, but his education continued on an informal basis as he met local artists. During 1886 he was introduced to Impressionist artists and their works, such as Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In 1887 Van Gogh continued to make important connections with other artists who he befriended and exchanged paintings with, such as Louis Anquetin, √âmile Bernard, Armand Guillaumin, Lucien Pissarro and Signac. Many of the Impressionist artists also shared his interest in Japanese ukiyo-e wood block prints. In the two years, from 1886 through 1888, Van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. One of van Gogh's quarrels with Impressionists, though, was subject matter. In the late 1880s the avant- garde painted the modern city, one modified significantly by the work of Baron Georges Haussmann, Napoleon III's Prefect of the Seine. His plan was to build a modern city of \\"grand boulevards, bridges and parks\\", which figure into van Gogh's works of the Seine, but at an expense. The city lost tens of thousands of old buildings, some of them cherished historical buildings, and displaced tens of thousands of people to the suburbs. Paradoxically, renovations along the Seine provided some of artist's most cherished views. Prior to the renovation buildings crowded the Seine, which could only be reached at right angles from narrow streets. New bridges were built and existing ones rebuilt, without shops and other structures that previously sat on the bridges. The city benefited by more light and air and improved commerce. To celebrate the modern city, Impressionists painted the changing urban landscape. Many, including van Gogh, felt that the city \\"now dwarfed the individual.\\" This was one of the key reasons for van Gogh's growing unease in Paris. The Seine 1855 Colton Map of Paris area and the river SeineThe Seine (Latin: Sequana) is named for its snake-like course from inland France to the English Channel at Le Havre. Numerous locks and bridges are found in the river Seine. The Seine is rich in history, provides commercial navigation and has been a source of inspiration to artists for centuries. For more than 4,500 years, the Seine has provided a means of transportation. As Paris grew, the Seine was important for trade of commodities such as firewood, grain and wine. Efficient travel, though, was not possible until canals were added and river depths were controlled in the mid to late 19thcentury. Many of key Paris buildings and monuments are located along the Seine. Starting in the 1860s Impressionists left their studios to paint en plein air (in the open air) and one of their first subjects was the Seine. Paul Gauguin painted Pont d'I√©na, the future site of the Eiffel Tower, when the area was filled with homes and gardens. From Notre Dame de Paris, Camille Pissarro painted the Louvre. Armand Guillaumin captured the smoke spewing factory chimneys of Ivy. In 1874 Alfred Sisley made the graphic paintings of the floods of Le Port-Marly, located near Paris. Claude Monet, √âdouard Manet and Auguste Renoir painted bridges, trees and sailboats at Argenteuil located in the northwestern suburbs of Paris. And van Gogh and others painted the Seine. Paintings Longing for tranquil settings, van Gogh began to paint beyond the city fortifications and along the banks of the Seine, in Asni√®res and the island of Grand Jatte. He experimented with a lighter, more colorful palette than used in his early Dutch paintings or Montmartre series. Paris Upon arriving in Paris in March 1886, the Mus√©e du Louvre was the first placed van Gogh visited, directly after exiting the train. In late 1886 he writes of his interest in Impressionism, yet not quite \\"joined the club\\". His intention, he says, is to use vivid color and not greys. In 1886, he did twelve landscapes, \\"frankly green frankly blue\\" [such as Lane at the Jardin du Luxembourg] as he struggled \\"for life and progress in art\\". It was in July 1886 that his brother Theo began to notice changes in Vincent's paintings and noted Parisian artists began swapping paintings with him. =Pont du Carrousel with Louvre= Pont du Carrousel with Louvre depicts the bridge that crosses the Seine named Pont du Carrousel and behind it the Louvre. Pont de Carrousel is a bridge that leads to the Louvre which is accessed through \\"guichets\\" du Carrousel and guichets du Louvre. Guichets are gates and commonly used for the passages into the Louvre. The Louvre was built about 1200 as a fortress. In the 14thcentury the Louvre was expanded to a residence for Charles V. The old fortress was removed in the 16thcentury replaced by a Renaissance palace which was expanded over the years. It is now one of the world's most important museums, its collections starting from works held by the kings of France. =Lane at the Jardin du Luxembourg= Lane at the Jardin du Luxembourg is situated in the gardens of the Palais Luxembourg. The Palais Luxembourg was built in 1615 for Marie de' Medici, widow of Henry IV, on the grounds of the mansion of Fran√ßois de Luxembourg, duc de Piney, that she purchased in 1612. She did not feel at home at the Louvre and desired to live in a place that reminded her of her homeland, Florence. During the Revolution the palace was overtaken and became a state prison. In 1795 it became the site of the first Directory and then the seat of the senate for Napoleon. The Luxembourg Gardens are now a public park and a place of respite for residents and visitors of Paris. Among the treed grounds are fountains and statues. The painting also named Terrace in the Luxembourg Garden depicts a spring day in the park. Here Van Gogh has begun to leverage what he has learned about modern art, color and light. Thick brushstrokes foretell his evolving style. The remoteness with which the painting was made is typical of an Impressionist's approach. Pont de Clichy, near Asni√®res Van Gogh remained anxious and lonely during his first year in Paris, but with the spring in 1887 he began to explore outside of central Paris for more pastoral settings. From Rue Lepic in Montmartre van Gogh took the Boulevard de Clichy to the southern banks of the Seine in the old Commune de Clichy. Beyond that was Asni√®res and La Grand Jatte island, also the scene of van Gogh's paintings of the Seine. =The Seine with the Pont de Clichy= Of making The Seine with the Pont de Clichy, also named Bridges of Asni√®res (F303), van Gogh wrote, \\"I've been worried by the sunset with figures and a bridge that I spoke of to Bernard. The bad weather prevented me working on the spot and I‚Äôve completely ruined it trying to finish it at home. However I began again at once, the same subject on another canvas, but as the weather was quite different, in grey tones and without figures.\\" =Gate in the Paris Ramp= In one of van Gogh's early works of Porte de Clichy, one of the city gates into Paris, Gate in the Paris ramp, 1886 (F1401), image not shown, van Gogh began to experiment with adding brighter, contrasting colors to his paintings. Porte de Clichy is one of entrances through the fortifications of Paris, 30kilometers in length, that surround the city. In the summer of 1887 he produced four watercolors of these city defences. In making this painting van Gogh sketched the ramparts while making note of the colors that he wished to use, such as violet for the left wall and yellow for the right one. van Gogh also made a watercolor painting of The Fortifications of Paris with Houses also known as The Ramparts of Paris in 1887.

In the 19thcentury Parisians took a short train ride to Asni√®res for boating, including rowing meets; festivals; and the \\"unrestrained atmosphere\\" of its dances. Van Gogh and Bernard often painted together \\"en plein air\\". Vincent wrote to his sister Wil, \\"While painting at Asni√®res, I saw more colors than I have ever seen before.\\" Instead of working in the somber colors of his early work, van Gogh embraced the use of color and light of the Impressionists. Influenced by Impressionism and Pointillism, van Gogh modified his traditional style and used vivid color, shorter brushstrokes and perspective to engage the viewer. His views of the banks of the Seine are an important progression for his later landscape paintings. In Asni√®res, within walking distance of Theo's flat in Montmartre, van Gogh painted parks, caf√©s, restaurants and the river. =The Seine with the Pont de la Grande Jatte= The Seine with the Pont de la Grande Jatte (F304) is a painting made by van Gogh of a favored area on the Seine near Asni√®res. It was made during a period where he explored the use of \\"dots\\" of paint set alongside contrasting colors, influenced by Georges Seurat. In 1885 Seurat made A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte with a technique of placing colored dots on a work which led a movement called \\"Neo-Impressionism\\", \\"Divisionism\\" and \\"Pointillism\\". Van Gogh was one of the artists later called \\"Post- Impressionists\\" who was influenced by Seurat's style that rejected realism and idealism to create a new genre based upon abstraction and simplicity. Van Gogh learned from Seurat the beauty in simplicity and a means to convey messages in a more optimistic, light way than his work in the Netherlands. While he could not match Seurat's precision, aspects of Pointillism were integrated into van Gogh's work. =Bank of the Seine= In Bank of the Seine (F293) van Gogh uses Pointillism in the small dots for the trees, larger dots in the sky and dashes for water. Impressionism is harnessed to create light and reflection of the water. =Bridges across the Seine at Asni√®res= Bridges across the Seine at Asni√®res (F301) was painted in open air and bright sunlight. The scene depicts railway bridges over the river. Van Gogh uses light and reflection effectively in this painting. The stone piers of the bridge are reflected in the water and white paint is used for highlights. A woman dressed in pink with a red parasol are the focal point of the composition. The painting is part of a group of suburban landscapes along with a painting in Oxford, both of which he had placed in red frames. Van Gogh found this setting through his friend √âmile Bernard whom he met when studying with Cormon. Over the two years that Van Gogh was in Paris [1886‚Äî1887] Van Gogh made several paintings of bridges crossing the Seine. =Walk Along the Banks of the Seine Near Asni√®res= Walk Along the Banks of the Seine Near Asni√®res also called Riverbank at Asni√®res (F299) illustrates van Gogh's technique of using \\"short, rapid strokes of color the capture the atmosphere of a particular place\\", something he used with other paintings along the Seine.

Clubs and competitions were established for amateur sportsmen to meet on the Seine. Van Gogh's friend John Russell was an avid participant in local competitions. In the summer of 1887 they often met at Theo's apartment on Rue Lepic where Russell was shown Vincent's paintings of boats, bridges and islands along the Seine, which with Russell's interest in rowing may have been inspiration for his paintings of the Seine at Bougival and Le Pecq.

He was professor at the School of Byzantine Chant at the Conservatory of Athens, the founder and director of the Greek Byzantine Choir and an Archon Protopsaltes (lead protopsaltes) of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.  Life  Lykourgos A. Angelopoulos was born in Pyrgos, Peloponnese, in 1941. He studied Byzantine music at the School of National Music, under the tutelage of the great musician and musicologist, Simon Karas, and Law at the University of Athens. He was the protopsaltes (first cantor) at the Church of Saint Irene in Athens (first Cathedral). He was the founder and director of the Greek Byzantine Choir and professor of Byzantine Music at the Nikos Skalkotas Conservatory and at the Philippos Nakas Conservatory in Athens. He was the director of the Children's Byzantine Choir of the Archdiocese of Athens since its foundation and the director of the School of Byzantine Music at the Diocese of Elis.  Works  Lykourgos Angelopoulos had published his own editions according to the re-introduction of signs taken from Late Byzantine notation. Simon Karas translated them within the rhythmic context of Neo-Byzantine notation as ornaments.The manual by Georgios Konstantinou (1997) was supposed to explain the signs, used in Angelopoulos' editions, to his students. Concerning performance practice, the choir follows Karas' innovations and his interpretation of the Byzantine modes, due to Lykourgos Angelopoulos' use of the \\"extended\\" neumatic notation in his own hand-written chant editions.In a video of Petros Peloponnesios' short version (Doxastarion syntomon) of the Doxastikon oktaechon ŒòŒµŒ±œÅœáŒØ·ø≥ ŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒπ, we can follow his choir with Angelopoulos' edition using Karas' extended neume notation. In a contribution to a musicological conference at Delphi (1986), Lykourgos Angelopoulos explained his attitude to the living tradition and to the New Method in general, and editions based on Simon Karas' Method in particular.See Angelopoulos' contribution to the Delphi conference (1986). He died at the age of 73 on 18 May 2014.  International collaboration  He had collaborated with the Athens Radio Broadcast on programs related to Byzantine Music and had performed contemporary music composed by M. Adamis, D. Terzakis and K. Sfetsas. He was a member of the research team headed by Marcel P√©r√®s in France, which studies the old Western chants and their relationship to the Byzantine ones. He had performed Byzantine, Old Roman, Ambrosian and other traditions of Western plainchant in recordings with the Ensemble Organum in France.  Honours  In 1994 Lykourgos Angelopoulos was honored by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I with the Patriarchal offikion and was named Archon Protopsaltis (First Chanter) of the Holy Archdiocese of Constantinople. He had also been honored by Diodoros, Patriarch of Jerusalem, by the Orthodox Church of Finland and by the Diocese of Patras in Greece.  Influence on the living tradition  Lykourgos had especially influenced Georgios Konstantinou, who proposed a notation for microtonal shifts (melodic attraction) and notated details, which had previously been part of oral tradition.See the examples in his manual (1997). The advantage of the oral tradition is that only those singers who had been introduced by their masters, followed a certain local tradition. The Balkans and the Orient are still rich of these local traditions. Lykourgos Angelopoulos was well known for his international collaborations, e.g. with Divna Ljubojeviƒá, and as a charismatic singer who had a large following. He had faced strong opposition among psaltes who belong to these local traditions.The discussion of Karas' extended notation and Georgios Michalakis' polemics, who had a point of view influenced by Iakovos Nafpliotis and the Old Patriarchal School, might serve as two examples of the controversy surrounding Simon Karas' Method.

Dixon, the sheriff of Trinity County in northern California. History The massacre was in response to the killing of Colonel John Anderson by the Wintu. The Americans tracked the Wintu to a part of Hayfork Creek south of the Hayfork Valley known as Bridge Gulch, where they had made camp.Hoover, Mildred Brooke and Douglas E. Kyle, Historic Spots in California: Fourth Edition, Stanford University Press, 1990 - 617 pages, 19512813, accessdate January 3, 2013 They waited until early morning before attacking, to ensure that nobody could escape. When daylight broke they attacked the Wintu, who were just beginning to awaken. More than 150 Wintu people were killed, with only about five scattered children surviving the attack. Those Wintu killed in the massacre were not responsible for the death of John Anderson, who was killed by Wintu from a different band. Native Americans in California experienced several decades of genocide as the white settlers started to arrive from the east and the Midwest. Miners, ranchers and other settlers flooded into the region to occupy lands belonging to Native Americans. As more and more white settlers arrived, Native Americans were forced from their homelands and the most valuable lands, and conflicts erupted. In addition to the loss of land and resources, and the conflicts over new settlements, Native Americans suffered from introduced diseases and were subject to violence and murder at the hands of the newcomers, sometimes aided or led by US military troops. Legal loopholes or the absence of a strong, local judicial system also prevented the white killers being brought to justice. Tall tales and rumors circulated by words of mouth or by the press also contributed to mass participation in the killings and galvanized people's tacit consent to those killings. While mid-19th century California law did not explicitly permit the killing of Native Americans, it also prevented any non-white (i.e., Native American) witnesses providing evidence against white defendants. According to Californian state law, the punishment for stealing livestock was 25 lashes and a 200 dollar fine (Lindsay, 202). Many White settlers apparently found such a measure too lenient and not enough to deter the Indians from stealing their livestock. They often raided Indian villages and executed the men and women on the spot. More gruesome still, they often put down the children and infants as well. This is clearly a violation of state law and outright murder. Unfortunately, because of the legal loopholes and widespread support for those killings, these men were never prosecuted by law. The white settlers often found it convenient to portray Indians as subhuman and inferior to white people. In this way, it became justifiable in their conscience to kill their fellow human beings of \\"the other\\" race. Indians were perceived as \\"savages\\" and seen as living in \\"misery\\" (Lindsay, 194). As a result, killing Indians was another way to \\"stop their misery.\\" These notions may partially explain the indiscriminate killing of Native men and women in California after disputes in land settlements erupted. The white settlers saw themselves as a superior race; as a result, they saw themselves as having a \\"manifest destiny\\" to hold all the land to the Pacific Ocean. They sincerely believed that they could make better use of the land by farming. This land would be \\"wasted\\" left in the hands of the Indians. Accounts and rumors describing Indians as \\"bloodthirsty killers\\" also helped to demonize the Indians in the minds of the white people.

The King not only permitted it, he had the trophy created within the Royal Crown Silversmith. It is beautifully decorated in traditional Siamese style, with figures of dancing girls and elephant heads.

He was befriended by Forty and his fellow officers, and on eventually becoming King he presented the cup to Forty and his fellow officers as a token of their friendship. Forty donated the cup to the islands to be played for annually between Victoria College in Jersey and Elizabeth College in Guernsey (These are the CI equivalents to UK Public Schools). When rugby was no longer played by the two colleges it was decided that the cup should be contested between the two island rugby clubs each season, thus began the annual 'battle' for the Siam Cup. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands by Nazi Germany in the Second World War, the Germans wanted it to be sent to their homeland to be melted down and used as funds to support the Third Reich. Strangely enough the cup 'disappeared' and was not rediscovered until after the end of the occupation. To this day, there is no record of the whereabouts of the cup during this period. By the 1970s the trophy started to deteriorate from age and a replica was commissioned. The original was handed to the Rugby Football Union in 1977 where it is placed on display at the World Rugby Museum at Twickenham Stadium in London, England. Competition The competition has been contested annually since 1920, each island hosting it every other year. The only breaks in competition were due to the Second World War. Jersey are the more successful island in the competition, perhaps due to being a professional side playing at level two of the English leagues. Guernsey play at level five. Since the 2016 event, the rules were changed to put restrictions on Jersey and the players they could field to try and make the competition more competitive. Jersey are now only able to select a player who has been resident in the island for at least three years. The result of the changes was deemed a success as the 2016 event was a closer affair with Guernsey leading until the latter stages before Jersey snatched the win and in 2017, Jersey won by just 2 points. In 2018, Guernsey finally broke the duck as they capped off an excellent season, which had seen them gain promotion to the National Leagues just a week earlier, by winning a first Siam in a decade. 2018 was also the first time in the history of the competition that a clean sweep has been achieved as Guernsey won all four games (Mens 1sts, 2nds, Veterans and Ladies) As of 2019, Jersey had won 61 times, with Guernsey winning 16. There has only ever been one draw. Equivalent competitions are held at academy, women's and veterans level. Guernsey ladies are currently on an unbeaten 8 year run as of 2019. In 2020 it was decided to postpone the current year's competition until May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is found in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic Ocean. Description The shell of B. crenatus is made of six calcareous plates and grows up to across. The upper edge of the plates are toothed and the shell is often tilted to one side. The opercular aperture is diamond shaped and protected by two further plates which can slide across when the animal is not feeding. Distribution This is a boreal species distributed in intertidal and sublittoral zones of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. It has a similar distribution to Balanus balanus, a species with which it is often associated. Biology This barnacle is a hermaphrodite and the reproductive organs develop during the winter. Individuals in a group fertilise each other and, after a period of maturation, nauplii are liberated into the water. After a number of moults, the larvae settle out of the zooplankton in about April and attach themselves to rocks and stones on the sea floor. B. crenatus is a fast-growing barnacle and can grow from a length of to in the month of May after settling. It is fully grown by August and ready to reproduce in its first winter. Ecology This species is mainly found in the sublittoral zone but can sometimes be found under stones or overhangs on the lower shore. It colonises pebbles, bedrock, shells and artificial structures. It is found in both calm and exposed waters and can tolerate low salinity levels and is found at depths of up to . It seems to favour habitats with strong currents and when overcrowding occurs, may be distorted to fit the space available. It is often found growing alongside another species of barnacle, Balanus balanus. The main predator is the juvenile common starfish (Asterias rubens). Medium sized barnacles seem to be at greatest risk. Small specimens are ignored while large specimens seem able to withstand attack but in some years, the population is decimated.

The station initially relied on programming from Jones Radio Networks; in later years, KRWP was a full service station, with classic country music being supplemented with a tradio program and high school sports coverage. Cumulus' acquisition of the station was part of its plan to move KMAJ-FM, a Topeka, Kansas radio station it owned on the same frequency, to the Kansas City market, which would have required KRWP to reduce its power. The KMAJ-FM move was called off in 2006, after Cumulus' purchase of Susquehanna Radio Corporation, as the move would have given it too many FM radio stations in Kansas City. On January 17, 2018, KRWP went off the air without any notice from Cumulus.Cumulus as quiet as 107.7 The Lake since closing station Cumulus had earlier indicated that, following the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of rules requiring a local main studio, KRWP would close its local facilities and transfer its operations to Cumulus' Kansas City studios.

Yellow: German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, green: Swiss canton of Thurgau, red: Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen The Untersee (German for Lower Lake), also known as Lower Lake Constance, is the smaller of the two lakes that together form Lake Constance and forms part of the boundary between Switzerland and Germany.  Geography  Berlingen { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"geoshape\\", \\"ids\\": \\"Q565637\\", \\"title\\": \\"Untersee\\" } The Lower Lake Constance measures 63 km¬≤ and is situated about 30 cm lower than the Obersee. The Romans called it Lacus Acronius. In the Middle Ages, the Upper Lake was called Bodamicus Lacus, or Bodensee in German. At some point in time, this term began to include the Lower Lake, and a new term \\"Upper Lake\\" (in German: Obersee), was introduced for the larger lake. The main tributaries are the Seerhein and Radolfzeller Aach. The landscape surrounding the Untersee is very diverse. The Untersee contains two islands: Reichenau and Werd (near the transition to the High Rhine). In the northeast is found the peninsula Bodanr√ºck; in the northwest, the Hegau lowlands with the peninsula Mettnau; in the west, the peninsula H√∂ri, with a mountain called Schiener Berg, and in the south, the Seer√ºcken, which reaches more than 300 feet above the Untersee near Berlingen. Bordering the Lower Lake Constance are the Swiss cantons of Thurgau and Schaffhausen and the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In contrast to the Upper Lake, the border between Germany and Switzerland across the Lower Lake is well defined. Municipalities on the Swiss side are Gottlieben, Ermatingen, Salenstein, Berlingen, Steckborn, Mammern, Eschenz and Stein am Rhein. Municipalities on the German side are √ñhningen, Gaienhofen, Moos am Bodensee, Radolfzell, Reichenau, Allensbach and Constance.  Zeller See, Gnadensee and Markelfingen Winkel  The Island of Reichenau, as seen from the Seer√ºcken Three parts in the north of Lower Lake have names of their own: Zeller See (lit.: \\"Lake of Radolfzell\\"), Gnadensee (lit.: \\"Lake Mercy\\") and Markelfingen Winkel (lit.: the nook of Markelfingen). The Zeller See is the part between the peninsula Mettnau in the north, of the peninsula H√∂ri in the south and Island of Reichenau in the east. To the west lies the estuary of the Radolfzeller Aach. The Gnadensee extends Allensbach in the north and the Island of Reichenau in the south, from the tip of Mettnau in the west to the Reichenau causeway with its highly visible poplar avenue in the east. According to legend, the name Gnade () of the lake comes from the time when the court house was located on the Island of Reichenau. If a defendant was sentenced to death, the execution of the sentence could not be carried out on the island, but only on the mainland because the island was \\"holy ground\\". Therefore, the condemned man was brought by boat to the mainland in the direction of Allensbach, where the sentence could be Gnade. Now, if the abbot wanted to pardon the condemned, he would ring a bell before the offender arrived on the other shore. This signaled to the executioner on the mainland, that prisoner had been pardoned. The story above is unlikely to be true. A more probable theory is that the lake is named after Maria, \\"Our Lady of Mercy\\", as the church of the abbey on the island was dedicated to St. Mary and St. Mark.Nyffenegger Eugene and Martin Graf: Thurgau name book, vol 3.1, Frauenfeld / Stuttgart / Vienna, 2007, , p602 The town name Frauenfeld in neighbouring canton of Thurgau can be similarly explained. The Markelfingen Winkel is the western end of the Gnadensee, between Markelfingen in the north, Radolfzell in the west and Mettnau in the south.Markelfingen Corner in a description of the study area of the Landesanstalt f√ºr Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-W√ºrttemberg Its eastern boundary is at the level of the summit Mettnauspitze. With is maximum water depth of 16 m, the Markelfingen Winkel is the shallowest part of the lake. It has a tributary: the M√ºhlbach, which drains the Mindelsee.  Rheinsee  The mainly Swiss section of the lake below of the Island of Reichenau and its southwestern arm is known as Rheinsee (lit.: \\"Rhine Lake\\", not to be confused with Seerhein (lit.: \\"Lake Rhine\\"), which is the Upper and Lower Lakes connecting segment of the river Rhine). This section of the lake follows more or less the border between Germany and Switzerland and is also called \\"Rhine Lake\\", since the current of the Rhine follows exactly this path to the effluent of the Lake Constance in the Swiss town of Stein am Rhein, where the High Rhine starts.Seespiegel, Issue 20: The Bodensee: three parts, one lake  See also  *Obersee (Lake Constance)  References  Gestalt und Funktionen des Bodensees und seines Einzugsgebietes .

The Divine Mercy Shrine () in Krak√≥w, Poland is a Roman Catholic basilica dedicated to the Divine Mercy devotion, as the resting place of Saint Faustina Kowalska, canonized on April 30, 2000.Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy Krak√≥w- ≈Åagiewniki August 2002Vatican website: Apostolic Journey address by Pope John Paul II at the Shrine, June 7 1997 The new basilica was built between 1999‚Äì2002, and is located in the District of ≈Åagiewniki at ≈õw. Faustyny street. Three Popes have visited the shrine and millions of pilgrims from around the world continue to visit it every year.Sacred Places Europe by Brad Olsen 2007 page 138 History The site of the building originally housed the neo-Gothic monastery complex of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy (founded in 1862), which was designed by Charles Zaremba and was built between 1889‚Äì1891. In 1966, the remains of Sister Faustina were moved to the church. In 1968 Cardinal Karol Wojty≈Ça (later Pope John Paul II) designated the church as a shrine, thanks to the remains of Sister Faustina. In 1985, Pope John Paul II called Lagiewniki the \\"capital of the Divine Mercy devotion\\". Since the beatification of Saint Faustina in 1993, her remains rest on the altar, below the image of Divine Mercy. Interior design and architectural form of the Basilica Faustina's chapel at the sanctuary Altar In 1999‚Äì2002, a modern two-story, ellipsoidal basilica, specifically devoted to the Divine Mercy was built. The building was designed to resemble a boat, and has a 77-meter high observation tower that resembles a mast. The basilica can accommodate about 5,000 people and the main chapel has about 1,800 seats. The altar in the main sanctuary houses the Divine Mercy painting and relics of Saint Faustina. The image above the main altar was painted by Adolph Hyla in 1944, and replaces the first image Hyla painted in 1943 as a votive offering for surviving during World War II. The image and the basilica are a major pilgrimage site and in 2011 the basilica received around 2 million pilgrims from around the world. The lower level of the church has a central a chapel dedicated to Saint Faustina, with four side chapels. The upper part of the basilica has free- standing post-modern Chapel of Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. On June 24, 2007, on the 60th anniversary of Operation Vistula, the Basilica opened a Greek Catholic chapel dedicated to reconciliation, and as a gift to the Greek Catholic Church. Report of miracle In March 1981, while praying at the tomb of St. Faustina at the church, Maureen Digan of Massachusetts reported a healing.Judy Roberts, Legatus magazine, May 1, 2010Tim Drake, 2002, Saints of the Jubilee, Authorhouse pages 85-95 Digan had suffered from lymphedema for decades, and had undergone 10 operations, including a leg amputation. Digan reported that while praying at Faustina's tomb she heard a voice saying \\"ask for my help and I will help you\\" and her constant pain stopped. Upon her return to the US, five Boston area physicians stated that she was healed (with no explanation). Digan's healing was declared miraculous by the Vatican in 1992, and paved the way for the beatification of Faustina Kowalska.Catherine M. Odell, 1998, Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy OSV Press pages 159-160 Papal visits On June 17, 1997 Pope John Paul II visited the church to pray at the tomb of Saint Faustina - an event commemorated by a relief at the entrance to the chapel. In May 2006, Benedict XVI visited the chapel, and a second relief commemorates that. During the 2006 pilgrimage by Pope Benedict XVI, he unveiled a statue of Pope John Paul II at the observation tower at the basilica, as the seventh sculpture of John Paul II in Krak√≥w. In July 2016, Pope Francis visited the Basilica as part of the Jubilee Year of Mercy and as part of the International World Youth Day celebrations taking place in Krak√≥w.

It is one of the most distinctive reflex syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by the triad of eyelid myoclonia with and without absences, eye-closure-induced seizures, EEG paroxysms, or both, and photosensitivity. Eyelid myoclonia with or without absences is a form of epileptic seizure manifesting with myoclonic jerks of the eyelids with or without a brief absence. These are mainly precipitated by closing of the eyes and lights.Panayiotopoulos CP, Agathonikou A, Koutroumanidis M, Giannakodimos S, Rowlinson S, Carr CP. Eyelid myoclonia with absences: the symptoms. In: Duncan JS, Panayiotopoulos CP, editors. Eyelid myoclonia with absences. London: John Libbey and Company Ltd, 1996:17‚Äì26 Eyelid myoclonia is the defining seizure type of Jeavons syndrome.  Signs and symptoms  Eyelid myoclonia, not the absences, is the hallmark of Jeavons syndrome. Eyelid myoclonia consists of marked jerking of the eyelids often associated with jerky upwards deviation of the eyeballs and retropulsion of the head (eyelid myoclonia without absences). This may be associated with or followed by mild impairment of consciousness (eyelid myoclonia with absences). The seizures are brief (3‚Äì6 s), and occur mainly and immediately after closing of the eyes (eye closure) and consistently many times a day. All patients are photosensitive. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures, either induced by lights or spontaneous, are probably inevitable in the long term and are provoked particularly by precipitating factors (sleep deprivation, alcohol) and inappropriate AED modifications. Myoclonic jerks of the limbs may occur, but are infrequent and random. Eyelid myoclonic status epilepticus, either spontaneous (mainly on awakening) or photically induced, occurs in a fifth of patients.Agathonikou A, Panayiotopoulos CP, Giannakodimos S, Koutroumanidis M. Typical absence status in adults: diagnostic and syndromic considerations. Epilepsia 1998; 39(12):1265‚Äì1276. It consists of repetitive and discontinuous episodes of eyelid myoclonia with mild absence, rather than continuous non- convulsive absence status epilepticus. Onset is typically in childhood with a peak at age 6‚Äì8 years (range 2‚Äì14 years). There is a twofold preponderance of girls. Prevalence and incidence is probably low.  Precipitating factors  The most potent precipitating factor is eye closure, whether voluntary, involuntary or reflex. Most and, in some patients, all of the seizures are induced immediately after closure of the eyes in the presence of uninterrupted (non-flickering) light. Eye closure in total darkness is ineffective. Contrary to other forms of photosensitive epilepsies that are sensitive only to flickering lights, patients with Jeavons syndrome are also sensitive to bright, non-flickering lights. This is probably due to the enhancing effect of bright light on the sensitivity of eye closure.  Self-induction in Jeavons syndrome  Self-induced seizures in Jeavons syndrome are rare. Eyelid myoclonia is a seizure and not an attempt for self-induced seizures. These patients do not need to produce conditions of intermittent photic stimulation for self-induction. Simply closing the eyes would be more potent. Cause Jeavons syndrome is a genetically determined homogeneous syndrome, with a high prevalence of similar seizures in family members.  Diagnosis  All tests apart from the EEG are normal. Video-EEG is the single most important procedure for the diagnosis of eyelid myoclonia with or without absences. It shows frequent high-amplitude 3‚Äì6 Hz generalized discharges of mainly polyspikes and waves. These are brief (1‚Äì6 s, commonly 2 or 3 s) and they are typically related to eye closure, i.e. they occur immediately (within 0.5‚Äì2 s) after closing the eyes in an illuminated recording room. Eyelid myoclonia of varying severity often occurs during these EEG discharges. Photoparoxysmal discharges induced by photic stimulation occur in all untreated young patients, but may be absent in older patients or those on medication. Sleep EEG patterns are normal and generalized discharges are more likely to increase during sleep, but may also decrease. The EEG and clinical manifestations deteriorate consistently after awakening. A normal EEG is rare, even in well- controlled patients.  Classification  The International League against Epilepsy has not yet recognized Jeavons syndrome despite overwhelming evidence of its existence. Instead, only ‚Äòeyelid myoclonia‚Äô has been accepted as an ‚Äúabsence seizure with special features‚Äù.  Differential diagnosis  The diagnosis of Jeavons syndrome is simple because the characteristic eyelid myoclonia, if seen once, will never be forgotten or confused with other conditions. Furthermore, the EEG with the characteristic eye-closure-related discharges and photosensitivity leaves no room for diagnostic error. Nevertheless, eyelid myoclonia is often misdiagnosed as facial tics, sometimes for many years. The symptom/seizure of eyelid myoclonia alone is not sufficient to characterise Jeavons syndrome, as it may also occur in symptomatic and cryptogenic epilepsies, which are betrayed by developmental delay, learning difficulties, neurological deficits, and abnormal MRI and background EEG.  Management  Based on anecdotal evidence, the drugs of choice are those used for other idiopathic generalized epilepsies.Panayiotopoulos CP. Reflex seizures and related epileptic syndromes. In: A Clinical Guide to Epileptic Syndromes and Their Treatment. Revised 2nd edition. London: Springer, 2010:497‚Äì531.Covanis A. Jeavons syndrome. In: Panayiotopoulos CP, editor. Atlas of epilepsies. London: Springer; 2010. 1081‚Äì1092. Valproate alone, or most probably in combination with clonazepam, levetiracetam, lamotrigine or ethosuximide, appears to be the most effective regimen. The choice of the second drug depends on the main seizure type. Clonazepam is highly efficacious in eyelid myoclonia and myoclonic jerks. Of the newer antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam may be the most effective, because of its anti myoclonic and anti photosensitive properties. Lamotrigine is very effective in absence seizures but may exaggerate myoclonic jerks. Contra-indicated drugs are: Carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine and vigabatrin. Lifestyle and avoidance of seizure precipitants are important. Non- pharmacological treatments used for photosensitive patients (such as wearing special glasses or the newly commercially available blue Z1 lenses) should be employed in Jeavons syndrome when photosensitivity persists.  Prognosis  Jeavons syndrome is a lifelong disorder, even if seizures are well controlled with antiepileptic drugs. Men have a better prognosis than women. There is a tendency for photosensitivity to disappear in middle age, but eyelid myoclonia persists. It is highly resistant to treatment and occurs many times a day, often without apparent absences and even without demonstrable photosensitivity.

John Felde, 72 and more, carried a basin and ewer from the manor to the church. He provided water for the godfathers and godmother of Maurice to wash their hands after he was raised from the font. Philip Fermer, 60 and more, knows because Robert his son celebrated his first mass in the same church on the day that Maurice was baptised. John Kyngton, 60 and more, knows because William his son was born on the same day that Maurice was baptised. John Stafford, 55 and more, was in the church when Maurice was baptised, and saw John Grevell, godfather of Maurice, give him a silver goblet with a cover immediately after the baptism, and 6s. & 8d. To the nurse. John Thorndon, 57 and more, carried a torch in front of Maurice from the manor of Siston to the church on the day that he was baptised, and held it during the baptism. Wardship Maurice was aged 10 (or possibly 14) on the death of his father in 1422, and therefore deemed a minor, not having achieved his majority of 21. The Inquisition post mortem of Gilbert Denys, dated at Chipping Sodbury, 25 June 1422, stated \\"Maurice Denys is his son and next heir, and he is of the age of 14 years and more\\". As Sir Gilbert Denys was a tenant-in-chief of the king in respect of the manor of Alveston, Glos., Maurice became a ward of the crown. In May 1422 Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester had been appointed keeper of the realm whilst King Henry V was away in France. In August 1422 the dying king appointed Gloucester as regent of England. Gilbert Denys had been in the service of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and had appointed the latter's son Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester as one of the two overseers of his will. It was possibly at the request of Beaufort, influential on the regency council, that the wardship of Maurice was awarded to Sir Edward Stradling of St Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, who was then about to marry Beaufort's illegitimate daughter by Alice FitzAlan. Gilbert Denys had been born in Glamorgan and had known Edward Stradling well, having quitclaimed his interests in land in Glamorgan to Stradling following the extensive redistributions of land consequent on the death of Sir Lawrence Berkerolles of Coity Castle in 1411.George Grant Francis Collection, Swansea: RISW GGF 1/36 general release 1 November 1421 Gilbert Denys to Edward Stradling The Fine Rolls contain the following entry dated 17 July 1422: > Commitment to Edward Stradlyng, chivaler, by mainprise of William Oldhalle > of the county of Norfolk and William Stradlyng of the county of Somerset, of > the keeping of 2/3rds of all the lands, and 2/3rds of the hundred of > Langeley, co.

Remarriage of mother Margaret Russell, mother of Maurice Denys, retained on the death of Gilbert Denys as her customary dower 1/3rd of his lands for life. Thus Edward Stradling had available only the remaining 2/3rds. as his wardship lands. Yet he exerted his influence over the widow Margaret, who had been urged not to remarry but rather to take a vow of chastity in the will of her husband, by procuring her as wife for his young nephew John Kemys from Wentloog, South Wales. Thus the following entry is recorded in the Patent Rolls, dated at Westminster, 12 December 1422, only 7 months after Gilbert Denys's death:Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry VI, vol. 1, p.19 > Licence for Margaret late the wife of Gilbert Denys, knight, tenant-in-chief > of Henry V, to marry John Kemmes, esquire This meant that Kemeys himself acquired jure uxoris a life interest in the dower 1/3 of the Denys lands. As Kemeys did not die until 1477, 11 years after Maurice Denys's death, Maurice never lived to enjoy his entire patrimony. It appears that Margaret and John Kemeys resided at Siston, the place of Maurice's birth and the principal Denys manor, which forced Maurice to reside at Alveston, or possibly near to it at Olveston Court, which his father had held at his death from the Bishop of Bath & Wells. Not only did Edward Stradling obtain Margaret as a wife for his nephew, but he had previously obtained Joan Dauntsey, the young 2nd wife and widow of her father, Sir Maurice Russell (d. 1416), as wife for his uncle Sir John Stradling, as the following entry in the Patent Rolls, dated 8 July 1418 at Waltham, records: > Pardon, for 40 marks paid in the hanaper, to John Stradlyng, chivaler, and > Joan late the wife of Maurice Russell, chivaler, tenant-in-chief, of their > trespass in intermarrying without licence. Joan had as her dowry 1/3rd of the substantial lands of Maurice Russell, and later unexpectedly became the heiress of her brother regarding the Dauntsey lands in Wiltshire. Attains majority The Close Rolls, 10 Henry VI, record the following writ, dated 20 November 1431:Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry VI, vol.2, pp.137‚Äì8, membrane 21 > To the escheator in Gloucestershire and the march of Wales adjacent. Order > to give Maurice Denys, son and heir of Gilbert Denys, knight, seisin of his > father's lands, as he has proved his age before the escheator, and the king > has taken his fealty, and for 13s. 4d. Paid in the hanaper has respited his > homage until Whitsuntide next. First marriage Sir Edward Stradling had obtained not only the wardship of Maurice but also his marriage. He exercised this right by marrying him off to his daughter, Katherine Stradling, who was thus provided with a husband of ample means. Yet Katherine it appears died very soon after giving birth in about 1437 to the couple's first son, Sir Walter Denys (c. 1437‚Äì1505). Second marriage Maurice married secondly, before 1 November 1437, Alice Poyntz, daughter of Nicholas Poyntz of Iron Acton, Glos. By his second wife Elizabeth Hussey, daughter of Henry Hussey of Sussex.Visitation of the County of Gloucester 1623, ed Sir John Maclean, London, 1885, pp. 130‚Äì135, Poyntz The family of Poyntz was prominent in the Gloucestershire gentry, of ancient lineage, and their principal manor of Iron Acton lay between the Denys manors of Siston and Alveston. Maurice had 8 children by Alice Poyntz, including Hugh Denys (d. 1511), groom of the stool to King Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509). Entails lands The following settlement, apparently on the marriage of Maurice and Alice Poyntz, was licensed on 1 November 1437, as recorded in the Patent Rolls:Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry VI, vol.3, p.120 > Licence, for 4 marks paid in the hanaper, for Maurice Denys to enfeoff John > Fort, Simon Cotesbroke, John Burnell the younger and John Pakker of Iron > Acton, and their heirs, of two parts (i.e. 2/3rds) of the manors of Alveston > and Erdecote (i.e. Earthcott Green), with the hundred and frankpledge of > Langele, (i.e. Langley) co. Gloucester, held in chief, and of the remainder > of the third part of the premises, likewise held in chief, after the death > of Margaret, the wife of John Kemys, who with her said husband, holds the > same in dower. Licence also for the said feoffees, after having had seisin > and received the attornment of the said John Kemys and Margaret to refeoff > the said Maurice and Alice, his wife, and the heirs of their bodies of the > said two parts, and to grant them the said remainder under the same entail, > with remainder to the right heirs of the said Maurice. Such entails were usual and required by the father of the bride to ensure that his daughter and her progeny obtained title to the estate of the proposed husband. Since Sir Walter Denys eventually obtained Alveston, Earthcott Green and Langeley hundred, it would seem that he must have been the heir of the body of Alice Poyntz, not of Katherine Stradling, as the pedigree in the 1623 Visitation of Gloucestershire shows. However, it appears the entail was never finalised, as in 1466 Maurice and Alice obtain licence again to settle the same manors on feoffees, which power they would not have had if the manors had been held by feoffees since 1437. Also, the settlement of 1466, shortly before Maurice's death, does not give remainder to the heirs of the body of Alice, which might explain how Sir Walter Denys obtained the manors. The 1466 settlement is recorded in the Patent Rolls, dated at Westminster, 12 October 1466:Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1461‚Äì67, p.531, membrane 23 > Licence, for 33s. 4d. Paid in the hanaper, for Maurice Denys, esquire, and > Alice his wife to grant the manors of Alleweston and Erthecote and the > hundreds of Langley and Alleweston, co. Gloucester, held in chief, to > Humphrey Poyntz and Thomas Lymeryk, and for the latter to regrant the same > to the said Maurice and Alice for life, with remainder to the heirs of the > body of Maurice and final remainder to his right heirs. Death and burial Maurice died in 1466 and was buried in the chancel of Olveston Church as the Denys brass of 1505 in that church states. Denys monumental brass, 1505, Olveston Church 400px Identification of Armourials The armourials are as follows: Top left (dexter) (1st) Quarter (to bearer's R, viewer's L)): Denys; Top right: (sinister) Russell. Bottom L (3rd. Q): 1st: Denys; 2nd: Russell; 3rd: Gorges; 4th: a cross moline or fer- de-moline, is for the family of Eleanor Ferre, da. of Sir John Ferre, of Tothill, Lincs., an heiress of the Gorges family. (Raymond Gorges, History of the Family of Gorges, Boston USA, 1944; The arms of Sir Guy Ferre (d. 1323), his nephew,Parsons, John Carmi. Eleanor of Castile can be seen above the pedestrian gateway of Butley Priory (of which he held the advowson) where the fer de moline of his canting arms is shown in the form of a cross moline). Bottom R (4th. Q): 1st: Denys; 2nd: Russell; 3rd: Gorges; 4th: prob.Danvers.Although, the arms look very like those of Wadham: Gules, a chevron between three roses argent. See Devon heraldry Armorials repeated on tabard fronts and sleeves. Morys Denys the father to L in Dexter position of honour. Russell was his heiress-mother, Gorges a former Russell heiress. On the R. is Sir Walter Denys, the son, with the arms of his co-heiress 2nd. wife, Agnes Danvers, in the 4th. Q. Blazoning of Armorials Arms of Denys: Gules, three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailed of the last The arms of Denys are: Gules, three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure, over all a bend engrailed of the last. The Denys arms blazoned with these tinctures survive earliest in British Library Add.MS 45131, f. 54, a 1509 drawing of Hugh Denys (d. 1511) at the deathbed of Henry VII. The armourials are the arms of Cantilupe of Candleston Castle, Glamorgan, probably granted as \\"arms of patronage\\" to their feudal officials or tenants the Denys's, differenced by the imposition of a bend engrailled, probably before 1258. Cantilupe arms, reversed for difference, are still borne as the official arms of the See of Hereford, in honour of St. Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford, canonised in 1320. The Denys arms are a rare ancient exception to the rule of tincture \\"no colour on colour or metal on metal\\" propounded by John Gibbon in his 1682 Introductio ad Latinam Blasoniam, in which he lists (pp. 150‚Äì1) some exceptions, including Denys: \\"Now for my reader's diversion and delight I will insert what hath fallen under my observation\\". The Denys arms are also shown sculpted on the wings of the nearby Tudor mansion Siston Court, built by Sir Maurice Denys (d.1563), great- grandson of Maurice Denys (d. 1466), yet there they have been altered to a neater composition, with the bend passing between the leopards' faces, and the latter composition was also adopted by the Denys family of Pucklechurch, lords of that manor until 1701. Arms of Russell Russell: (of Kingston Russell, Dorset & Dyrham, Glos.) Sir Gilbert Denys of Siston had married c. 1404,as his 2nd wife, Margaret Russell, eldest da. and later co-heiress of Sir Morys Russell of Dyrham. Argent, on a chief gules 3 bezants. She was the mother of Morys Denys. (Bezants are Byzantine gold coins, thought to have been very popular with the Crusaders who plundered Constantinople in 1204, not having received the previously agreed funding from the Emperor.) \\"Gorges Modern\\" arms Gorges (of Knighton, Isle of Wight; Wraxall, Somerset; Bradpole, Dorset). Sir Theobald I Russell (d. 1341) of Kingston Russell, Dorset, grandfather of Sir Maurice Russell of Dyrham, had been the ward of Sir Ralph III de Gorges, 1st Baron Gorges (d. 1324), and had been married-off by his warder to his 2nd. daughter Eleanor de Gorges. Eleanor's 3rd son Theobald II Russell inherited from his uncle Ralph IV de Gorges (d. 1331), 2nd Baron, the former Gorges estates and changed his name to \\"Gorges\\", adopting their arms, apparently as part of the arrangement. The armorials of Gorges are of interest. They were originally canting arms of a Gurges, which is Latin for whirlpool, then c. 1300 were changed voluntarily to lozengy, or and azure, in recognition of the de Morvilles, ancestors of the Gorges. Yet there was a celebrated dispute in 1347 (see Warbelton v. Gorges) when these lozengy arms were claimed by John de Warbelton against Theobald II Russell \\"de Gorges\\" and a court of honour adjudged the arms to Warbelton. Instead of adopting completely new arms, Theobald merely added a red chevron as a difference, blazoned Lozengy or and azure, a chevron gules. These arms are known as \\"Gorges Modern\\". The Denys family should logically have quartered the undifferenced arms of their ancestor Ralph III de Gorges, not those of Theobald II Russell \\"de Gorges\\", their cousin, unless as appears to have been the case, it was customary to apply such heraldic judgements retrospectively. Danvers (of Cothorpe, Oxon.) Morys Denys's 2nd wife, and Sir Walter's mother, was Agnes Danvers, co-heiress of Sir Robert Danvers (d. 1467), Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The arms blazoned in the 4th. Q. on Sir Walter's tabard appear as A chevron between 3 roses,If they are Gules, a chevron between three roses argent, these are the arms of Wadham; See Devon heraldry yet the arms given by Burkes 1884 for this family are quite different Argent, on a bend gules 3 martlets (house martens) vert legged or. The arms of Danvers of Warwick however are closer to those depicted here: Gules, a chevron between 3 mullets (stars) of 6 points or. Conclusion: The monumental brass is likely to have been erected well after the date of the interment, so if indeed there are errors on the part of the engraver, or in the instructions given him, it may have been felt acceptable to let the matter rest, rather than incur considerable expense in having it remade. On the other hand, if the arms are all correct, there are lacunae in the literature and official records of Denys family history.

Biography He attended the art academy in K√∂nigsberg and then became the pupil of Gustav Bl√§ser in Berlin. For the decoration of K√∂nigsberg University, he furnished medallion portraits of its learned men. In 1860 he produced his \\"Penelope\\" and in 1860 a sitting figure in marble of King Wilhelm for the Exchange in Berlin; and a terra-cotta statue of Leibnitz for the Academy of Science at Perth, Australia, productions remarkable for realistic modeling and imposing expression. In 1871 he executed the masterly relief \\"Uprising of the People at the Summons of their King\\"; and the following year a design for the Goethe monument. Washington Monument, Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia His next work was the statue of Frederick the Great for Marienburg (1877). In 1882, he completed a monument to Albrecht von Graefe, a noted oculist. This was followed by a statue of Martin Luther (1883) at Eisleben. For the market place at Leipzig, he made a war monument: ‚ÄúGermany,‚Äù as an armed heroine (1888).

Okorocha is a former governor and the senator representing Imo West Senatorial district at the 9th Nigerian Senate,https://punchng.com/okorocha-sworn-in-as-senator-says- igbo-presidency-doesnt-exist/ who won the 6 May 2011 gubernatorial election in Imo State and was re-elected for his second term on 11 April 2015. The former governor represents the Imo West Senatorial District at the red chamber. He is the founder of Rochas Foundation, a charity comprising a number of special schools that are spread all over Nigeria that gives scholarship to the less privileged children in Nigeria. On his first attempt, he ran on the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) platform and ran on the platform of All Progressives Congress for his second term. Background Rochas was born on 22 September 1962 in Ogboko, Ideato South, Imo State to an Imo father and an Anambra mother. He identifies more closely with his Anambra side which is the source of his natural aggression. He attended Juladaco High School, Jos (1976-1981). He studied at the University of Jos (1990-1991), obtaining a diploma in Public Administration. He returned to the University of Jos (1993-1994) to obtain an advanced diploma in Public Administration. Career positions include President, Nigeria Red Cross Society, President/Founder, Rochas Foundation Inc, President, Rochas Group of Companies Limited, Pro- Chancellor, African Business School and Former Chairman, Board of Nigerian Airspace Management Agency. He is married to Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha and together they have 6 children (3 girls and 3 boys); Uloma Rochas Nwosu, Uju Rochas Okorocha, Uchechi Rochas Okorocha, Aham Rochas Okorocha, Amen Rochas Okorocha and Amam Rochas Okorocha. Early political career Okorocha was a Commissioner on the Federal Character Commission and a Member of the National Constitutional Conference. When democracy was restored in 1999, Rochas Okorocha competed in the primaries to be the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for governor of Imo State but lost to Achike Udenwa. He moved to the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) and ran for the party's presidential nomination but a disappointing result in the primary in 2003 ended his ambition. He returned to the PDP, and President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him as Special Adviser on Inter-Party affairs. Rochas Okorocha formed the Action Alliance (AA) party in 2005, planning to become a Presidential candidate for the AA in the 2007 elections. He again returned to the PDP, and in September 2007, indicated that he was interested in becoming PDP National Chairman. After Governor Ikedi Ohakim decamped from the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA) to the PDP in July 2009, Okorocha denied that Ohakim had taken over the PDP in the state, saying he was named as A leader since he was governor, but a proper PDP congress should be held to decide on policy. As Imo State Governor Okorocha decamped from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), to run as an APGA candidate for Imo State Governor in the April 2011 national elections. A few weeks later, in December 2010, the APGA suspended Okorocha from the party over what it described as anti-party activities pending an investigation of his conduct. He stole 10 million dollars . It was reported that he had stormed the Imo State Secretariat of APGA with dozens of thugs, who beat up several top officers of the Party. Okorocha and his companions had also threatened the Imo State Chairman and Secretary of APGA. However, Okorocha went on to campaign as APGA candidate and won subsequently. Rochas in 2013 decamped to the All Progressive Congress. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared that the Imo State gubernatorial elections held on 26 April 2011 were inconclusive since the collation of results was marred by irregularities. The INEC ordered reruns in four local government areas and one ward, to be held on 6 May 2011. In the event, elections were not held in Oguta local government area due to a security threat. The final results had Okorocha of the APGA declared winner with 336,859 votes. He was followed by the incumbent governor Ikedi Ohakim of the PDP with 290,490 votes. Former Senator Ifeanyi Araraume of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) was third with 107,068 votes. President Goodluck Jonathan congratulated Okorocha on his election, saying the people of Imo State had spoken through the ballot box. In preparation for the 2015 elections, former deputy speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Emeka Ihedioha threw in his hat for the governorship tussle. After being able to snatch away the PDP tickets from other contenders, he had to slug it out with the incumbent, Okorocha. The election eventually took place on 11 April 2015 after the first date was shifted by six weeks when the federal authorities cited security concerns. Just as Okorocha's first election debacle, the second one was also declared inconclusive. INEC declared the 11 April governorship polls in Imo inconclusive, a development that led to the cancellation of elections in more than 250 polling units in 23 of the 27 local government areas. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Gabriel Ada, listed the state constituencies affected in the re-run to include; Ikeduru, Isiala Mbano, Isu, Oguta, Owerri West, and Oru East. He explained that the electoral commission ordered re-run for the governorship election because of the 79,000 difference between the votes scored by the leading and the second candidates. Okorocha won the rerun election fixed for 25 April 2015. During his time as governor, on one of his television interviews on Channels Television , he used the word \\"iberiberism\\" when trying to explain his projects as governor. Iberiberism originates from an Igbo word 'iberibe' meaning stupidity or foolishness. This got him huge attention on media channels. He was present at the 2019 Igbo day which took place in Owerri, the two-day event started with an award night by the Imo State Government \\"Governor Rochas Okorochahttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/01/how-igbo-day-was-celebrated-in- owerri/ APC On 2 March 2013, Rochas led an APGA faction to form the All Progressives Congress. He was later elected by his colleague governors in the opposition as Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum. Towards the end of his tenure as governor, Okorocha picked his son-in-law Uche Nwosu, who was the Chief of Staff, as his candidate to run for the office of the governor under APC, but Uche Nwosu lost the party's governorship ticket to Senator Hope Uzodinma. Uche Nwosu defected to the Action Alliance (AA) party after his loss and became their governorship flag bearer.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/12/breaking-okorochas-son-in-law-uche- nwosu-dumps-apc-joins-aa/ \\"Uche Nwosu dumps APC for AA,\\" 4 December 2018 on 1 March 2019 APC suspended Okorocha along with Amosun for anti-party activities. He contested the senatorial ticket for the 9th Senate representing Imo west Orlu senatorial zone during the 2019 National Assembly elections however the results are controversial and have not been ratified by INEC. Despite being declared the winner of Imo west senatorial seat, INEC removed his name from the final list saying that the result was declared under duress. The certificate of return was however issued to him by INEC on 11 June, 2019 following the inauguration of the 9th assembly of the Nigerian Senate and declared him the winner of the Imo west senatorial district elections INEC finally presents certificate of return to Okoricha.https://punchng.com/inec- finally-presents-certificate-of-return-to-okorocha/amp/ Okorocha was sworn in on 13 June, 2019 by the Senate President Ahmed Lawan.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created St. Vrain's County declared: > That the territory comprised within the following limits, be erected into a > county called St. Vrain's: commencing in the main channel of the south fork > of the Platte River, where the 104th meridian of west longitude crosses the > same, thence up the main channel of said stream to the mouth of the Cache la > Poudre, thence up the main channel of the Cache la Poudre to the east line > of Heele county, thence south to the 40th parallel of north latitude; thence > east on said parallel to the 104th meridian of west longitude, thence north > on said meridian to the place of beginning. St. Vrain's County was named in honor of Ceran de Hault de Lassus de St. Vrain, the French trader who established the first trading post on the upper South Platte River. St. Vrain's County encompassed much of what is today Weld County, Colorado. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Weld County, for the new Colorado Territory. Elections and elected officials St. Vrain County's first office holding official was Corydon P. Hall, appointed by Governor Robert Williamson Steele in December 1859 as President Judge of St. Vrain County. He was to hold office until the county's first popular election was held on January 2, 1860.

He began his discourse by tracing a brief history of the origins of French language. Indeed, he reminded that the Roman conquest and the invasion of the Franks in Gaul contributed to the emergence of a linguistic hierarchy, at the top of which stood Latin. However the contact between Latin and the idioms spoken by the ‚Äúbarbarian‚Äù population generated the vulgarisation of classical Latin, namely a multitude of patois dialects.Acad√©mie de Berlin.Discours sur l‚Äôuniversalit√© de la langue fran√ßaise, √©d. Th Suran, Paris, 1930 The writer equally highlighted the two major dialects which divided French territories: the Picard language spoken in the north and the Proven√ßal, the dialect of the south. Although the pre-eminence was given to the northern dialect (la langue d‚Äôo√Øl), Rivarol regarded the northern pronunciation as ‚Äúa little bit thud‚Äù and regretted the eclipse of the southern dialect (la langue d‚Äôoc), which he qualified as ‚Äúfull of sounds ‚Äúthat would have conferred to French more splendor‚Äù.Rivarol pp130 Afterwards, Rivarol examined the causes of the universality of the French language. The discovery of the Americas, the passage to India, the invention of the printing press, the development of the trade market and the progress in science gave to Europe supremacy over the world. By consequence, relations between European powers felt the necessity of a common language. In his essay, Rivarol showcased the dominant languages ruling the European continent, and demonstrated why they could not supersede the French language. German Rivarol began his critique with the language of Goethe. He blamed the German people for having denied their own language during the 16th century. The French essayist declared that the inferior position of German with regard to Latin was explained by the fact that the Prussian empire had never been unified under the same crown. Another argument criticised the difficulty of German syntax that appeared to be an obstacle to the learning of this language. In addition, the glottal pronunciation, as well as the Fraktur script ‚Äúshocked people of the south‚Äù. Rivarol even dared to express in front of the Berlin Academy the revolting feelings that people from Latin origins associated with northern languages. Nevertheless, he mitigated his statements by describing the German language as ‚Äútoo rich and too hard at the same time‚Äù.Rivarol pp 132 He praised German literature for giving the world poets and writers of genius. However, as Germany fell behind its neighbours in terms of art and literature, its language faced difficulties in finding a privileged place at the international level. The German language projects an image of ‚Äúantique and modest‚ÄùRivarol pp 133 people, too conventional and sedentary. Rivarol finished his critique on Germany by pointing out another argument against a possible development of the German language: the blind tolerance and the warm welcome that the Academy presented to foreign idioms. Spanish The second language to be criticized by Rivarol was the Spanish language. This language from Castile had lost its power and its charm from the era of Charles V with the collapse of the Spanish Empire. In the period following the golden age of Spanish literature, ‚ÄúCastilian had no longer that Moorish gallantry that charmed Europe, and the national genius became darker‚Äù.Rivarol pp 134 Rivarol did not deny the importance that Spanish had in the metropolis of Europe. As it was spoken at the royal courts and in theatres, the genius of literary works by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega were praised throughout Europe. The Spain of the 18th century concealed ‚Äúits poverty under the magnificence of the Spanish language and national pride‚Äù.Rivarol pp 135 Paradoxically, after having expressed his admiration for Castilian, Rivarol reproached the language for being redundant. He also depicted Spanish pronunciation as pompous. Italian When it came to his ancestral country, Antoine de Rivarol's discourse veered to a more solemn tone. In fact, he did not hesitate to dedicate five or six pages of eulogy on the ‚Äúcentre of the world for so many centuries‚Äù.Rivarol pp 136 It is interesting to notice that Rivarol profoundly regretted the glorious times of the Roman Empire when ‚Äúthe only passable routes in Europe led to Rome‚Äù Consequently, the French writer asked himself why Italy did not succeed in imposing its language to the European continent. One of the main reasons that impeded the development of the Italian language lay in the papal authority. Indeed, the Roman Catholic Church always favoured Latin. Given that the Pope communicated exclusively in Latin both in written and oral speech, the dialects spoken in the regions of Italy did not manage to dethrone Latin. For centuries, the Tuscan dialect had been considered as a vulgar idiom. For that reason precisely, a lot of renowned writers, such as Dante, Petrarch or Boccaccio had long time been reluctant to write in patois. Most of the time, they published their works in Latin. In another argument, Rivarol attracted attention on the spread of Tuscan all over the Mediterranean regions. In fact, this dialect began to be spoken beyond Italian territories due to European travellers who practiced commerce activity to Asia. In addition, the Medici period culturally enriched the Italian language by means of literature and flourishing art. In the 16th century, nevertheless, the political tensions of the neighbour countries went against the expansion of Tuscan. France and Spain, immerged in warfare, did take absolutely no interest in the idea of a universal language. ‚ÄúThe maturity of Italian was precocious‚Äù.Rivarol pp 138 Subsequently, Italy in its turn fell in a period of political conflicts. Invaded by Germans, by Spanish, and by French, Italy lost its authority at the expense of its adversaries. Symptomatically, the importance of the Italian language weakened. English The last language to come under fire was English. Rivarol heaped the most virulent criticism on England. He described England as a country ‚Äúunder cloudy sky, isolated from the rest of the world, served as an exile for Romans‚ÄùRivarol pp 143 Throughout his essay, the author drew a discriminatory comparison between French and English cultures. He overtly disparaged English values at the expense of French ones. With disdainful eyes, Rivarol depicted English nation that, according to him, had no quintessential characteristics. Consequently, French mores and traditions represented a model for Europe. Regarding the thriving economy of England, the French essayist condemned British navigation judged as dangerous for the other countries. On the other hand, Rivarol fervently defended values of France that ‚Äúendowed with immortal treasures, it acted against its own interests and misread its genius‚Äù.Rivarol pp 144 Whereas England needs everybody in order to attract potential customers, ‚Äúeverybody needs France‚Äù. In addition, the French pamphleteer seemed to take pleasure in comparing personalities of the two peoples. The English are portrayed as ‚Äúterse and taciturn, linked to embarrassment and timidity of northern Man‚Äù.Rivarol pp 145 They are contrasted with the French that Rivarol described as optimistic and social individuals, who combine politeness, gallantry and grace. This unilateral defence in favour of French people dominated the essay of Antoine Rivarol. In this respect, he established a parallel between the peculiarities of a nation and virtues of its language, affirming that a rich language necessarily belonged to rich and educated people. In order to examine the case of English language and to see if it could claim the universality, Rivarol analysed English literature along with its eminent writers. The domain of literature would be the only aspect in the argument of Rivarol not to be subjected to disapproval. In fact, the writer even delivered a panegyric on the merits of English literature. He acknowledged the ingenuity of Chaucer and Spencer, describing the former as English Homer. Nevertheless, he contradicted himself few lines later: ‚Äútheir books did not became books of all people‚Äù.Rivarol pp 161 One can clearly notice the royalist tone of Rivarol while he was launching an attack against Shakespeare and Milton. He emphasised the fact that the royal court of England did not appreciate these poets judged as rustic and popular. Rivarol discredited both Milton and his poems. Conversely, poets at Charles II‚Äôs court received complements from the French writer. Concerning the origins of the English language, Rivarol considered them obscure. Following the conquest of William the Conqueror, the duke of Normandy, Anglo-Saxon was assimilated to French. Both French pronunciation and the syntax had been distorted ‚Äúlike obelisks and statues which fell into hands of the Barbarians‚Äù.Rivarol pp 153 French The last and the most important part of Rivarol‚Äôs essay was devoted to the French language. Indeed, he would not cease to praise it until the end of his discourse. In this passage, Rivarol launched himself into a demonstration full of nationalist passion for the progress of the French language. He put a particular emphasis on the intrinsic values of France. He began his defence by an exaltation of the reign of Louis XIV, ‚Äútrue Appollo of French Parnassus, who walked down the history of human spirit, next to Augustus and Alexander the Great‚Äù.Rivarol pp 174 The structure of the sentence in French is meant to be clear and faithful to the logic. As illustration, the writer cited the syntactic order in French: subject-verb-object. Speaking highly of French grammar, ‚Äúwhat is not clear is not French‚Äù, Rivarol blamed the languages with inversions. Unlike the French syntax, which he described as ‚Äúa straight line‚Äù, idioms such as Greek and Latin confused locators by leading them into a grammatical labyrinth. Due to inversion traps, Latin or Greek prose lost their clarity and accuracy. However, the only weak point that Rivarol reproached French consisted in the incompatibility with music. According to the French pamphleteer, the rigid structure of French clashed with meandering chord of musical notes. However this constancy of the order was the reason why philosophers adopted the French language. As regards the French pronunciation, Rivarol characterised it as sweet, soft and gracious ‚Äúmarked by the French character‚Äù.Rivarol pp 168 Finally, he attempted to answer to the second question posed by the Berlin Academy, namely, why could French deserve the prerogative of the universal language. The European continent forms a remarkable diversity of kingdoms and peoples. In order to guarantee the stability of all the nations, it seemed indispensable to have a common model. In this regards, French represented the only linguistic example capable of transposing its regular order and constancy to anyone who would speak it. According to Antoine Rivarol, language is the painting of our ideas. Therefore, the choice of the French language was not only advisable but also necessary for Europe. As far as the future of French was concerned, the writer remained optimistic. According to him, the universality of French and the immortality of its literature would not hand their power to another language anytime soon. He finished his essay on notes that could appear somewhat na√Øve to the 21st century reader. Indeed, Rivarol named France as the country that liberated America. French, in this case is depicted as the language of Peace. Criticisms Numerous critics reproached Rivarol for partiality in the defence of the French language in his essay, and for having based his reasoning on arguments that he himself described as delicate: * The central position of France in Europe, * Its political constitution, * The genius of French writers, * The temper of its inhabitants and * The image that France projected to the world. All these aspects made French a predominant tongue according to him. Rivarol was also lambasted for having underestimated the culture of French neighbours. Scholars accused him of ignorance of northern countries, of their languages and values. Without providing any statistical data or objective evidence, Rivarol tended to generalize his statements. His nationalist and Francocentrist sensibility earned him the designation of a controversial writer. NotesFurther reading * Acad√©mie de Berlin.

The Amazon bamboo rat (Dactylomys dactylinus) is a species of spiny rat from the Amazon Basin of South America.Pearson, David L., and Les Beletsky. Travellers' Wildlife Guides: Peru. Northampton: Interlink. (2008) It is also referred to as coro- coro, Tor√≥, Rato-do-Bamb√∫, or Rata del Bamb√∫ in different parts of its range.InfoNatura: Animals and Ecosystems of Latin America. (2007) Version 5.0. Arlington, Virginia (USA): NatureServe. http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura. 3 May 2011. The bamboo rat prefers to reside in areas of dense vegetation, such as clumps of bamboo or in the canopy. It is an arboreal browser, consuming primarily leaves and spending much of its time off the ground. Because the Amazon bamboo rat spends most of its time in heavily forested areas, it is difficult to observe, and not much is known about its habits. Physical characteristics The Amazon bamboo rat has a body length of over 600 millimeters (about 24 inches) from the nose to the tip of the tail, and weighs approximately 600-750 grams (21-26 ounces). The rat has a stout appearance, olive-grey fur streaked with black, and a tail with short, fine hairs. It has elongated digits, which are an adaptation for the rat's frequent need to climb, hence the species name: dactylinus derives from the ancient greek word (), meaning \\"finger\\". Its paws are covered with hundreds of bumps called tubercles to aid in climbing. Despite being nocturnal, the Amazon bamboo rat has weak eyeshine. The bamboo rat may benefit from weak eyeshine because it makes the rat more difficult to detect in the canopy, and because the rat moves so slowly that it does not require as much light. It has horizontally slit pupils, similar to those of a goat, to aid in its occasional diurnal activity. Like other arboreal browsers, the Amazon bamboo rat has scent glands which it uses to mark its territory. Behavior Due to the restricted diet of arboreal folivores, many of them move slowly to avoid wasting energy. The Amazon bamboo rat's slow and cautious manner of climbing has the added effect of making its movements completely silent, helping to protect it from predators. Because the rat moves so slowly, its displacement may only reach 62 meters (about 203 feet) in a single night. If a bamboo rat is quietly approached, it will back away slowly and silently; however, the rat is capable of disappearing swiftly into the foliage if necessary. This behavior allows the rodent to minimize its energy usage. Diet The Amazon bamboo rat is a small folivore. It consumes only plants that are easily digested, in order to conserve energy. The bamboo rat primarily consumes young leaves, stems, and petioles. Because of its limited diet of bamboo and local vines, it is more abundant in regions of Latin America where its preferred food sources are plentiful. Social The Amazon bamboo rat is nocturnal, emitting its shrill cry throughout the night to communicate its presence to other bamboo rats. The bamboo rat's call consists of several explosive, low frequency pulses, as well as grunts of low amplitude, which may indicate alarm or serve to communicate with other rats.LaVal, Richard K. (1976) Voice and Habitat of Dactylomys dactylinus (Rodentia: Echimyidae) in Ecuador. Journal of Mammalogy 57:2, 402-404. The Amazon bamboo rat has been observed to travel in pairs, commonly consisting of one male and one female. Because the bamboo rat has not been studied in great detail, not much is known regarding its mating habits. Distribution The Amazon bamboo rat lives in dense rainforest vegetation. There is also a report of its presence in a gallery forest in the cerrado. It can be found in much of the Amazon Basin, in parts of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.Bezerra, Alexandra, Nelson Da Silva, Jr., and Jader Marinho-Filho.

Between 1768 and 1790, she acted as the political adviser of Emperor Joseph II through her salon or discussion circle. Life She was born as a Princess of Oettingen-Oettingen and Oettingen-Spielberg, daughter of Prince Johann Aloys of Oettingen-Spielberg and Princess Therese of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg. She was raised and educated in a French convent in Strasbourg. When she was fifteen, she inherited wast estates from her aunt in Bohemia, and she and her sister Maria Leopoldine (1741‚Äì1795) were introduced at the imperial court in Vienna and appointed maid of honour to the empress Maria Theresa of Austria, during which service they became acquainted with the imperial family. On 30 March 1761, in Vienna, she married Prince Karl Borrom√§us of Liechtenstein. She and her spouse were the ancestors of a line of the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. Eleonore spent her summers in her estates in Moravia and her winters in Vienna. She had a love affair with the Irish general Charles O'Donnell, which attracted attention, but he died in 1771. Salon of the Five Princesses From 1768 onward, she held a discussion circle with a group of people including Emperor Joseph II, and through him became influential upon the affairs of state. Joseph II was reportedly in love with Eleonore of Liechtenstein and attempted to convince her to be his mistress in 1771‚Äì1772, but she declined, and they became lifelong friends. For two decades, her salon circle of five princesses exerted influence upon the affairs of state through their connection with Joseph II: their circle consisted of Princess Eleonore of Liechtenstein, Princess Maria Josepha von Clary und Aldringen (1728‚Äì1801), Princess Maria Sidonia Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1729‚Äì1815), and Princess Leopoldine of Liechtenstein (1733‚Äì1809); field marshal Count Franz Moritz von Lacy (1725‚Äì1801) and the chief treasury Prince Franz Xaver Wolfgang von Orsini-Rosenberg (1723‚Äì1796) also frequently attended their discussion circle. They met once and, from 1780, four times a week to discuss politics. Eleonore's relation to Joseph was not in lack of tension, and she did disagree with his church politics, and criticized him on his restlessness. The salon of the five princesses lost their influence as state advisers upon Joseph's death in 1790. During the Second Congress of Rastatt (1797‚Äì1799), she opposed the pro-French policy of chancellor Johann Amadeus von Thugut. She was also adverse to State Chancellor Klemens von Metternich, and she is pointed out to be behind his deposition as Dresden ambassador. She also opposed him arranging the marriage between Marie-Louise of Austria and emperor Napoleon in 1810. Eleonore of Liechtenstein has left letters which gives an important image of contemporary life in the Austrian court life. Issue She had seven children: * Princess Maria Josepha Eleonore Nicolaus (Vienna, 4 December 1763 ‚Äì Vienna, 23 September 1833), married in Vienna on 29 January 1782 Johann Nepomuck Graf von Harrach zu Rohrau und Thannhausen (Vienna, 17 May 1756 ‚Äì Vienna, 11 April 1829), without issue. * Prince Karl Joseph Emanuel Albinus (Vienna, 2 March 1765 ‚Äì killed in duel in Vienna, 24 December 1795), married in Vienna on 28 September 1789 Marianne Josepha Gr√§fin von Khevenh√ºller-Metsch (Vienna, 19 November 1770 ‚Äì Vienna, 10 August 1849), and had issue: * Prince Joseph Wenzel Franz Anastasius (Vienna, 21 August 1767 ‚Äì Vienna, 30 July 1842), a Priest in Salzburg. * Prince Emanuel Joseph Kaspar Melchior Balthasar (Vienna, 6 January 1770 ‚Äì Vienna, 20 February 1773). * Prince Moritz Joseph Johann Baptist Viktor (Vienna, 21 July 1775 ‚Äì Vienna, 24 March 1819), married in Eisenstadt on 13 April 1806 Marie Leopoldine Prinzessin Esterh√°zy von Gal√°ntha (Vienna, 31 January 1788 ‚Äì Liebeschitz, 6 September 1746), and had issue: * Prince Franz de Paula Joseph Aloys Crispin (Vienna, 26 October 1776 ‚Äì of wounds received in battle on 23 June in Brussels, 27 June 1794), unmarried and without issue. * Prince Aloys Gonzaga Joseph Franz de Paula Theodor (Vienna, 1 April 1780 ‚Äì Prague, 4 November 1833), unmarried and without issue.

She was known for her beauty, love affairs and unconventional behaviour. Early life She was the daughter of Count Pavel Martinovich Skavronsky, Chamberlain of the Royal Court and Minister Plenipotentiary to Naples, well known for his mental imbalance and extraordinary love of music, and Yekaterina von Engelhardt, niece and at the same time favorite of Prince Grigory Potemkin. She was educated at the court of the Empress Catherine II the Great and the Empress Maria Feodorovna, wife of her son Emperor Paul I; and later became a maid of honor for the Empress Maria. Marriage to Prince Bagration In 1800 the Paul I of Russia, who was well known for his caprices, found out that General Pyotr Bagration, a Prince of the Bagrationi dynasty, was secretly in love with Catherine. The Emperor often used to marry members of his court off to each other, and one day at the Palace of Gatchina he suddenly announced that it was his intention to attend the marriage of General Bagration and Countess Catherine Skavronskaya. The Countess was said to be in love with Count Peter von der Pahlen,Von der Pahlen was in disgrace at court at the time, having been relieved from the governorship of Livonia by the Emperor, although he would be reinstated in October. and even the prospective groom was shocked. Nobody however dared to argue with the monarch, and the wedding took place on 2 September in the chapel of the Gatchina Palace, near St. Petersburg. This is what General Louis Alexandre Andrault de Lang√©ron had to say about this union : \\"Bagration married the young niece of the great Prince Potemkin. This rich and lustrous partner did not suit him. Bagration was a mere soldier, with the tone and manners of one, and he was extremely ugly. His wife was as white as he was black, and she was as beautiful as an angel, bright, the liveliest of the beauties of St.Petersburg; she would not be happy with such a husband for long...\\".M√©moires in√©dits du marquis de Langeron : 1813, Bautzen-Dresden-Leipzig, in la Lecture R√©trospective, March‚ÄìApril 1896. The \\"Wandering Princess\\" Portrait by Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1820) Prince Klemens von Metternich. In the year 1805 the Princess finally broke up with her husband and went to Europe. The couple had no children. She traveled so extensively that she had a special carriage made, with an elegant ladder that allowed her to climb in and out of it comfortably. It had a bed inside, and all the luggage was placed on the outside. She called her carriage her dormez (–¥–æ—Ä–º–µ–∑) or 'sleeper'; this was the time when she came to be known as \\"the Wandering Princess\\". Prince Bagration called her back to Russia a number of times, and sent her so many letters that even her friends tried to persuade her to go; she remained abroad, however, using the excuse that she was sick and in need of medical treatment. In Europe Princess Bagration was a great success, and became well known in court circles. She became notorious everywhere and was called le Bel Ange Nu (\\"the beautiful nude angel\\")Originally by Prince Klemens von Metternich. because of her passion for revealing dresses, and Chatte Blanche (\\"the White Cat\\"), because of her unlimited sensuality. Lord Palmerston noted in his memoirs that the Princess only wore translucent Indian muslin, which adhered closely to her figure. From her mother, however, she had inherited an angelic face, alabaster white skin, blue eyes, and a cascade of golden hair. Even when she was thirty it was said she still had the skin of a fifteen-year-old. Her husband the Prince, however, refused to hear a word said against her, insisting that the affairs of his household were his business alone; she was his wife and he would stand up for her. Her huge expenditure on receptions and clothes belied her claims of sickness, but he remained a generous husband and continued to pay her bills. The Prince even remonstrated with the Princess's mother, who had started to get irritated by her daughter's extravagance. In 1808, a military Order was awarded to the wives of those generals who had particularly distinguished themselves in the recent war. Princess Bagration was bypassed, and the pride of her husband was wounded. He argued that Ekaterina bore his name, and that was enough: \\"She should be rewarded, because she's my wife ...\\". The Prince paid thousands of roubles for debts Princess Catherine had accumulated from living in Vienna. There were rumors about her connection with the Saxon diplomat Count Friedrich von der Schulenberg, a Prince of W√ºrttemberg, Lord Charles Stewart and others. Goethe met her in Karlsbad, and admired her beauty; she had just started a new romance with Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, who ended his relationship with Princess Eleonore of Solms- Hohensolms-Lich for her. The Prince soon died in the Battle of Saalfeld, and the princess returned once more to Vienna. She then became the mistress of the very influential Prince Klemens von Metternich and had a daughter by him in Vienna on 29 September 1810,See: Genealogy Page here. Other sources give the birth as having been in Dresden in 1803, but that was unlikely as she is said to have lived in St. Petersburg for five years with her husband. whom she named Marie-Clementine after the father, who officially acknowledged his paternity. The daughter even lived with the Metternich family from 1814 until getting married.Stella K. Hershan: Der nackte Engel, Fritz Molden Verlag, M√ºnchen (1972) Life in Vienna Princess Catherine was an extremely emancipated lady for her age, and played like a man, choosing for herself which man to take as lovers, and which as just friends. After travelling for many years between one European capital and another, she settled in Vienna. Based there the Princess made her home into one of the most brilliant salons of society, a distinctly pro-Russian, anti-Napoleonic salon.Curiously von Metternich had an affair with the Duchesse de Sagan, Napol√©on's sister Caroline, the wife of Murat; her rivalry with Metternich's new mistress, was said to have afforded him much amusement, and this may have influenced her alliances. The Princess set up a covert diplomatic post without any official authorization. Her salon was constantly filled with the rich and famous. She maintained a friendship with Goethe and corresponded with him and Bulgakov. She boasted that she knew more political secrets than all the envoys put together. Under her influence, Austrian high society began to boycott the French Embassy. Napol√©on found her to be a serious political opponent. As a result of her closeness to Prince von Metternich, she was later able to persuade him to let Austria join the anti-Napoleonic coalition. Death of Prince Bagration Prince Bagration, despite his age, continued to fight for Russia in the Napoleonic War. Finally, at the Battle of Borodino on 26 August 1812, he was mortally wounded in the leg; he developed gangrene due to lack of treatment, and finally died sixteen days later on 12 September. Shortly before he died he had commissioned two portraits from Volkov, one of himself and the other of his wife. After his death his effects were carefully searched; the sister of Alexander I, Catherine (Ekaterina) Pavlovna had been passionately in love with Prince Bagration, even Napol√©on had proposed to her, but she refused because of her love for the Prince. He had refused her advances because he still adored his wife Catherine, and she quickly married her first cousin Wilhelm, later to become King William (Wilhelm) I of W√ºrttemberg. Her compromising letters were discovered among his papers, along with an oval miniature of his true love, Catherine. The End of the Napoleonic War In 1815 the Princess Catherine greeted the victory of the Russian army over Napol√©on, and during the Congress of Vienna she held a grand ball in honor of the Russian emperor Alexander I. She was not only his intimate friend but during, and after the war, she constantly supplied the Russian Emperor with information about the political mood in Europe. In the same year she moved to Paris, where the secret police kept her luxurious mansion at number 45 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√© under surveillance. Informants hired to follow the princess constantly sent them reports. One informant wrote: \\"This lady is very well known in high society due to her political influence and coquetry. On Monday night, quite late, two Poles left her, and one of them, Count Stanislas PotockiStanis≈Çaw (Stanis≈Çawowicz) Potocki, a relation by marriage of Princess Catherine. returned. Such antics are frequent. .. the Duchess is very fickle. \\" She counted many Parisian celebrities among her close friends: Stendhal, Benjamin Constant, the Marquis de Custine, even the Queen of Greece. The Princess's cook for a time was Marie-Antoine Car√™me, the founder of Haute Cuisine.Jean-Robert Pitte, Professor Jody Gladding: French Gastronomy: The History and Geography of a Passion. Columbia University Press. The writer Balzac, despite his sloppy dress sense, had been a frequent visitor to Princess Catherine's salon in Vienna, amusing the ladies with his stories, so naturally when she moved to Paris he became one of her friends.Juanita Helm Floyd: Women in the Life of Balzac. Full text online.http://www.fullbooks.com/Women-in-the-Life-of-Balzac3.html Balzac mentions in one of his letters that she was one of the two women upon whom he based the character Feodora, heroine of his first novel 'La Peau de Chagrin'. Similarly Victor Hugo mentions her salon in Les Mis√©rables. Second marriage, separation and death The grave of Catherine Bagration In Paris on 18 January 1830 she married the British general and diplomat Sir John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden and Grimston; she was fifteen years his senior. For a while her married name became Caradoc. They had no children, and later broke up and filed for a formal separation.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959); vol. VI, pg. 595. By 1849 she was on the move again and visited London, apparently for the first time. Even in her old age, when her limbs could no longer support her, she would rest with great elegance and a suggestive manner. Princess Catherine was the heiress to the fabulous jewelry collection of her great uncle, and it is possible that her finances were flagging at the end of her life. She sold some items, including the famous \\"Potemkin Diamond\\", which was purchased by the Emperor Napol√©on III for his wife the Empress Eug√©nie, after whom it was subsequently named (See Empress Eug√©nie (diamond)). She finally died during a trip to Venice, on 2 June 1857, and was buried in the San Michele Cemetery, which is also the last resting place of Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Her white headstone bears the French inscription: Princesse Catherine Bagration D√©ced√©e √† Venise le II Juin MDCCCLVII (Princess Catherine Bagration, deceased in Venice 2 June 1857). Some sources give her date of death as 21 May,\\"The Complete Peerage ...\\", among other sources. but this is the Russian Old Style. Sales of jewelry The Empress Eug√©nie diamond, which she had sold to Napol√©on III, was taken to England when the now ex-Royal Family went into exile. When their finances became tight it was auctioned by Christies and bought by the then Gaekwad of Baroda, India, MalhƒÅr RƒÅo. It remained in the Gaekwad princely family for some time, but at some point was sold again, and now seems to be in private Russian hands. In 1978, the Duke of Westminster purchased a diamond and spinel tiara and matching set of jewels reported to have belonged to Catherine Bagration.http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/tiara-thursday- westminster-collection.html References Category:1783 births Category:1857 deaths Category:19th-century Russian people Category:Austrian salon-holders Category:Russian salon-holders Category:House of Mukhrani Category:Klemens von Metternich ","title":"Catherine Bagration"},{"id":"31688961","title":"List of airlines of Nicaragua"},{"id":"31688991","text":"Coronation Street is a British soap opera, initially produced by Granada Television. Created by writer Tony Warren, Coronation Street first broadcast on ITV on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters introduced in the show's twenty-ninth year, by order of first appearance. Harry Ashton Harry Ashton was an OAP who enquired about a vacancy for a paperboy at The Kabin in January 1988. Rita and Mavis tried to politely refuse but he had an answers for all of their concerns - he got up early every day to walk his loyal dog Jimmy, and he was obsessed with keeping fit. To prove he could manage the early hours, he volunteered for a trial run. Alan Bradley gave Harry the toughest round to test him, and he returned with the same enthusiasm despite a gang of kids pinching his flashlight (he'd got it back when Jimmy frightened them away). Rita and Mavis were impressed and he was taken on. While Harry insisted on being treated no differently from the other paperboys, Mavis gave him Priscilla Millbanks's round as it was the easiest. This didn't go down well with Priscilla and Wayne Pickles, who threatened to quit unless Harry was sacked as the job should go to a kid. Harry offered to resign, but Mavis instead called all parties to a meeting at Jim's Cafe where she got Wayne and Priscilla to agree to stay in exchange for reinstating their old rounds, and sharing Craig Atkinson's round between them while he was sick with a cold, but she made clear her feelings on their selfish, petty-mindedness. As Mavis had saved his job, Harry asked her out to dinner at a place in the Precinct. Mavis tried to refuse but he wheedled a yes out of her. The evening was made awkward by the fact that Mavis thought Harry was spending what little money he had on her and tried to cut costs by suggesting they split the bill (which he refused) and then ordering an omelette and water (which Harry asked was for religious reasons). Harry told Mavis that he'd taken early retirement from his position as Senior at the Rates Office as his wife was ill but she died six months later, and so a job delivering newspapers coupled with his pension suited him very well. A few days later, Mavis received a surprise visit from Harry's sister Muriel. Muriel was a spinster who, having lived with Harry since his wife's death, and been close to Harry since their parents' early deaths, was threatened by Mavis, and had come to the Kabin to inspect her. Muriel settled Mavis's worries about Harry's finances, telling her that Harry dabbled in stocks and shares but didn't give the impression of being wealthy as he didn't throw his money around. Muriel's motivation in visiting Mavis was obvious however, and Mavis was very embarrassed. Harry asked Mavis to take what Muriel said with a pinch of salt, but Mavis told him she wanted to keep things formal from now on. In April 1988, Harry and Mavis saw Cry Freedom at the pictures. Harry lived in Nelson Street. He told Rita that he knew of Len Fairclough as he did job as his neighbour's house a few years ago. Priscilla Millbanks Priscilla Millbanks was a young girl who delivered newspapers for The Kabin in 1988. Along with Wayne Pickles, Priscilla gave Rita Fairclough and Mavis Riley an ultimatum that newly appointed paper- pensioner Harry Ashton be sacked or they'd quit. Priscilla and Wayne thought the allowances made for Harry's age were unfair on them as Priscilla had been given a more difficult round so that Harry could have hers. Mavis called all parties to a meeting at Jim's Cafe where she got them to agree to stay in exchange for reinstating their old rounds and sharing Craig Atkinson's round between them while he was sick with a cold, but she made her feelings clear on their selfish, petty-mindedness. Later that year, when Wayne beat up Jason Stubbs for stealing his round (when in fact Wayne had been sacked for not showing up for work five times in one month), Priscilla warned Mavis that Wayne was planning to go on giving Jason a hard time. Priscilla had a sister, Cheryl, who was expecting a baby in 1988. Gina Seddon Gina Seddon made her first appearance on 14 March 1988. She was originally played by Julie Foy. On 15 March 2017, it was announced that the character would be reintroduced, with Connie Hyde taking over the role. Gina returned on 28 April 2017. Gina is the younger sister of Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). She comes to Weatherfield to lodge with Sally and her new husband, Kevin (Michael Le Vell). Gina has a one- night stand with Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) while dating Billy Wyatt (Fabian Cartwright), leading to a fight between Martin and Billy. When Gina and Sally's father Eddie dies, Gina inherits ¬£1,000 from his life insurance and leaves Weatherfield. When Sally is diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, she goes to stay with Gina for six months while she recovers from surgery. In 2017, Sally is targeted by an internet troll and resigns from the council. Sally's daughters, Rosie (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent), track down Leah Buckley (Molly McGlynn), believing she is the troll. Leah denies being the troll, but her stepmother is to blame and will get her to stop. After Sophie tells Rosie about Sally's state, Rosie goes to see Leah and is surprised to spot Gina, who turns out to be Leah's stepmother. Rosie confronts Leah and demands to know if Gina is the troll. Leah explains that Gina has ill and has become bitter towards Sally, as she was there for her when she was ill, but Sally hasn't done the same for Gina. Rosie threatens to report Gina to the police, but Leah counter-threatens to go to the papers about Sally neglecting Gina when she was ill. Rosie tells Sophie who the troll is and they both go to see Gina and Leah, where they learn Gina has bipolar disorder. When Gina goes missing, Rosie and Sophie help Leah find her and Gina turns up on the street. Gina wants to talk to Sally, but Leah bundles her into the car and drives off. Sally and her husband, Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) visit Gina and Leah and invite them to stay with them and Sally helps find a home for Gina and Leah. Sally is upset when Gina confesses that she was responsible for trolling her. Leah makes plans to go to France with a friend and Tim overhears Leah on the phone, saying how Sally can look after Gina and Tim works out Leah was the troll and Gina goes missing. Gina is later found and Leah is kicked out and leaves for France. Gina and Sally reunite their sisterhood and Gina begins to live with Sally. Gina starts a romantic relationship with Dev and moves in with him and starts working part time at his shop. She also gets employed to work as a machinist at Underworld with her sister Sally. Dev and Gina later end their relationship after a few months of dating due to Dev thinking the worst of Gina and her medicine not begin taken right. She moves back in with Sally but Sally is later framed for crimes she didn't commit and sentenced to 4 years in prison. While Tim and Gina try finding evidence that Sally is innocent, Gina finds that she has strong feelings for Tim and later sleeps with him while he's drunk. Tim then gets angry and kicks her out. Gina then starts a friendship with Kevin Webster who later agrees that Gina can move in at his. After Sally finds out that Gina tried to destroy her marriage, she doesn't take it well and tells Gina she means nothing to her. When evidence of Sally's innocence is discovered she is released from prison, Gina then tries to make bonds with her sister again but Sally refuses. Gina then wants to leave Weatherfield after being blamed for taking Sophie's money which Kevin actually took for a holiday. He later begs her to stay which she decides to do. When Underworld is closed down by manager Carla Connor, Gina and her fellow colleagues protest to get their jobs back. While Gina and Sally are up on the roof putting up posters they later begin to argue. Gina later offers her hand to Sally after she falls back but the Underworld roof has actually collapsed leaving Sally falling in the debris with Gina just missing getting trapped under. She and some neighbours from the street later try saving the people inside. When Gina and the paramedics save Sally, she is taken to hospital but Tim refuses that Gina goes with them in the ambulance and later starts helping out the casualties as they came out the rubble of the destroyed factory. A few days after the tragic event Gina tells Sally that Rana Habeeb was killed in the factory collapse leaving Sally shocked and fearful of her injuries. Gina later begins to feel guilty and starts to question if she and Sally were responsible for the roof caving in. She is later told that the roof could hold around 20 people and that she and Sally weren't to blame for the roof as it was in fact sabotage. Gina then tells Kevin that she wants to leave for good because she doesn't think that her and Sally can sort things out even after a life or death situation. She later tells Tim that she is leaving but notices something odd about him and stops the cab she is alter in the check on him. She later finds Tim in a state and calls for an ambulance. Tim is later hospitalised and told that he had a mini heart attack. Sally later thanks Gina and after Tim is discharged from hospital he thanks her too. Before Gina leaves she works things out with Sally and Tim and later leaves the street. According to Kevin, Gina has gone to Liverpool for a fresh start. Sandra Stubbs Sandra Stubbs was cleaner and barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn from 1988 to 1989. Mother of thirteen-year- old Jason Stubbs, Sandra was fleeing from her abusive husband Ronnie when she started at the Rovers. When Social Services discovered she was leaving Jason on his own while she worked, Sandra had to quit the Rovers and move in with her mother. Jason Stubbs Jason Stubbs was the teenage son of Rovers Return cleaner Sandra Stubbs and her abusive husband Ronnie. In 1988, Sandra and Jason fled to Weatherfield to escape from Sandra's abusive husband Ronnie. Jason missed his dad but was loyal to Sandra, having tried to defend Sandra from his violence on at least one occasion. In November 1986, when it was feared that Ronnie was a danger to Jason, a social worker visited the Stubbs but found no cause to remove Jason from his parents. Sandra and Jason soon settled into their new lives; Sandra rented Flat 3, 44 Rosamund Street, got a job as the Rovers and settled Jason into a new school. Having had a paper round before moving, Jason asked at the Kabin if they needed anyone. They didn't, but the polite lad made an impression on Mavis Riley, who two days later decided to sack unreliable Wayne Pickles and give Jason his round. On his first day in the job, Jason was beaten up by Wayne for \\"stealing\\" the round, Wayne having guarded the round to see who had taken it over. Jason was intimidated enough to cover for Wayne, telling Rita and Mavis that he'd tripped over his bag strap, but the next time Wayne cornered him he fought back and knocked his bike over. The matter was resolved when Sandra got the truth from Jason and threatened Wayne's mum in the Kabin. A few weeks later, Ronnie re-appeared on the scene, having tracked Sandra and Jason down. Adamant that there was no way back for her and Ronnie, Sandra refused to acknowledge him, and so he turned to Jason, turning up at his school at lunchtime as a surprise. Although glad to see his dad, Jason refused to divulge their new home address, and Sandra arrived on the scene before Ronnie could interrogate him further. Ronnie remained in the area until he was due to return to the ships, working on Sandra and her friends to persuade her to give their marriage another try. The night before he was due to leave, a drunken Ronnie followed Sandra home, where he pleaded with her one last time. Met with unwavering defiance, Ronnie became violent, breaking a promise he'd made seconds before. Jason raced to the Rovers to get help, however by the time Ken Barlow, Kevin Webster and Alan Bradley arrived at the flat, Ronnie had fled the scene, leaving Sandra bruised and beaten. Upset to see his mother so vulnerable, Jason was taken in by Bet Gilroy at the Rovers for the night while Sandra was kept in hospital. In November, Jason admitted to Mavis that the paperboys were joking about Derek Wilton not showing up at their wedding. The lads were well aware of Mavis and Derek's disastrous first wedding, in which they'd jilted each other. Also that month, Jason told Rita that he wasn't looking forward to an upcoming parent/teacher evening at school, as he hadn't been doing the work. In 1989, Jason fell in with the wrong crowd and on one afternoon in February, while Sandra was at work, Ken Barlow caught Jason and his mates having a booze-up in the flat, drinking lager from cans purchased at the Corner Shop. The boys ran off at the sight of Ken, who had called at the flat to offer Jason a paper round with the Weatherfield Recorder. After helping Jason tidy the living room, Ken advised the boy to choose his friends better. The incident would remain a problem for Sandra and Jason to sort themselves, but for Jason's friends being caught by the police vandalising a car, and giving them Jason's address. Discovering both that Jason had been drinking and that he was routinely left on his own, WPC Morgan contacted Social Services, and a social worker, Mrs Lambert, was assigned the case. Sandra was informed that it was illegal for her to leave Jason on his own while she worked, and that something would have to change. With immediate effect, Sandra quit her job and moved out of the flat and in with her mother temporarily, uprooting the family once again.

Biography She was the eldest daughter of John and Anne Gaynor, of Athlone, County Roscommon. At the age of fifteen she moved with her family to Dublin where her education was completed. Two of her sisters, Anna and Marcella, became nuns with Religious Sisters of Charity. At twenty-five, she married the much older George Atkinson, a medical doctor and, with Sir John Gray, joint proprietor of the Freeman's Journal. They were both interested in art and Sarah accompanied her husband on many trips abroad, taking in the cultural centres of Europe. At home they made the acquaintance of prominent politicians, journalists and musicians. Regular guests at their house were Dr. John Shaw, editor of the Evening Mail, Rosa Mulholland and Katharine Tynan. The loss of her only child in his fourth year deeply affected Mrs. Atkinson and she threw herself into charitable and other good works. She moved with her husband to Drumcondra in Dublin, where she made the acquaintance of Mrs. Ellen Woodlock.Maria Luddy: Women and Philanthropy in Nineteenth-Century Ireland. Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 37, Ellen Woodlock, a sister of Francis Sylvester Mahony, was born in Cork in 1811 and had been married in 1830 and widowed quite young, just before the birth of her only son. Ellen was the sister in law of Rev. Dr. Bartholomew Woodlock, who was President of All Hallows College. She intended joining a religious community in France but after spending a few years in that country (with her son in a nearby school) returned to Cork and then moved to Dublin. At this time the post-famine city was inundated with poverty-stricken families and abandoned children. Fever and disease were rife, and the Poor Law of the day was insufficient to meet the needs of the starving population. Many evictions were taking place in deplorable circumstances, which forced the poor, however reluctantly, to seek refuge in the workhouses. The most vulnerable sections of the community were single women (including widows) and children. Ellen Woodlock was totally against placing children in workhouses and founded St. Joseph's Institute in 1855 to rescue girls from that situation. With her Mrs. Atkinson interested herself in the female paupers of the South Dublin Union. With much difficulty in the 1860s she gained permission for ladies like herself to enter and inspect the condition of young girls in the North and South Dublin Unions, after which she opened a better home to which many were transferred. She campaigned for years to improve the state of the workhouses and provide better conditions for the poverty- stricken. One of her sisters ran the Hospice for the Dying in Dublin, to which she donated funds. She helped Ellen Woodlock establish the Children's Hospital at 9 Buckingham Street in 1872, which later moved to Temple St., which she visited every day. Every week she visited hospitals and prisons, in the 1880s accompanying Katharine Tynan to visit the last of the Land Leaguers incarcerated in Kilmainham Gaol.Katherine Tynan, Memoirs, p. 108 From the 1850s Atkinson contributed a large number of historical and biographical articles and essays to several publications, including Duffy's Hibernian Magazine, The Month, The Nation and the Freeman's Journal. She later wrote for the Irish Monthly after it was established, and for the Irish Quarterly Review. Her Life of Mary Aikenhead was published in 1875 and was very well received. She followed this with biographies of the Irish sculptors John Henry Foley and John Hogan and also a life of Catherine of Siena. A collection of her essays, with a preface and biography by Rosa Mulholland, was published posthumously in 1895.Seamus Deane, Angela Bourke, Andrew Carpenter, Jonathan Williams.

W. and Weldon, E. J.: Error-correcting Codes. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1972 are error-correcting code that are used in arithmetic applications. Arithmetic codes were commonly used in computer processors to ensure the accuracy of its arithmetic operations when electronics were more unreliable. Arithmetic codes help the processor to detect when an error is made and correct it. Without these codes, processors would be unreliable since any errors would go undetected. AN codes are arithmetic codes that are named for the integers A and N that are used to encode and decode the codewords. These codes differ from most other codes in that they use arithmetic weight to maximize the arithmetic distance between codewords as opposed to the hamming weight and hamming distance. The arithmetic distance between two words is a measure of the number of errors made while computing an arithmetic operation. Using the arithmetic distance is necessary since one error in an arithmetic operation can cause a large hamming distance between the received answer and the correct answer. Arithmetic Weight and Distance The arithmetic weight of an integer x in base r is defined by :w(x) = \\\\min {t  x=\\\\sum_{i=1}^t a_i r^{n(i)}} where {a_i}< r, n(i) \\\\geq 0, and r, n(i) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}. The arithmetic distance of a word is upper bounded by its hamming weight since any integer can be represented by its standard polynomial form of x=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i r^i where the b_i are the digits in the integer. Removing all the terms where b_i = 0 will simulate a t equal to its hamming weight. The arithmetic weight will usually be less than the hamming weight since the a_i are allowed to be negative. For example, the integer x = 29 which is 11101 in binary has a hamming weight of 4. This is a quick upper bound on the arithmetic weight since x = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4. However, since the a_i can be negative, we can write x = 2^5 - 2^1 - 2^0 which makes the arithmetic weight equal to 3. The arithmetic distance between two integers is defined by :d(x,y) = w(x-y) This is one of the primary metrics used when analyzing arithmetic codes. AN Codes AN codes are defined by integers A and B and are used to encode integers from 0 to B-1 such that :C = { ANN\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\\\leq N <B } Each choice of A will result in a different code, while B serves as a limiting factor to ensure useful properties in the distance of the code. If B is too large, it could let a codeword with a very small arithmetic weight into the code which will degrade the distance of the entire code. To utilize these codes, before an arithmetic operation is performed on two integers, each integer is multiplied by A. Let the result of the operation on the codewords be R. Note that R must also be between 0 to B-1 for proper decoding. To decode, simply divide R/A. If A is not a factor of R, then at least one error has occurred and the most likely solution will be the codeword with the least arithmetic distance from R. As with codes using hamming distance, AN codes can correct up to \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{d-1}{2} \\\\rfloor errors where d is the distance of the code. For example, an AN code with A = 3, the operation of adding 15 and 16 will start by encoding both operands. This results in the operation R = 45 + 48 = 93. Then, to find the solution we divide 93/3 = 31. As long as B>31, this will be a possible operation under the code. Suppose an error occurs in each of the binary representation of the operands such that 45 = 101101 \\\\rightarrow 101111 and 48 = 110000 \\\\rightarrow 110001, then R = 101111 + 110001 = 1100000. Notice that since 93 = 1011101, the hamming weight between the received word and the correct solution is 5 after just 2 errors. To compute the arithmetic weight, we take 1100000 - 1011101 = 11 which can be represented as 11 = 2^0 + 2^1 or 11 = 2^2 - 2^0. In either case, the arithmetic distance is 2 as expected since this is the number of errors that were made. To correct this error, an algorithm would be used to compute the nearest codeword to the received word in terms of arithmetic distance. We will not describe the algorithms in detail. To ensure that the distance of the code will not be too small, we will define modular AN codes. A modular AN code C is a subgroup of \\\\mathbb{Z}/m \\\\mathbb{Z}, where m = AB. The codes are measured in terms of modular distance which is defined in terms of a graph with vertices being the elements of \\\\mathbb{Z}/m \\\\mathbb{Z}. Two vertices x \\\\pmod{m} and x' \\\\pmod{m} are connected iff :x - x' \\\\equiv \\\\pm c \\\\cdot r^j \\\\pmod{m} where c,j \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} and 0 < c < r, j \\\\geq 0. Then the modular distance between two words is the length of the shortest path between their nodes in the graph. The modular weight of a word is its distance from 0 which is equal to :w_m(x) = min{w(y)y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, y \\\\equiv x \\\\pmod{m} } In practice, the value of m is typically chosen such that m=r^n -1 since most computer arithmetic is computed \\\\mod 2^n-1 so there is no additional loss of data due to the code going out of bounds since the computer will also be out of bounds. Choosing m=r^n-1 also tends to result in codes with larger distances than other codes. By using modular weight with m=r^n-1, the AN codes will be cyclic code. definition: A cyclic AN code is a code C that is a subgroup of [r^n-1], where [r^n-1] = {0,1,2,\\\\dots,r^n-1}. A cyclic AN code is a principal ideal of the ring [r^n-1]. There are integers A and B where AB = r^n-1 and A,B satisfy the definition of an AN code. Cyclic AN codes are a subset of cyclic codes and have the same properties. Mandelbaum-Barrows Codes The Mandelbaum-Barrows Codes are a type of cyclic AN codes introduced by D. Mandelbaum and J. T. Barrows.Massey, J. L. and Garcia, O. N.: Error- correcting codes in computer arithmetic. In: Advances in Information Systems Science, Vol. 4, Ch. 5. (Edited by J. T. Ton). New York: Plenum Press, 1972J.H. Van Lint (1982). Introduction to Coding Theory. GTM. 86. New York: Springer-Verlag. These codes are created by choosing B to be a prime number that does not divide r such that \\\\mathbb{Z}/B\\\\mathbb{Z} is generated by r and -1, and m=r^n-1. Let n be a positive integer where r^n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{B} and A = (r^n -1)/B. For example, choosing r=2, B=5, n=4, and A= (r^n-1)/B = 3 the result will be a Mandelbaum-Barrows Code such that C = { 3NN\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\\\leq N <5 } in base 2. To analyze the distance of the Mandelbaum-Barrows Codes, we will need the following theorem. theorem: Let C \\\\subset [r^n - 1] be a cyclic AN code with generator A, and :B = C = (r^n - 1)/A Then, :\\\\sum_{x \\\\in C} w_m(x) = n(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{rB}{r+1}\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{B}{r+1}\\\\rfloor) proof: Assume that each x \\\\in C has a unique cyclic NAFClark, W. E. and Liang, J. J.: On modular weight and cyclic nonadjacent forms for arithmetic codes. IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 20 pp. 767-770(1974) representation which is :x \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_{i,x}r^i \\\\pmod{r^n -1} We define an n \\\\times B matrix with elements c_{i,x} where 0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-1 and x \\\\in C. This matrix is essentially a list of all the codewords in C where each column is a codeword. Since C is cyclic, each column of the matrix has the same number of zeros. We must now calculate n{ x \\\\in C  c_{n-1,x} eq 0}, which is n times the number of codewords that don't end with a 0. As a property of being in cyclic NAF, c_{n-1,x} eq 0 iff there is a y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} with y \\\\equiv x \\\\pmod{ r^n -1}, \\\\frac{m}{r+1}<y \\\\leq \\\\frac{mr}{r+1}. Since x = AN \\\\pmod{r^n-1} with 0 \\\\leq N<B, then \\\\frac{B}{r+1}<N \\\\leq \\\\frac{Br}{r+1}. Then the number of integers that have a zero as their last bit are \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{rB}{r+1}\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{B}{r+1}\\\\rfloor. Multiplying this by the n characters in the codewords gives us a sum of the weights of the codewords of n(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{rB}{r+1}\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{B}{r+1}\\\\rfloor) as desired. We will now use the previous theorem to show that the Mandelbaum- Barrows Codes are equidistant (which means that every pair of codewords have the same distance), with a distance of :\\\\frac{n}{B-1}(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{rB}{r+1}\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{B}{r+1}\\\\rfloor) proof: Let x \\\\in C, x eq 0, then x = AN \\\\pmod{r^n-1} and N is not divisible by B. This implies there \\\\exists j (N \\\\equiv \\\\pm r^j \\\\pmod{B}). Then w_m(x) = w_m(\\\\pm r^j A) = w_m(A). This proves that C is equidistant since all codewords have the same weight as A. Since all codewords have the same weight, and by the previous theorem we know the total weight of all codewords, the distance of the code is found by dividing the total weight by the number of codewords (excluding 0).

After being drafted by the Royals in 2007, Duffy spent the next several years in the Royals' minor league system, and represented the team in the 2009 All- Star Futures Game. However, personal issues led Duffy to temporarily retire from baseball in 2010, although he returned to the Royals to make his MLB debut in 2011. After his rookie season, Duffy did not pitch in the MLB on a regular basis again until 2014. Duffy was a member of the Royal's pitching staffs during the team's successful 2014 and 2015 seasons, and won the World Series championship with the Royals in 2015. Duffy had a career year in 2016, setting career highs in many statistical categories. After the 2016 season, Duffy signed a $65 million extension to remain with the Royals and has remained a regular starting pitcher. Early life Duffy was born on December 21, 1988 in Goleta, California. He was exposed to the game of baseball at an early age, both through playing competitively in local youth leagues and practicing with his family. He attended Cabrillo High School in Vandenberg Village, California, where he played both baseball and basketball. For the baseball team, Duffy had a 5‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record, a 0.60 earned run average, and 127 strikeouts in innings pitched in his senior year. Professional career=Minor leagues The Kansas City Royals drafted Duffy in the third round of the 2007 MLB draft out of high school. He began his professional career that season with the Arizona Royals of the rookie-level Arizona League, where he pitched in 11 games and had a 1.45 earned run average (ERA). Duffy with the Royals in 2011 The Royals promoted Duffy to Burlington Bees of the Class-A Midwest League in 2008, where he had an 8‚Äì4 record and a 2.20 ERA in 17 starts. He was named Burlington's Pitcher of the Year. In 2009, Duffy started 24 games for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class-A Advanced Carolina League. He was named a Carolina League All-Star, and finished the season with a 9‚Äì3 record and a 2.98 ERA. Duffy represented the Royals in the 2009 All-Star Futures Game, where he pitched scoreless innings. The Royals invited Duffy to spring training in 2010. However, Duffy abruptly retired from baseball in March 2010, at the age of 21. He informed the Royals' organization that he wanted to \\"reassess his life priorities\\". The move reminded many of Zack Greinke's departure from the Royals' camp in 2006. Realizing that he missed the game of baseball, Duffy decided to unretire and return to the Royals in June, showing up at the extended spring training in Surprise, Arizona. Later that season, Duffy pitched for Wilmington, the Idaho Falls Chukars of the rookie-level Pioneer League, and Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Class AA Texas League. Duffy went 5‚Äì2 with a 2.95 ERA in seven regular-season starts for the Naturals, and 1‚Äì0 with a 1.69 ERA in two playoff games, as the Naturals won the Texas League championship. He pitched in the Arizona Fall League after the season. Heading into the 2011 season, Baseball America rated Duffy as the 68th best prospect in baseball. The Royals again invited Duffy to spring training. Duffy began the 2011 season with the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League . With Omaha, Duffy was named Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week for the week of April 25 ‚Äì May 1. Duffy pitched to a 3‚Äì1 record and 3.00 ERA in seven starts for Omaha, recording 43 strikeouts while only walking 10 and allowing 30 hits in 36 innings. Kansas City Royals2011‚Äì2015= The Royals promoted Duffy to the MLB, and he made his MLB debut on May 18, 2011.Duffy to get Wednesday start against Texas MLB.com, May 17, 2011 He gave up two runs in four innings; he did not earn the decision in a 5‚Äì4 loss to the Texas Rangers. He recorded his first MLB win on June 14, pitching six innings against the Oakland Athletics. Duffy finished the 2011 season with a 4‚Äì8 record and 5.64 ERA in 20 MLB starts. After signing a contract for $487,750 prior to the 2012 season, Duffy competed for, and won, a spot in the starting rotation during spring training. Duffy made six starts in 2012 before suffering a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow that required Tommy John surgery on June 13, 2012. Prior to being sidelined, Duffy had a 2‚Äì2 record with an ERA of 3.90. On November 2, 2012, the Royals reinstated Duffy from the 60-day disabled list; however, he was not expected to return to pitching for the Royals until late June or early July. Duffy signed a one-year $505,125 contract on February 20, 2013. On May 26, 2013, Duffy began a rehab assignment with the Northwest Arkansas Naturals. While still undergoing rehab from his injury, Duffy was reassigned to the Omaha Storm Chasers (a higher level minor league affiliate than the Naturals) on June 6. He was optioned to Omaha at the end of the rehab period on June 25. Duffy was recalled from Omaha on August 7, and returned on August 8. He was recalled on August 16 to start the first game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, in a game the Royals went on to win. On March 2, 2014, Duffy signed a one-year $526,000 contract. During spring training in 2014, Yordano Ventura won the final spot in the Royals' starting rotation over Duffy. However, when Bruce Chen went down with a back injury early in the season, Duffy took over his spot in the rotation. He posted a 9‚Äì12 record with a 2.53 ERA over innings. Duffy pitched to a 4.08 ERA during the 2015 season. In September, Duffy was moved from the starting rotation to the bullpen. In the 2015 World Series, Duffy made three relief appearances as the Royals defeated the New York Mets in five games to win the World Series championship. =2016‚Äìpresent= Duffy signed a one-year, $4.225 million contract with the Royals for the upcoming 2016 season. He began the season as a relief pitcher, but rejoined the Royals' starting rotation in May. Duffy responded to the move out of the bullpen with a strong season, setting a career high in wins with a 12‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record. On August 1, 2016, Duffy set the Royals' record for most strikeouts in a single game with a 16-strikeout performance against the Tampa Bay Rays. In that game, Duffy carried a no-hitter into the eighth, losing it on a leadoff double by Desmond Jennings of the Tampa Bay Rays. On August 11, Duffy pitched all nine innings in a game against the Chicago White Sox for his first career complete game. Duffy was considered to be a contender for the American League Cy Young Award, the annual award given to the best pitcher in each league, although Duffy ultimately received no votes for that award. Besides his career-high 12 wins, Duffy pitched to a 3.51 ERA and increased his strikeouts per 9 innings pitched ratio to 9.4. He had the highest zone percentage of all major league pitchers, with 49.8% of his pitches being in the strike zone. On January 16, 2017, Duffy signed a five-year contract extension with the Royals worth $65 million. On April 3, 2017, Duffy was the Royals' Opening Day starter against the Minnesota Twins. He pitched six innings, throwing eight strikeouts, allowing three hits and three walks. Despite hopes that Duffy could build upon the momentum from his 2016 season, multiple injuries limited his playing time. On May 30, Duffy was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a Grade 1 oblique strain. On August 26, Duffy was again placed on the 10-day disabled list, this time due to left elbow impingement. He finished the regular season in 2017 with a 9‚Äì10 record and an era of 3.81. He pitched innings in 24 games at the major league level, all as a starter. In the offseason before the 2018 season, Duffy was widely rumored to be a potential trade piece, leading Duffy to post on Twitter \\"bury me a Royal\\" to signal his opposition to being traded. Duffy had a poor start to the 2018 season, but finished with a respectable 8‚Äì12 record and 4.88 ERA over 28 starts. He also finished second in the American League in wild pitches and 7th in walks allowed, indicating struggles with his command. Heading into the 2019 season, Duffy was viewed as a potential \\"building block\\" for the Royals' pitching staff. However, left shoulder tightness led to Duffy beginning the season on the injured list. He was activated on April 26th. After returning, Duffy was a consistent starter in the Royals' rotation, and pitched a season- high 8 innings against the Minnesota Twins on June 22. He made another appearance on the injured list in August with a strained hamstring. This injury sidelined Duffy for about a month, although he returned in September, starting five games and winning two of them. Duffy ended the season with a 7‚Äì6 record, a 4.34 ERA, and 115 strikeouts in innings. With the 2020 Kansas City Royals, Duffy appeared in 12 games, compiling a 4-4 record with 4.95 ERA and 57 strikeouts in 56.1 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/danny- duffy-518633 International career Duffy was a member of the United States national baseball team in the Pan American Games Qualifying Tournament, in the 2010‚Äì11 offseason, along with future Royals teammates Mike Moustakas and Eric Hosmer. Duffy also represented the United States as a member of the national team competing at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, an international tournament. Duffy's performance included wins against the national teams of Canada and the Dominican Republic. The United States' team went on to win the tournament. Personal life His father, Dan, is an investigator for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. His mother, Deanna, worked as a California Highway Patrol officer. She played softball, and throws batting practice for Danny. He is married to Sara Mouzabi. https://www.playersgf.com/2017/11/danny-duffy-and-his-stunning-wife-sara- mouzabi-family-bio.html?m=1 On August 27, 2017, Duffy was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol after passing out in the drive-thru of a Burger King in Overland Park, Kansas. At the time of his arrest, he was on the disabled list due to his elbow injury and was not traveling with the Royals. He entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to one year of probation in January 2018. Duffy has been open about his struggles with depression (which had forced his temporary retirement in 2010), and has been outspoken about the need for better mental health support in professional sports.

History Founded in 1896 by Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Agudath Achim services were held in various rented halls in downtown Ashland for many years. In the early twentieth century, many began to actively prefer Reform Judaism to Orthodoxy; as early as 1915 biweekly Reform services were conducted by a student rabbi from Hebrew Union College, and in 1921 the congregation joined the Reform movement. This change was not uncontested; the move led to the secession of some members, who founded a new synagogue, the House of Israel. Around this same time, Agudath Achim became a member of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.Jewish communities on the Ohio River: a history by Amy Hill ShevitzJewish life in small-town America: a history by Lee Shai WeissbachKentucky, Jewish Virtual Library It was not until 1938 that a temple was completed and dedicated, at 2411 Montgomery Avenue in Ashland.

Born in Oola, County Limerick, Stokes first played competitive hurling whilst at school in Doon CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene as a dual player with the Limerick minor hurling and football teams. He made his senior hurling debut in the 1940 championship. Stokes went on to play a key part for Limerick and won one All-Ireland medal, one Munster medal and one National Hurling League medal. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, Stokes won five Railway Cup medals. At club level he won two hurling championship medals and one football championship medal with University College Dublin. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1953 championship. In retirement from playing, Stokes became involved in team management and coaching. As selector to the Limerick senior team, he helped guide the team to the All-Ireland title in 1973. Playing career=Colleges Stokes first played in goal for the Doon CBS secondary school team in the Dr. Harty Cup. In 1938 he was moved to midfield and was a reserve on the Munster colleges team. The following year Stokes partnered Vin Baston at midfield in the All-Ireland colleges decider and played a key part in bringing the title back to Munster. University During his studies at University College Dublin, Stokes was a star on both the university's hurling and football teams. He first enjoyed success on the hurling field in 1941. A 2-8 to 2-4 defeat of University College Galway and a 7-10 to 3-1 win over University College Cork gave Stokes his first Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Three years later in 1944, UCD made a clean sweep of the series once again, giving Stokes, who was now captain of the team, a second Fitzgibbon Cup medal. In 1945 Stokes was named at full-forward on the UCD football team. A 3-8 to 0-2 defeat of UCC gave him a Sigerson Cup medal. Club Stokes began his playing career with Pallasgreen, however, it was as a dual player with University College Dublin in the Dublin county championships that he enjoyed his greatest successes. In 1943 UCD's senior football team reached the final of the county club championship. A 1-8 to 1-6 defeat of Se√°n McDermott's gave Stokes a Dublin Senior Football Championship medal. Four years later in 1947, Stokes was on the UCD hurling team lined out against Faughs in the county decider. A 6-12 to 4-9 of the hurling kingpins of Dublin, gave Stokes a championship medal in the small ball code. UC retained the title the following year. Inter-county Stokes first appeared on the inter-county scene as a dual player at minor level, however, he enjoyed little success. In 1940 Stokes made his senior debut with the Limerick senior hurling team in a tournament game against Cork. He was subsequently included on the Limerick championship team, and made his debut in a drawn Munster semi-final against Waterford. It took two late goals from Jackie Power and a storming display by Mick Mackey to level the game. Another late rally gave Limerick a victory in the subsequent replay. Stokes's side put in another excellent performance in the Munster final to draw the game with Cork. At half-time in the replay Limerick looked like a spent force. Held scoreless for the entire thirty minutes, team captain Mick Mackey got the recovery underway in the second-half with a point from a seventy. He later moved back to the defence where Cork were running riot with goals. A pitch invasion scuppered the game for ten minutes, however, Limerick held on to win by 3-3 to 2-4 and Stoke collected a Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1940 brought Kilkenny and Limerick together for the last great game between the two outstanding teams of the decade. Early in the second-half Kilkenny took a four-point lead, however, once Mick Mackey was deployed at midfield he proceeded to dominate the game. Limerick hung on to win the game on a score line of 3-7 to 1-7. The win gave Stoke an All-Ireland medal. Limerick took a back seat to Cork and Tipperary in the Munster series of games for the next few years. In 1947 Stoke won a National Hurling League medal as Limerick defeated old rivals Kilkenny by 3-8 to 1-7 following an earlier drawn game. Stokes also lined out with the Limerick junior football team. In 1950 he won a Munster medal following a 3-6 to 1-6 defeat of Cork.

Unlike what the name may imply, the series spotlighted popular music played on Top 40 radio stations of the mid-to-late-1960s. Much like Time-Life's other series chronicling popular music, volumes in the \\"Classic Rock\\" series covered a specific time period, including single years in some volumes and stylistic trends in others. Each volume was issued on a compact disc, cassette or (on volumes issued through 1990) 2-LP vinyl record set. Individual volumes generally contained 22 tracks, and represented the highlighted time period's most popular and noteworthy tracks. Also included was a booklet, containing liner notes written by some of the most respected historians of the genre, photographs of the artists, and information on the songs (writers, performers and peak position on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart). History \\"Classic Rock\\" was first issued in the winter of 1988, with the first volume in the series titled Classic Rock: 1965. Like most compilation albums, songs by two of the era's most successful groups ‚Äì The Beatles and The Rolling Stones ‚Äì were not included due to licensing issues; however, several albums had cover art with drawings of male rock singers resembling The Beatles. As was the case with Time-Life's other series, \\"Classic Rock\\" was advertised in television and magazine advertisements. The series was available by subscription (by calling a 1-800 number); those who purchased the series in that fashion received a new volume roughly every other month (on the format of their choice), and had the option of keeping the volumes they wanted. Each volume was also offered for individual sale. When the series was fully issued, a customer could purchase the entire series at once (or a group of albums, as packaged by Time-Life as part of a promotion), often at a discounted price. New volumes continued to be issued through 1991, the final one being a volume titled Classic Rock: Rock Renaissance IV (an album of hard rock from the mid- to late-1960s). An additional volume, titled Totally Fantastic '60s, was released in 1996. Time-Life continued to offer \\"Classic Rock\\" through the early-2000s (decade), after which it was replaced by other series.

In 2011, he was named a Guggenheim Fellow. Background Ross graduated from University of California, Berkeley, with a B.A. in mathematics and M.A. in Sculpture in 1962.Klaus OTTMANN (2013). \\"Lightness of Being: The Art of Charles Ross\\" in Substance of Light, Santa Fe: Radius Books, 13. Ross is creating - in New Mexico's \\"Chupinas Mesa\\" - an earthwork known as Star Axis, which is a naked eye observatory and architectonic sculpture. Star Axis's geometry is derived from the shifting relationship of earth to the sun and the north star.NY Times, Susan Karlin, A Sculptor Works up an Expos√© of the Stars Secrets Star Axis was begun in 1971. The Star Tunnel is the central element of Star Axis. It frames our north star, Polaris. The Star Tunnel is precisely aligned with the earth's axis. Within it a stairway rises 10 stories toward a circular opening at the top that frames all of the orbits of Polaris throughout the ages. As you climb the stairway toward the circular opening you see larger and larger views of the sky. The view from each stair frames an orbit of Polaris for a particular time in the 26,000 year cycle called precession. The smallest orbit of Polaris, viewed from the bottom stair, is about the size of a dime held at arm's length. The largest orbit of Polaris, viewed from the top stair, encompasses your entire field of vision.Klaus OTTMANN (2013). \\"Lightness of Being: The Art of Charles Ross\\" in Substance of Light, Santa Fe: Radius Books, 27. In 1965, Ross began creating prism sculptures‚Äîminimal geometrical objects as perceptual vessels that alter the perception of the environments that surround them. In 1980, he created his first site specific solar spectrum installation. These permanent environmental color and light installations are created by mounting large scale prisms in skylights and windows that project huge spectrums into the architecture. In 1992, Ross designed the prisms in the Harvard Business School's The Class of 1959 Chapel for architect Moshe Safdie. In 1996, he created a solar spectrum environment for the Dwan Light Sanctuary at the United World College in Montezuma, New Mexico. This installation includes 24 prisms mounted in two apses and four skylights so that there is solar spectrum in the sanctuary from sunrise to sunset every day. He has also created permanent solar spectrum installations in more than 20 other locations including Saitama University Medical School near Tokyo in 1999.Klaus OTTMANN (2013). \\"Lightness of Being: The Art of Charles Ross\\" in Substance of Light, Santa Fe: Radius Books, 20-21. In 2003, Ross designed a solar spectrum environment for the National Museum of the American Indian as a reflection of the Native American relationship with light and cosmology. Ross was included in the 2015 film Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art.

AW.27 Ensign G-ADTC in typical 1940 NAC markings Pre-war preparations During the 1930s, and up to 1938, the British government progressively implemented the recommendations of the Maybury Committee Report and related later reports, by organising and installing air traffic control, weather reporting, navigation and radio systems for civilian aviation. In 1938, the Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) was set up by the Air Navigation (Licensing of Public Transport) Order 1938, under the Air Navigation Act 1936 (s.5). Chaired by Trustam Eve, the ATLA issued provisional licences to airports and to air transport companies operating regular services, throughout 1938 and 1939. Licensing, and some subsidising of services, was conditional on agreements that commercial aircraft fleets would be made available to the government in a national emergency. In parallel, the Civil Air Guard scheme of 1938 provided subsidised pilot training in return for future military call-up commitments. At that time, the Air Ministry, headed by Secretary of State for Air, Sir Kingsley Wood, was responsible for both military and civil aviation, and the Director-General of Civil Aviation was Sir Francis Shelmerdine. Activation and dispersal On 29 August 1939, prior to the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, the British government started to implement the Air Navigation (Restriction in Time of War) Order 1939. That ordered military takeover of most civilian airfields in the UK, cessation of all private flying without individual flight permits, and other emergency measures. It was administered by a statutory department of the Air Ministry titled National Air Communications (NAC). On 31 August 1939, all flights to mainland Europe were briefly suspended, later reinstated under the organisation of NAC. By 1 September 1939, most of the aircraft and facilities of British Airways Ltd (BAL) were transferred from Heston Airport to Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport, and to Exeter Airport. Similarly, landplanes of Imperial Airways were transferred from Croydon Airport to Whitchurch, while others were temporarily dispersed to Coventry (Baginton) Airport and Exeter Airport. Imperial Airways' flying boats were transferred from Southampton marine aerodrome to Poole Harbour, Dorset. All the usable fleets of private air transport companies were dispersed: *Air Commerce Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man. *Air Dispatch Ltd, from Croydon Airport to RAF Pengam Moors Aerodrome, Cardiff. *Air Taxis Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Barton Aerodrome, Manchester *Allied Airways (Gandar Dower) Ltd, at Aberdeen (Dyce) Airport. *Birkett Air Service Ltd, from Heston Airport to Liverpool (Speke) Airport. *British-American Air Services Ltd, from Heston Airport to Liverpool (Speke) Airport. *Great Western & Southern Air Lines Ltd, from Land's End Airport to Liverpool (Speke) Airport. *Isle of Man Air Services Ltd, at Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man. *Jersey Airways Ltd, at Jersey Airport. *North Eastern Airways Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Liverpool (Speke) Airport. *Olley Air Service Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man. *Personal Airways Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Manchester (Barton) Aerodrome. *Portsmouth, Southsea & Isle of Wight Aviation Ltd, from Portsmouth Airport to Cardiff (Pengam Moors) Aerodrome. *Railway Air Services Ltd, from Glasgow (Renfrew) Airport to Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport. *Scottish Airways Ltd, at Glasgow (Renfrew) Airport. *Surrey Flying Services Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Weston-super-Mare Airport. *Western Airways Ltd, at Weston- super-Mare Airport. *Wrightways Ltd, from Croydon Airport to Manchester (Barton) Aerodrome. Other aircraft were incorporated into the above fleets from Anglo-European Airways Ltd, Commercial Air Hire Ltd, Guernsey Airways Ltd, International Air Freight Ltd, Mutual Finance Ltd, Southern Airways Ltd, West Coast Air Services Ltd, plus several from the Air Ministry, flying clubs and private owners. Camouflage was applied to some aircraft immediately, others later or not at all. Most NAC aircraft progressively carried civilian registrations underlined in red, white and blue, plus RAF-style marks on fins and elsewhere, particularly for overseas flights. Operations From its headquarters at Whitchurch, NAC directed operations of the fleets of Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd, to support the transportation of military personnel and supplies to France, and to continue basic overseas civilian services. The fleets operated by the smaller private companies were also directed by NAC, and variously used to maintain essential civilian services within the UK, but also for army co-operation duties and transportation of blood supplies, particularly to France. On 1 April 1940, British Airways Ltd and Imperial Airways Ltd were officially combined into a new company, BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation), that had already been formed on 24 November 1939 with retrospective financial arrangements. On 27 March, it was announced that many of the non-scheduled functions of NAC would be taken over by the RAF. Associated Airways Joint Committee Following the fall of France (22 June 1940), on 27 June 1940, NAC was replaced by a new organisation, the Associated Airways Joint Committee (AAJC), chaired by Sir Harold Hartley. By then, BOAC separately administered overseas flights, such as to non-aligned and neutral nations. The AAJC, from its base at Liverpool (Speke) Airport, took direct control of most of the private air transport operators. From early 1940, about 950 private aircraft, including most of the former NAC fleet, were eventually impressed into RAF service, and suitably militarised as required. No. 24 Squadron RAF was a major recipient and operator of miscellaneous impressed aircraft.

The Academia Pernambucana de Letras (Pernambuco Academy of Letters) is a Brazilian literary society established in the manner of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, on January 26, 1901, in Recife by Carneiro Vilela and other writers from the state of Pernambuco, with a total of 20 seats. One of the first letters academies of Brazil, being surpassed only by Academia Cearense de Letras, by Academia Brasileira de Letras and Academia Paraense de Letras.  History  At the end of the 19th century, some intellectuals in Recife were considering the creation of a new literary academy, which had the name Academia Pernambucana de Letras. Jos√© Isidoro Martins J√∫nior, Artur da Silva Orlando, Eduardo de Carvalho and Thiago Joaquim da Fonseca addressed an invitation to Carneiro Vilela to join the new institution, which he refused, as he explained in a note in the newspaper Province. The same Carneiro Vilela, however, was part of a group of intellectuals who founded the Academy in 1901. On December 28, 1900, a note about the imminent installation of an academia appeared in the Jornal do Recife and Diario de Pernambuco. On 14 January 1901, there was a preparatory session for the installation of the Academy, with the approval of the Organic Law and choice of patrons of the twenty seats that would compose. A formal ceremony took place on January 26, with a speech by Carlos Porto Carreiro. The Academy had been dissolved in 1910, to be reorganized in 1920. In 1921, the number of seats was increased to 30. In 1960 was increased to 40, which is the current number. The Academy is headed by Waldenio Porto, whose term ends on February 26, 2012, when the academic Fatima Quintas will assume the post, for which she was nominated by acclamation of academic writers.

The purpose is to protect electronics against moisture, dust dirt and vibration. Low Pressure Molding is also used for sealing connectors and molding grommets and strain reliefs. Key to this process are the raw materials and specialized molding equipment. Dimer acid based polyamide materials, better known as hot-melts, are used as molding compounds. They are thermoplastics i.e. the material, when heated, becomes less viscous and is able to be re-shaped, then hardens to keep the desired form upon cooling down. These polyamide materials differ from other thermoplastics in two main areas: One: Viscosity: At processing temperature (410F/210C) the viscosity is very low, typically around 3,000 centipoise (similar to pancake syrup). Low viscosity materials require low injection pressure in order to inject into a cavity. In fact it is normal to use a simple gear pump to inject the polyamide material. Low injection pressure is paramount, when over-molding relatively fragile electronic component. Two: Adhesion: Polyamide materials are basically high performance hot-melt adhesives. The adhesive properties of polyamide is what seals a chosen substrate. The type of adhesion is purely mechanical i.e. no chemical reaction takes place. Process The mainly used amorphous thermoplastic polyamides combine a favourable viscosity spectrum with a wide application temperature range from -58¬∞ to 302¬∞ Fahrenheit( -50 to 150¬∞ Celsius). The material is heated until liquid (typically at 356¬∞ to 464¬∞ Fahrenheit/180¬∞ to 240¬∞ Celsius) and then injected at very low pressure, typically 50 to 200 psi (3.5 to 14 bar) into a relative cold mold-set. The low viscosity polyamide material flows gently into the mold-set cavity and around the electronics to be encapsulated. It also starts cooling down as soon as it touches the mold-set cavity and the electronics. A mold-set cavity is typically filled in a few seconds but a typical full molding cycle is 20 to 45 seconds. As the Polyamide material starts to cool down it also starts to shrink. Continuous injection pressure is therefore applied to the cavity, even after its initial fill. This is done in order to compensate for the shrinkage that naturally occurs when the Polyamide material goes from liquid to solid (i.e. hot to cold). The Polyamide temperature is not too hot for the electronics and does not re-melt or re-flow the solder. This is simply because the relative cold mold-set will absorb the brunt of the heat, thereby reducing the temperature that a circuit board may see. Millions of circuit boards are successfully over-molded without causing any harm in the process. A low injection pressure does not stress a fragile solder joint. Use Low Pressure Molding process was initially invented in Europe in the 1970s by adhesives companies like Henkel AG & Co. KGaA in Germany and Bostik in France to seal connectors and create strain reliefs for wires. The first commercial use of the Low Pressure Molding process was in the automotive industry. The driving force was to replace toxic and cumbersome potting processes, faster cycle times, lighter parts and environmentally safe components and for some applications to replace heat shrink tubings. Since then Low Pressure Molding has spread out to other areas such as industrial products, medical, consumer products, military, wire harness and any unique product that needs to be sealed and protected against the environment, like Automotive sensors in-cabin and even under hood, USB thumb drives, RF ID tags, moisture sensors, motor control boards, consumer products. In essence the process acts as a middle ground between plastic injection molding which subjects components to high pressure and temperatures that can often damage them and potting with resin a process that involves waste and lengthy curing times.

In 1738, he was elected as Deputy Governor of the colony and served for two one-year terms under Governor John Wanton. In 1723, Abbott and his wife deeded a plot of land in Providence for establishing a church \\"in the Presbyterian or Congregational way.\\" Ten years later, he and two others were appointed by the Assembly to erect a new jail in Providence of the same size as the one in Kings County. Early in 1740, he was given 20 pounds for his time and expense in revising and renewing the boundary line between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies, and later that year he was on a committee to determine the boundaries between the Rhode Island and Massachusetts colonies. In 1741, he and two others were appointed to set off a part of Warwick to establish the town of Coventry, Rhode Island. Abbott married Mary Fenner, the daughter of Major Thomas Fenner and Dinah Borden. She predeceased him on 7 January 1759. The couple had no children, so much of his estate was left to his Fenner relatives. Executors of his will were future Deputy Governors of the colony Jabez Bowen and Darius Sessions. Daniel and Mary Abbott are buried in the North Burial Ground, Providence, Rhode Island.

Women and Mystical Experience in the Middle Ages, Boydell Press, 2006 to 1391‚Äì94), was an anchorite of Ravensworth in North Yorkshire, England. She was the principal disciple of the hermit Richard Rolle, and the recipient of much of his writings.Hughes, Jonathan. Pastors and Visionaries: Religion and Secular Life in Late Medieval Yorkshire, Boydell Press, 1988 Life Variations of her name include Kirkeby, Kerkby or Kyrkby.Rhetorics of Pain and Desire: The Writings of the Middle English Mystics Information about her comes from a biographical office of Rolle written between 1381 and 1383, when Margaret returned to the Cistercian nunnery at Hampole some thirty-four years after Rolle's death. Her recollections were used to provide a biography of Rolle celebrating his sanctity. Miracles reported by pilgrims from across the North of England were also recorded to encourage an unofficial cult. Margaret was also instrumental in the composition of a liturgical commemoration of the gift of canor, the mystical ecstasy that Rolle celebrated in his writings, which Evelyn Underhill relates to a song of joy.Underhill, Evelyn. \\"The Mysticism of Richard Rolle\\", Rolle, Richard. The Fire of Love or Melody of Love (Richard Misyn, trans./Frances M.M. Comper, ed.), Methuen & Co., Ltd., London, 2nd ed., 1920 Additional information is provided in a brief life of Rolle written before 1405. From a small landowning gentry family in Ravensworth, it may be surmised that Margaret first became interested in the solitary life as a young nun of Hampole guided by the convent's spiritual director, Richard Rolle. It was for her that he wrote his English translation and commentary on the Psalms which linked the growth in intensity of religious experience of canor with an understanding of the Psalms. Margaret became an anchoress in East Layton in Richmondshire (possibly in 1348), and her patrons may have been the Fitzhugh family, who owned the local estates. Rolle wrote The Form of Living for her, the first vernacular guide for recluses since the Ancrene Riwle. Rolle addressed Margaret in the text directly, discussing the problems she would face as a recluse far from his guidance, such as excessive abstinence and the high expectations placed on her by others; and he encouraged her in the attainment of ecstasy by creating for her the verbal equivalent of canor in English. He also presented her with a collection of his works made into a single treatise including: The Form of Living, The Commandment of Love, Ego dormio, prose pieces and lyrics beginning with a rubric reading ‚Äòa tract of Richard hermit to Margaret Kirkby recluse on the contemplative life‚Äô. The volume, copied c.1430, survives as Longleat MS 27. In The Form of Living and the compilation On the Contemplative Life Rolle demonstrated that his entire mystical system, which celebrated the pre-eminence of canor and the solitary life, was of pastoral relevance to his outstanding disciple, and that he attempted to initiate Margaret into thoughts and spiritual experiences previously available only in his Latin works. The personal tensions that Margaret felt when leaving Hampole are recounted in the biographical office. She suffered seizures that could be cured only by Rolle who would sit with her at her anchorage window until she slept on his shoulder. After one attack Rolle confessed that even if she were the devil (who had once taken the form of a beautiful woman who had loved him) he would still have held her. After Rolle's death her illness never returned, which gives their story, according to biographer Jonathan Hughes, \\"a romantic unity to a platonic Yorkshire love story that anticipates Wuthering Heights\\".Jonathan Hughes, 'Kirkby, Margaret (d. 1391x4)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 6 May 2011 However, Margaret's career was of wider historical significance. In 1357 she obtained the unusual concession of being allowed to change cells and was enclosed in Ainderby so that she could observe the celebration of mass in the parish church. Thirteenth-century episcopal registers had emphasised the recluse's service to God through a penitential, ascetic life, and the achievement of a mystic union with God was mentioned if at all only in passing. The register of John Thoresby, Archbishop of York, confirming the enclosure suggests to Hughes that \\"in common with the epistles of Rolle, Margaret desired an eremitic life in order that she might fashion herself as a servant of God more freely and more quietly with pious prayers and vigils. Such language indicates how she and Rolle were pioneering a change in the conception of the eremitic vocation\\". The enclosure at Ainderby churchyard brought her to the attention of Richard le Scrope, the rector from 1368 and later Archbishop of York. He was probably the medium through which Rolle's writings came to the attention of the Cambridge educated northerners in the service of Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, including Walter Hilton; this led to a pastoral response to Rolle's teachings that provided contemplative instructions for layfolk. Other members of the Scrope family showed an interest in Margaret's servant, Elizabeth. In 1405 Stephen, 2nd Baron Scrope of Masham, left legacies to Elizabeth and the anchoress of Kirby Wiske. Henry, 3rd Lord Scrope, and patron of many anchoresses, owned an autograph volume of Rolle's writings and this may well have come into the possession of the family through Margaret Kirkby; it is through Henry Scrope, the king's treasurer, that the teachings of Rolle and Margaret's example inspired Henry V and Henry, Baron Fitzhugh of Tanfield, to establish the eremitic communities of Sheen Priory and Syon Monastery. Although she did not write anything herself, Margaret may have influenced Julian of Norwich, author of Revelations of Divine Love. Among Margaret's patrons were Sir Bryan Stapleton of Bedale, lord of the manor of East Layton, who in 1394 bequeathed to her a silver ewer. His brother, Sir Miles Stapleton, moved to Ingham, Norfolk and his son, also Sir Miles, whose daughter became an anchoress, was a patron of Julian of Norwich.Hill, Carole. \\"Julian and Her Sisters: Female Piety in Late Medieval Norwich\\", Identity and Insurgency in the Late Middle Ages, (Linda Clark, ed.), Boydell Press, 2006 Having returned some time between 1381 and 1383, Margaret lived at Hampole until her death ten years later. To judge from Stapleton's bequest, this occurred in or before 1394. She was buried in the cemetery of Hampole near her master and her remains are presumably in the garden of the old schoolhouse of Hampole on the site of the convent. Frances Beer argues that from her life \\"we can surely conclude that [Margaret] was strong, courageous, intelligent, purposeful ‚Äì deserving of the great esteem in which she was held by her great friend and advisor [Rolle]\\". Bottomley concurs, arguing that she was independent, intelligent and strong- willed.Bottomley, Frank. \\"Yorkshire Spiritual Athletes: Hermits and Other Solitaries ReferencesSources *Jonathan Hughes, 'Kirkby, Margaret (d. 1391x4)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 6 May 2011 Category:14th-century English people Category:English Roman Catholics Category:People from Ravensworth Category:1391 deaths Category:1320s births Category:English hermits Category:14th-century English women ","title":"Margaret Kirkby"},{"id":"31689286","text":"Bayant√∂m√∂riin Khaisan Bayant√∂m√∂riin Khaisan (), also spelled Khayishan (, ) (c. 1862The date of birth is estimated using his own writing.

The Zost League bordered Liaoning to the south, from which peasants reclaimed grassland from Zost into productive agricultural fields. In this process, his family became wealthy landowners. He received a well-rounded education and had full command of Mongolian, Manchu and Chinese (and later Russian). He worked at the banner office of the Kharchin Right Banner. When the Chinese secret society named Jindandao attacked the banner in 1891, he guided the government forces dispatched from Zhili province to suppress the rebels. He also helped his lord Prince G√ºnsennorov modernize Mongol education and military training. In 1900, influenced by the Boxer Rebellion, the remnants of the Jindandao resumed their activity. As a banner official, he crushed some 500 rebels with banner troops. In the winter of 1902, a false charge forced Khaisan to flee his homeland. He personally arrested one surviving rebel leader named Zhang Liansheng (), who used rent strikes and other methods of protest against wealthy Mongol landlords. However, he had to hand over him to a Chinese prefecture because, after the Jindandao incident, the Han Chinese in Zost were put under the jurisdiction of a local prefecture. Zhang committed suicide during escort but his family charged Khaisan with murder.  Mongol independence movement  He fled to Harbin, where he got acquainted with Russian Colonel Khitrovo. He worked as an editor of the first Mongolian language newspaper (), which was published by Imperial Russia's Chinese Eastern Railway.Tatsuo Nakami, The Minority's Groping: Further Light on Khaisan and Udai, Journal of Asian and African Studies, No. 20, pp. 106-120, 1980 online edition. He then secretly went to Urga (modern-day Ulaanbaatar) around 1907.Nakami Tasuo ‰∏≠Ë¶ãÁ´ãÂ§´.

By this time he came to think that the Mongols must establish an independent state of their own. In 1909 he met Gustaf J. Ramstedt, who visited Mongolia on his second archaeological expedition, to whom he told his subversive idea. Also, according to the Russian Colonel M. Popov, he asked Russian representatives to supply Mongols with arms and to help them establish a national government. He added that otherwise Mongols would seek help from the Empire of Japan. In spring 1910, the political tension was heightened as the new Manchu amban Sandowa arrived at Urga to enforce the New Policy, which, Mongols thought, would push them into the margin of survival. After secret meetings by nobles and lamas, they decided to send a mission to Imperial Russia to ask for support. As a member of the mission, Khaisan visited Saint Petersburg in August. He seems to have represented Inner Mongolia, and thus they had Pan- Mongolist aspirations to include present-day Chinese territory in Mongolia. His role in the movement is unclear due to lack of sufficient historical sources of this period. Chen Lu, then the Chinese representative in Urga, wrote that in 1915 Tserendorj, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, said, \\"If Khaisan has not come to Urga, Outer Mongolia would not have be able to gain its independence.\\" Soon after the Chinese Xinhai Revolution in October, Mongol nobles and lamas declared independence, establishing the Bogd Khaan government. He took a high-ranking post in the most influential Home Ministry and worked under Home Minister Tserenchimed, who was also a radical pan- Mongolist. He was, however, in a weak position in the new government. The alien had to use his patron Tserenchimed to exert authority. Both Khaisan and Tserenchimed were soon disappointed with the Russian policy toward Mongolia. Khaisan came to be labeled anti-Russian by Russian representatives. In July 1912, pro-Russian Sain Noyon Khan Namnans√ºren was appointed as the first prime minister, striking a severe blow to both Khaisan and Tserenchimed. In 1912 Bogd Khaan gave Khaisan the rank of duke (\\"ulsad tuslagchi g√ºn\\" or simply \\"g√ºn\\") and a land near the Mongolian-Russian border. Khaisan brought his family there, and began agricultural development with his Russian, Buryat and Han Chinese employees, which caused trouble with the local nomadic population.Borjigin Burensain „Éú„É´„Ç∏„ÇÆ„É≥„Éª„Éñ„É¨„É≥„Çµ„Ç§„É≥, Harachin Tomedo imin to kingendai Mongoru shakai „Éè„É©„ÉÅ„É≥„Éª„Éà„É°„ÉâÁßªÊ∞ë„Å®ËøëÁèæ‰ª£„É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Á§æ‰ºö (Mongolian immigrants from the Qaraƒçin and Tumed areas within modern Mongolian society), Kingendai Uchi Mongoru T≈çbu no heny≈ç ËøëÁèæ‰ª£ÂÜÖ„É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Êù±ÈÉ®„ÅÆÂ§âÂÆπ (Social and Cultural Change in Eastern Inner Mongolia in the Modern Period), pp. 318‚Äì345, 2007. The future of the Bogd Khan government remained uncertain. In his struggle for the international recognition of Mongolian independence, Tserenchimed tried to make a diplomatic contact with Japan in February 1913. His attempt was failed not only because of strong Russian pressure but also because Japan took a non-interference policy toward Outer Mongolia, disappointing Inner Mongolian secessionists including Khaisan. In January 1913 the liberation campaign of the south was initiated by Khaisan and other Mongols from the south including Udai from the Jirim League and Manlaibaatar Damdins√ºren from Kh√∂l√∂nbuir. Although the Bogd Khaan forces successfully captured a large portion of the south by mid-1913, the Russian objection and shortage of supplies forced them to withdraw to Outer Mongolia in December. At the same time, Khaisan had kept secret contact with his former lord Prince G√ºnsennorov, who then took the side of the Republic of China. In September 1913, his son was sent to Beijing claiming that Khaisan was anxious to return to his homeland. Khaisan was arrested by the Bogd Khaan government on charges of treason. His son in Beijing asked the Chinese government to press the Bogd Khaan government to release Khaisan. As a result, Khaisan was released in early 1914. In November 1913, Russia and China proclaimed a joint declaration that, despite Mongols' objection, recognized China's suzerainty and confined the area of autonomy to Outer Mongolia. The tripartite agreement of Kyakhta of 1915 formally recognized Outer Mongolia's autonomy within China, which delivered a fatal blow to the pan-Mongolists. With his hope broken, Khaisan moved to Beijing via Russia in 1915. He was given the position of Vice President of the Bureau of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and the high rank of beise by Yuan Shikai. He died in Beijing in 1917.

Cregan joined the team during the 1928 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the start of the 1936 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, three Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. Cregan was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Cregan enjoyed a lengthy career with Newcastle West. Cregan's son, √âamonn, was an All-Ireland medallist with Limerick in 1973. His other sons, Mickey and Conor, also played with Limerick. Playing career=Club Cregan played his club hurling with Newcastle West and enjoyed some success during a career that spanned three decades. His activities during the War of Independence impacted on his club hurling career, however, he won a number of West Limerick championship medals during the club's most successful period. Inter-county Cregan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick junior hurling team in 1927. It was a successful year for the team as a 4-4 to 2-2 defeat of Clare in the decider gave him a Munster medal. Limerick were later defeated by Meath in the \\"home\\" All-Ireland final. The following year Cregan made his debut in the senior ranks with Limerick. The team had gone into decline since last winning the provincial crown in 1923 as Cork dominated the southern province in the late twenties. In 1933 Limerick made the breakthrough. A 3-7 to 2-2 defeat of Waterford gave Cregan his first Munster medal. Although the game was played in Thurles the result was decided in Clonmel as the game had to be abandoned because of a pitch invasion. Since Limerick were winning the game comfortably the Munster Council decided to award the Munster title to Limerick. Cregan's side subsequently faced reigning champions Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. The game was a close one; however, Kilkenny sealed the victory with a great solo-run goal by Johnny Dunne in the last ten minutes. A 1-7 to 0-6 score line gave Kilkenny a second consecutive All-Ireland victory. 1934 began with Limerick bouncing back from this defeat by claiming the National Hurling League title. Cregan later collected a second Munster medal following a 4-8 to 2-5 defeat of Waterford. Dublin provided Limerick's opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and, as it turned out, the game was a dramatic spectacle. Dublin trailed by five points with five minutes left, however, they fought back to draw 2-7 to 3-4. The replay turned out to be an even closer affair as well with both sides level with two minutes to go. Points from Mick Mackey and Jackie O'Connell and a fourth goal from Dave Clohessy secured a 5-2 to 2-6 victory for Limerick and an All-Ireland medal for Cregan. Cregan captured a second consecutive National League medal in 1935 before Limerick completely powered their way through the provincial series of games. A 5-5 to 1-4 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider gave him a third successive Munster medal. Kilkenny turned out to be Limerick's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final and, once again, the game was a close affair. Limerick were the red-hot favourites as they were the reigning National League and All-Ireland champions and had played a remarkable 31 games without defeat. In spite of rain falling throughout the entire game both sides served up a great game. At the beginning of the second-half Lory Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they would not surrender. Mick Mackey smashed a free to the net, however, his final attack to secure a win was foiled by Paddy Larkin. Kilkenny held on to win the game on a score line of 2-5 to 2-4.

He also wrote poems in Arabic. Abulafia collected his poems in diwan, which he called Gan HaMeshalim veHaHidot (The Garden of Parables and Riddles). The collection of poems was written mostly in Hebrew and included poems by other authors as well. Also included were 35 poems that represented a poetic debate between Todros Abulafia and the poet Phinehas Halevi. Angel S√°enz-Badillos, Professor in the Hebrew Department of Complutense University of Madrid, Spain, believes that Abulafia was \\"probably the best and most prolific author of Christian Spain during the reigns of Alfonso the Learned and his son Sancho IV of Castile.\\" Life A distant relative of Meir Abulafia, Todros Abulafia was born in 1247 in Toledo. He mastered Arabic, and was well educated in both Arabic and Christian poetry and literature. Early in his career Abulafia became a courtier in the court of Alfonso X of Castile. The court of Alfonso, who was called Alfonso the Wise and Alfonso the Learned, attracted an ambitious poet because it was a cultural center of Castile at that time. Besides being a poet, Abulafia was also a diplomat and a financier. In 1279 the king ordered him to collect an enormous amount of taxes from the Jewish community of Castile. The king needed the money to pay for his religious military campaign. The collected money never reached the army because one of the king's sons used it for his own purpose. The angry king ordered the execution of two leading tax collectors, one of whom was Abulafia's patron. Some time later Abulafia and most other Jews of Castile were taken from a synagogue and arrested. Ransom was set as the condition for their release. Abulafia continued to write poems while in prison. After he was released he became a courtier once again, this time in the court of Alfonso's son Sancho IV of Castile. Little is known about Abulafia's life after 1298. Poetry The poetry of Todros ben Judah Halevi Abulafia was influenced by his living in Christian Spain, where Arabic was still spoken 150 years after Christian rulers retook Iberia from the Moors. In some ways, his poetry differs from the poetry written by his Jewish Andalusian predecessors, who were forced to flee Southern Spain during the Berber-Almohad invasion of 1147‚Äì1148; at the same time, common motifs like the use of hyperbole still can be seen. One example is a poem that Abulafia dedicated to Ibn Shoshan, a Jew who had just arrived in Toledo from Morocco. In the poem, titled \\"Flowers' debate\\", \\"the author's tapestried earth, encircled by a jeweled necklace of flowers, frames the rivalry of a group of prominent flowers: the red rose, vere the pale rose,shoshan, and the narcissus, havasele\\". In the poem each flower debates its characteristics, but none could overcome the pale rose,shoshan, which also stands for the honoree of the poem, Ibn Shoshan and his family. In the poem the pale rose, shoshan, won the debate of the flowers because it presented the best characteristics: \\"righteous, courageous, humble, philanthropic and praiseworthy.\\" His preference for Arab women finds confirmation in some of his poems. Todros led a life of adventures, and \\"prosperous sensuality\\" and this sexual realism with some degree of lustfulness gets reflected in many of his poems. Abulafia's poems continue the tradition of the troubadours who were always welcomed in the court of Alfonso the Wise, and this \\"troubadouresque fin‚Äôamor\\" is not found in Andalusian Hebrew tradition. In discussing Abulafia's poetry, Peter Cole states: \\"Above all, Todros‚Äôs work is distinguished by its freshness and candor: he managed to introduce a vivid (though not always straight forward) personal dimension into his verse that went well beyond anything medieval Hebrew poetry had seen before him. He filled the classical conventions with irony, turned them on their heads, or did away with them altogether and created new poetic space in which to work.\\" Translation challenges Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well as other medieval poems written in Hebrew, presents some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem \\"Figs\\". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: \\"[S]end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight.\\" The next line of the poem was translated as \\"And in return, here is my flatus.\\" The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means \\"vine twig\\". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that \\"Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' I think that this is a sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line‚Äî'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'‚Äîcould fit either way.\\" Gan HaMeshalim veHaHidot Little is known about the poet's life after 1298. After his death, his poetry was almost forgotten for more than six hundred years. Then the diwan was discovered and copied in 17th century Egypt. For the next few centuries, this copied manuscript traveled between Iraq and India, changing hands among antiquarian collectors from different countries. In the late 1800s, the manuscript became the property of Sha'ul 'Abdullah Yosef, an Iraqi scholar and businessman, who obtained the manuscript while working in Hong Kong. (It is unclear how the manuscript got to Hong Kong.) Yosef understood the manuscript's value because he was very knowledgeable in Hebrew. After his death in 1906, the manuscript became the possession of David Yellin, who was a leading scholar in medieval Hebrew poetry at that time. Yellin published the manuscript between 1934 and 1937 in three volumes, adding around twelve hundred poems to \\"the medieval Hebrew canon\\".

In December, 2009 the EPA issued its \\"Endangerment Finding,\\" which found that greenhouse gases threaten health and welfare. In January, 2011 the EPA implemented permitting for sources of greenhouse gases. On February 9, 2011 in a hearing before the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Republican Congressmen said the science underpinning the EPA's regulatory effort was a hoax, questioned the EPA's interpretation of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, and said the Obama administration would cost American jobs. EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said cleaning up the environment would improve health and create jobs. Proposed changes If passed, this bill would have amended several core components of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Title III of the CAA would have been amended to have the term ‚Äúgreenhouse gas‚Äù include: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and any other substance subject to, or proposed to be subject to, regulation, action, or consideration under this Act to address climate change. The Act said that the Administrator of the EPA may take no action involving the consideration of greenhouse gases as pollutants or contributing factors to climate change. It also said that ‚Äú[nothing] shall cause a greenhouse gas to be subject to part C of title I ‚Ä¶or considered an air pollutant for purposes of title V...‚Äù This means that, as greenhouse gases would no longer be considered to degrade the quality of air, sources would not be required to obtain a permit to emit. These permits require sources of pollution to complete a registration process in order to lawfully be able to emit anything considered to be a pollutant. Going along with this, it would no longer be required to report emissions of greenhouse gases.\\" The Act also listed a number of prior agency actions that would have been \\"...repealed and shall have no legal effect.\\" Essentially this Act would have reversed the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which gave the EPA the power to regulate carbon dioxide. Legislative history The House bill was sponsored by Representatives Fred Upton (R‚Äì6th MI) and Ed Whitfield (R‚Äì1st KY). Co-sponsors included Representatives Steve Scalise (R‚Äì1st LA), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R‚Äì5th WA), and Greg Walden (R‚Äì2nd OR). The bill was introduced on March 3, 2011. An identically worded bill was authored and introduced into the United States Senate by Senator Jim Inhofe (R‚ÄìOK) and cosponsored by Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker (R‚ÄìMS) and Marco Rubio (R‚ÄìFL). On March 8, 2011 in a hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Democratic Congressmen presented five eminent academic climatologists who defended the scientific consensus that global warming is largely the result of human activities like the burning of fossil fuels. Republican Congressmen presented two witnesses who said that the reasons for global warming were unclear. On March 10 the Act advanced out of the subcommittee on a voice vote. On March 15 the Act advanced out of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on a 34 to 19 vote. All Republican committee members voted in favor, along with three Democrats: John Barrow (D‚Äì12th GA), Jim Matheson (D‚Äì2nd UT), and Mike Ross (D‚Äì4th AR). On March 30 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a cost estimate that said ‚Äúenacting this legislation would save $57 million in 2012 and about $250 million over the 2012-2016 period, assuming that appropriations in those years were reduced accordingly.‚Äù This savings is calculated by taking into consideration the amount of money spent by the EPA in its effort to regulate GHG emissions. However, ‚ÄúRepublicans on the committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee argued that trying to limit carbon emissions would cost US businesses $300-400 billion/year and discourage hiring of new employees.‚Äù In response to this, Lisa P. Jackson, the acting Administrator for the EPA, argued that the EPA‚Äôs implementation of the Clean Air Act has stimulated the US environmental technologies industry has led to an increase in revenue. \\"In 2008, that industry generated nearly $300 billion in revenue and $44 billion in exports.‚Äù She continued on saying, ‚ÄúYesterday, the University of Massachusetts and Ceres released an analysis finding that two of the updated CAA standards EPA is preparing to establish ‚Ä¶ will create nearly 1.5 million jobs over the next 5 years.\\" She also brought attention to the effects that the CAA has on society by stating, \\"in 2010 alone, EPA's implementation of the CAA saved more than 160,000 US lives, avoided more than 100,000 hospital visits; prevented millions of cases of respiratory illness, including bronchitis and asthma; enhanced US productivity by preventing millions of lost workdays; and kept US children healthy and in school.\\" Supplementing this, on March 1, 2011, the EPA released a report that estimated, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the direct benefits from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments are estimated to reach almost $2 trillion for the year 2020, a figure that dwarfs the direct costs of implementation ($65 billion).‚Äù The saving reported here are mainly due to the estimated reduction of early deaths caused by pollution. These findings are based upon already observed trends. On April 5 US President Barack Obama said he would veto any bill that prevented the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. On April 6 in House floor debate Upton summarized his intentions for introducing this bill saying, \\"The only environmental impact may be to ship our jobs to countries with no environmental protections at all, so, ... at the end of the day the EPA climate regime is all economic pain and no environmental gain.\\" Henry Waxman (D‚Äì4th CA), Ranking Member in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said \\"...climate change is real. It is caused by pollution, and it is a serious threat to our health and welfare. We need to confront these realities, not put our heads in the sands.\\" On April 7, 2011 the bill passed the House by a vote of 255 to 172. No Republican opposed it; 19 Democrats supported it. The next day it was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. The bill died with the ending of the two-year Congressional session, in January 2013.

In 2014, the parliament unanimously voted to establish a department promoting gender equality, which is establishing institutions for women's welfare.  Societal attitudes  A survey of 600 women in 2010 for the Association for Support for Life from Women (KAYAD) indicated that 51% of women agreed that women had to conform to pre-determined gender roles, 88% agreed that above all else, women should be good mothers and caretakers of the home, 58% believed that women should be home before their husbands and 80% believed that girls should be raised to become \\"ladies\\", 20% believed that widowed or divorced women should not live alone. 40% stated that they had difficulties in achieving their goals due to societal pressure, while 38% believed that it was not as important for women to have a significant role in public life in comparison to men. 55% believed that women should be able to work outside the family even if not necessitated by economic conditions. Politics  Constraints affecting women who have entered politics in Northern Cyprus include investing time for home, motherhood, family, and political life. The fact that coffeehouses and meyhane (traditional drinking taverns), social spaces that have been traditionally reserved for men, remain central to Turkish Cypriot politics is a restraining factor for women. Even some regional headquarters of political parties function as coffeehouses.Yirmibeolu, G√∂zde.

Any party that does not fulfill this requirement may not participate in elections.  Violence against women  In 2014, 204 women filed complaints to the police reporting violence against them. Aziz G√ºrpƒ±nar, the Minister of Labour and Social Security at the time, called the figure \\"frightening\\". Between 2013 and 2015, the number of complaints was 442 in total, and according to Asƒ±m Akansoy, Minister of the Interior at the time, only 10% of victims were estimated to have reported violence. Northern Cyprus ratified the Istanbul Convention in 2011. A survey of 1000 married women in 2012 by the non-governmental organization Feminist Workshop found that 33% of married women experienced violence, while the participants reported knowing on average 2.58 women who experienced violence from their partners. 14% of women reported having experienced marital rape. Due to the lack of a reliable public transport system, students in Northern Cyprus sometimes have to hitchhike. Students have reported that female students often face sexual harassment in these hikes, while male students also reported harassment.  Employment  According to a 2015 survey by the State Planning Organization, 39-40% of women participated in the workforce as opposed to 71-72% of men. Female unemployment rate was found to be 8.9%, as opposed to 6.5% for men, and 36.5% of all employees were women. It was also found that 85.7% of women were employed in the services sector, as opposed to 67.8% of men. The same survey in 2008 indicated that only 36.2% of women participated in the workforce as opposed to 67.1% of men. Female unemployment rate was found to be 14%, as opposed to 7.6% for men, and 32.6% of all employees were women. The Plan for the Support of Local Employment, whose implementation started in 2013, prioritised the increase of women's participation in the workforce. The plan resulted in the employment of 2091 women along with 1812 men until January 2015. The plan also allowed 78 women to start businesses in 39 sectors.

They are native Portuguese-speakers and are also known as Tapebano and Perna-de-pau people. Before official recognition as Indians in 1993, they were classified as mixed-race peasants. They trace their descent from the Potiguara, Trememb√©, Cariri, and Juc√° peoples,\\"Tapeba: Elements of local indigenous history.\\" Povos Ind√≠genas no Brasil. Retrieved 10 May 2013. who spoke Tupi languages. Background The Tapeba people live on federally identified and delimited, but still not fully demarcated, indigenous lands in Caucaia, Cear√°, in the Brazilian Northeast. In addition to indigenous blood, most Tapeba have significant European and, to a lesser extent, African racial heritage. Before their official recognition by Brazil's Foundation for the Indian in the 1990s, they had little history as a coherent indigenous identity. It was through prodding by Fortaleza's Archbishop Lorscheider, who was moved by their wretched poverty, that they organized in the 1980s and sought state recognition, which in Brazil often comes attended by lands demarcations, legal eviction of competing land occupants, and privileged access to healthcare, education and other state services. Before the 1980s, there are no historical registrations of a \\"Tapeba\\" people anywhere in Brazil. To contextualize this, the Tapeba are one of about 50 groups presently living in Brazil's Northeast‚Äîwhere Indians are generally thought to be extinct because of this region's early colonial incursions‚Äîthat have reemerged as political entities since the 1970s. Without exception, these groups seek official recognition and legal recourse to a better material existence, at the center of which are almost invariably violent turf wars with white landholders. In fact, many such groups in Bahia, Sergipe and Alagoas are racially Afrobrazilian.See Jan Hoffmann French's 2009 book, \\"Legalizing Identities\\" Current issues As for the Tapeba, while they have significant indigenous blood ties and have for generations been an agricultural society threatened by the urban growth of Cear√°'s capital, Fortaleza (which now subsumes Caucaia in the western outskirts of its metropolitan area), they also are Portuguese-speakers with a long history of variably peaceful and violent interactions with European-Brazilians. Before the 1990s, they were classified as caboclos (mixed-race peasants), a stigmatizing mark of non-citizenship in Brazil, and deemed to be squatters along the Cear√° River and nearby mangroves. Converting their identity to that of Indians has reduced that stigma, provided a coherent identity that has been instrumental in raising youth consciousness within the community, and most importantly, brought legal access to material resources they would otherwise lack. Additionally, some of their expressive traditions, the best-known of which is their Tor√© dance ritual, can be said to be recent cultural adoptions (some might even argue they are inventions in the Hobsbawmian sense), intended primarily to further their indigenous identity claims.

Hartman Douglas K. Hartman is an American scholar in the field of education. He is a professor of technology & human learning in the College of Education at Michigan State University. He has a joint appointment in the Departments of Educational Psychology & Educational Technology and Teacher Education. His research focuses on the use of digital technologies for human learning in a number of domains (e.g., school, work, community, sports, church and home).  Biography  Hartman was born in Grangeville, Idaho. He was educated in Montana and Hawaii during his elementary and secondary school years. His college years were spent as a student-athlete in Oregon. He taught and coached at the middle school level in Oregon and California for several years before attending graduate school in Illinois. For nearly 30 years he's served as a faculty member at universities in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Michigan. With colleagues, Hartman has published almost 100 articles, chapters, and technical reports. His sole edited book, Stories Teachers Tell (with Richard Donato), was re-written as a reader's theater and performed off- Broadway in New York City. Hartman's current research interests focus on technologies and their use for human learning as well as the history of teaching & learning. Education Hartman earned his Ph.D. in 1991 at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in Literacy, Language & Learning (P. David Pearson, advisor). He worked as a research assistant at the University's Center for the Study of Reading with Rand J. Spiro, Richard C. Anderson, Diane Stephens, and Kathleen Copeland. He received an M.Ed. in Reading Education from California State University, Fresno (Penny Dyer, advisor), in 1986 while working as an elementary teacher. In addition, he served as a Research Assistant in the School of Education and a Teaching Assistant in the Summer Bridge Program. Hartman received his B.S. degree at Warner Pacific College in Social Science (Ed Whitehead, advisor) and Reading in 1981 (Dorothy Danner, advisor) and began working as an English/language arts teacher for the West Orient Middle School in Gresham, Oregon.

He is currently Professor in the College of Education at Michigan State University (2008-Present). Research Hartman research focus falls into three main categories: New Literacies and Intertextualities, Teacher Practices (including adolescent literacies) and the History of Literacy. New Literacies and Intertextualities Hartman has published in the areas of New Literacies and Intertextuality. This area of research has focused on the discussion of multiple texts and building sustainable cognition along with a transition to online reading. This area of research began through Dr. Hartman‚Äôs work on his Dissertation ‚ÄúEight Readers Reading: The Intertextual Links of Able Readers Using Multiple Passages ‚Äù (winner of the International Reading Association‚Äôs Dissertation of the Year Award) and continues with his most recent, in print, publication ‚ÄúFrom Print to Pixels: The Evolution of Cognitive Conceptions of Reading Comprehension‚Äù (Hartman, Morsink, and Zheng, 2010). Teacher Practices including Adolescent Literacies Hartman‚Äôs research in the areas of Teacher Practices focused on the use of using multiple texts in the classroom, leading discussions in the classroom and shaping readers experiences through multiple texts. This area of research draws from the research in intertextualitiy but puts it into a practitioner lens for use by classroom teachers. History of Literacy Hartman research includes work on the History of Literacy.

It is loosely based on the novels by Maurice Leblanc. Plot Georges Descri√®res' portrayal of Ars√®ne Lupin showed more similarity to Graf Yoster than to Maurice Leblanc's original. He behaved in the first place as a perfect gentleman who never got angry. He was always relaxed, because whatever could possibly have bothered him in daily life was taken care of by his butler. It wasn't questioned how he had come to his financial independence although the series sometimes discreetly implied that he was a professional criminal. Besides rescuing damsels in distress Lupin took on (other) criminals, competing with their wit and intelligence. Either he stole paintings from rich people who had to be considered white-collar criminals or he acted as a detective who derailed criminal schemes. However, when he was attacked, he could defend himself effortlessly by using elegant jujutsu methods. (Graf Yoster left such matters to his butler). Among the guest stars were German actors such as G√ºnter Strack and Sky du Mont. Jean-Paul Salom√© said in his commentary on the DVD version of his film Ars√®ne Lupin (2004) he had liked this series as a child. German TV, one of the investors, would broadcast the show eventually between 18:00-20:00 o'clock because it was only allowed to show commercials within that timeslot. For them to get a financial return on investment the show had to be appropriate for families and also for children who would watch it alone. Subsequently, it was nearby to ask to defuse and flatten some of Leblanc's plots in order to avoid possible complaints that could force the station to broadcast the show beyond the \\"Vorabendprogramm\\".

J. K.; January 15, 1828 ‚Äì March 23, 1890) was a Canadian author, editor, historian, and poet. Katzmann published short poems from time to time, and afterwards became a regular contributor to various periodicals and newspapers, including the Colonist, the Record, and the Guardian. For two years, she edited the Provincial Magazine, one of the earliest of its kind published in Halifax. For this, she wrote \\"Tales of our Village,\\"‚Äîsketches of the early history of Dartmouth and Preston interwoven with local traditions. She invariably signed all she wrote with her initials, M. J. K., and by this sobriquet, became well known to all her friends. She was married in 1869 to William Lawson, Esq., of Halifax, in which town she was then living. After her marriage, her time was largely given to work among the poor, and to social and benevolent schemes, particularly those connected with the Church of England, of which she was a devoted member. She preserved to the end of her life that love for literary work which she had early displayed, and any event of interest in the community was sure to call forth sympathetic lines which were now signed with the initials M. J. K. L. In 1887, she obtained the Akins Historical Prize of King's College, Windsor, for her History of the, Townxhi* of Dartmouth, Preston, and Lawrencetown. She died at Halifax, on Sunday, March 23, 1890, after several weeks of painful illness, leaving one child, a daughter.

Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott. From a very early age, Katzmann showed unusual intelligence and signs of that love for literature which always characterized her. She could read at the age of three, and from that time devoured eagerly the limited number of books which were at her disposal in Maroon Hall. Scott's Tales of a Grandfather and Chambers Journal were her especial favourites. Owing to the remoteness of the country district in which she lived, educational advantages were few; and, save for the help given by her own family, she was almost entirely self-taught. Her quickness of perception and wonderful memory no doubt compensated to a great extent for the lack of other advantages.led there with other New England Loyalists. Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott. Career In 1845, her poetry came to the attention of Joseph Howe, who praised it in his \\"Nights with the Muses\\" column in The Nova Scotian. Between 1848 and 1851, Katzmann published a large amount of verse in the Halifax Guardian.\\"Mary Jane Katzmann,\\" Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature, Answers.com, Web, May 5, 2011. In January 1852, she became editor of The Provincial, a new literary journal, \\"and under her expert guidance it became possibly the best of the early Nova Scotian periodicals. The format and printing were superior, and the quality of the contributions was commendable.... Katzmann tailored her publication to attract a wide audience, both male and female; she also strove to include articles of regional origin rather than selected reprints.\\" The magazine \\"was well received by its readers but sufficient subscriptions were not forthcoming, and publication ceased with the December 1853 issue. Nothing further is known of the editor until 1866, when she was operating the Provincial Bookstore in Halifax.\\" In 1869, Katzmann married Halifax businessman William Lawson. She turned over the bookstore to her sister, and became a proper non-working Victorian wife (though she continued to write).

Between 1999 and when the hoax was discovered in 2001, Swenson, playing the role of Kaycee, represented herself on numerous websites as a teenager suffering from terminal leukemia. Kaycee was reported to have died on May 14, 2001, and her death was publicized on May 16; shortly thereafter, members of the online communities that had supported her unraveled the story and discovered that Kaycee had never actually existed. Debbie Swenson confessed on her blog to the hoax on May 20, 2001. Creation In 1998, Debbie Swenson's real daughter, Kelli Burke (born Kelli Jo Swenson in 1985), who was in middle school at the time in Gracemont, Oklahoma, created the online persona of \\"Kaycee Nicole\\" with a group of her friends.Archive of The Oklahoma 'N SYNC Girls Website; archive.org The group created a webpage for the nonexistent girl and used photos of a high school basketball player from their town to represent her,Archive of Kaycee Nicole Webpage; archive.org but do not seem to have played the role of Kaycee beyond that or given her an active persona. That came when Debbie Swenson discovered what the girls had done and, rather than forcibly discontinue the hoax, she adopted the persona and began playing the role of Kaycee. In August 1999, the Swenson family moved from Oklahoma to Kansas.Archive of Swenson Family Webpage; archive.org Persona After it came into Debbie Swenson's possession, the Kaycee Nicole persona appeared on CollegeClub.com in 1999, as a \\"sunny blonde\\" teenaged basketball star in Kansas who shared thoughts and photos with others on the website. She made friends easily with both users and staff at the site, even volunteering to help with administrative work and sending gifts to CollegeClub employees. \\"Kaycee\\" was interviewed by telephone by The New York Times in 2000, under the name \\"Kaycee Swenson\\". She described herself in the resultant article as a high school senior who was taking college courses and planned to start college full-time the next year. Blogging, illness, and death In 2000, Kaycee revealed to an online friend of hers, Randall van der Woning, that she suffered from leukemia, which was then in remission. Shortly afterward, she told him that the cancer was back. Sympathetic, Van der Woning offered to set up and host a blog for her to chronicle her struggles; Kaycee accepted the offer and the two created \\"Living Colours\\" in August 2000. Kaycee's blog recounted, in sometimes vivid detail, her struggles with the disease, including multiple hospitalizations. The near-daily entries were presented as having been written by Kaycee or, in cases where she was too weak or ill, by her \\"mother\\", Debbie. She maintained an upbeat writing style despite her apparent hardships ‚Äì her first entry said, \\"I'm beginning a new exciting journey ... into my survival. I want to win! I'll fight to the finish!\\" and readers of her blog became devoted to the inspirational young girl. Readership of the blog became widespread, with millions of readers visiting the site in the two years it was active and many readers recommending the blog to their own social networks. Some sent cards, gifts, and well-wishes to Kaycee by mail; still others spoke to \\"Kaycee\\" on the phone, some, such as the administrator of her blog, many times. In April 2001, it was revealed that Kaycee's liver was failing. Concerned about losing a \\"friend\\" without ever having met her, Van der Woning insisted that Kaycee allow him to visit her; Kaycee told him that he was welcome to visit, but not until after she returned from a trip she would be taking to see the ocean. However, before Van der Woning could make his trip to see Kaycee, he received a call on May 15, 2001, from Kaycee's mother. Sobbing, Debbie informed him that Kaycee had died, unexpectedly, of an aneurysm the day before. News of Kaycee's death was immediately posted on her blog: > Thank you for the love, the joy, the laughter and the tears. We shall love > you always and forever. Kaycee Nicole passed away May 14, 2001, at the age > of 19. Readers of the blog mourned Kaycee's death, many posting obituaries short and long on their own blogs, and news of her loss became widespread and much- discussed throughout the internet. Unraveling of hoax After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who requested an address to send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers to were told that, despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, there was no longer a post-office box mailing address for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated. On May 17, blogger Saundra Mitchell posted an entry to her blog mocking people who faked illnesses on the internet. Though she did not initially name Kaycee Nicole, the next day she published another commentary which did explicitly name her and suggested that in fact, Kaycee Nicole had never existed. She cited the nearly impossible haste with which Kaycee had been interred, noting that even if Kaycee had not been autopsied ‚Äì which was dependent upon the manner of her death and whether there was a doctor attending ‚Äì the two days that Debbie claimed that gathering of mourners, memorial service, and cremation had been accomplished in was unlikely; Mitchell also noted a number of inconsistencies in the backstory about Kaycee's cancer. Mitchell, working off Kaycee's IP address, traced the girl's location to Peabody, Kansas. She called around the town, asking if anyone knew of someone of Kaycee's description who had died recently. No one did. On May 18, a user on the weblog Metafilter posted a thread entitled \\"Is it possible that Kaycee did not exist?\\", which posited, largely on the basis of Saundra Mitchell's writings, that Kaycee Nicole might have been a hoax. Commenters in the often-heated thread (even the creator of the thread stated that \\"I mean, I want it NOT to be true. I hate the thought that a bunch of people are grieving over somebody who did not existi!\\" ) made a number of observations about the story of Kaycee, among them that no one had ever met Kaycee in person ‚Äì not even the internet denizens who had been closest to her ‚Äì and that no obituary was available in a newspaper, anywhere, for a 19-year-old girl named Kaycee Nicole. As the Metafilter thread progressed, users discovered that Kaycee's CollegeClub account was tied to the CollegeClub account of Debbie Swenson's teenaged daughter and that records showed that someone had logged into Kaycee's account days after she was supposed to have died. A user investigated the photographs that Kaycee had shared on her blog, identified a school mascot pictured, and traced it back to a particular high school, then traced the jersey number that \\"Kaycee\\" was wearing to an actual player. Investigation of the player showed that the only connection she had to Kaycee Nicole was that her family had once been acquainted with the Swenson family; she was not ill, was not named Kaycee Nicole, and not aware that her photo was being used by someone else. Confession On May 19, Debbie Swenson placed a call to her biggest supporter, Randall van der Woning. She told him that Kaycee had not actually been her own child, but rather a foster daughter. She requested that he keep Kaycee's identity secret. Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted that the story of Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed. \\"I didn't know the reactions would be so strong\\", Swenson said. \\"I knew it was wrong and every day it ate at me and I couldn't take it.\\" She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer, none of whom were her daughter. Aftermath Internet anger at the hoax was swift, with Van der Woning and many other supporters disclaiming Kaycee and Debbie Swenson. The local police in Peabody, Kansas, were notified and soon handed off the case to the FBI as a possible fraud. The FBI declined to further investigate after its initial acceptance of the case, stating that it had not been able to find evidence that Debbie Swenson's accepting of gifts for \\"Kaycee\\" constituted a dollar amount above their threshold for financial crimes.FBI declines to prosecute in 'Kaycee' internet hoax, page 1 & 2; Peabody Gazette-Bulletin; 8 pages; May 30, 2001.

It is native to the northern portions of Minnesota. Distribution The finescale dace occupies the regions ranging across the southern and northwest parts of Canada to areas of Minnesota, and more southward to the areas that lie near the Great Lakes Basin. The populations have been shown to inhabit areas in Minnesota including Brule Lake, as well as those bodies of water occupying the Lake Superior drainage areas of St. Louis and Cook counties. This species has also been found to live in the Great Lakes drainage stream regions of Wisconsin (although rarely seen in southern parts of Wisconsin). Although more northernly distributed, they have been seen to exist as Glacial relict populations in the Sand Hills of Nebraska, the Black Hills of South Dakota, Colorado, and parts of Wyoming. Description Finescale dace gets its name from the fine scales running along its body The species is characterized by its large, blunt head, and dark lateral bands running parallel to the length of its bronze and black body. On each lateral line there may be more than 80 scales. These scales are classified as leptoid scales. The leptoid scales are thin and flexible and cover the extent of the body. Leptoid scales are divided in two groups of specificity. The finescale dace has what are called ctenoid scales, called this because of the cteni that run along the posterior area of the fish. A lateral line system exists on the fish and allows it to orient itself in moving water. Main row teeth are distributed 5-4 usually, but have been seen as 4-4, 4-5, and 5-5 as well. The fish has paired fins lying on the pectoral and pelvic fins. The pectoral fins lie on the sides of the body. The pelvic fins are placed in the thoracic position. They range in size from long, about the length of an average person's thumb. Ecology This fish is most often found in the cool, acidic waters of the north. More specifically, they are found in the calm waters of slow-moving creeks and in cool, boggy ponds. Beaver ponds provide an excellent habitat, as they are found hidden in the safety among sunken logs and downed brush. They prey on tiny invertebrates including small insects such water beetles. Their diet also includes a variety of crustaceans, plankton, algae, and in the Northern parts of Minnesota, fingernail clams. Importance to humans Finescale daces are predated on by a multitude of species including diving beetles, mink, brook trout, and kingfishers, but however, are not consumed by humans. Instead, they are sold as bait in many parts of Minnesota and Canada. Conservation status No concern is taken for the populations of finescale dace. Their resiliency and sturdiness make them a great species for the bait industry in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Canada, as well as pets in home aquariums. Life cycle Breeding begins in April and ends in June, when the internal temperature of the streams heat to at least 15 degrees Celsius. The yellow and red colors exhibited in the pigments on the underside of a male's body during breeding season alerts the female of sexual readiness. The brightly colored pigments attracted the more muted colored females to large indentations in the sandy bottom of the stream, underneath waterlogged timber and brush. The pair will shoot into the indentation together and the female will proceed to lay her eggs while the male begins to fertilize them with his sperm. The eggs settle on the bottom of the floor and are left unattended by both parents. This breeding process takes in total only fifteen to thirty seconds. The spawning continues for several more days, which exhausts the female. She may lay several hundred more eggs in the span of the spawning season, depending much on her size and reproductive fitness. the eggs rest in the depressions and will hatch in 4 days if they have successfully avoided predation. The finescale dace has been seen to reproduce with the northern redbelly dace, Chrosomus eos, but produces hybrid offspring that are always females. It is advantageous for females to grow larger and live longer than males. This way, they can reproduce longer and produce more supple eggs. Recorded in Minnesota, the largest documented female was measured at long at approximately six years of age. In a similar location, the largest recorded male was long and roughly five years of age. However, it is typical to find both sexes living to three or four years at an average length of long. Etymology The species name Neogaeus comes from the Greek word meaning \\"new world\\".

It is a redox titration in which a Fe2+-1,10-phenanthroline complex (ferroin) color change indicates the end point. Ferroin can be reversibly discolored in its oxidized form upon titration with a Ce4+ solution. The use of cerium(IV) salts as reagents for volumetric analysis was first proposed in the middle of 19th century, but systematic studies did not start until about 70 years later. Standard solutions can be prepared from different Ce4+ salts, but often cerium sulfate is chosen. Since cerimetry is linked to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair, it can be used for analyses of nonstoichiometric levels that either oxidize Fe2+ or reduce Fe3+. For the case of oxidation, a precise excess of high-purity crystalline Mohr's salt is added upon the oxide digestion in aqueous hydrogen chloride (HCl), while for the case of reduction, an excess of 1 M iron trichloride (FeCl3) is added. In both cases, Fe2+ ions will be titrated subsequently. Because the Ce4+ solution is prone to hydrolysis, the titration is done in a strongly HCl-acidic solution into which some phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is added to obtain a less colored phosphato complex of Fe3+. According to tabulated values of standard potentials at pH = 0 for the first-row transition metals, any nonstoichiometry below the following oxidation states will reduce 1 M FeCl3 solution whereas any nonstoichiometry above them will oxidize the Mohr's salt: Ti4+, V4+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+. In addition, any nonstoichiometry in the Fe(III)‚ÄìFe(II) range is titrated directly with no additives, any nonstoichiometry below Fe2+ will reduce 1 M FeCl3 whereas any nonstoichiometry above Fe3+ will oxidize Mohr's salt. In the second- and third-row transition metals, only the early elements would be suitable for the titration, and the limiting oxidation states are Zr4+, Nb5+, Mo4+, Hf4+, Ta5+, and W6+. Standard potentials involving rhenium ions are too close to E¬∞ for Fe3+/Fe2+ as well as to each other. Nonstoichiometry of oxides containing several elements in oxidation states suitable for cerimetry is determined in one titration.

The photograph shows President of the United States Barack Obama along with his national security team, receiving live updates from Operation Neptune Spear, which led to the killing of Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda. Background Air Force Brigadier General Brad Webb was sitting at the table monitoring the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound when Michael Leiter, then Director of the United States National Counterterrorism Center, entered the room. Leiter does not appear in the photograph, but was followed by Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and others. Soon the President entered the room, commenting \\"I need to watch this,\\" and sat down next to General Webb. According to journalist Peter Bergen, the group was watching a live feed from an unmanned drone flying overhead. Leon Panetta said that Obama did not see bin Laden being killed. Clinton said: \\"We could see or hear nothing when [the SEALs] went into the house. There was no communication or feedback coming so it was during that time period everyone was particularly focused on just trying to keep calm and keep prepared as to what would happen.\\" The picture was taken at 4:05 pm local time in Washington (16:05 EDT), which was 12:35 am local time in Afghanistan. President Obama later said he believed the picture was taken about the time the room's occupants were informed or realized that one of the raid's helicopters had crashed.Bowden, Mark, \\"The Hunt For 'Geronimo'\\", Vanity Fair, November 2012, p. 144 White House photographer Pete Souza commented on this photograph for Time in late 2012, writing, \\"Much has been made of this photograph that shows the President and Vice President and the national security team monitoring in real time the mission against Osama bin Laden, May 1, 2011. Some more background on the photograph: The White House Situation Room is actually several different conference rooms. The majority of the time, the President convenes meetings in the large conference room with assigned seats. But to monitor this mission, the group moved into the much smaller conference room. The President chose to sit next to Brigadier General Marshall B. 'Brad' Webb, Assistant Commanding General of Joint Special Operations Command, who was point man for the communications taking place. With so few chairs, others just stood at the back of the room. I was jammed into a corner of the room with no room to move. During the mission itself, I made approximately 100 photographs, almost all from this cramped spot in the corner. Please note: a classified document seen in front of Sec. Clinton has been obscured.\\" People Annotated photograph The following people are pictured, from left to right: Seated #An unidentified person with black hair (only part of the head is visible) #Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States #Barack Obama, President of the United States #Brigadier General Marshall B. \\"Brad\\" Webb, Assistant Commanding General of the Joint Special Operations Command #Denis McDonough, Deputy National Security Advisor #Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State #Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense Standing #Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff #Tom Donilon, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs #William M. Daley, White House Chief of Staff #Tony Blinken, National Security Advisor to the Vice President #Audrey Tomason, Director for Counterterrorism for the National Security Council #An unidentified person in a beige shirt behind Tomason (only a fragment of the person's shoulder is visible) #John O. Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism #James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence #A man in a black suit with a white tie. Though his head is out of frame, he has been identified as a CIA analyst, publicly known only as \\"John\\", who was \\"the first to put in writing [in summer 2010] that the CIA might have a legitimate lead on finding bin Laden\\". Reception The photograph received much publicity after the news of Bin Laden's death was announced. CNN called it a \\"photo for the ages\\" and drew comparisons to other famous images of U.S. presidents such as Dewey Defeats Truman. Former White House photographer Eric Draper said that the photo captured \\"a defining moment in history very well\\". The photograph has also been the subject of commentary by historians and body language experts. Because the photograph was taken during the raid, it has been most noted for its intensity. Hillary Clinton, pictured in the photograph, described the moment as \\"the most intense 38 minutes of my life\\" while Obama commented that it may have been the longest 40 minutes of his life, possibly excepting when his daughter Sasha had meningitis as an infant. Brennan said \\"the minutes passed like hours and days\\" and Clapper said that \\"the tension in the air was palpable\\". Particularly of note was Clinton's facial expression, holding her right hand over her mouth in apparent anxiety over the outcome of the raid. She later said that she was suffering from a spring allergy and was likely suppressing a cough. Regarding the photograph, Clinton said that she was unaware of the photographer in the room as she was so focused on the situation. Analysis Some historians have commented on the historical significance of the photograph, particularly its depiction of the crossing of gender and racial boundaries. Lehigh University political science professor Saladin Ambar said that the picture suggests \\"a new American landscape that we're still crossing into\\". He continued \\"When Obama was elected, there were some people who thought that we had crossed a racial threshold. What his presidency is revealing is that there are many crossings.\\" The photograph has also been noted to depict a change in presidential leadership style. Historian Clarence Lusane said that past presidents have felt a need to project \\"machismo\\" and \\"swagger\\". Meredith College sociology professor Lori Brown said it is significant however, that Obama is neither in the center of the room nor in the tallest chair. Political analyst Cheryl Contee said \\"Obama's willingness to be photographed without the typical Oval Office swagger gives birth to a new type of swagger.\\" She said that the image shows Obama's leadership style as a collaborator. The New York Times commented on Clinton's expression in the photograph, writing, \\"She is what the French critic Roland Barthes called the 'punctum,' the not necessarily conspicuous detail that gives a photograph its emotional resonance.\\" They also stated the mystery of the photograph‚Äîwhat are they looking at?‚Äîwas analogous to the uncertainty of Western democracy's relationship with Islamic militant terrorism. ‚Äì Also in print: May 8, 2011, New York Edition WK4 Ambar stated that the photograph also shows how entrenched women have become in U.S. politics; Clinton and Audrey Tomason are in the photograph, while the similar photograph of John F. Kennedy and his staff during the Cuban Missile Crisis does not show any women. Lori Brown said in a CNN article that the photograph also shows how women have made progress in U.S. political life, although Brown said that Clinton's visible reaction dulled the impact somewhat, because women \\"are often more physical in their emotional responses and in a 'power situation' it may not seem as acceptable\\". Until the publishing of the photograph, Audrey F. Tomason, a woman identified by the White House as the Director for Counterterrorism, was unknown to the public. After the publication of the photo, because of the apparent proximity to U.S. President Barack Obama seen in the photograph, various rumors appeared regarding what her role is. She was the only woman, other than Hillary Clinton, in the photograph. She also appeared to be the only person in the photograph under 40 years of age.Stone, Daniel. \\"Audrey Tomason: Situation Room Mystery Woman.\\" The Daily Beast. Tuesday May 3, 2011. Retrieved on May 10, 2011. Alexis Madrigal, a senior editor at The Atlantic, said that Tomason \\"appeared to be an outlier in a room filled with the Administration's heaviest hitters\\". Tommy Vietor, a United States National Security Council spokesperson, said that there were other young staffers in the room, but Tomason was the only one in the photograph. Vietor said \\"[t]here were at least half a dozen people with similar profiles in the immediate vicinity where that photo was taken.\\" Madrigal added \\"The luck of the camera's gaze means that history will be able to place Tomason at a decisive moment in war on terrorism, but not her colleagues.\\"Madrigal, Alexis. \\"The Other Audrey Tomasons in the Situation Room.\\" The Atlantic. May 10, 2011. Retrieved on May 10, 2011. Little information is publicly available about Tomason, although Tufts University later confirmed that she is a Tufts graduate. Robert Cardillo, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, was cropped from the photo and was seated to the right of Vice President Biden. Alteration in Hasidic newspapers Proverbs 11:10) Di Tzeitung (The Journal), a Satmar Hasidic newspaper from Brooklyn, edited the image to remove Clinton and Tomason due to its policy of not running photographs with women because of modesty laws. The newspaper subsequently apologized for altering the image in breach of the terms of its release. The Washington Post subsequently issued a correction, noting that Di Tzeitung had not violated any White House copyright because the photograph was \\"in the public domain from the moment of inception\\". In addition, Dee Voch (The Week), a weekly Hasidic magazine from Brooklyn, also edited out the women.Bell, Melissa. \\"Second Hasidic newspaper drops Hillary Clinton and Audrey Tomason.\\" The Washington Post. May 10, 2011. Retrieved on May 10, 2011. The editing of images of women out of photographs is a common practice of Haredi newspapers. While some interpreted this practice as a result of inequality to women's rights in Hasidic Judaism, Di Tzeitung, in its statement, said it was done only because of modesty reasons, and should in no way be seen as degrading of women. Other uses The photograph was used satirically on the cover of the 13 May 2011 issue of Private Eye magazine, suggesting that the people present were witnessing a massacre of the Liberal Democrats party in British local elections. In the season 5 finale of the Netflix TV show House Of Cards, fictional President Claire Underwood and her cabinet conduct a military operation in the White House Situation Room. The angle of the camera shot, placement of actors in the scene, their clothing, and even the placement of computers and coffee cups on the table, directly mimic Souza's photograph.https://imgur.com/r/HouseOfCards/0HQQr\\" The photograph was also mimicked in a shot in Bong Joon-ho's film Okja, only with a corporation taking the place of the U.S. government.
