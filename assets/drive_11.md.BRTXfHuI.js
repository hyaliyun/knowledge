The burial mound is over in diameter and was first excavated by the local archeaologist Thomas Bateman in 1846. The chambers have paved floors. Bateman discovered the remains of at least twelve human skeletons.

It is sometimes known as Grey Ladies. Description Nine Stones Close is a small stone circle is located on the edge of Harthill Moor in Derbyshire, part of a rich prehistoric landscape which includes Bronze Age barrows and settlement enclosures. It consists of four remaining upright stones which were originally part of a circle of around 30m in diameter, plus the sites of several others which were removed in the 18th and 19th centuries. One of the stones that was appropriated in the 18th century is now used as an oversized field gatepost nearby. It is uncertain whether there were originally nine stones, one theory being that nine is a corruption of 'noon', said to be the time when, according to local folklore, fairies would gather at the site to dance. Excavations in 1847, 1877 and 1939 found flints and pot-sherds which date the monument to the Bronze Age.

Born in Columbus, Ohio, Steinmetz received his BA in English from Wheaton College in Illinois (1958) and his BD from Drew University (1961). In 1961 he was ordained an elder in the Methodist Church. He moved to Harvard University where he took a ThD (1967) under the direction of the prominent Dutch Reformation historian Heiko Oberman. Before coming to Duke University, where he spent most of his academic career, he taught for five years (1966-1971) at Lancaster Theological Seminary. At the Duke Divinity School, he served as the Amos Ragan Kearns Distinguished Professor of the History of Christianity and was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006. He also served as a Visiting Professor at Harvard (1977), Notre Dame (1993, 1997, 2005, 2008), and Emory (2010) universities. In 1959 Steinmetz married Virginia Ruth Verploegh, an English teacher from Chicago whom he met at Wheaton. Virginia earned her MA in English at Temple University and her PhD at Duke University. She taught for several years at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, before she was appointed as Duke‚Äôs first director of graduate student career services. The couple have two children: Claire Elise and Matthew Eliot. Steinmetz taught courses at Duke in four departments: the historical division of the Divinity School, the joint program in Graduate Religion, the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and the Department of German. In 1985 he was elected president of the American Society of Church History. In 1986 he was chosen as the first president of the American Friends of the Herzog August Bibliothek in Germany. In addition to his reputation as a productive scholar, Steinmetz was known as a lively and entertaining lecturer, who could win over students disinclined to take history seriously, No one was therefore surprised when he won a teaching prize in 1986 and was named the Duke University Scholar/Teacher of the year. His prose style, written and spoken, was admired by critics for its clarity, its elegance, and its dry humor. Steinmetz was an intellectual historian and a specialist in the history of Christian thought in late medieval and early modern Europe. His earliest works explored the reception of the teaching of St. Augustine in the later Middle Ages, determining if possible the intellectual influence such late medieval Augustinianism might have exercised on Martin Luther. Luther‚Äôs early thought was often articulated in biblical commentaries and lectures. This fact led Steinmetz to take a fresh look at the history of biblical interpretation. Typically, historians were satisfied if they tried to analyze Luther‚Äôs hermeneutical theory (rather than his exegesis). But Steinmetz was dissatisfied with what he regarded as an exclusive interest in hermeneutics and concluded that such an approach, while useful, was woefully inadequate. What historians needed was something more than a critical review of interpretive theory; what they needed was a wholesale immersion of their minds in the exegesis itself. Steinmetz argued that exegesis could not be understood properly in isolation from its own larger context. Unless historians developed a comparative approach to their texts, reading as many commentaries as possible on each biblical passage, they would never understand what biblical exegesis could tell them about the intellectual world they were studying. Steinmetz shifted the focus of his studies from Luther‚Äôs early theology to the theology and exegesis of Luther‚Äôs younger contemporary, John Calvin. Using as many as 60 early modern commentaries on Paul‚Äôs Letter to the Romans, Steinmetz looked at Calvin‚Äôs theological development through the lens of medieval and early modern interpretations of Paul. By placing Calvin‚Äôs exegesis in its proper context he could now tell Calvin‚Äôs ordinary comments (broadly shared by his contemporaries) from his original insights. The late Heiko Oberman characterized Steinmetz‚Äôs study of Calvin as an ‚Äúexquisite contribution to Calvin scholarship‚Äù that ‚Äúsucceeds in tracing the precise profile of Calvin as biblical interpreter.‚Äù Barbara Pitkin called his Calvin scholarship a ‚Äúcollection of path-breaking studies‚Äù that ‚Äúset investigation into Calvin‚Äôs biblical interpretation on a new footing,‚Äù[2] In 1996 Steinmetz was honored by his students with a Festschrift, Biblical Interpretation in the Era of the Reformation, and in 2006 was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2008 he and his wife endowed the annual Steinmetz Lectures in Historical Theology. Shortly thereafter (2009) he retired as the Kearns Distinguished Professor Emeritus and was awarded the Distinguished Career Award of the American Society of Church History (2010). At the same time (2010) Emory University offered him a visiting post as the McDonald Distinguished Professor of History, a gift that enabled him to lay the intellectual foundations for his next book, The Catholic Calvin.

Kutzbach (born June 14, 1937, Reedsburg, Wisconsin) is a climate scientist who pioneered the use of climate models to investigate the causes and effects of large changes of climate of the past.  Career  John E. Kutzbach is Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He is a former Director and now a Senior Scientist in the Center for Climatic Research (UW-Madison). Kutzbach earned an undergraduate degree in engineering (1960), a M.S. degree (1961) and a Ph.D. (1966) in atmospheric science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was an aviation weather forecaster in the United States Air Force, stationed in France (1961‚Äì1963). He joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty in 1966, was named Plaenert-Bascom Professor of Liberal Arts in 1990, and has been Professor Emeritus since 2002. He has been a regular summer visiting researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder Colorado, since 1975. He assisted in the early planning of international climate research meetings and reports as a member of the Joint WMO/ICSU Planning Staff and the WMO GARP Activities Office at the World Meteorological Organization, Geneva Switzerland (1974). He has held one-year visiting appointments at the Meteorological Office of the United Kingdom, Bracknell, England (1968) and the Univ. of Bonn, Germany (1978), and shorter visiting appointments at the Max- Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany (1999); the Univ. of Alaska ‚Äì Fairbanks (2004); and the Univ. of Western Australia, Perth (2009). Gisela Hanebuth and John Kutzbach were married in Berlin, Germany on September 17, 1965. They both had careers as professors at University of Wisconsin- Madison. They have three children ‚Äì Angela Kutzbach Currie, Katrina Kutzbach Martin, and Mark Kutzbach, and six grandchildren.  Scientific accomplishments  Kutzbach pioneered the use of climate models to investigate the causes and effects of large-scale changes of climate of the past. He showed how changes in earth‚Äôs orbital parameters (eccentricity, precession, tilt) caused long-period changes in the tropical monsoons of Africa and Asia (1981,1982). He collaborated with an international group of paleoecologists, glaciologists, geomorphologists, and marine geologists in using field observations of past climate and environments in evaluating simulations of global climate from the last glacial maximum, 21000 years ago, to the present (1985, 1988, 1993a).Sarah E. Metcalfe, David J. Nash - Quaternary Environmental Change in the Tropics - 2012 p13 \\"Climate models are derived from weather forecasting models, originally conceived by John von Neumann who founded ... John Kutzbach and his co-authors led the way in exploring drivers of change in the monsoon using the NCAR CCM\\" This interdisciplinary project, the Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project (KutzbachCOHMAP), was among the early examples of broad international and interdisciplinary collaboration in studies of past climate, and was a forerunner of programs such as the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP). Kutzbach‚Äôs interdisciplinary collaboration continued in studies of earlier geologic eras using climate models to investigate the effects of large changes in earth‚Äôs orography (1989a, 2001), the altered land/ocean configuration of Pangea (1989b, 1993b), and long-period changes of orbital parameters (2014). In early years he helped introduce to the atmospheric sciences the use of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to identify large-scale and long-period modes of atmospheric circulation (1970). In recent years he has contributed to studies of how humans have been influenced by climate and climatic change (2014), contributed to its change (2010, 2016), and face potential future impacts (2007a). He has authored or coauthored over 200 papers published in scientific journals. A symposium honoring his contributions was held in 2004; the collected papers of the symposium are published (2007b).  Awards and honors  Kutzbach was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2006. He has also received the Roger Revelle Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 2006, the Milankovitch Medal of the European Geophysical Society in 2001, the Humboldt Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany in 1976, the Distinguished Career Achievement Award of the American Quaternary Association in 2003, and the International Science and Technology Award of China in 2017. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Meteorological Society.

They are most often associated with personality tests, but can also be applied to other psychological constructs such as mood or psychopathology. There are three commonly used general strategies: Inductive, Deductive, and Empirical. Scales created today will often incorporate elements of all three methods.  Inductive  Also known as itemetric or internal consistency methods. The inductive method begins by constructing a wide variety of items with little or no relation to an established theory or previous measure. The group of items is then answered by a large number of participants and analyzed using various statistical methods, such as exploratory factor analysis or principal component analysis. These methods allow researchers to analyze natural relationships among the questions and then label components of the scale based on how the questions group together. The Five Factor Model of personality was developed using this method. Advantages of this method include the opportunity to discover previously unidentified or unexpected relationships between items or constructs. It also may allow for the development of subtle items that prevent test takers from knowing what is being measured and may represent the actual structure of a construct better than a pre-developed theory. Criticisms include a vulnerability to finding item relationships that do not apply to a broader population, difficulty identifying what may be measured in each component because of confusing item relationships, or constructs that were not fully addressed by the originally created questions.  Deductive  Also known as rational, intuitive, or deductive method. The deductive method begins by developing a theory for the construct of interest. This may include the use of a previously established theory. After this, items are created that are believed to measure each facet of the construct of interest. After item creation, initial items are selected or eliminated based upon which will result in the strongest internal validity for each scale. Advantages of this method include clearly defined and face valid questions for each measure. Measures are also more likely to apply across populations. Additionally, it requires less statistical methodology for initial development, and will often outperform other methods while requiring fewer items. However, the construct of interest must be well understood to create a thorough measure, and it may be difficult to prevent or determine if individuals are faking on the measure.  Empirical  Also known as External or Criterion Group method. Empirical test construction attempts to create a measure that differentiates between different established groups. For example, this may include depressed and non- depressed individuals, or individuals high or low in levels of aggression. The goal of item creation is to find items that will be answered differently by the groups of interest. Items are traditionally constructed without expectation for how they will be answered by each group. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory was initially developed using this method. This method primarily differs from the inductive method in the way items are selected. While inductive methods select items based upon factor loadings, empirical items are selected based upon validity coefficients and their ability to accurately predict group membership. However, the empirical method shares many of the strengths and weaknesses of atheoretical item creation with inductive methods, while also having an initial item pool more likely to relate to the topic of interest.

In the final against Scotstown, Mac Niallais was again awarded the \\"Laoch na hImeartha\\" (man of the match) after scoring four points, including three frees. Inter-county Mac Niallais was first called into the Donegal senior team as an 18-year-old in the winter of 2011 by manager Jim McGuinness. He played in the 2012 Dr McKenna Cup but injuries hampered his progress that year for club and county. He returned to training ahead of the next season and played in the 2013 Dr McKenna Cup. During that competition, he scored an early goal against St Mary's in a one-point win at MacCumhaill Park. In the 2013 National Football League he made substitute appearances against Down in the second game and against Dublin in Donegal's final league game of the season, both in Ballybofey. He also played in the under-21 team that lost to Cavan in the 2013 Ulster final. Mac Niallais arrived in 2014 having played around a half-an-hour of meaningful senior inter-county football for Donegal. That year would bring his first league start - against Laois at O'Moore Park. He palmed home a goal in the twelfth minute and scored a point later in the same match. The year also brought games in the Senior Championship for Mac Niallais for the first time. Called onto the field when Donegal were forced to make emergency reparations to the midfield following injuries to Rory Kavanagh and Neil Gallagher, Mac Niallais scored four points and collected the man of the match award in the Ulster semi-final against Antrim at Clones. He then won his first Ulster senior title, helping himself to three points in the final against Monaghan. Under the management of Rory Gallagher, Mac Niallais scored a 52nd-minute goal against Derry from a distance of 20 metres in the opening fixture of the 2015 National Football League. He scored 1‚Äì4 against Cork in the 2016 National Football League. Mac Niallais scored a brace in the seven- point 2016 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final victory over Fermanagh. He scored another goal in the 55th minute of the semi-final against Monaghan. He later left the Donegal team. He headed stateside. Mac Niallais returned to the Donegal team under the management of Declan Bonner in 2018. He scored 1‚Äì2 against Kerry in the opening round of the 2018 National Football League in Killarney and repeated the feat against Tyrone in Omagh during the fifth round of fixtures. He started the final and scored a point as Donegal secured the 2018 Ulster Senior Football Championship. Following the death of a clubmate in a car accident in January 2019, Mac Niallais opted out of the Donegal panel that year. He thus missed out on the 2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship, which Donegal won. But from September 2019, Mac Niallais met regularly with county manager Bonner. By November, Mac Niallais had decided to return to the team. \\"At the same time\\", Mac Niallais later said, \\"it was still in the back of my mind to go away. I did say that to [Declan] and he was fine with it\\". In December 2019, Bonner confirmed that Mac Niallais had opted out of the Donegal panel for 2020. In February 2020, Mac Niallais moved to Crouch End, close to Britain's Alexandra Palace, with the intention of playing football for North London Shamrocks. He had contemplated going to join friends in Sydney; however, the arrival of a then 18-month-old godson convinced him to remain closer to family. In March 2020, he spoke about the intensity of committing to inter-county football: \\"Your life's completely taken over by it. It's gone to extreme levels where personally, I don't know. I wasn't built for that kinda stuff. I obviously used to love it but after a few years of doing it, I nearly had enough of it. I wouldn't be a big fan of the travelling. If training was down in Magheragallon every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, I'd be there every time, I'd play for Donegal no bother\\". Personal life He plays golf (reaching a handicap of 14 in early 2020) at his local club, located close to the Gaoth Dobhair GAA club's base. He has also been a regular snooker player in Letterkenny.

Three of its six members grew up in the small town of Tamworth in rural New South Wales, which is also Australia's Country Music Capital and their country roots are frequently reflected in the band's lyrics. The band has been described as the saviours of Australian Country, and is widely respected for its bitingly satirical and dense storytelling lyrics. To date, the band has released three studio albums: Classic Country Hits (2004), Once Upon A Time in Australia (2006)and Terror Australis (2009). History Vocalist and Lyricist Mitch Hell was raised in Tamworth in rural New South Wales. After moving to Sydney and fronting various punk, straight edge, hardcore and Oi! bands he met up with former high school mate and fellow Tamworth survivor Paddy 'Toots' McHugh in spring of 2001. The pair wrote their first song the now infamous 'Whiskey in the Sun' in the early 2002 and recorded several incarnations of this song over the next year mostly as a joke, poking fun of where they were raised. However it wasn‚Äôt until 2003 with the addition of another Tamworth survivor Matthew 'Browny' Brown the band really started taking shape. The three Tamworth boys dragged in whatever musicians they could find and busked on the streets of Tamworth during the 2003 Country Music Festival, playing mainly covers by Merle Haggard, David Allen Coe, The Descendents and The Clash. After the festival and inspired by the thrill of performing the boys went into 'Hilltop Studios' in Tamworth to record a demo with the idea of getting a real band together. The demo worked and by mid-2003 the boys had recruited a drummer Angus Howie (also a Tamworth survivor) a bass player Pig Barnett and even a fiddle player Jim Eric Bones whom was then playing guitar for death metal band Punisha. All six of the boys rehearsed and in late 2003 went back into 'Hilltop Studio' to record their first EP the now legendary \\"Classic Cuntry Hits.\\" Over the next year the boys worked hard playing any gig going and writing as much as possible. They became inspired by old Australian bush and folk bands such as Redgum, Roaring Jack and Dingo. They were also heavily influenced by Celtic punk bands such as the Pogues and Flogging Molly. All these influences were used and shaped to make the band's first full-length album 'Once Upon A Time in Australia' which was released on Scott Mac of Toe to Toe's label Sold Our Souls. The album was released to much success and sold over 5,000 copies. Off the back of this the boys played across Australia with a plethora of local and international bands. Continuing to work hard the boys suffered some casualties of the road. They lost drummer Angus Howie to the glitzy world of TV Ratings and he was replaced by Irish Austin Citizen. With a new energy the boys set about writing for their next album. Another set back was the loss of the unflappable Pig on bass. R.I.P brother. He was replaced with good friend Jim Mongrel from various south coast punk bands, most notably Run For Cover. It was with this new line up the boys went in to record at the 'Brain Studios' in Surry Hills, Sydney in early 2009 producing the third and final full-length album 'Terror Australis'. In 2013 the entire back catalog was released as a downloads on bandcamp.

The race took place at York on 13 May 1851 for a purse of 1,000 sovereigns. Background The Flying Dutchman was a 5-year-old, who had won the 1849 Epsom Derby and St Leger and, as a 4-year-old, the 1850 Ascot Gold Cup. So dominant had he been that the whip had only been raised on him on one occasion in his entire career - at Epsom. Voltigeur was a year younger, and in 1850 had followed The Flying Dutchman's by taking both The Derby and St Leger (in a rematch after an initial dead heat). In winning the Derby, he had posted a time ten seconds faster than that of The Flying Dutchman the year previously. Two days after Voltigeur's St Leger victory, the two horses met for the first time in the Doncaster Cup. The younger horse was in receipt of 19 pounds from his rival and as a result, the previously unbeaten Flying Dutchman went down to a half-length defeat, although in some ways the victory was deemed unsatisfactory. Rumours abounded that the Flying Dutchman's jockey, Charles Marlow, was the worse for drink and consequently ignored instructions to wait on the colt, declaring \\"I'll show you what I've got under me today!\\" and setting a ridiculously fast pace. It was subsequently agreed that the two would meet again the following spring for a purse of 2,000 guineas, with each owner putting up half the stake. Race The famous handicapper Henry John Rous set the weights for the second match, giving The Flying Dutchman a weight of 120¬Ω pounds to Voltigeur's 112. The race between the two Yorkshire horses proved extremely popular, drawing a crowd of between 100,000 and 150,000, an all-time record for York. Some even walked from as far afield as Richmond, North Yorkshire to be there. Even the horses' exercise gallops attracted large crowds of fans attempting to assess their relative condition. Unlike their previous meeting, The Flying Dutchman was successfully restrained in the early stages as Voltigeur, under Nat Flatman, made the running. In the final furlong the Flying Dutchman moved up level with his rival and then pulled ahead to win by a length. Aftermath The event was immortalised in paintings by Harry Hall, first exhibited in Buchanan Street, Glasgow later that year, and John F. Herring, whose work became so famous there was scarcely a village in the British Empire without a copy. As for the horses, The Flying Dutchman was retired to stud after the race. Voltigeur, on the other hand, carried on racing. The very day after the match race, he went down to defeat in the Ainsty Hunt Cup, conceding 37 pounds to a classy filly named Nancy. The next season, when he was five, he won the race named in honour of his old rival, The Flying Dutchman Handicap, run at York, before finishing unplaced in his final three racecourse appearances, including the Ascot Gold Cup, and then retiring to stud himself.

Location Commonly said to lie on Ilkley Moor and Burley Moor, the Twelve Apostles are located within the parish of Burley in Wharfedale. The stone circle is slightly below and to the northeast of an east-west ridge at about 381 metres above sea level. The circle is just over 800 metres north-west of the Grubstones circle.James Dyer, (2001), Discovering Prehistoric England, page 230. Osprey Publishing. Description The Twelve Apostles consists of the remains of a stone circle with a diameter of about 15 metres.Rodney Castleden, (1992), Neolithic Britain: New Stone Age Sites of England, Scotland, and Wales, page 259, Routledge. The circle originally had between 16 and 20 stones, but it is now reduced to 12 stones. The stones are made from the local millstone grit. All of the stones were fallen by the mid-20th-century and were lying loose upon the ground. The circle was inside a bank 1.2 metres wide and 0.6 metres high. The bank was still traceable in the 1920s but has apparently eroded since then due to visitors walking over the ground. At the centre of the circle was a small mound, which may have been the disturbed remains of a burial cairn. In 1971 a group of amateurs made an unauthorised attempt to re-erect the fallen stones, but the stones soon fell again. The stones have since been re-erected.Twelve Apostles - West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service, retrieved 7 November 2013 It is not clear who re-erected them, nor when. The site suffers severe visitor erosion, as it was formerly hidden beneath heather, but is now in an area of bare trampled soil.

Nikk began his career as a pharmacist in Queensland, undertaking his apprenticeship at the Friendly Societies‚Äô Dispensary in Maryborough. He then practiced as a locum throughout Queensland before settling in Mackay. It was here that he partnered with Dr F. N. Hales to form National Products, a company to indent and supply reagent chemicals, scientific glassware and equipment to Queensland Sugar Mills. Nikk spent some time as a Pharmaceutical Detailer following the dissolution of the business partnership in Mackay, before World War II broke out and he was directed by the Medical Co-ordination Committee to approved technical occupation. He became the chemist in charge of the emergency laboratory producing galenicals and preparations for pharmaceutical use, and also essences, food colours, and preservatives for the baking, confectionery and cordial making trades. Following the end of the war, Nikk took up the position of pharmacist at Townsville General Hospital in 1954. At this time he took a keen interest in a number of pharmacy organisations, including the Miscellaneous Workers‚Äô Union, forming and establishing the second sub-branch in Australia of the Miscellaneous Worker‚Äôs Union and was elected foundation president, a position he held until his relocation from Townsville to New South Wales in 1958. Nikk‚Äôs relocation to New South Wales was to take up the position of Chief Pharmacist at the Sutherland District Hospital at Caringbah. It was here that he joined the Institutional and Industrial Pharmacists‚Äô group and was elected to the committee. From here he joined with Mavis Sweeney, the only member of the Society of Hospital Chemists of Australia (now known as The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia) and was elected foundation president of the New South Wales state branch of the now SHPA. In his time as president of the NSW branch, he lobbied the State Health Department to allow Bachelor of Pharmacy graduates to choose to undertake their pre-registration training in NSW state hospitals rather than in a community pharmacy, and successfully had the legislation amended.

It was developed by Hewitt Pegues Tomlin, Jr. and his sister, Francess Tigrett. The mall included a branch of Kisber's, a department store that had been a downtown Jackson fixture since 1906. Around 1978, the mall was enclosed, and a new Kisber's department store was built behind the mall's original one. In 1985, Richard E. Jacobs Group acquired the mall. By this point, the mall's anchors alongside Kisber's included Memphis- based Goldsmith's, and national retailers J. C. Penney and Sears. By 1996, Kisber's had become Belk. CBL & Associates Properties bought 21 malls from the Jacobs group in 2000, including Old Hickory. Changes that followed the CBL acquisition included an Abercrombie & Fitch store opening in 2003, displacing the food court; and a conversion of the mall's Goldsmith's store to Macy's in 2005. Despite the loss of the food court, as of 2013, there is a seating area and a handful of establishments to purchase food from.

Dwarfism in chickens is an inherited condition found in chickens consisting of a significant delayed growth, resulting in adult individuals with a distinctive small size in comparison with normal specimens of the same breed or population. The affected birds show no signs of dwarfism in the first weeks of age.Hutt, F.B. Genetics of the fowl. McGraw-Hill Book Co. N.Y. 1949. Differences in size due to dwarfism appear slow and progressively along the growing stage.

At this point differences between normal and dwarf sibs is evident in all males and in 98% of the females. Dwarfs chickens reach sexual maturity and reproduce normally. Dwarfism in chickens has been found to be controlled by several simple genetic factors. Some types are autosomic while others are sex-linked, but when poultry breeders make reference to 'dwarf chickens' they usually refer implicitly to sex-linked recessive dwarfism due to the recessive gene dw, located on the Z chromosome. As sex-linked dwarf broiler breeder hens can bring about normal sized broiler chickens, sex-linked recessive dwarfism found application in poultry industry since the last decades of the 20th century. These hens require less food and less housing space. Their feed intake do not need to be restricted. They also have more tolerance to heat (see: Advantages...). So the use of sex-linked dwarf broiler female parent stocks helps to save costs and to improve animal welfare and economic efficiency in European broiler industry (see: Use of...). But in spite of the proven advantages of raising dwarf breeder hens, their use is not generalized in broiler industry. Autosomal types of dwarfism Two different types of autosomal dwarfisms have been found in chickens. These types of dwarfism are controlled by genes located on the autosomal chromosomes so inherits the same way in both sexes. Thyrogenous dwarfism, td In 1929 a type of dwarfism was described in different breeds of Rhode Island Red chickens.Landauer, W. 1929 Thyrogenous dwarfism (myxoedema infantilis) in the domestic fowl. Am. J . Anat. 43, 1-43.Mayhew, R. L. and Upp, C. W. 1932 Inherited (?) dwarfism in the fowl. J. Hered. 23, 269-276.Upp, C. W. 1932 Notes on a form of dwarfism encountered in Rhode Island Red fowls. Poult. Sci. 11, 370-371.Upp, C. W. 1934 Further data on the inheritance of dwarfism in fowls. Poult. Sci. 13, 157-165. This type of dwarfism produced individuals which showed a general growth delay, which was recognizable since two or three weeks of age. The outer toe was curved backwards. The skull was high and wide in relation to its length and the upper beak was curved downwards. Tongue was shortened and tumescent. Legs shortened, more in the metatarsal than in the femur. The condition was semi-lethal. None of the affected birds reached sexual maturity. It was considered as the result of a dysfunction of the thyroid gland, similar to the human pathological condition known as myxoedema infantilis. Dwarfs of this type were homozygotes for an autosomal recessive gene td (thyrogenous dwarfism). Autosomal dwarfism, adw Another body size mutation was found in the experimental Cornell K-strain of chickens. Body size was reduced by about 30% and the affected birds were recognizable by 6 to 8 weeks of age. Their sexual maturity was somewhat delayed and rate of lay was about 90% that of the K-strain. Viability of the carriers was good but hatchability was poor. The condition was due to an autosomal recessive gene designed adw. The ultimate goal of the modern genetic studies is to find out the underlying genes involved in these traits. To achieve this, the so-called positional candidate gene approach is gaining in importance. This approach is based on the genetic localization of a trait using genetic linkage analysis. Subsequent comparative mapping of the trait locus with the gene-rich maps of the human and the mouse may reveal candidate genes for the trait in question. Comparative mapping revealed that autosomal dwarfism in the chicken (adw) is located in a chromosomal region that is conserved between chicken, human and mouse. In the mouse the phenotype \\"Pygmy\\", similar to chicken adw is also located in that region. The Pygmy mouse phenotype arises from the inactivation of the High Mobility Group I-C (HMGCI-C). In the human the HMGCI-C gene is also located in the same conserved chromosomal segment. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of chicken metaphase chromosomes using the chicken HMGI-C gene as a probe, showed that the chicken HMGI-C gene is indeed located in the region of the adw locus.Ruyter-Spira, C.P. 1998 Analysis of the chicken genome : mapping of monogenic traits (PhD thesis)Wageningen UR Library Catalogue. Record #956960 Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is another candidate for adw in the chicken.Ruyter-Spira, C.P. et al. 1998 Nucleotide sequence of the chicken HMGI-C cDNA and expression of the HMGI-C and IGF1 genes in autosomal dwarf chicken embryos. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression. Volume 1399, Issue 1, 30 July 1998, pp. 83‚Äì87 Sex-linked dwarfism In birds, female is the heterogametic sex, that is, it has one Z and one W sexual chromosome (genotype ZW), while male (the homogametic sex) carries two Z chromosomes (genotype ZZ). Thus, reciprocal crosses between normal and dwarf specimens may give rather different results. Sex-linked recessive dwarfism, dw Hutt studied in the 1940s a remarkable type of dwarfism caused by only one sex-linked recessive gene to which he assigned the symbol dw. This mutation reduces body weight in females by 26 to 32%, but the effect is still greater in homozygous males, by about 42-43%. Chicks are normal size.Guillaume, J. 1976 The Dwarfing Gene dw: Its Effects on Anatomy, Physiology, Nutrition, Management. Its Application in Poultry Industry World's Poultry Sci. J. 32,285-304.Somes, R. G. International Registry of Poultry Genetic Stocks. A Directory of Specialized Lines and Strains, Mutations, Breeds and Varieties of Chickens, Japanese Quail and Turkeys. Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, Bulletin #460, (1981). This is the best studied type of dwarfism in chickens. Sex-linked dwarfism in meat type breeds are first recognized by the shortening of the shanks than by the lowering body weight in the rearing periodPamp√≠n, M. et al 1988 Comparison of dwarf and normal White Plymouth Rock birds in the growing stage (original in Spanish) Revista Cubana de Ciencia Av√≠cola Vol.15:31-37 There are no signs of sex-linked dwarfism in the first weeks of age. Some individuals can be identified as dwarfs at 8‚Äì10 weeks of age, but classification is more precise when the chickens are five months old or more. At this point differences between normal and dwarf sibs is evident in all males and in 98% of the females. These dwarfs reach sexual maturity and reproduce normally. Normal females are always of genotype Dw/-, while dwarf females are always of genotype dw/-, because female is the heterogametic sex having only one Z chromosome. That is, females carrying a sex-linked gene of dwarfism are always pure and exhibit the trait. On the other hand, normal males may be either homozygous Dw/Dw or heterozygous Dw/dw, but dwarf males are always homozygous dw/dw. Double dose of dwarf gene causes the dwarfism to be much more evident in males than in females. The above picture illustrates the comparative size of two full-sib roosters born the same day: Left: Normal sibling of genotype Dw/dw. Right: Dwarf sibling of genotype dw/dw. =Hormonal causes of dwarfism= Among the main factors involved in growth regulation, thyroid hormones tiroxine (T4) triiodothyronine (T3), growth hormone (GH), and its related growth factor, Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), were the most studied in dwarfs.Scanes, C.G. 2009 Perspectives on the endocrinology of poultry growth and metabolism. General and Comparative Endocrinology Vol. 163, Issues 1‚Äì2, 1 September 2009, pp. 24‚Äì32 Sex-linked dwarf chickens are characterized by low circulating levels of T3 and IGF-I in spite of normal or even increased levels of T4 and GH. The T3 deficiency is explained by a lower peripheral activity of T4 monodeiodination which could be related to an abnormal T4 uptake by the cell, particularly the hepatocyte. The low production of IGF-I could be related to a deficient GH receptor, as suggested by the decreased GH binding observed in the liver of dwarf birds. Both T3 and IGF-I synthesis may share common pathways since thyroidectomy also decreases IGF-I level while a GH injection stimulates the T4 to T3 monodeiodination in the normal embryo but not in the dwarf. Further studies are needed on the GH receptor and the T4 uptake in the hepatic cell to identify the common point where the dwarf gene could act. Ovulation rate and lipomobilisation are decreased in adult dwarfs but these findings are not yet easily related to the endocrinological changes observed during growthTixier- Boichard, M. et al. 1989 Physiological studies on the sex-linked dwarfism of the fowl: a review on the search for the gene‚Äôs primary effect.

Bantam chickens are also called miniatures. These birds are popular as pets, but Bantam hens are also renowned for hatching and brooding because they are very protective mothers and will attack anything that gets near their young. The reciprocal crosses made between normal sized chickens with Bantams revealed that Bantams carry one or several sex-linked dominant genes that reduce body size.Jull, M.A. and Quinn, J.P. 1931 The inheritance of body weight in the domestic fowlMaw, A.J.G. 1935 The inheritance of skeletal dimensions in the domestic fowl. Sci. Agr. 16, 85-112. This mutation is present in Sebright Bantams and probably other bantams. This mutation is thought to be an allele at the Dw locus and to be different from the allele dw.Custodio, R.W.S. and Jaap, R.G. 1973 Sex-linked reduction of body size in Golden Sebright Bantams. Poultry Science 52:204-210. In genetics, the common convention is that most dominant alleles are written as capital letters and recessive alleles as lower-case letters (see: Dominance (genetics)). In spite of this, literature refers to the gene of Bantam dwarfism with the lower-case symbol dwB. MacDonald dwarfism, dwM A second type of sex-linked recessive dwarfism was found in a sex-linked dwarf chicken population. This mutation is thought to be an allele or the Dw locus and to be different from the dw allele. This conclusion is based on the fact that males heterozygous for dwM/dw produce female offspring which fall into two populations with respect to shank length.Hsu, P.L., Buckland, R.B. and Hawes, R.O. 1975 A new dwarf isolate in the chicken: a possible new allele at the dw locus Poultry Science 54:1315-1319. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether this allele is different or the same as the dwB allele. Up to the present level of knowledge the dominance order of the alleles of locus Dw is: dwB > Dw > dw. In other words, allele dwB for Bantam dwarfism is dominant over the normal allele Dw, and the last is dominant over the sex-linked recessive allele dw. The existence of a second recessive allele has not yet been confirmed. Use of sex-linked dwarfism in poultry industry Sex-linked recessive dwarfism found application in poultry industry in the last decades of the 20th century. The application in broiler production is based on the known fact that dwarf female parents give 100% normal progeny when they are mated with normal male parents. The resulting progeny males are 100% heterozygotes Dw/dw and the females are hemizygotes Dw/-. In commercial broiler chicken production the use of dwarf female parents acquired a great importance.Whitehead, C.C. et al. 1987 Reproductive performance of dwarf broileer breeders giving different food during the rearing and breeding periods and two lighting patterns. British Poultry Science Vol. 2:415-427 Nowadays, the majority of broiler breeders in Europe are the standard, fast growing genotype, but 18-20% of the broiler breeders are dwarf parental females that produce standard and alternative (medium or slow growing) broilers.de Jong, Ingrid C. and Swalander, M. 2011 Housing and management of broiler breeders and turkey breeders. Proceedings of the 30th Poultry Science Symposium, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, 2011. The use of dwarfism also found application in commercial egg production. Dwarf Leghorn layers need less housing space, so the main advantage is to allow a more efficient use of housing space producing more eggs per unit of surface, but the smallest size of their eggs imposes a serious drawback to this purpose. Advantages of broiler breeder hens Under current practice, normal parent poultry breeding stock potentially face welfare problems. Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, is associated with increased nutritious requirement and thus feed consumption, but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious welfare problem is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, in order to prevent health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger.de Jong, Ingrid. C. and Gu√©men√©, D. Welfare issues in broiler breeders. Poultry Welfare Symposium (Main lecture) Cervia, Italy, 18‚Äì22 May 2009 The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the \\"broiler breeder paradox\\".Decuypere, E. et al. 2010 The Broiler Breeder Paradox: ethical, genetic and physiological perspectives, and suggestions for solutions.

Retrieved June 25, 2012 Using dwarf broiler breeder hens is a good alternative, because dwarf hens combine relatively good reproductive fitness with ad libitum feeding. With respect to bird welfare the use of slow growing birds is a viable alternative to reduce the negative effects of feed restriction. Dwarf broiler breeders do not need to be (severely) feed restricted.Dawkins, M.S. and R Layton, R. 2012 Breeding for better welfare: genetic goals for broiler chickens and their parents.

Geography The line runs through the plains of West Bengal. From Howrah, it is first the Gangetic plains and then the basins of the Damodar, Rupnarayan and Kangsabati, thereby traversing Howrah, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur districts. Kolaghat Thermal Power Station, with its six tall chimneys, one for each of the 210 MW units, is a landmark on this line. Haldia dock complex handled 31.015 million tonnes of traffic in 2011‚Äì12. Haldia Refinery, one of the eight operating refineries of Indian Oil Corporation, was commissioned in 1975. Haldia Petrochemicals, a modern naphtha based petrochemical complex and the second largest project of its kind in India, has been a catalyst for the development of a large number of downstream industries. History Bengal Nagpur Railway opened to traffic its main line from Nagpur to Asansol in 1891. Sini, on the Nagpur-Asansol line, was connected to Kharagpur and Kolaghat in 1898‚Äì99. The Kharagpur-Cuttack section was also opened the same year. The Kolaghat-Howrah track was completed in 1899‚Äì1900. Kharagpur was connected to Howrah with the opening of the Rupnarayan bridge on 19 April 1900. The Panskura-Durgachak line was opened in 1968, at a time when Haldia Port was being constructed. It was subsequently extended to Haldia. Haldia Dock Complex, a part of Kolkata Port Trust, was commissioned in 1977. The Tamluk-Digha line was opened in 2004. Electrification The Howrah‚ÄìKharagpur line was electrified in 1967‚Äì69. The Panskura-Haldia line was electrified in 1974‚Äì76. Santragachi- Bankaranayabaj sector was electrified in 1984‚Äì85. All lines were electrified with 25 kV AC overhead system. EMU train services between Panskura and Haldia introduced in 1976 and direct EMU services between Howrah and Haldia in 1979. New lines Indian Railways propose to lay a new line connecting Sealdah and Haldia, with the distance being shorter by 70 km than the Howrah-Haldia track. There is a plan to connect Digha to Jaleswar on the Kharagpur-Puri line. The Howrah-Kharagpur stretch has three lines. There is a plan to build a fourth line for the Santragachi-Panskura-Kharagpur stretch. Car and loco sheds There are EMU car sheds at Tikiapara (for Howrah), Panskura and Kharagpur. Kharagpur has a diesel loco shed which houses WDM-2, WDM-3A and WDM-3B locos. Nimpura (for Kharagpur) has an electric loco shed. Santragachi has an electric loco shed and also an outstation trip shed. It houses WAP-4 and WAP-7 locos and can take in 50+ locos. Santragachi also has arrangements for rake maintenance. Kharagpur has workshops for loco, carriage and wagon overhaul. Speed limits The main line is classified as a \\"Group A\\" line which can take speeds up to 160 km/hr. The branch lines have speed limits within 100 km/hr. Railway reorganization The Bengal Nagpur Railway was nationalized in 1944.Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 with the portion of East Indian Railway Company east of Mughalsarai and the Bengal Nagpur Railway. In 1955, South Eastern Railway was carved out of Eastern Railway. It comprised lines mostly operated by BNR earlier.

Kim Il- sung The song is a four-square march. It features paired two bar phrases in an A-B-A form, with dotted rhythms. Percussion and brass instrumentation is intended to enhance the revolutionary tone of the song. The song, composed in 1946, is the earliest known work of art mentioning Kim Il-sung, and thus can be said to mark the beginning of his personality cult. In the early 1980s Kim Jong-il began promoting the song and it has since replaced \\"Aegukka\\", the national anthem, as the most important song played in public gatherings in the country. North Koreans typically know the lyrics by heart. The first two bars of the song are used as an interval signal on North Korean radio and television. According to North Korean sources, their satellites Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-1, launched in 1998, and Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-2, supposedly launched in a test on 5 April 2009, are broadcasting this song among other data.

It was built in 1891 by architect Haldor Larsen B√∏rve and used as a liquor store and restaurant until 1903, when the city took it over for use as a customs house. The building, which now holds offices for Statsbygg S√∏r, is located on Storgata 162, along the banks of the Porsgrunn River and just across from Porsgrunn City Hall. History In 1848, a consortium of shipowners and captains bought a plot of land between Storgata and the Porsgrunn River and built a shipyard there, which they named \\"Reform.\\" Starting a new shipyard at the time was a risky proposition, and initially their investment paid off, with six ships launched from the facility over a period of just five years. However, their luck soon ran out, and in 1853 all operations stopped entirely, the workforce was laid off and the warehouses, near modern-day Reynoldsparken, were closed. In order to cut down on seedy bars and liquor stores, the Norwegian parliament passed a law in 1871 that gave local governments permission to establish an organization (\\"samlag\\") with exclusive rights to sell and serve liquors in a municipality. The idea of having a government- sanctioned monopoly of alcohol sales in a city was inspired by the Swedish system and was a precursor to the modern Vinmonopolet, with the difference being that most of the profits went to local governments rather than the state government. In the spring of 1873, Porsgrunds Br√¶ndevinssamlag was created to capitalize on the new law, and in 1887 they received a licence to become the sole alcoholic beverage retailer in Porsgrunn. The samlag was very successful, and over the 24 years that it was in operation, it raised a total of 105,000 kroner for the city. The profits went towards road maintenance, social services, and above all, construction, funding in part the construction of a local library, swimming hall, and rail line between Porsgrunn and Larvik. In the 1880s, the city announced their plans to build a new wharf, called √òstre Porsgrunn Dampskipsbrygge, on the plot of the old \\"Reform\\" shipyard. Porsgrunds Br√¶ndevinssamlag acted quickly, purchasing a neighboring property in anticipation of the resulting influx of passengers. In 1891 they enlisted local architect Haldor Larsen B√∏rve to build on their new centrally-located property. This was B√∏rve's first major project as part of his newly formed architectural firm, which would later go on to build the new Porsgrunn City Hall across the street as well as many other local buildings, such as the V√•r Frue Church. The resulting Neo-Gothic brick building, referred to colloquially as \\"Samlagsg√•rden\\" or \\"Reformg√•rden,\\" contained three restaurants and a liquor store. However, by the end of the 1800s, public attitudes had turned against the samlag due to a growing temperance movement in the city. The movement, which objected to the samlag on moral grounds, was especially strong in Porsgrunn due to the efforts of local resident Carl Reynolds, founder of the Norwegian chapter of the International Organisation of Good Templars. Their efforts paid off on 10 April 1897, when a local referendum to break up the samlag and prohibit all sale and serving of liquor in the city passed with a 124 vote majority. Customs house The city had been looking for a new customs house to replace the old one in Frednes (now part of the Porsgrunn Maritime Museum), since it was considered too far away from the center of town. The location near the steamship wharf was seen as ideal, since it was very centrally located and saw a lot of boat traffic. In 1899, they bought a nearby plot of land with the intention of building a new customs house, but soon afterwards they got an offer to buy the old samlag building, to be renovated and furnished at the seller's expense. A 1902 report from Statens bygnignsinspektorat, the precursor to Statsbygg, said that since Reformg√•rden was \\"particularly well-suited for the customs house and other public offices, it is advisable that [the government] take over Reformg√•rden. It will never be built-in, and the government will have free access to the steamship pier.\\" When the Porsgrunn City Hall across the street burned down on 9 December 1901, many of the city's services needed new office space. The police force moved temporarily to another building while the new city hall was constructed, but it was decided to move the local post office permanently, with Reformg√•rden as its new home. In 1904, the post office was joined by offices for the district court and the national telegraph company, Televerket. The new owners of the property, Norwegian Customs (), moved into the building on 1 July 1904, which they bought for a sum of 63,500 kroner. The customs building housed these various government offices for many years, but slowly the other tenants began to move their operations elsewhere. First to go was the Televerket offices, which moved to a new building between Stangsgate and Skolegata where the local telephone exchange stood. Next went the post office, moving to the low building just north of the Customs House, and when the district court offices left, Norwegian Customs were the only tenants left in the building. Between 1949 and 1953 a small extension was built on the basement level at the back of the building, out towards the river. The Customs Office, which had been part of the Larvik Customs District since its inception, became part of Skien Customs District in 1969 and remained under its jurisdiction until 1993. Between 1993 and 1995, further restructuring of the districts took place and the Customs House became part of the newly created Telemark and Vestfold Customs District. In 1997, the customs office in Porsgrunn was deemed no longer necessary and closed, and the building once again lay vacant. Recent history The Customs House was bought by Statsbygg in 1999 as office space for their Statsbygg S√∏r division. With the help of Amlie's architectural firm in Stathelle they immediately conducted extensive restoration of the building's interior. The windows and all of the interior and exterior doors were taken out and replaced with new replicas. Some of the original features, such as the elaborately detailed ceilings, wall panels, and main staircase, were repaired and restored. Some parts of the interior were torn out, such as many non-load-bearing walls, ceilings, and floors that were mainly from the 1950s to 1980s. The building was also fitted with modern amenities such as HVAC, an elevator, and a fire sprinkler system. In 2000, the property came under the ownership of Entra Eiendom when the company split from Statsbygg and acquired all its commercial real estate. Statsbygg S√∏r's offices remained in the building, now leased from the new owners. The brick facade underwent repairs in 2003. The property returned to Statsbygg ownership on 31 December 2009, when the agency bought the building for a sum of 14.6 million kroner. The agency had nine months left on the lease but felt it prudent to buy the building for the financial advantage as well as to oversee the preservation of the historic building. A postcard depicting the Customs House on Storgata. Some of the figures in the photo were added by the photographer. Architecture The Customs House is a brick building in the Hannover-school Neo-Gothic style that displays many elements typical of the architectural style, including extensive use of steep gables, recessed wall surfaces, and Gothic pointed arches and window designs. The building is built with red brick alternating in parts with black glazed brick for contrast. The Customs House's main facade facing Storgata has two tall gables on either side and a lower gable in the center. The corner facing Porsgrunn City Hall is cut at a 45 degree angle to the other walls and is topped with a weather vane marked with 1891, the year of the building's completion. The corner also once featured a small balcony that has since been removed. One feature of the building that was very modern for the time was the use of cast iron on the building's exterior, specifically the columns that separate the double windows on the first floor. The columns are marked with \\"Porsgrunds mek. V√¶rksted,\\" which was a local foundry once located at the end of Porselensvegen, down the street from Porsgrunds Porsel√¶nsfabrik.

In the neighborhood of Manshiyat Nasr in Cairo, the Coptic community of Zaraeeb collects the trash of the city for decades and developed the most efficient and highly profitable recycling system on a global level. Still, the place is perceived as dirty, marginalized and segregated. To bring light on this community, with his team and the help of the local community, eL Seed created an anamorphic piece that covers almost 50 buildings only visible from a certain point of the Muqattam Mountain. The piece of art uses the words of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, a Coptic Bishop from the 3rd century, that said: ‚ÄòAnyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eye first.' : \\"The Zaraeeb community welcomed my team and me as if we were family. It was one of the most amazing human experiences I have ever had. They are generous, honest and strong people. They have been given the name of Zabaleen (the garbage people), but this is not how they call themselves. They don't live in the garbage but from the garbage; and it is not their garbage, but the garbage of the whole city.

Recent tensions in Tunisia have sparked a critical debate about the limits of artistic freedoms in the birthplace of the Arab Spring as it undergoes a nascent transition to democracy. \\"This project is not about decorating a mosque, it is about making art a visible actor in the process of cultural and political change,\\" comments el Seed, who started work on the mural on 20 July. \\"I truly believe that art can bring about fruitful debate, especially within the uncertain political climate right now in Tunisia.\\" The project was approved by the Governor of Gab√®s and the mosque's imam, Shaikh Slah Nacef.

It is currently open as a restaurant and bar. Mixology classes can be booked at The Tavern through Natchez Pilgrimage Tours. A package store and rum distillery are also in the works. New owners are Doug and Regina Charboneau. Regina is a nationally known chef with her original success on the west coast in San Francisco. History Pre-Revolution The King's Tavern building was built in 1769, making it the oldest structure in the old river port city of Natchez. When the British moved in and established the nearby Fort Panmure, the King's Tavern building was originally built to be a block house for the fort. As there was no saw mill near this frontier town, this building and other structures were constructed using beams taken from scrapped New Orleans sailing ships, which were brought to Natchez via mule. Another source of wood used in the King's Tavern building construction were barge boards from flat river boats, which were dismantled and sold after arriving in Natchez with their goods after traveling down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Boatmen couldn't take their flat boats back up these rivers, so they just added to their profit by selling the boats as wood, which was needed to build Natchez. Besides the wood, sun-dried bricks also were used as building material. The result is a building which has an ambiance and decor of another era from the outside. Though the outside of the Kings Tavern has the rustic 1780s authentic wooden brick architectural style, the inside is a lovely place for cozy, quiet, intimate meal or to host luncheons, dinner parties, receptions meetings. The King's Tavern also provides meals for the large tour buses full of visitors who are traveling along the Natchez Trace Pathway. Post- Revolution After the Revolutionary War in 1776, the British left the area, leaving the river port open for other interests. In 1789, a New Yorker by the name of Richard King moved his family to Natchez where he bought this block home and opened a combination tavern and inn, as well as the place where the town's mail was dropped off. His inn business was very successful because of the need for boatmen and weary stage riders to have a secure place to rest for the night. The upstairs rooms on the third floor were comfortable accommodations. Selling drinks to townspeople and visitors as well was also a money maker. He also found himself to be very popular with people, because he received and sent the town's mail. Everyone congregated on the steps of his tavern, socializing and reading their mail. He enjoyed a celebrity status, and he and his wife became prominent and very much respected people in Natchez. During this time, outlaws began settling in Natchez. They preyed on the boatmen and visitors, made a living from gambling and robbing people, sometimes not thinking twice of killing their victims. After selling their goods and their flat boats for lumber, boatmen would spend the night at the King's Tavern, and then head home along the Natchez Trace Pathway. This usually caused highwaymen outlaws to hold them up, and usually kill them. The infamous, sadistic Harpe brothers were outlaws who took delight in torturing, mutilating and finally killing their victims. The Harpe brothers as well as other such men would return to Natchez and stimulate the economy, sometimes staying at the King's Tavern, if not in the Natchez Under the Hill area, notorious for being a haven for people of questionable character. However, with the invention of the steamboat, which could travel down and up the river as well, the need for this dangerous travel along Natchez Trace ended with this form of modern transportation. This development cut down on the lucrative stage business significantly, dropping the economic activity taking place at the King's Tavern. Richard King sold the King's Tavern in 1817. The building was once again a private home, becoming the Postalwaith family home for several generations, a total of 150 years, beginning in 1823. Modern Day In 1973, the building was sold to a local investor and it eventually became a tavern and restaurant to serve both locals and visitors, taking the original name, the King's Tavern. Under new ownership The Tavern has reopened in the fall of 2013. The owners are using the farm-to-table concept using locally sourced quality ingredients. Offerings include specialty flat breads made in a wood-fired brick oven, salads, and desserts. Haunting, and Paranormal Activities One of the oldest buildings in Natchez built in the 1700‚Äôs. The city‚Äôs oldest standing building. King‚Äôs Tavern is rich in history, and that includes the paranormal kind. Considered the most haunted restaurant in Mississippi. The building is believed to be haunted by several ghosts. Including Madeline. The mistress of one of the tavern‚Äôs original owners. Although many believe Madeline was murdered by the wife of her lover. No one is sure what happened to her. In the 1930s, when the skeletal remains of three bodies. Two men and one woman one of which was assumed to be Madeline. Were found hidden in the wall behind the fireplace. A jeweled dagger was also found with the remains. Which was assumed to be the murder weapon. Aside from supernatural happenings believed to be caused by Madeline. Employees have reported hearing a phantom baby crying, seeing mysterious reflections appear in mirrors, and an unoccupied bed giving off a warmth as if someone was sleeping in it.

A complication to this process is that in some materials, G_R is not a constant value during the crack extension process.Zehnder, Alan T. (2012). \\"Fracture Mechanics\\".

ISSN 1613-7736 A plot of crack growth resistance G_R versus crack extension \\\\Delta a is called a crack growth resistance curve, or R-curve. A plot of energy release rate G versus crack extension \\\\Delta a for a particular loading configuration is called the driving force curve. The nature of the applied driving force curve relative to the material's R-curve determines the stability of a given crack. The usage of R-curves in fracture analysis is a more complex, but more comprehensive failure criteria compared to the common failure criteria that fracture occurs when G \\\\geq G_c where G_c is simply a constant value called the critical energy release rate. An R-curve based failure analysis takes into account the notion that a material's resistance to fracture is not necessarily constant during crack growth. R-curves can alternatively be discussed in terms of stress intensity factors (K) rather than energy release rates (G), where the R-curves can be expressed as the fracture toughness (K_{Ic}, sometimes referred to as K_{R}) as a function of crack length a.  Types of R-Curves  300px  Flat R-Curves  The simplest case of a material's crack resistance curve would be materials which exhibit a \\"flat R-curve\\" (G_R is constant with respect to \\\\Delta a). In materials with flat R-curves, as a crack propagates, the resistance to further crack propagation remains constant and thus, the common failure criteria of G \\\\geq G_c is largely valid. In these materials, if G increases as a function of \\\\Delta a (which is the case in many loading configurations and crack geometries), then as soon as the applied G exceeds G_c the crack will unstably grow to failure without ever halting. Physically, the independence of G_R from \\\\Delta a is indicative that in these materials the phenomena which are energetically costly during crack propagation do not evolve during crack propagation. This tends to be an accurate model for perfectly brittle materials such as ceramics, in which the principal energetic cost of fracture is the development of new free surfaces on the crack faces.Griffith, A. A. (1921), \\"The phenomena of rupture and flow in solids\\" (PDF), Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, A, 221 (582‚Äì593): 163‚Äì198, Bibcode:1921RSPTA.221..163G, doi:10.1098/rsta.1921.0006, archived from the original (PDF) on 2006-10-16. The character of the energetic cost of the creation of new surfaces remains largely unchanged regardless of how long the crack has propagated from its initial length.  Rising R-Curves  300px Another category of R-curve that is common in real materials is a \\"rising R-curve\\" (G_R increases as \\\\Delta a increases). In materials with rising R-curves, as a crack propagates, the resistance to further crack propagation increases, and it requires a higher and higher applied G in order to achieve each subsequent increment of crack extension \\\\delta a. As such, it can be technically challenging in these materials in practice to define a single value to quantify resistance to fracture (i.e. G_c or K_{Ic}) as the resistance to fracture rises continuously as any given crack propagates. Materials with rising R-curves can also more easily exhibit stable crack growth than materials with flat R-curves, even if G strictly increases as a function of a. If at some moment in time a crack exists with initial length a_0 and an applied energy release rate which is infinitesimally exceeding the R-curve at this crack length [G(a_0) = G_R(a_0) + \\\\delta G] then this material would immediately fail if it exhibited flat R-curve behavior. If instead it exhibits rising R-curve behavior, then the crack has an added criteria for crack growth that the instantaneous slope of the driving force curve must be greater than the instantaneous slope of the crack resistance curve \\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\delta G(a_0)}{\\\\delta a} \\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\delta G_R(a_0)}{\\\\delta a}\\\\Biggr) or else it is energetically unfavorable to grow the crack further. If G(a_0) is infinitesimally greater than G_R(a_0) but \\\\frac{\\\\delta G(a_0)}{\\\\delta a} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\delta G_R(a_0)}{\\\\delta a} then the crack will grow by an infinitesimally small increment \\\\delta a such that G(a_0 + \\\\delta a) = G_R(a_0 + \\\\delta a) and then crack growth will arrest. If the applied crack driving force G(a) was gradually increased over time (through increasing the applied force for example) then this would lead to stable crack growth in this material as long as the instantaneous slope of the driving force curve continued to be less than the slope of the crack resistance curve. Physically, the dependence of G_R on \\\\Delta a is indicative that in rising R-curve materials, the phenomena which are energetically costly during crack propagation are evolving as the crack grows in such a way that leads to accelerated energy dissipation during crack growth. This tends to be the case in materials which undergo ductile fracture as it can be observed that the plastic zone at the crack tip increases in size as the crack propagates, indicating that an increasing amount of energy must be dissipated to plastic deformation for the crack to continue to grow.Viggo Tvergaard, John W. Hutchinson, The relation between crack growth resistance and fracture process parameters in elastic-plastic solids, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Volume 40, Issue 6, 1992, Pages 1377-1397, ISSN 0022-5096, https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-5096(92)90020-3. A rising R-curve can also sometimes be observed in situations where a material's fracture surface becomes significantly rougher as the crack propagates, leading to additional energy dissipation as additional area of free surfaces is generated.Morel, S., et al. (2002). \\"R-curve behavior and roughness development of fracture surfaces.\\" International Journal of Fracture 114(4): 307-325. In theory, G_R does not continue to increase to infinity as a \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, and instead will asymptotically approach some steady-state value after a finite amount of crack growth. It is usually not feasible to reach this steady-state condition, as it often requires very long crack extensions before reaching this condition, and thus would require large testing specimen geometries (and thus high applied forces) to observe. As such, most materials with rising R-curves are treated as if G_R continually rises until failure.  Falling R-Curves  While far less common, some materials can exhibit falling R-curves (G_R decreases as \\\\Delta a increases). In some cases, the material may initially exhibit rising R-curve behavior, reach a steady-state condition, and then transition into falling R-curve behavior. In a falling R-curve regime, as a crack propagates, the resistance to further crack propagation drops, and it requires less and less applied G in order to achieve each subsequent increment of crack extension \\\\delta a. Materials experiencing these conditions would exhibit highly unstable crack growth as soon as any initial crack began to propagate. Polycrystalline graphite has been reported to demonstrate falling R-curve behavior after initially exhibiting rising R-curve behavior, which is postulated to be due to the gradual development of a microcracking damage zone in front of the crack tip which eventually dominates after the phenomena leading to the initial rising R-curve behavior reach steady-state.SAKAI, M. , YOSHIMURA, J. , GOTO, Y. and INAGAKI, M. (1988), R‚ÄêCurve Behavior of a Polycrystalline Graphite: Microcracking and Grain Bridging in the Wake Region. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 71: 609-616. doi:10.1111/j.1151-2916.1988.tb06377.x  Effect of size and shape Size and geometry also plays a role in determining the shape of the R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate because there is a low degree of stress triaxiality at the crack tip in the thin sheet while the material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also change at free boundaries in the structure. Thus, a wide plate may exhibit a somewhat different crack growth resistance behavior than a narrow plate of the same material. Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, is a property only of the material and does not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanics is predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property.  Testing  ASTM evolved a standard practice for determining R-curves to accommodate the widespread need for this type of data. While the materials to which this standard practice can be applied are not restricted by strength, thickness or toughness, the test specimens must be of sufficient size to remain predominantly elastic throughout the test. The size requirement is to ensure the validity of the linear elastic fracture mechanics calculations. Specimens of standard proportions are required, but size is variable, adjusted for yield strength and toughness of the material considered. ASTM Standard E561 covers the determination of R-curves using a middle cracked tension panel [M(T)], compact tension [C(T)], and crack-line-wedge-loaded [C(W)] specimens. While the C(W) specimen had gained substantial popularity for collecting KR curve data, many organizations still conduct wide panel, center cracked tension tests to obtain fracture toughness data. As with the plane-strain fracture toughness standard, ASTM E399, the planar dimensions of the specimens are sized to ensure that nominal elastic conditions are met. For the M(T) specimen, the width (W) and half crack size (a) must be chosen so that the remaining ligament is below net section yielding at failure.

Twelve gauge has been widely accepted as an appropriate bore diameter to provide an effective number of projectiles within an acceptable recoil. Early 12 gauge popularity for sporting purposes produced a large number of repeating firearms designs readily adaptable to military purposes. United States Initial World War I issue with each shotgun was one hundred commercial-production paper-cased shotgun shells containing nine 00 buckshot pellets in diameter. These cartridges became wet in the muddy trench warfare environment; and swelled paper cases would no longer chamber reliably. Full-length brass cartridges proved more resistant to moist field conditions and the repeated loading and unloading during patrols and watches when no ammunition was fired. Some of these early brass cartridges had an unusual saw-tooth crimp. M19 World War II production of full-length brass cartridges containing 00 buckshot was designated Shell, Shotgun, Brass, 12 Gage, No. 00 Buckshot, M19. M162 Plastic shotgun shells devised following World War II were equally durable and water resistant as the earlier brass cartridges and had the additional advantages of corrosion resistance and lower cost. Initial production for the Vietnam War loaded 00 buckshot into the same red plastic cases being used for sporting ammunition and was designated: Shell, Shotgun, Plastic Case, 12 Gauge, No. 00 Buck, XM162. The shells were typically packaged as twelve ten-round cardboard boxes within a metal ammunition box. M257 Combat experience in Vietnam suggested two improvements. Heavy bullet preferences dating back to the Philippine-American War were re-evaluated considering combat experience with the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge, and advantages of a larger number of smaller No. 4 buckshot pellets were evident for some situations. These loadings were designated: Shell, Shotgun, Plastic Case, No. 4 Buck, Special, XM257. Initial production was in the same red plastic cases, but the visibility advantage for sporting use was a liability in jungle warfare; so later production used cases of a subdued green color. Flechettes Plastic cases loaded with small steel darts called flechettes were issued on a limited trial basis during the Vietnam war. Cartridges manufactured by Western Cartridge Company contained twenty flechettes long and weighing each. The flechettes were packed in a plastic cup with granulated white polyethylene to maintain alignment with the bore axis, and supported by a metal disk to prevent penetration of the over-powder wad during acceleration down the bore. Cartridges manufactured by Federal Cartridge Company contained 25 flechettes. Tips of the flechettes are exposed in the Federal cartridges, but concealed by a conventional star crimp in Western cartridges. Flechettes had flatter trajectory over longer ranges than spherical buckshot, but combat effectiveness did not justify continued production. Experimental Frag-12 is experimental military shotgun grenade ammunition under consideration by military forces. Coming in three variants: High Explosive (HE), High Explosive Armor-piercing (HEAP) and High Explosive Fragmenting Antipersonnel (HEFA) used by the AA-12 Atchisson Assault Shotgun and potentially other shotguns.

Hobbs was a hyperbaric technologist and simulation coordinator at Duke Medical Center before taking a position as the Director of Simulation for the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and Clinical Instructor in the Department of Pediatrics. As of 2018, Hobbs is the business manager for the UNC Health Care Department of Neurosurgery.  Early life and education  Hobbs was born on November 28, 1973 in Fayetteville, North Carolina where he attended Terry Sanford High School and graduated in 1992. He then attended the North Carolina State University (NCSU) where he majored in business management with a human resources concentration. While in college, Hobbs began volunteering at the F.G. Hall Hyperbaric Laboratory at Duke University Medical Center. Hobbs became a Certified Hyperbaric Technologist in 1997. He was awarded credentials as a Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator in 2015. Hobbs earned an MBA with a concentration in healthcare from Fayetteville State University in 2020.  Diving and hyperbaric  Hobbs was certified in scuba diving by H. Larry Brown at NCSU in 1993. Following this first class, he began assisting the diving classes while continuing his diving education. Hobbs was certified as a cave diver and NAUI instructor in 1997. At the Duke F.G. Hall Lab in 1997, Hobbs worked on a project to evaluate emergency oxygen rebreathers for use in the delivery of first aid oxygen to diving accident victims. This work culminated in the testing of Hobbs' prototype and subsequent marketing of the Remote Emergency Oxygen Delivery System (REMO2) by the Divers Alert Network (DAN) from January 1999 ‚Äì August 2001. This product was introduced at the Med-Trade convention and named the 1999 \\"Med-Trade new product of the year\\" however problems with manufacturing capability ended the project. Hobbs participated in other projects related to aging divers, breath- hold diving, and extra-vehicular activity. Hobbs serves as a member of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society diving committee that shapes guidance related to diving medical safety. Education in hyperbaric medicine related topics via inter-institutional simulations has allowed Hobbs to tie his passion for diving with his career in medical training. Hobbs has made significant regular contributions to Wikipedia's scuba diving articles, particularly to their referencing. He was joint author of a 2009 article advocating participation in Wikipedia as a means of increasing awareness of diving medicine.  Woodville Karst Plain Project  Hobbs has served as medical officer for the Woodville Karst Plain Project since 2004. From this position, he has supported the medical communication and logistics for the team's divers.  Simulation  Hobbs began working as the Medical Simulation Coordinator for Duke University Medical Center's Human Simulation and Patient Safety Center in 2001. Here his role in a young field involved development of resources for the program, curriculum development, and establishing the role he would provide within this new field. In 2007, Hobbs was part of the development team for a first person video game called 3DiTeams out of a collaboration between Duke University Medical Center and Virtual Heroes, Inc. and used for medical education and team training. The project was unveiled to the general public in a workshop entitled \\"3DiTeams ‚Äì Team Training in a Virtual Interactive Environment\\" hosted by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Annual Meeting in San Francisco, California on October 16, 2007. Their team has continued to develop and test new training and assessment methods for healthcare providers and research personnel. In 2014, Hobbs joined the faculty at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine as Director of Simulation and Clinical Instructor in the Department of Pediatrics. His role at UNC has involved patient safety projects as well as development of unique educational opportunities. The quality improvement and patient safety initiatives include simulations for health system wide TeamSTEPPS and Code Sepsis projects as well as more specific work with postpartum hemorrhage and trauma. Work with interprofessional teams is one area in which he has continued to specialize. In 2016, their team collaboration with North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine was recognized by the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) and Association for Prevention Teaching and Research when the team's One Health case submission was selected in a national competition. Hobbs advocates for the use of standardized patients to portray other team members or having other clinicians as faculty if interprofessional learners are not an option. In addition to his role in graduate medical education, Hobbs also created a course for UNC undergraduate students to participate in simulation activities throughout the health system. Hobbs authored a book chapter on the role of a simulation operations specialist in research that was published in 2016. In 2017, the UNC Anesthesia team including Hobbs was awarded the \\"First Place Research Abstract at the 17th Annual International Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare\\". He received a plaque recognizing his \\"contributions and service\\" to the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and Simulation Operations and Technology Section in 2018. Hobbs left his simulation director role in 2017 to take on a role as business manager for the UNC Health Care Department of Neurosurgery. In addition to the day-to-day operations of the Department of Neurosurgery, Hobbs serves on a committee providing oversight their educational laboratory focused primarily on cadaveric and task oriented simulation training. He is also began blogging in the Society for Human Resource Management Blog in 2017 and concentrates his posts on simulation, workplace safety, and workforce accommodations.  Rubicon Foundation  In 2002, Hobbs joined with divers Brian Armstrong and James Wagner in the formation of the Rubicon Foundation to further diving education, research and conservation efforts. The first major project Rubicon started was the Rubicon Research Repository created to aggregate often hard to find literature in the fields of diving and hyperbaric medicine. This included scanning creation of metadata for many documents that were not indexed in any database as well as negotiation of copyright permissions with the organizations to make these items available to the public. Hobbs received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\" from the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society for his creation of the Rubicon Research Repository in June 2005. This work has continued and grown in their effort to create greater communication and collaboration between the diving medical community and divers. Divers Gene Hobbs and Brian Armstrong debrief following dive for the B25 recovery project Dr. Simon Mitchell has recognized Hobbs \\"alongside Dick Clarke as CHTs who have made spectacular contributions to the field\\". As a result of his work with the Rubicon Research Repository, Hobbs was named the 2010 Divers Alert Network/ Rolex Diver of the year. This was the 22nd time this award has been presented to someone that has \\"contributed significantly to dive safety or the DAN mission\\". Later that year, Hobbs began diving a rebreather having completed his training with Gregg Stanton. The B-25c Mitchell bomber was ditched on 4 April 1943 and remained below the surface of Lake Murray (South Carolina) for 60 years. The recovery effort was headed by Dr. Robert Seigler and supervised by Gary Larkins of the Air Pirates. Hobbs participated in the recovery effort with divers from Association of Underwater Explorers (AUE), the Rubicon Foundation, and Woodville Karst Plain Project in 2005. The project was documented by the History Channel and televised on their show Mega Movers. The plane is being preserved by the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham, Alabama. Hobbs teamed up with Keith Gault of the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit to apply probabilistic models developed by Dr Wayne Gerth to the understanding of problems facing the technical diving population. This project is ongoing and included various breathing gases and decompression styles. In 2010, Rubicon started Project Pink Tank with a goal to improve the knowledge available to breast cancer survivors about their engagement in scuba diving. The methods applied for this project will also influence further diving medical research.  Personal life  Hobbs met his wife Becky while working in the Human Simulation and Patient Safety Center and they were married at Anse Chastanet in October 2004. In 2009, Hobbs and his wife lost their son Andrew who was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia after thirty days. Their second son Ryan was born in 2011. They currently reside in Pittsboro, North Carolina.

The community includes the holiday resorts of Kinmel Bay and Towyn. It is crossed by the Afon Gele, which flows from west to east, before joining the River Clwyd on the eastern boundary. At the 2001 census the community had a population of 7,864, increasing to 8,460 at the 2011 census. Before being named Kinmel Bay there was a small settlement called Foryd, which is the name of the bridge crossing into Rhyl. The area is very Anglicized, with well over half the population having been born in England. The area was developed after 1793, when the Rhuddlan Marsh Commissioners were granted powers to drain the area around Towyn. In the mid 19th century, flood defences were constructed to protect the new Chester to Holyhead railway. Storm-force winds, a high tide and storm surge caused the defences to fail over a stretch in 1990, resulting in the flooding of 2,800 properties. The flood water covered . Since then a rock revetment has been constructed to protect the breached coastline, and further protective works have been carried out to the east.

As a church body it enjoys the status as an √©tablissement public du culte (public establishment of cult). Creeds and memberships The EPRAL adheres to the Apostles Creed, Nicene Creed, Heidelberg Catechism and the Second Helvetic Confession. The EPRAL has approximately 33,000 members in 52 congregations served by 50 pastors. Congregations holding services in German language use the current German Protestant hymnal ' issued by the Protestant church bodies in Austria, France (Alsace-Moselle), Germany and Luxembourg (1993‚Äì1996), in a regional edition (Ausgabe Baden / Elsass- Lothringen) including traditional hymns from Alsace, Baden and Moselle. In 2006 the EPRAL formed with the EPCAAL the Union of Protestant Churches of Alsace and Lorraine. This is no united body, but it provides common decision making structure and single body of pastors. However, the two churches maintain their own organisation. The EPRAL is member of the Protestant Federation of France and of the World Communion of Reformed Churches, and the World Council of Churches. The EPRAL was a founding member of the Conference of Churches on the Rhine in 1961, which now functions as a regional group of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe (CPCE). The EPRAL has close fellowship with the Reformed Church of France. History The first Reformed congregation in the area was founded by John Calvin in Strasbourg in Alsace. It has its origin in the very early times of the Reformation. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the populations in a number of small imperial estates or free imperial cities including their governments (princes or city councils) had adopted the Reformed confession; in other such territories, the ruling princes introduced the Reformed faith using their privilege of Cuius regio, eius religio. Reformed confession spread in the northern and eastern part of the area with concentration in Mulhouse and Metz. In Strasbourg and some enclaves in northern Alsace and the Vosges, Reformed Christians form only small minority communities. But the Republic in Mulhouse was reformed at the time of the French Revolution, when all the area had become a part of France. After the conclusion of the Concordat of 1801 with the Vatican applying to French Roman Catholicism, in 1802 Napoleon I decreed the organic articles which constituted also the other -existing major religious groups in France, the Calvinists (Reformed Christians), Jews and Lutherans, as recognised public religious bodies (√©tablissements publics du culte). These bodies all followed a similar model with semigovernmental leading bodies, such as the Reformed Central Council (Conseil central; est. on 26 March 1852) in Paris, the Lutheran General Consistory (renamed as supreme consistory as of 1852) in Strasbourg and the Israelite Central Consistory in Paris. Subordinate to the chief bodies there were regional consistories each comprising several congregations altogether counting at least 6,000 souls. The organic articles shaped the constitution of the pre-1905 Reformed Church of France.N. N., \\"The French Concordat\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. The representatives of the Reformed church accepted the governmentally imposed structure, since it did not put the Reformed church in a worse position than the other creeds. However, Napoleon's model of hierarchical parastatal governance was a harsh breach with many crucial Reformed presbyterial and synodal traditions. Pastors were not employed and paid by the church people, constituted in the congregations, but were chosen and paid by the government and subordinate to the government-appointed members of the consistories. Napoleon's law did not provide for a general synod, the only body relevant in taking decisions in matters of doctrine and teaching for all the church, and while the law de jure provided for regional synods combining representatives of at least five consistorial ambits the government de facto never allowed their convocation.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 212. . Lacking a general synod, last convened in 1659, and with no provincial synods convoked, the Reformed congregations formed the only decision-taking body, though restricted to local church matters, legitimised by the Reformed doctrine. Until 1852 the law did not even recognise Reformed congregations but considered them as legally indistinct local outposts of the parastatal consistories. Cernay On 26 March 1852 Napoleon III signed a decree, influenced by Charles Read, which still did not provide for a general synod, but at least made the Reformed congregations distinct legal entities, whose governing bodies (called presbyteries) - according to then Reformed doctrine - were elected by the male adult members.N. N., \\"Times of disagreement\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. The new Central Council established in 1852, the supreme executive body of the Reformed Church of France, was staffed with incumbents appointed by the government, a practice clearly contradicting the presbyterial and synodal doctrine of Calvinism.N. N., \\"Alsace from 1871 to 1918\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. In the course of the 19th century, Calvinists in France clung to different theological movements, such as traditionalist Calvinism, rationalist theology, Christian revival or Liberal Christianity. So the pre-1905 Reformed Church of France entered into heavy controversies on doctrinal and teaching matters which could not be resolved due to the lacking general synod. Many Calvinists were adherents of the Christian revival movement (in France they were then called √©vang√©liques) colliding with proponents of religious liberalism. The congregations still could not employ the pastors, since the advowson was with the parastatal consistories. When the consistories appointed pastors of a particular theological leaning to a congregation whose members and elected bodies clung to another opinion, it often created hefty quarrels. Two pastoral conferences were convened each by proponents of one of the two main currents in French Calvinism; the liberals met in N√Æmes and the revivalists in Paris. They had no mandate for binding decisions, since elected laymen were not represented. Revivalists demanded a general synod, in order to conclude a binding confession of faith, while moderate liberals agreed but radical liberals denied that a general synod decision would at all be binding in matters of teaching and doctrine. Only in June and July 1872 the French government finally allowed the gathering of a general synod. However, the Reformed congregations in Alsace and the Lorraine department could not benefit from this any more. After France had waged war on Prussia (then a member of the North German Confederation) the former was defeated by the latter and its allies. By the Treaty of Frankfurt France ceded Alsace and parts of two northeastern d√©partements of Lorraine to the newly united Germany. The Reformed congregations there with approximately 39,000 parishioners were separated from the Reformed Church of France in May 1871. Unlike the Lutheran Church of the Confession of Augsburg of France (√âglise de la Confession d‚ÄôAugsbourg de France) whose directory (directoire) and supreme consistory (consistoire sup√©rieur) were located in Strasbourg in Alsace, with the vast majority of its members also residing in Alsace-Lorraine and subsequently transforming into the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine (√âglise protestante de la Confession d'Augsbourg d'Alsace et de Lorraine; EPCAAL) territorially confined to the new German state of Alsace- Lorraine, the central governing body of the French Calvinists, the Central Council, was based in Paris. Evading from the subordination to the non-elected Central Council, which was mostly staffed with proponents of liberal Christianity, whom the French government preferred,N. N., \\"Athanase Coquerel (1795-1868)\\", on: Mus√©e virtuel du Protestantisme fran√ßais (Virtual museum of the French Protestantism), retrieved on 29 April 2013. was rather welcome to the Calvinists in Alsace-Lorraine. Temple Neuf, Metz Whereas the Alsatian Reformed consistories comprised all the Calvinist congregations in Alsace, the Reformed congregations in the new German Lorraine department used to be part of the Nancy consistorial ambit since 1850, so that a Reformed consistory of Metz was refounded in 1871, however, competent only for the Calvinists in German Lorraine.Jean Colnat, 43 J Archives du Temple neuf (retrieved on 28 February 2013), Saint-Julien-l√®s-Metz: Service d√©partemental d'Archives de la Moselle, 2002. Already in 1822 the French government had established a Reformed consistory in Metz, which, however, had been moved to Nancy in 1850. The then five Reformed consistorial ambits in Alsace-Lorraine existed side by side without any umbrella organisation. In this their situation was similar to that of the three Israelite consistories in the area which had been cut off from the Paris-based Central Consistory. Proponents of Calvinism and Judaism then took the endeavour to form new statewide umbrella organisations.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden und Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 80. . According to Reformed doctrine the new central body needed the mandate of an elected synod, rather than being a parastatal authority. In 1872 Upper President rejected the Calvinist and Jewish proposals, arguing he would interfere as little as possible in the current state of legal affairs of Alsace-Lorraine as long as no Alsace-Lorrainese legislative body were established.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 81. . In the same time Moeller forbade the Reformed consistories to send delegates to the 1872 (Eisenacher Kirchenkonferenz).Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 206. . When in 1882 the five Reformed consistories were invited to send a delegate to the Eisenach Church Conference, the consistories lacking any joint body long quarrelled about whom to send.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 209. . In 1885 the state administration proposed that the Reformed consistory of Metz apply to merge into EPCAAL. The Metz consistory, the other four Reformed consistories and EPCAAL opposed that proposal.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 210. . So the Alsatian Reformed consistories felt the need to establish a statewide Reformed church and started a new initiative to that end.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 211. . By mid-1892 the four Alsatian consistorial delegates formed a committee in order to prepare a constitutive synod, while Metz refused to participate. In October the committee sent its proposal to the state administration and asked it to convene that synod. Although the state administration rejected a constitutive synod in February 1892, as being not provided by French law, this time it offered the Reformed committee an alternative, by convoking a regional synod as provided by the French organic articles if five consistories apply.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, pp. 212seq. . Now the Alsatian Calvinists took the administration up on its proposal postponing any decisions of the Reformed consistories as to new examination rules for Strasbourg University graduates of Protestant theology, arguing these can only effectively be taken, once a Reformed church body be established.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 213. . Now the consistory of Metz threw a spanner into the preparatory works by demanding its merger into the EPCAAL. However, the Department of Justice and Religious Affairs of the state administration now \\"determined that the law required only that there be five consistories available for the synod, not that all five consent to form the body.\\"Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 214. . This was because by French law the government convened regional synods for the ambits of at least five consistories, whereas the concerned consistories had no say in this matter. French law contradicted itself in how to choose delegates for a Reformed regional synod, either the consistories would send delegates (Organic articles), or the parishes would elect representatives (1852 decree). So only on 16 and 17 April 1895, representatives of the four Alsatian Reformed consistorial ambits, with Metz boycotting, formed their synod, thus formally constituting today's Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine (EPRAL).Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 216. . Since then the synodals elect the Synodal Council (Conseil Synodal, Synodalvorstand), as central governing body of the church representing the synod when not convened. In 1901, the Lutheran Supreme Consistory of the EPCAAL had definitely rejected the Metz consistory to be accepted into the EPCAAL as a united Protestant consistorial ambit and the Lorrain department president , favouring the union of Calvinists and Lutherans, terminated his presidency term.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 218. . In November 1902 the Reformed Consistory of Metz gave itself up to fate and agreed to be part of the EPRAL and started participating in the statewide Reformed bodies established seven years earlier.Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 219. . So Metz set some conditions, which the Reformed synodals willingly fulfilled in 1903. The special united Protestant character of several congregations in the Metz consistorial ambit was to be maintained and congregations were to be entitled to officially use, if they wished so, the brand Protestant (evangelisch) instead of Reformed as part of the parish name. Reformed Temple in Courcelles-Chaussy After 1871, many people from interior Germany settled in Alsace-Lorraine, among them rather few Calvinists, because Calvinism is a minority faith among the German Protestants, who then still formed a majority in the German overall population. In all the then three German federal states adjacent to Alsace-Lorraine, Baden, the Bavarian Palatinate and the Prussian Rhineland, the Reformed and Lutheran church bodies had merged, either through a united Protestant confession (Evangelical State Church in Baden as of 1821, Protestant State Church of the Palatinate as of 1817) or in administration only (by way of a united umbrella) maintaining separate confessions in the local congregations (Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces; united umbrella since 1817).Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 207. . So Protestant officials from interior Germany delegated to posts in Alsace-Lorraine often had no routine with a Reformed and a Lutheran church existing side by side.In fact only in the Prussian province of Hanover a Reformed and a Lutheran state church with considerable membership each existed side by side. This caused their expectation for the Reformed and the Lutheran churches in Alsace-Lorraine to unite, promoted by the administration of Alsace-Lorraine,Anthony Steinhoff, The gods of the city: Protestantism and religious culture in Strasbourg, 1870-1914, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008, p. 205. . especially since the head of state of Alsace- Lorraine, the German Emperor himself, in personal union king of Prussia was as such the supreme governor of the united old-Prussian church body. However, the Lutheran Supreme Consistory in Strasbourg asserted its continued existence as recognised public-law religious body in 1872, although reconfined to Alsace- Lorraine only, so that thereafter any merger with the ‚Äì by membership ‚Äì smaller Reformed consistories turned unlikely and did not materialise in the end. Nevertheless, the recognition of an all Alsatian-Lorrain Reformed church umbrella was protracted by the authorities. Only on 21 June 1905 the Alsatian- Lorrain state committee (Landesausschuss, between 1874 and 1911 the indirectly elected parliament), passing the first law altering the French legal situation as to religious bodies, recognised the Synodal Council as governing body of the Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine.Vgl. ‚ÄûStrasbourg, paroisse r√©form√©e du Bouclier‚Äú, on: Wiki-protestants.org, retrieved on 26 February 2013. By the new Constitution of Alsace-Lorraine, enacted in 1911, the president of the Synodal Council as a representative of one of the two Protestant regional churches in Alsace-Lorraine, like one representative of each public-law religious body in Alsace-Lorraine,These were, besides the EPRAL, the Lutheran EPCAAL, the dioceses of Metz and of Strasbourg and the collective of the three Israelite consistories of Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg. became an ex officio member of the first chamber of the (the Landtag). , president of the Synodal Council from 1898 to 1913, represented the church in the Landtag, then followed by Albert Kuntz. Whereas in interior France the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State did away with the concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, these provisions remained valid law in Alsace- Lorraine also after its return to France as part of the Local law in Alsace- Moselle.So within the three d√©partements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle regulations (among others) such as Bismarck's social insurance system remained in effect, until France built up a comparable system for all of France, and Christian feast days such as the 26 December and Good Friday remained public holidays. Only during the German occupation (1940‚Äì1944/1945) the organic articles had been abolished in 1941 as part of the Nazi Weltanschauung policy doing away with public funding of religious bodies and religious instruction in all schools. But with the reestablishment of French law, the pre-1940 legal status was reconstituted. Therefore, the EPRAL cannot merge with the new Reformed Church of France, a religious association established in 1938 by merging four religious bodies, unless the EPRAL would waive its concordatary status, which also provides for the clergy being paid by the government and Calvinist pupils in public schools entitled to participate in religious instruction classes following EPRAL guidelines. Temple Saint-√âtienne in Mulhouse Organisation The EPRAL has a presbyterial-synodal system of church government. The legislative body of EPRAL is the synod with 33 synodals. They elect and control the Synodal Council (Conseil synodal) and its president for three year terms. Since 1 September 2012 Pastor Christian Krieger serves as president of the Synodal Council. The EPRAL has its headquarters (Synodal Council) in Strasbourg. EPRAL has a mobile form of pastoral ministry. The congregations (paroisses, i.e. parishes) are grouped in four (till 2009 five) consistorial ambits: The consistories are based in Bischwiller, Metz, Mulhouse und Strasbourg. The former consistorial ambit of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines was merged into that of Strasbourg due to decreasing numbers of parishioners in 2009. By the French Organic Articles each time several congregations form a consistory (consistoire), with the term used for the board and its district alike.Cf. \\"Etudes: Cultes protestants\\" , on: Institut du Droit Local Alsacien-Mosellan (IDL), retrieved on 17 December 2013. As religious statutory law corporations (√©tablissements publics des cultes) the consistories have legal entity status, holding property of their own and receiving contributions from member parishes. Each consistory comprises all the pastors active in its district and the double number of laypersons, elected for three year terms by the local church presbyteries. The consistorial members elect from their midst their executive, the consistorial council (Conseil consistorial) of four members. Consistorial decisions are presented to the French minister of the Interior, who may oppose them within a two-months period, and reported to the EPRAL Synodal Council. The consistories appoint the pastors after proposition by the presbytery of the concerned congregation. Ordination of women and blessings of same-sex marriages are allowed.

Early life http://lsb380.plbio.lsu.edu/Gil%20memorial.html Robert Lee Gilbertson 1926-2011 Presentation by Meredith Blackwell Early years Gil was born on January 15, 1925, in Hamilton, Montana to George and Eula Norris Gilbertson. He had one sibling, George N. Gilbertson. They grew up in Missoula. Gil shared his youthful adventures with a best friend whose aunt ran a bordello. He also had fond memories of his Uncle Nick, a railroad man for whom one of his grandsons was named. Gil, always a reader, enjoyed the memoir A River Runs Through It and Other Stories not only for its literary merits, but also because it was set in the Missoula of his youth. Norman Maclean mentioned many people and places Gil had known. Also, the narrator had a younger brother who died young, and this reminded Gil of his younger brother, George, who died as a young man of a brain tumor. Gil hated that surgery had changed his brother completely but had not cured him. Growing up in Missoula, Gil also had known several men, one the father of a friend, who died in the 1949 Mann Gulch fire described in another Maclean book, Young Men and Fire. Gil graduated from Missoula Central High School in 1942 soon after the US entered WWII. He had to wait until his January birthday when he became 18 when he could enlist in the Army. He was sent to Europe, where he served as a combat infantryman in the U. S. Army from 1943-1946. Gil received the European Theater Campaign Medal with two battle stars, a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. Gil's stories of World War II Photograph of Gilbertson in uniform of a combat infantryman in the Army On December 13, 1984 Gil wrote about how he earned the Purple Heart. > ‚Ä¶ 40 years ago today I was a 19 year old combat infantryman in C.

Gilbertson at Silver spur bar On Friday October 25, 1985, he again remembered the war when he wrote about a trip to Europe when he worked at Kew and went sightseeing in London. > ‚ÄúOn the way to Trafalgar Square we [Gil and Pat] stopped at the site of the > War Room in the Cabinet Building along St. James Park and toured the > restored War Museum ‚Äìvery fascinating to me since I was there at that time > and lived through a lot of the history myself.‚Äù He remarked that his bad > feet, perhaps never recovered from the war, suffered from the long walks of > sightseeing.

Bill of Rights. In 1946 he enrolled at the University of Montana where he majored in Botany and graduated with honors. Gil married Patricia Park in 1948, and they went to the University of Washington for the next two years (1950-1951). As an undergraduate Gil assisted Reuben Diettert with his mycological research, so he had some exposure to fungi before he arrived at Washington.Robert Lee Gilbertson 1926-2011 doi: 10.3852/12-118 Mycologia November/December 2012 vol. 104 no. 6 1521-1524 There he began a master's degree program with Daniel Stuntz.Daniel Elliot Stuntz, 1909-1983 Joe F.

Gil would go on to study wood-decay fungi for 60 years. His PhD degree was completed in 1954 in mycology and forest pathology with a thesis on Polyporus montagnei and Cyclomyces greenii and published his first paper on these species in Mycologia in 1954.Gilbertson, R.L. 1954.

Gilbertson's presidential address in Mycologia =Post-Doctoral Studies and Professorships= After receiving his PhD Gil remained at Syracuse for six months as a research assistant until he was hired as an assistant professor of forestry at the University of Idaho. He and Pat spent the next five years (1954‚Äì59) in Moscow, and their son and daughter, Park and Joan, were born in Moscow, Idaho, 27 August 1956 and 23 July 1959, respectively. From Idaho Gil returned to Syracuse as Associate Professor of Botany in the College of Forestry for eight years (1959-1967). He was appointed as Professor at the University of Arizona in 1967. He concurrently held positions as Plant Pathologist, Agricultural Experiment Station, University of Arizona (1967‚Äì95) for a project ‚ÄúResearch on wood-rotting fungi and other fungi associated with southwestern plants‚Äù and was collaborator and consultant with Center for Forest Mycology Research, US Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin (1957-1981). He spent 26 years on the faculty in Tucson until his retirement from teaching in 1995 and then as Professor Emeritus until his death on October 26, 2011 from complications due to prostate cancer Gil's Obituary Arizona Daily Star The Robert L. Gilbertson Mycological Herbarium Gil's herbariumhttp://lsb380.plbio.lsu.edu/Gil%20memorial.html Gil Memorial is an important legacy. It contains almost 40,000 wood-decaying and other fungal specimens, especially from Arizona and the western United States, Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Gulf Coast region. He built the collection from almost nothing and accessioned the specimens with minimal assistance. In 2005 the University completed the renovation of historic Herring Hall, and the University of Arizona Fungal Herbarium, renamed the Robert L. Gilbertson Mycological Herbarium was inaugurated on Friday, March 11, 2005. The names of the fungi were current ones, unusual for wood decay fungi, a group in which genus level reassignments remain common. The National Science Foundation recently supplied funding for digitization that currently is underway and should soon be available by searching the herbarium on the Internet. The value of Gil's collection has been increased by the precise substrate information and geographical coverage he included for his collections. The Herbarium is unique because its specialized collections document the occurrence of a complex, speciose desert mycota in a region once said by proposal reviewers to have no fungi. Gil put great stock in the USDA Yearbook of Agriculture (1941) that contained state unit values for precipitation. When someone asked why he bothered to plan a foray for the August 1980 MSA meeting with AIBS in Tucson, he was quick to point out that August rainfall in Arizona was almost three times greater than that of Washington state (Gilbertson 1980). The collection also houses the vouchers of the many new and rare fungi, large numbers fully documented from Gil's large number of publications. The collection is a resource for economically, biographically, and taxonomically important groups of fungi.http://lsb380.plbio.lsu.edu/gil_presentation%2018%20Jan.pdf Gilbertson leaning on a tree with a Fomitopsis fruit body Research Areas of Interest Mycological systematics and floristics; wood-rotting basidiomycetes; biological diversity in world ecosystems. Gil's contributions to mycology extended to many fungal groups, most notably Sonoran Desert rusts, myxomycetes, downy mildews, and ascomycetes, and even the fungus-like plant pathogens, Pythium and Labyrinthula . His work included the use of cladistics, synoptic keys, and the study of wood decay, wood decay inhibitors, and detoxification processes. Gil described many new fungal species from under- studied substrates, including fungi that are associated with Sonoran Desert plants and cacti. Dr. Gilbertson's researchGil's website at the University of Arizona http://cals.arizona.edu/PLP/faculty/pages/gilbertson.html concerned several aspects of the biology of wood-rotting basidiomycetes. These aspects included systematics, floristics, cultural morphology, genetics of sexuality including homogenic and heterogenic incompatibility, biochemical and ultrastructural changes in wood during decay, and the use of these fungi for commercial degradation of wood and the biological breakdown of toxic phenolic environmental pollutants. Dr. Gilbertson's research on species of the genus Ganoderma has shown that several are capable of selective delignification, degrading lignin at a faster rate than they do the polysaccharide components of the wood cell wall. The most promising of these is Ganoderma colossum , a thermophilic soil inhabiting fungus of subtropical forest ecosystems. Dr. Gilbertson's research with this and other species of Ganoderma was directed at determining the relation of temperature and length of exposure to delignification and rate of decay. Research on the systematics and floristics of wood-rotting fungi has been directed at the urgency to elucidate biological diversity in world ecosystems.Wood-Rotting Fungi of North America, Robert L. Gilbertson, Mycologia, Vol. 72, No. 1 (Jan. - Feb., 1980), pp. 1-49 Recent research in this field involved preparation of a monograph of the genus Inonotus with Dr. Leif Ryvarden on flora of the University of Oslo and preparation of a flora of wood-decaying basidiomycetes of Hawaii. Professional service Gil was active in the Mycological Society of America, and he was elected Councilor, Vice President, then President-Elect and President at a time when the Vice-President did not automatically rise to the presidency. He continued to contribute to the society, and after his term as president he served as Chairman of the Awards Committee, Local Arrangements Chairman, member of the Foray Committee, and Chairman of the Honorary Members Committee. The society honored Gil with its highest award, the Distinguished Mycologist Award, in 1994. Gil's MSA presidential address on wood-decaying basidiomycetes (Gilbertson 1980) remains a classic. Gil was a founding member of the Western International Forest Disease Work Conferences (WIFDWC), an annual gathering of western North American forest pathologists. He served as program chair twice, local arrangements chair, secretary (1969), and chair (1980), and as its \\"mycologist in residence\\" for more than 30 years. He also was a member of the American Phytopathological Society and served as an associate editor of Plant Disease for fifteen years, and the Society of American Foresters, and served as chair of the Forest Pathology working group. He also belonged to the Arizona Academy of Science, the Association of Southwestern Naturalists, the California Botanical Society, Sociedad Mexicana de Micolog√≠a, and the British Mycological Society, and was a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. After Retirement After retirement from his academic position Gil continued to collect, especially in Hawaii and Mexico. He had a fruitful association with Don Hemmes and other colleagues including Jack Rogers and Karen Nakasone, and many of his last scientific papers cover those fungi. Gil also traveled to places he had visited in his youth in the western US. For example, he wrote (2 July 1997), ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back. Officially retired but back. I‚Äôm now Professor Emeritus and Curator of the Mycological Herbarium... It was fun to revisit the places where Joe [Lowe], Ross [Davidson], Alex [Smith], and I collected in 1956 [when Gil was 31 and working at Idaho]. \\"http://lsb380.plbio.lsu.edu/gil_presentation%2018%20Jan.pdf Mycological Colleagues Gil had many close friends who studied fungi, and after graduation he traveled throughout the country with his major professor Josiah Lowe. The friends included Wilhelm G. Solheim, who taught forest pathology at the University of Arizona (1965-1967) after his retirement from the University of Wyoming and filled in until Gil arrived in Tucson. Another close friend, George Baker Cummins, retired to Tucson, where he spent many productive years working in space Gil shared with him. Gil and George worked to provide ‚ÄúIndexes to W.G. Solheim's Mycoflora Saximontanensis Exsiccata.‚ÄùGilbertson R.L., Cummins G.B., Darnall E.D.. Indexes to W. G.

John G. Palmer, Frances F. Lombard, Harold H. Burdsall, Jr., Michael J. Larsen, and Orson K. Miller, Jr. are several other colleagues acknowledged in his presidential address who were an integral part of Gil's mycological and personal life, and who and shared his interest in wood-rotting fungi. Beginning in the 1980s, Gil became interested in the wood-inhabiting fungi of the Gulf Coast and realized a close cooperative effort in studying and describing these fungi with Meredith Blackwell as a collaborator. After retirement, Gil collected extensively in Hawaii, the specimens being the basis for a number of papers on the Hawaiian mycota, authored with Don Hemmes, Jim Adaskaveg, Karen Nakasone, Erast Parmasto, Jack Rogers and Dennis Desjardin, significantly adding to the biogeographical knowledge of the islands. Gil was close to his own students, and these included MS students, many of whom went on to get PhDs with another advisor, Daniel O. Ebo, K. Sieglinde Neuhauser, Douglas C. Rhodes, Karen K. Nakasone, Donna Goldstein, Anjuwaree Ronaritivichai, Mary Lou Fairweather, James J. Flott, Kevin M. McCann, and Donna M. Bigelow. PhD students were Emroy L. Shannon, J. Page Lindsey, Rogerio T. de Almeida, Robert L. Mathiasen, Karin H. Yohem, Julietta Carranza, and Phyllis T. Himmel. Kenneth J. Martin and James Adaskaveg, completed both MS and PhD degrees with Gil. Frank Hawksworth of the Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station in Fort Collins, a close friend from Western International Forest Disease Work Conferences, studied mistletoes. Gil, Frank, and Gordon Wallis updated the list of western forest diseases, and Gil included brown felt blight, ‚Äúbear wipe,‚Äù a disease of conifers caused by Neopeckia coulteri NeopeckiaNeopeckia or Herpotrichia juniperi (Frank G. Hawksworth, Robert L. Gilbertson, and Gordon W. Wallis, 1984). Gil wrote several books with L.

The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January 15, 1980, to the northeast of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. Initially it moved to the west-southwest, and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of R√©union. On January 19, M√©t√©o-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a tropical cyclone. Hyacinthe looped to the south of eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened after turning to the east. The storm executed another loop to the southwest of R√©union, passing near the island for a second and later third time. Hyacinthe became extratropical on January 29 after turning southward, dissipating two days later. For twelve days, Hyacinthe dropped torrential rainfall on R√©union; nearly all of the island received more than 1 m (3.3 ft) of precipitation. Over a 15‚Äëday period from January 14 to January 28, of rainfall were recorded at Commerson Crater, a volcano caldera. The heaviest rainfall occurred through a process called orographic lift in the mountainous interior, leading to hundreds of landslides. Widespread floods damaged half the roads on R√©union and isolated three villages. Hyacinthe caused heavy damage to crops and damaged or destroyed 2,000 houses. Losses from the storm totaled $167 million (1980 USD, 676 million francs), and 25 people were killed. Meteorological history In the middle of January 1980, the Intertropical Convergence Zone persisted along 10¬∞ S, spawning a small low- level circulation near St. Brandon. According to M√©t√©o-France (MFR), a tropical depression formed about 355 km (220 mi) northeast of Mauritius on January 15\\\\. It tracked to the west-southwest, passing north of the island on January 17. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also reported that a tropical depression had developed, giving it the identifier \\"08S\\". Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, and the MFR followed suit on January 18, naming the storm Hyacinthe. The storm gradually intensified as it passed north of R√©union, with 1-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) by January 19, according to the JTWC. That day, an eye developed, and MFR estimated that Hyacinthe intensified to tropical cyclone status, with 10-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). A strengthening anticyclone to the south turned the storm northwestward, and on January 20, Hyacinthe executed a small loop to the south, just offshore eastern Madagascar. While moving to the south, Hyacinthe's winds steadily decreased, as the storm weakened. On January 21, the storm weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, and on January 22 the JTWC estimated winds decreased to 75 km/h (45 mph). The next day, it turned to the east while slowly re-intensifying. On January 24, the JTWC upgraded Hyacinthe to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). After approaching within 175 km (120 mi) west- southwest of R√©union, the cyclone turned to the northwest and executed another loop. The JTWC estimated that Hyacinthe reached peak winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) on January 25, which the storm maintained for about 24 hours. During that time, Hyacinthe turned to the southeast and later weakened. On January 26, it moved near R√©union for the third time, passing about 105 km (65 mi) to the south. The storm turned southward, becoming extratropical on January 29\\\\. Over the next two days, the remnants of Hyacinthe accelerated, turned to the east, and dissipated to the southeast of Madagascar. Impact Washed out road in Saint-Pierre, R√©union For twelve days, the circulation of the storm produced cloudiness and thunderstorms over R√©union. Hyacinthe broke several rainfall records for tropical cyclones, becoming the wettest tropical cyclone on record. From January 14 to January 28, the storm dropped at Commerson Crater, just north of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Over ten days, Hyacinthe produced 5,678 mm (223.5 in), also at Commerson. In twelve hours, Hyacinthe dropped 1,095 mm (43.1 in) of rainfall at Grand √élet, just shy of the record set by Cyclone Denise in 1966. The highest daily total was on January 25, when fell at Commerson. Over a three-day period, the storm dropped 3,240 mm (127.6 in) at Commerson, as well as 4,300 mm (169 in) over a five-day period ending on January 28. Only a small portion of the island near Saint-Pierre received less than 1 m (3.3 ft) of rainfall, and totals increased further inland, with over 2 m (6.6 ft) recorded at four locations. Such heavy rainfall typically occurs on the island when tropical cyclones approach, owing to orographic enhancement in the mountainous interior. In addition to the rainfall, Hyacinthe produced a minimum barometric pressure of at Saint-Pierre on January 27\\\\. Wind gusts reached in Saint-Denis, although the mountainous portion of the island reported winds as strong as . Wave action was not severe due to the quick changes in track and lack of significant intensity. There was some beach erosion along western-facing beaches, and Pointe des Galets sustained damage to coastal properties. However, any major damage caused by the storm was largely due to the heavy rainfall. The Rivi√®re Langevin reported increased flow, reaching a discharge of about 300 m¬≥/s (10,500 ft¬≥/s). Along Rivi√®re-du- Mat les Bas, river flooding entered five houses. Floods washed out a and a portion of a highway along a ravine near Chaudron. Along Route nationale 1, traffic was disrupted after rocks blocked the roadway. In Petite-√éle, floods washed out a bridge and of roads. About half of the roads on R√©union were damaged, and road damage was estimated at $40 million (1980 USD, 161.3 million francs). The rain caused widespread mudslides, including hundreds near Salazie and Cilaos. Three towns were temporarily isolated, including Hell-Bourg which was cut off for about eight days, Helicopters delivered food and clothing to the villages. Throughout R√©union, Hyacinthe killed 25 people and left 7,000 homeless. Four of the deaths occurred after a house was washed away at Petite- √éle. A school was destroyed in Saint-Louis. The storm caused power and water outages, and about 30% of the island temporarily lost phone service. Hyacinthe damaged 1,712 houses and destroyed another 288; housing damage totaled about $42 million (1980 USD, 170 million francs). Flooding caused $48 million (1980 USD, 194 million francs) in agricultural damage, including about 1,000 killed cattle and near-total losses to bananas, mangoes, and avocados. Overall damage was estimated at $167 million (676 million francs). Many records set by the storm were broken by Cyclone Gamede in 2007, including the rainfall accumulations from three to eight days. However, Hyacinthe retained its status as the wettest overall tropical cyclone. Elsewhere, Hyacinthe affected Madagascar as a weaker storm. Wind gusts reached at Mananjary and on √éle Sainte-Marie. At the same two locations, rainfall reached and , respectively. On Mauritius, the storm's passage forced the main port to close.

When Sue Ellen goes to see Ann in jail, she tells her that all the Ewings are ready to present as character witnesses to Ann's good will. Ann is convinced that it will do no good, because she saw the juror's faces and she knows that they will give her the maximum punishment of 25 years. Sue Ellen tells Ann to stay positive and that they will fight for her. On her way out, Sue Ellen sees Christopher and Elena in the lobby of the courthouse. Sue Ellen tells Elena that she is disappointed she has not heard back from her regarding progress on the Henderson Oil Field. Elena apologizes but with recent events, she was distracted. Sue Ellen tells her to get to work or she will be calling in the loan in two weeks. Meanwhile, Vicente Cano, meets (in handcuffs) with the Venezuelan Council General regarding his extradition home.

(2001 onwards), \\"Asparagales: Scilloideae\\", Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, retrieved 2013-04-12 The genus has a single species Pseudoprospero firmifolium, which is endemic to South Africa (the Cape Province, KwaZulu-Natal).  Description  Pseudoprospero firmifolium grows from an underground bulb whose tunic has dry, paper-like outer layers. The channelled linear leaves are evergreen. The flowers are borne in a loose many- flowered raceme, which usually has a side branch. Individual flowers have white to lilac tepals which are joined at the base and persist into the fruiting stage. The stamens are more-or-less erect, with filaments joined at the base to the tepals and to each other. The seeds are black.  Systematics  From the 1970s onwards, Franz Speta and co-workers split up the broadly defined genus Scilla, placing many of its species into separate genera. One of these genera was Pseudoprospero, created by Speta in 1998 for the former Scilla firmifolia. Subsequent studies have confirmed that Pseudoprospero firmifolium is distinct not only from Scilla but from all other genera in the tribe Hyacintheae (or the subfamily Hyacinthoideae for those who accept the family Hyacinthaceae), being placed in its own subtribe. place Pseudoprospero as the sole genus in the family Hyacinthaceae, subfamily Hyacinthoideae, tribe Pseudoprospereae, equivalent to the classification family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae, tribe Hyacintheae, subtribe \\"Pseudoprosperinae\\", although this last name appears not to have been published.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 2, 2013, and features the introduction of special guest star Katey Sagal as Nancy Abrams and the return of special guest star Kate Hudson as Cassandra July. The episode is a tribute to the music of Stevie Wonder. Plot Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) calls glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to let him know she is one of the finalists for the role of Fanny Brice in the upcoming Broadway revival of Funny Girl; he tells the club the good news and encourages them to perform Stevie Wonder songs to celebrate the wonderful things in their lives. Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) finds out that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) has been accepted in a film school in New York City but scared of how his mother will react to him living in New York by himself if he doesn't tell her. She performs \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\" to encourage him to go, but Artie remains decided about staying. Kitty then approaches Nancy Abrams (Katey Sagal), who is surprised to learn about Artie's feelings about leaving. After being confronted by his mother, Artie admits he is afraid to be on his own, but Nancy assures him he'll adapt, and now emboldened, Artie decides to go to New York. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), who is recording her first album, returns to Lima with Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) to help coach New Directions for Regionals. She helps Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) improve her voice, and the two sing \\"Superstition\\" alongside Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) in the auditorium. Kurt learns his father Burt Hummel's (Mike O'Malley) cancer is in remission, and celebrates his recovery with a performance of \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\". Blaine later asks Burt's permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're not ready for that type of commitment, and they'll be together eventually. Meanwhile, Mercedes and Mike notice Jake Puckerman's (Jacob Artist) talents, and motivate him be a more active voice in the glee club, which Jake accomplishes through a rendition of \\"I Wish\\". In New York, Cassandra July (Kate Hudson) finds out about Rachel's callback and initially seems to continue on her harassment of her, setting up an extremely difficult dance exam for the next day and telling her she'll go to her audition to see her fail. However, the exam turns out to be a party where Cassandra and the students congratulate Rachel on the callback by performing \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\". Cassandra tells Rachel that she's proud of her, and that all her bullying and apparent hate of her was meant to push her into becoming a better artist. Rachel thanks Cassandra for her lessons. Mercedes becomes disappointed when the record label tries to force her to change her image to have the album released, and decides to cancel their contract and pursue her dreams through different means. She reminds New Directions to always remain true to themselves by singing \\"Higher Ground\\". The club later meets at the auditorium, where they celebrate Artie's success with a rendition of \\"For Once in My Life\\". Production Shooting for the episode had begun by April 8, 2013, and was done in parallel with the final episode, which started by April 10. Cory Monteith, who plays Finn Hudson, does not appear in this episode or the season finale that follows it. Monteith entered a rehabilitation program facility on March 31, 2013, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. The storyline planned for him was changed, and the scripts for the final two episodes were revised accordingly. Romy Rosemont, who plays Finn's mother Carole on the show, makes her first appearance of the fourth season. Katey Sagal appears as Artie's mother, Nancy Abrams Special guest star Katey Sagal debuts as Nancy Abrams, Artie's mother. Kevin McHale, who plays Artie, had proposed Sagal‚Äîalong with Harry Connick, Jr.‚Äîas the character's yet-to-be-seen parents at the Glee panel held during the 2012 Comic-Con shortly before the fourth season began shooting. Show co- creator Ryan Murphy announced Sagal's casting on April 5, 2013. Sagal filmed her scenes on April 10. Special guest star Kate Hudson returns as Cassandra July, Rachel's dance instructor at NYADA. Other recurring characters in this episode include Kurt's father Burt Hummel (O'Malley), Burt's wife and Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont), glee club members Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell), Marley Rose (Benoist), Jake Puckerman (Artist), Kitty Wilde (Tobin) and Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner), and two unnamed sycophantic students at NYADA (Patrick Stafford and J.D.

( 1900 - 10 October 1995) was an Indian civil servant and the first Indian to become Chairman of the Railway Board.  Early life and education  Badhwar's father was an officer in the Indian Civil Service. He completed his schooling from Sherwood College in Nainital and later went on to study Mechanical Science Tripos at Cambridge University.  Career  Badhwar began his career as a marine engineer, working in several European countries on marine civil engineering projects after completing his engineering degree at Cambridge. In June 1925, he joined the East Indian Railway at Calcutta where he became one of the first Indian recruits in the technical services of the railways. In his early years in the railways he was assigned to several civil works including the laying of new lines and bridges and he had a stint at Liluah's Carriage and Wagons workshop. During World War II, Badhwar served with the Corps of Engineers where he rose to become a Lieutenant-Colonel. For his services to the war effort, Major Fateh Chand Badhwar, Commanding Officer of the Technical Group of the East Indian Railway was awarded the MBE (Military) in 1942. He rejoined civil administration the following year and served variously as Secretary to the Railway Board, General Manager of the Oudh and Tirhut Railway and from 1949 on the Railway Board as Member Staff and then as Member Engineering. For his services, he was made an Order of the British Empire OBE (Civil) in 1946. In 1951 he was appointed Chairman of the Railway Board ‚Äî the first Indian to occupy that office which he held until his retirement in October 1954. As Chairman of the Railway Board, Badhwar oversaw the amalgamation of the various privately owned railways, government owned lines and those of the princely states into the single organisation of the Indian Railways. He was also a proponent of indigenisation of railway technology and used his technical skills and training to reduce India's railway imports from Britain and to modernise the railways' rolling stock. This he achieved through the Research Design and Standards Organisation, Lucknow which was established during his term as Chairman of the Railway Board. As the Chairman of the Indian Railways, he was also part of high-powered committees to industrialise the newly independent India.  Later life  After his retirement, Badhwar became the Director of Bird & Company. He was also made Chairman of the Customs Inquiry Committee and the National Industrial Development Corporation. He helped reorganize the Ceylon Government Railway in the 1950s when he served in that country under the Colombo Plan for two months. Badhwar was a nature enthusiast and mountaineer who served as President of the Delhi Bird Watchers Society and had a long association with The Himalayan Club of which he was the first Indian president between 1964-67. He also served as the Secretary of the Patiala- based Indian Society for Cultural Cooperation and Friendship.  Honours  Badhwar was honoured by the Government of India with a Padma Bhushan in 1955. Badhwar Park, a railway residential colony in Mumbai's Colaba area has been named in his honour.

A significant innovator of the 1820s in steam engine design, he moved abroad to become an industrial leader in France and Italy. Early life He was the fourth son of John and Susannah Taylor of Norwich; and the brother of Richard Taylor, Edward Taylor, John Taylor and Sarah Austin. He was educated at Dr. Houghton's school in Norwich. Between 1801 and 1805 Taylor was with his brother John, who was employed by a copper mine in western Devon, for the Martineau family of Norwich. They came to know the Cornish engineer Arthur Woolf, though in Philip's case this was at a later point. Taylor had been sent to study surgery under Dr. Harness at Tavistock; but this apprenticeship did not result in a career. He returned to Norwich, where he joined a Mr. Chambers as a druggist; and worked with Dr. Fitch in a pharmacy business. He set up a factory to make wooden pillboxes, turning the first specimens on a small lathe powered by a pet spit-dog.Buchanan, p. 99. In business in London In 1812 Taylor moved to the neighbourhood of London, as a partner in the chemical works of his brother John at Stratford. Initially Philip was concerned with pharmaceuticals and apparatus, while John worked on metallurgical chemistry. They were backed by the Martineau family.Buchanan, pp. 99‚Äì100. One joint invention was an \\"acetometer\\", used to check excise duty on vinegar. Philip Taylor resided in the adjoining parish of Bromley. He went into business with John Martineau the younger, as Taylor & Martineau of City Road. The partnership was dissolved in 1827. The City Road business of Taylor & Martineau was a foundry and engineering works. It produced steam engines, gas generators, and pumps. The elder John Martineau was involved in the business, at least financially. Oil-gas lighting John Taylor took out a patent in 1815 for decomposing animal oils into gas. This discovery led in 1823 to what Philip Taylor's son later wrote of as \\"the battle of the gases\\": the commercial contest between gas lighting derived from coal and from oils.Philip Meadows Taylor, A Memoir of the family of Taylor of Norwich (1886), p. 52;archive.org. About 20% of new gas undertakings of the 1820s were based on oil.Buchanan, p. 124. Philip Taylor invented a method of lighting public and private buildings by oil-gas, in connection with which he took out a patent on 15 June 1824 for an apparatus for producing gas from various substances (No. 4975). The Bow Gas Company obtained an act of parliament in 1821, when the name proprietors were John, Philip and Edward Taylor with Thomas Martineau;Buchanan, p. 103. but had run into questionable financial circumstances by 1823. Moses Ricardo, brother of David Ricardo, was involved in the oil-gas company as director; he also wrote as a publicist for oil-gas. In 1822 Taylor went to Paris in the hope of introducing oil-gas, but found that coal-gas had forestalled it. Oil-gas enjoyed an advantage in whaling ports, where it could be based on whale oil.Buchanan, p. 105. Sir Walter Scott was an early adopter, for Abbotsford, and became one of the Edinburgh promoters of Taylor & Martineau, where James Milne was their agent.Buchanan, p. 102 and p. 120. The company had a technological edge, with their manager Tait inventing the telescopic gas holder. John Frederick Daniell discovered a definitive process for oil-gas production, which Taylor & Martineau implemented.Buchanan, p. 116. Taylor was in Dublin in 1825, setting up an oil-gas system. Covent Garden Theatre was won from coal-gas, but there were explosions.Buchanan, p. 101. In the end, and internationally, economic forces meant that oil-gas lost ground to the cheaper coal-gas, and were not overcome by promotion or technically. It continued in use in New York till 1828. Steam engines From 1816 Taylor was involved in steam engine design. He testified in 1817 before a House of Commons select committee on steam navigation, and during his evidence said he did not know Arthur Woolf personally. At this time he was described as a \\"manufacturing\\" or \\"operative\\" chemist. His interest in steam came via high-pressure boilers, as reported in 1823 by Peter Ewart. Taylor & Martineau piston arrangement, diagram from Thomas Tredgold, The Steam Engine: Comprising an Account of Its Invention and Progressive Improvement (1827) On 25 May 1816 and 15 January 1818 Taylor had obtained patents for applying high-pressure steam in evaporating processes (Nos. 4032, 4197). On 3 July 1824 he took out a patent for a horizontal steam engine (No. 4983). In 1825 Taylor & Martineau was producing a standard factory stationary steam engine, of a type that would become common. Later they sold a boiler and steam engine to Marc Seguin, French rail pioneer, then working for a steamer company on the Rh√¥ne River.Raveux, pp. 114‚Äì5. Harvey of Hayle produced engines to Taylor's design for Arthur Woolf.Buchanan p. 125. Other interests Taylor assisted Marc Isambard Brunel in 1821 in his financial difficulties, and was a director of the Thames Tunnel Company, though he resigned from its board in April 1825.Buchanan, p. 119. In 1825 he became connected with the British Iron Company and took out a patent for making iron (No. 5244). He also innovated in the fields of steam applied in sugar manufacture, brewing, and in the Hawes Soap Works.Philip Meadows Taylor, A Memoir of the family of Taylor of Norwich (1886), p. 54;archive.org. In France Involved in the financial troubles of the British Iron Company, Taylor went in 1828 to Paris, founded engineering works, and patented the hot blast process in the manufacture of iron. James Beaumont Neilson and Charles MacIntosh simultaneously patented it in London; the validity of the Paris patent was disputed, and was not established till 1832, just before its expiration. Taylor introduced the hot blast in works at Vienne and Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne. In 1834 Taylor submitted to Louis-Philippe a scheme for supplying Paris with water by a tunnel from the River Marne to a hill at Ivry. He had previously proposed for London a nine-mile tunnel to Hampstead Hill; but nothing came of it. In 1834 he erected machinery for a flour-mill at Marseille, and became a partner in the business. Under protectionist pressure, it was soon deprived of the privilege of grinding in bond. Taylor's introduction of filtration in sugar refining improved the local product.Raveux, p. 31. Taylor then, with his sons Philip Meadows and Robert, founded engineering works in Marseille, at Menpenti in 1835.Xavier Daumalin and Olivier Raveux, Marseille (1831‚Äì1865) Une r√©volution industrielle entre Europe du Nord et M√©diterran√©e Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales 56e Ann√©e, No. 1 (Jan. ‚Äì Feb. 2001), pp. 153‚Äì176, at p. 172. Published by: EHESS. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/27586490 In 1845 he bought a shipbuilding yard at La Seyne, near Toulon, which became a successful concern. In 1846 he went into partnership with the Marseille ironmaster Am√©d√©e Armand, thus putting together an industrial empire with all the components for the manufacture of steam vessels.Raveux, pp. 251‚Äì2. Taylor's recruitment of British engineers and foremen proved to be significant in the transfer of new technology to the Mediterranean countries.Raveux, pp. 110‚Äì1. Among his employees were William Adams, Fleeming Jenkin and Robert Whitehead. Later years From 1847 to 1852 Taylor resided at San Pier d'Arena, near Genoa, where the Sardinian government had invited him to establish works. This venture, Taylor & Prandi, was set up with Fortunato Prandi. Political troubles, with slack demand, led Taylor to return to Marseille.Raveux, p. 99 and p. 111. In bad health, Taylor disposed of his business, the Compagnie des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e, in 1855 to a new consortium. He died at Sainte-Marguerite, near Marseille, on 1 July 1870. He was a member of the French Legion of Honour and the Sardinian Order of SS. Maurice and Lazarus. Associations Taylor's circle included John Loudon McAdam, James Nasmyth, David Ricardo, Henry Maudslay, Robert Stephenson, Michael Faraday, Charles MacIntosh, Brunel, Francis John Hyde Wollaston, George Rennie, and Charles Wheatstone; also Humboldt, Gay-Lussac, Arago, and Jean-Baptiste Say. He prided himself on having taken part in the first steamboat trip at sea, on having seen the start of the first steam-engine, and on having witnessed at Somerset House Wheatstone's first electric telegraph experiments. He contributed in 1819 to the Quarterly Journal of Science, and in 1822 to the Philosophical Magazine. Family In 1813 Taylor married Sarah, daughter of Robert Fitch, surgeon, of Ipswich. He had eight children.

For example, small fatigue cracks developing along a row of fastener holes can coalesce increasing the stress on adjacent cracked sites increasing the rate of growth of those cracks. The objective of a designer is to determine when large numbers of small cracks could degrade the joint strength to an unacceptable level.\\"Federal Register, Aging aeroplane program\\" The in-flight loss of part of the fuselage from Aloha Airlines Flight 243 was attributed to multi-site fatigue damage. Categories of WFD Several factors can influence the occurrence of WFD, like Design issues and Probabilistic parameters like manufacturing, environment etc. Two categories of WFD are: Multi-Site Damage (MSD) MSD is the simultaneous presence of fatigue cracks in the same structural element. Multi-Element Damage (MED) MED is the simultaneous presence of fatigue cracks in similar adjacent structural elements. Difficulty in determining WFD occurrence Main difficulties involved are: * Cracks associated with MSD and MED are so small initially that they cannot be detected with existing inspection methods. * Fatigue cracks related to WFD grow rapidly. Therefore operators are not able to detect the cracks before they cause structural failure. Rule to predict the occurrence of WFD First, a parameter called Limits Of Validity (LOV) is defined. LOV is defined as ‚Äúthe period of time (in flight cycles, hours or both) up to which WFD will not occur in aeroplane structure.‚Äù The steps followed are: * Evaluation of structural configurations and determination of LOV based on fatigue test evidence. * Provide warnings to preclude the development of WFD up to LOV. * Adopt LOV values as a criterion to determine the life of aeroplane. * Stop the operation of aeroplanes when LOV is reached.

Chaos Ethics, Winchester and Chicago: Zero Books, 2014 Wood has suggested that \\"all ethical theories are uncertain, questionable, and not apt for justified belief\\", suggesting that foundational principles for ethics (such as those developed by Kant) remain useful because they allow people with different viewpoints to frame their arguments cogently. He has suggested that basic ethical values, such as human flourishing and the dignity of human persons, \\"have a role to play in helping people to think better about the terribly problematic situations that face us.\\" In his keynote address to the Cape Town University Law School in 2007, Wood compared Kant's realm of ends to the African ideal of ubuntu, suggesting that although the two ideas were not the same \\"I do think they represent very much the same response to the human condition, as manifested in different cultural and historical conditions.\\"Wood, Allen. ‚ÄúHuman Dignity, Right and the Realm of Ends‚Äù, Keynote Address to the Conference on Dignity and Law, Cape Town University Law School, 2007.

History Sedge has been a common material for household goods in Korea since the Silla period (57 BCE ‚Äì 935 CE). Despite the availability of the plant, which grows well in the waterlogged soil of rice paddies, sedge products were highly prized and were used as decoration in royal palaces and given as tribute to other nations. A sedge basket known as a pyebaek dongguri was an important element of the traditional wedding rite, and royal sacrificial ceremonies in the Goryeo period employed sedge weaving as a religious sacrament. Construction The process of creating sedge products starts with the farming of the raw material. Sedge is planted in April and harvested only a few months later in the summer. The cut stalks are boiled, dried, soaked, and then dried again in a process that, after several repetitions, bleaches them to a shiny white colour. Some strands are dyed to enable coloured highlights and designs in the finished work. Two principal methods for weaving the sedge exist: one involving the use of tools or machines, the other performed entirely by hand. These are sometimes referred to as \\"close\\" and \\"sparse\\" weaving. Machine weaving is predominantly used for making mats, whilst boxes, bowls and baskets require hand weaving. A basic frame (no) is created first, comprising interwoven sedge strands; the samori, or vertical sections, are then weaved into this. At this stage, images, patterns and characters are incorporated into the design, in a process called tteumjil. The process of creation is lengthy, taking up to two weeks for the construction of a hand-made sajuham (\\"three-tiered box\\"). Yi Sang-jae The current master of wanchojang is Yi Sang-jae from Ganghwado, an area that has long been a site of sedge cultivation and weaving. Born in 1943, he has been working in sedge for over fifty years, and has had his works exhibited in Japan and the UK. Yi, along with the art of wanchojang itself, was designated in 1996 as an Important Intangible Cultural Asset.

In the last years, this village has grown thanks to a new piece of land which was said to be developable.  Local economy  Agriculture and animal breeding.  History  A general view of Calle Real in Villavega Villavega was first named in an ancient quote of Castrillo de Villavega. It was named in Alfonso VIII¬¥s last will, in 1204, about 300 years after the establishment of this monument when this monarch ordered the delivery of the castle to the institution named as Orden Militar de San Juan de Jerusalem also known as Orden del Hospital, which was in charge of the security in this area. According to the historian Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, during the Middle Ages Villavega belonged to Meryndat de Mon√ßon. However, this information does not appear in the book Becerro de las Behetr√≠as de Castilla.

He was also vice-president of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, a pro-Kuomintang union, and chairman of the Cotton Industry Workers' General Union.  Early life  Pang was born in Shanghai, China on 26 June 1921. He moved to Hong Kong with his family in 1949.  Career  In 1952, Pang was a clerk in a cotton mills. In the 1950s, founded the Cotton Industry Workers' General Union for the cotton mill workers and successfully implemented the eight-hour shift system before he became its chairman in 1957.

He was appointed by the colonial government to the Labour Advisory Board in 1965. During the 1967 labour disputes which later turned into Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots, Pang opposed the pro-Beijing leftist workers' intimidation to young workers to join the labour strikes on 29 May. He urged the workers to report for work the following day with the assurance that government protection would be sought for them against the intimidators.

Launched at Baltic Shipyard and outfitted at Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, she is one of the largest and most powerful diesel-electric icebreakers in the world with a displacement of about 22,000tons and a propulsion power of 25megawatts. The construction of the 7.94 billion ruble icebreaker was awarded to Baltic Shipyard in December 2011. Initially expected to enter service in late 2015, the vessel was completed several years behind schedule and over budget. In 2017, it was announced that the unfinished vessel would be moved to nearby Admiralty Shipyard for outfitting in order to speed up the delivery. Due to a fire on board the vessel in November 2018 and a disagreement over the increased cost of the icebreaker, the delivery of Viktor Chernomyrdin was postponed to late 2020.  Development and construction   Background  The development of the icebreaker designated as LK-25 dates back to the first long-term plans for rebuilding the Russian icebreaker fleet after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As part of these plans that were published in the early 1990s, a number of both conventional and nuclear- powered icebreaker icebreaker type size series were developed, ranging from 7-megawatt auxiliary icebreakers (LK-7) operating near large ports to 110-megawatt nuclear icebreakers (LK-110Ya) capable of breaking ice up to thick. Of these, the 25-megawatt line icebreakers (LK-25) were intended to escort merchant ships and lead convoys through freezing seas, and operate as auxiliary ships in complex convoys along the Northern Sea Route. During the summer season, they could also escort ships independently over shallow waters in the Arctic. While an early LK-25 concept was presented already in the 1990s, the current design, Project 22600, was developed in 2008 by the Russian Petrobalt Design Bureau in co-operation with the Finnish Aker Arctic who had developed the hybrid propulsion configuration and carried out model-scale tests for the concept.Projects. Petrobalt Design Bureau.  Shipbuilding contract and start of construction  Following the challenging winter navigating season of 2010‚Äì2011, during which ice conditions in the Baltic Sea became so severe that Russia was forced to call in the nuclear-powered icebreaker Vaygach from Murmansk to escort ships in the eastern Gulf of Finland, the Russian government decided to include a 25-megawatt diesel- electric icebreaker to the federal program Development of the Transport System of Russia (2010‚Äì2020). On 2 December 2011, Rosmorport and St. Petersburg-based Baltic Shipyard signed a contract, worth RUB 7.94 billion of which 30% was paid in advance, for the construction of the new line icebreaker. The keel- laying ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was held on 10 October 2012.

Full-scale icebreaking trials, initially planned for March‚ÄìApril 2020, have also been postponed.  Disagreement over cost  Initially, the delivery of the vessel was scheduled for 25 December 2019. However, on 24 December it was reported that while Viktor Chernomyrdin was technically ready and manned, the delivery had been postponed to the first quarter of 2020. According to the United Shipbuilding Corporation, the new icebreaker would be handed over to Rosmorport once all legal and financial issues with the customer have been resolved. Until then, Rosmorport had refused to pay the excess cost of the vessel beyond the original contract price of about 8 billion rubles, currently estimated to be between 3 and 4 billion rubles on top of that. Since the December 2019 delivery date had not been extended by a new governmental decree, this cost overrun could have been further increased by a penalty of up to 1 billion rubles for the missed deadline. In April 2020, it was announced that the disagreement had been settled with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and Ministry of Transport each allocating an additional 1 billion rubles for the project. In addition, the United Shipbuilding Corporation would provide an additional 1.5 billion rubles to cover the increased cost of the vessel. Following this agreement, Viktor Chernomyrdin was expected to enter service in late 2020. The official deadline for the delivery of Viktor Chernomyrdin is 1 November, but the acceptance and delivery certificate was signed already on 30 September 2020. The official delivery ceremony will be held on 3 November 2020, the tenth anniversary of the death of Viktor Chernomyrdin after whom the icebreaker is named.  Career  When the new icebreaker type size series were developed in the early 1990s, the 25-megawatt \\"linear sea icebreaker\\" (LK-25) was intended to operate primarily along the Northern Sea Route. In November 2019, the Russian newspaper Kommersant wrote that during the eight years that Viktor Chernomyrdin has been under construction, both the idea of what kind of icebreakers are needed in the Arctic as well as the organizations responsible for the infrastructure of the region have changed. The Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom, which took over the management of the Northern Sea Route in 2019, considers the capabilities of the new diesel- electric icebreaker to be insufficient compared to the nuclear-powered icebreakers it operates through its subsidiary Atomflot. However, the ship's owner Rosmorport is allowed to offer icebreaking services directly to other companies operating in the region. In August 2020, it was announced that Viktor Chernomyrdin would be stationed in the Baltic Sea.  Description   General characteristics  Viktor Chernomyrdin is long overall and has a maximum moulded beam of . She was initially designed with an operating draught range of with a full load displacement of about 22,000 tonnes, but later design changes have increased the maximum draught to about . The reduced draught can be used in shallow waters such as river estuaries.LK25 main particulars. Vladimir I. Shtrambrand, Arctic Passion Seminar 2013. These main dimensions make Viktor Chernomyrdin the largest diesel-powered icebreaker in the world, second only to the Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers. The icebreaker has a crew of 38 and additional accommodation for 90 special personnel. In addition to normal icebreaking and escorting tasks, Viktor Chernomyrdin is equipped for emergency towing and rescue operations in open water, oil spill response, offshore and underwater construction projects, and fire fighting. To support technical work, the ship can be fitted with a 150-ton deck crane. The large superstructure contains over of scientific laboratory space. A modular \\"diving complex\\" consisting of a diving chamber and other support systems built in standard-sized containers can be carried on the deck. An outboard lift allows persons with limited physical abilities as well as compact equipment to be lowered directly to the sea ice.First Aker Arctic multi-screw DAS hybrid propulsion application.

The icebreaker has a smaller helipad in the bow for Kamov Ka-32 and Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma, and a larger helicopter deck and hangar capable of accommodating heavier Mil Mi-8 and AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in the aft.  Power and propulsion  Viktor Chernomyrdin has a fully integrated diesel-electric propulsion system. Built according to the power plant principle, the four medium-speed diesel generating sets with an output of each produce electricity for all shipboard consumers from propulsion motors to hotel functions such as lighting and air conditioning. The propulsion system consists of two ABB Azipod VI1600 azimuthing propulsion unitsReferences - Propulsion Products. ABB. and one propulsion motor driving a fixed shaft line at the centerline; a so-called hybrid configuration. While Viktor Chernomyrdin is not as powerful as the Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers, at her propulsion power is nonetheless one of the highest among diesel-electric icebreakers. At the time of construction, she was second only to the three Ermak-class icebreakers built in the mid-1970s. However, she is still significantly less powerful than the gas turbine-powered USCGC Polar Star and USCGC Polar Sea operated by the United States Coast Guard. Designed according to the double acting ship principle, Viktor Chernomyrdin is capable of moving continuously in compact ice field up to thick with a snow cover at in both ahead and astern directions. In addition, the azimuthing propulsion units give the vessel superior maneuverability to traditional icebreakers with shaftlines and rudders.

He worked as a journalist for the Antara news agency from 1956 until his retirement in 1983. He predominantly covered foreign policy and the economy for Antara. He had also served as Antara's bureau chief in the Netherlands as well. Chudori had close contacts within the Indonesian government and has been described as well-versed in the economic policies of the Suharto government at the time. Suharto's Economic Minister Widjojo Nitisastro often included Chudori, a prominent economics reporter, as an official member of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI) annual meeting in The Hague. In 1983, Chudori co-founded the English-language newspaper, The Jakarta Post, shortly after retiring from Antara. He also became the first general manager of The Jakarta Post.

Gelibolu was the first Ottoman province in Europe, and for over a century the main base of the Ottoman Navy. Thereafter, and until the 18th century, it served as the seat of the Kapudan Pasha and capital of the Eyalet of the Archipelago.  History  Gallipoli (from Greek Kallipolis, Turkish Gelibolu) was always a site of particular strategic importance, as it controlled the Dardanelles straits. Already under the Byzantine Empire, it served as a naval base. The Ottoman Turks first captured the strong fortress from the Byzantines in 1354, along with other sites in the area, aided by an earthquake that collapsed their walls. Gallipoli secured the Ottomans a toehold in the Balkans, and became the seat of the chief Ottoman governor in Rumelia. The fortress was recaptured for Byzantium by the Savoyard Crusade in 1366, but the beleaguered Byzantines were forced to hand it back in September 1376. Gallipoli became the main crossing point for the Ottoman armies moving between Europe and Asia, protected by the Ottoman navy, which had its main base in the city. Sultan Bayezid I () refortified Gallipoli and strengthened its walls and harbour defences, but initially, the weak Ottoman fleet remained incapable of fully controlling passage of the Dardanelles, especially when confronted by the Venetians. As a result, during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì1479) the straits' defences were strengthened by two new fortresses, and the Ottoman imperial arsenal was established in Istanbul itself. Gallipoli remained the main base of the Ottoman fleet until 1515, when it was moved to Istanbul. After this it began to lose its military importance, but remained a major commercial centre as the most important crossing-point between Asia and Europe. From the second Ottoman conquest until 1533, Gallipoli was a sanjak of the Rumelia Eyalet. In 1533, the new Eyalet of the Archipelago, which included most of the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea, was created for Hayreddin Barbarossa, the Ottoman Navy's Kapudan Pasha (chief admiral), and Gallipoli became the seat and capital province (pasha-sanjak) of the Archipelago, until the 18th century, when the Kapudan Pasha moved his seat to Istanbul. By 1846, the sanjak of Gallipoli became part of the Eyalet of Adrianople, and after 1864, as part of the wide-ranging vilayet reform, of the Adrianople Vilayet. Parts of the province were occupied by Bulgarian troops in the First Balkan War, but where recovered by the Ottomans in the Second Balkan War. During the First World War, it was the scene of the Gallipoli Campaign. After the war, the sanjak was briefly (1920‚Äì1922) occupied by Greece according to the provisions of the Treaty of S√®vres, and became a Greek prefecture. Following the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, it returned to Turkey. Gallipoli was a province center between 1922 and 1926 with districts of Gelibolu, Eceabat, Ke≈üan (also included present districts of ƒ∞psala and Enez as townships) and ≈ûark√∂y before division between provinces of √áanakkale, Edirne and Tekirdaƒü.  Administrative division  Originally the sanjak of Gallipoli included wide parts of southern Thrace, from K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece on the outskirts of Istanbul to the mouths of the Strymon River, and initially even Galata and Izmid (Nicomedia). According to a register of 1600, its districts (nahiyes) were: Gelibolu and Evre≈üe, Lemnos, Tasoz (Thasos), Miƒüal-kara (Malkara) and Harala, Abri, Ke≈üan, Ipsala, and G√ºm√ºlcine (Komotini). The early 17th-century official Ayn-i Ali Efendi records that it contained 14 ziamets and 85 timars, while later in the same century the traveller Evliya √áelebi recorded 6 ziamets and 122 timars. With the vilayet reform of 1864, the sanjak of Gallipoli comprised six kazas: Gelibolu, ≈ûark√∂y, Ferecik (Feres), Ke≈üan, Malkara and Enoz. With the detachment of the new Sanjak of G√ºm√ºlcine in 1878, the sanjak was reduced in extent, and by World War I contained only three kazas: Ke≈üan, M√ºrefte and ≈ûark√∂y.

The investigation into his disappearance has been ongoing ever since, with five men arrested in 2011, although no charges have been brought. The case The case has, over the years, attracted significant media coverage, in part due to its mysterious nature ‚Äì Damien was last seen in a fish and chip shop near his home in Cowes, and then never again, indicating his death. Surviving CCTV footage shows Nettles trying to order at a local chip shop, in a confused state. Multiple witnesses from the evening claim he appeared heavily intoxicated, or looked \\"spaced out\\", and his friends recall him possibly trying to acquire drugs. However, other footage of the night in question was lost by Hampshire Police, preventing the full corroboration of witness accounts which had begun to piece together a narrative regarding Nettles' last movements. As reported in the documentary Unsolved: The Boy Who Disappeared the police originally claimed that the man responsible for collecting video footage had lost the tapes after police had returned them, but records relating to evidence proved that was not the case. In episode five of Unsolved: The Boy Who Disappeared Nettles' mother expresses frustration at the police's handling of her son's disappearance, which had led to an official complaint on her part. Frustration is also expressed at the police's refusal to be interviewed about the disappearance for TV in 2016, and although the police maintain that Nettles' case remains open, she states dissatisfaction about what this actually entails. Nettles' mother comments 'if they'd done it right the first time I wouldn't be here now'. Crucial records, including the log of calls made to police that night are gone, police notebooks were not retained, and even details of which officers were on duty that night have now been lost. There have been several public campaigns to bring attention to his case. Disappearance Various theories have emerged to explain Damien's disappearance, including that he owed money to drug dealers. Rumours have persistently alleged that a local drug dealer who was in the area on the night Nettles vanished, was involved. Witness accounts include recollections of holding a boy up against a wall whose physique matched Nettles'. Associates were arrested, and released. The documentary Unsolved: The Boy Who Disappeared also mentions rumours of shortly after Nettles' disappearance referring to himself as a 'damned man', and of him incinerating suspicious objects outside his house. The documentary also mentions possibly making a 'deathbed confession' about Nettles before dying of a heroin overdose. In 2013, the police put up a reward for new information leading to solving the case. On 25 July 2016, a BBC Three series, Unsolved: The Boy Who Disappeared, was broadcast about the case.

In the spring of 1572, after the capture of Valenciennes by a Protestant force under Louis of Nassau, the Dutch commander continued with his offensive and took Mons by surprise on 24 May.The Eighty Years War (1568-1648) After three months of siege, and the defeats of the armies of Jean de Hangest, seigneur d'Yvoy and Genlis, and William the Silent, Prince of Orange (Dutch: Willem van Oranje), by the Spanish army led by Don Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba (\\"The Iron Duke\\"), Governor- General of the Spanish Netherlands, and his son, Don Fadrique de Toledo, Louis of Nassau's forces, isolated and without any hope of help, surrendered Mons to the Duke of Alba on 19 September.Hern√°n/Maffi p.24Without French assistance, William of Orange, leading a German mercenary army to aid his brother, was driven back into Germany; the garrison of Mons was thus cut off and ‚Äìeventually‚Äì forced to accept the terms. Trim p.162 Background In early May 1572 Louis of Nassau, one of the major commanders of the Dutch rebel forces, encouraged by the victory at Brielle by the Sea Beggars (1 April),Elliott p.140 and supported by the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, invaded the Spanish Netherlands with an army composed by German, English, Scottish, and French soldiers, and took Valenciennes on 21 May.Tracy p.82 On 23 May Louis of Nassau arrived at Mons with 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, who encamped in the environs of the city.Macgregor p.204 At the next day, after finding out the schedules of opening of the doors of Mons, Nassau entered the city by surprise with the cavalry, and then the rest of his forces, defeating the small Spanish garrison.Mons was the capital of Hainaut, and an important town, protected by lofty walls, a triple moat, and a strong citadel. Macgregor p.203 Louis took control of the city, and a few days later, was reinforced by about 4,500 infantry and cavalry under the command of the Count of Montgomery. When the news reached the Spanish headquarters, Don Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands, and commander-in-chief of the Spanish forces in the Low Countries, sent his son Don Fadrique with 4,000 soldiers (another 16,000 soldiers were coming from the north), along with the Maestre de Campo Chiappino Vitelli, to defeat Louis of Nassau and retrieve Mons. On 23 June Fadrique's forces arrived at Mons and laid siege to the city. Furthermore, in early June, the Duke of Alba, at the head of the bulk of the Spanish army, recaptured Valenciennes after a feeble defence of the Protestant garrison, depriving the rebels, and their French allies, of one of their main bases. Meanwhile, William of Orange, Prince of Orange, had recruited in Germany an army of 14,000 soldiers of infantry and 3,000 of cavalry (11,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry according to other sources), and on 7 July William crossed the Rhine, entering the Netherlands. Siege of Mons fortress-city of Mons. Siege of Mons by Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, 1572. Bor Nederlantsche Oorloghen. Louis of Nassau, aware of the progress of his brother, sent Jean de Hangest, seigneur d'Yvoy and Genlis, to France for more reinforcements, and in mid-July, Genlis, with an army of 10,000 men, crossed the border again, and marched towards Mons. Louis sent a message to Genlis, urging that he should join with the army of his brother, William of Orange, but Genlis ignored the message, and advanced against the Spaniards.Macgregor p.208 Battle of Saint-Ghislain On 19 July Genlis and his forces encamped near Mons, in a circular plane. Don Fadrique, aware of his arrival, advanced towards him with 4,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 3,000 armed villagers for the occasion. Genlis sent a detachment to reconnoitre, but after seeing the advance of the Spanish forces, these troops retreated to the French camp at full speed. \\"Don Frederic de Toledo is coming upon us\\", they cried. The Spanish cavalry of Philip of Noircarmes, without delay, charged against the French army, followed by infantry, while the rear was protected by the cavalry of Don Bernardino de Mendoza. The attack caused panic among the French Huguenots, and then, the Spanish infantry shattered the French army. The Spanish victory was complete, and the army of Genlis was entirely routed.The panic this caused among the French Huguenots was not easily allayed, and before they were aware, Noircarmes was charging upon them at the head of his cavalry, and the infantry arriving directly after, the army of Genlis was entirely routed. Macgregor p. 208 About 2,000 French soldiers were killed or wounded, and 700 captured, including 70 nobles and officers (in the following days, more than 4,000 were captured). The leader of the French army, Jean de Hangest, was also captured, and taken prisoner to Antwerp.Trim p.162 The Captain was honored with carrying the news of the victory to King Philip II, for the proven value during the battle. Meantime, the Prince of Orange with his new army continued to advance towards Mons. On 23 July, after the capture of Roermond, his troops mutinied. On 27 August, with guarantees of payment of some cities in Holland, crossed the Meuse, advancing over Diest, Termonde, Oudenaarde, and Nivelles.Macgregor p.209 St. Bartholomew's Day On 11 August Gaspard de Coligny, with the approval of King Charles IX, had written to the Prince, that he expected soon to begin his march towards the Netherlands. However, in France, Charles IX lost his nerve, fearing a Spanish invasion and a Catholic rebellion if he persisted in the planned invasion of the Netherlands to support the Huguenots and the Dutch Protestants. The result was St. Bartholomew's Day massacre on 23 August.Calvin's book was \\"Praelectiones in librum prophetiarum Danielis\\". Geneva and Laon, 1561. Holt (2005) p.81 When the news reached the Netherlands, it affected the morale of the Protestant troops (especially in the army of Louis of Nassau at Mons, because a great part of his troops were Huguenots), while in the Spanish camp it was celebrated by bonfires and illuminations, even in the St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral, the Catholic population sang anthems in honor of \\"the most Christian King of France\\".Macgregor p.210 In early September, Don Fernando, Duke of Alba (who despite being a strong defender of Catholicism, described the massacre as an atrocity), arrived at Mons with reinforcements and took command of the operations. The Prince of Orange continued to advance through the Netherlands, and some cities and villages were forced to open the doors to its passage for fear (Alba was specially angry for this), although some, such as Leuven, prevented the Orange's troops entering the city, in exchange for supplies. On 10 September the army arrived near Mons, and Alba, knowing the Orange's arrival, positioned his troops for a possible attack. William of Orange's army Don Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba \\"The Iron Duke\\", by Antonis Mor. William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Revolt, by Adriaen Thomasz. Key. On the same day, as expected, the Orange's cavalry attacked the flank of the Spanish army, but was repulsed by the Spanish arquebusiers, led in the first line by the Duke of Alba, his son Don Fadrique, and the Duke of Medinaceli, causing multiple casualties in the Orange's cavalry.Jaques (2007) p.676Vi√©ndolos en lugar tan peligroso, hiciera con m√°s raz√≥n juicio del ser soldados muy arriesgados que no generales. Gim√©nez Mart√≠n. After the failed attack, the Prince retreated to the village of Harmignies, about a league from Mons. On the night of 11 September the Spanish commander, Maestre de Campo Juli√°n Romero, entered the camp of William of Orange commanding 600 arquebusiers, remaining as a reserve, in rear, the same number, supported by units of infantry and light cavalry, whose purpose was to protect the withdrawal.Macgregor p. 210‚Äì211 In this raid 600 rebels were killed, for only 60 Spaniards. Hundred of horses were captured, and a great part of the tents and the supplies were destroyed and burned. During the action, William of Orange himself was in profound slumber, and was saved by the barking of his Spaniel dog, who slept beside him. With a heavy heart, William wrote to his brother Louis of his forlorn condition and inability to relieve Mons.Macgregor p.211 The Prince retreated with his army to Nivelles and Mechelen, marching to the Rhine, and finally the bulk of his troops, mutinous for lack of pay, dispersed towards Germany. Thereafter he made his way almost alone to Holland, the only province which still remained true to him. Surrender After the defeat of the army of French Huguenots under Jean de Hangest, and the withdrawal of the army of William of Orange, Louis of Nassau found himself isolated in Mons. Even the French Huguenots under his command mutinied as a consequence for the support of the King of France to the massacre of St. Bartholomew.Macgregor pp.212‚Äì213 On 19 September Louis of Nassau surrendered Mons to the Duke of Alba and the terms of the capitulation were agreed between the Dutch and the Spaniards. Immediate Consequences Portrait of Louis of Nassau by Adriaen Thomasz Key. Louis of Nassau would be received by the Duke of Alba, the Duke of Medinaceli, and Don Fadrique. The city would be evacuated on 21 September, and on 24 September the Duke of Alba entered Mons. Philip of Noircames, by his position as Governor of Hainaut, took command of the city. All towns that had accepted the authority of Prince William of Orange, many for fear of reprisals, returned to the allegiance to the Duke of Alba.Israel p.178 However, Alba advanced over Mechelen, one of the cities that lent support to the Orange's army, and where the Prince had left a small garrison. In retaliation for the assistance provided by the city to the rebel army of William of Orange, and to satisfy the arrears of pay of the soldiers of the Spanish regiments, the Duke of Alba ordered the troops under the command of his son Don Fadrique to sack the city.Macgregor p.214 After dealing with Orange's threat in the south, Alba sent his son Don Fadrique to the two rebellious provinces Gelderland and Holland. Fadrique started his campaign by the capture of the fortress-city of Zutphen in Gelderland. On his way to Amsterdam, Don Fadrique came across Naarden, which surrendered on 22 November 1572. Long-Term Consequences The loss of Mons proved irreversible. The Dutch Revolt never got another chance to rally the Walloon Protestants to its cause, which remained confined to the North. Nine years later Mons became part of the staunchly Catholic Union of Arras which accepted the Spanish rule, and Protestantism there was stamped out. Thus, the Dutch rebels losing the chance to gain Mons was an important step towards the division of what had been the single Habsburg Netherlands into two distinct entities - ultimately the present Netherlands and Belgium.

Plot Summer 1986: Pia, an 11-year-old schoolgirl, is raped and murdered in a wheat field near a small provincial German town by one man while another man watches silently from the passenger seat of his red car. The murderer packs Pia's body into the trunk of the car and leaves her bicycle behind. In 2009, exactly 23 years later, 13-year-old Sinikka Weghamm goes missing from the local fair. Her bicycle is discovered in the same spot where Pia's bike had been found. Senior detective Krischan Mittich, who investigated the original murder, has just retired. The new murder investigation is undertaken by David Jahn, a detective who is still emotionally overwhelmed by the death of his wife five months earlier. Mittich takes an interest in the new case, but he is blocked from participating by the new senior detective, Matthias Grimmer, who insists on doing things his way, even when he is wrong. A flashback shows the initial meeting of Pia's murderer, Danish national Peer Sommer, and his companion, a student named Timo. The men form a bond as Sommer shares his collection of pornographic films, including one that shows the abuse of an adolescent girl, with Timo. Timo leaves after Pia's murder, to Sommer's dismay. Mittich, the retired detective, visits Pia's mother and rails against the false hope that detective Grimmer holds out for Sinikka's parents, who grow increasingly upset at the lack of progress in the investigation. Timo, who has married, taken his wife's last name, and had two children of his own, is now an architect. Upon hearing of the new murder, he leaves home and makes his way back to Sommer. Sommer is glad to see his old friend and says that he'd tried unsuccessfully to find Timo after he'd left 23 years earlier. Sommer gives Timo a DVD copy of the old film with the girl. Timo leaves Sommer again. He watches the DVD in his hotel room and cries with shame and guilt. He goes to see Pia's mother. His questions about Pia make the mother suspicious, and she tells ex-detective Mittich about him. Timo goes to the police station, presumably to confess, and Jahn notices him in the parking lot about to exit his car, but Timo has second thoughts and leaves. Based on Timo's suspicious questions to Pia's mother, Jahn and Mittich visit Timo's house. He is not home, but the detectives question his wife and then find child pornography on his computer. Jahn meanwhile has gotten the idea of matching the list of red cars in the vicinity of Pia's murder with the list of red cars in the vicinity of an earlier murder. After initially rejecting the idea, Grimmer adopts the idea and sends his subordinates, including pregnant Jana Gl√§ser, but not including Jahn, out to interview the owners of the cars. Jahn sets out with Gl√§ser anyway, but he leaves her when he gets word that a suspicious man (Timo) has visited Pia's mother. Gl√§ser interviews Sommer alone. Sommer consults his diary to provide an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of Sinikka's murder; he hides a knife on his person in case she acts too suspicious, but she tentatively accepts the alibi, though she puts a question mark next to Sommer's name. Timo commits suicide by driving a car into the lake where Sinikka is later found, and afterwards, Grimmer believes that Timo was the sole murderer of both girls, but Jahn is not convinced. Following this, Sinikka's body is found by a swimmer, and her parents are informed. Jahn realizes that Pia's headphones had been tossed from the passenger side of the car after her murder, and that means that someone else was driving the car. He hypothesizes that Sinikka's murder had been a signal from the other man, a lonely pedophile, that he wanted to reunite with his old friend. But Grimmer does not want to hear any new theories, and, after a tussle, he suspends Jahn. Sommer, who had told detective Gl√§ser that he no longer has a car, is seen returning home in a car lent to him by a neighbor‚Äîthe same car that was used in Sinikka's abduction. He learns of Timo's death, and the film ends with him contemplating the loss of his friend.

Leukocyte polarization is an important requirement for migration, activation and apoptosis in the adaptive and innate immune systems; most leukocytes, including monocytes, granulocytes, and T and B lymphocytes migrate to and from primary and secondary lymphoid organs to tissues to initiate immune responses to pathogens.  Role in amoeboid cell migration  Amoeboid cell migration mechanisms enable rapid movement without strong adhesion to tissue and that doesn't harm cell tissues, as opposed to other types of cell migration. The cell is also able to interact and integrate environmental signals so it can quickly find and follow chemical signals left by other cells or pathogens. Amoeboid movement generally consists of four main stages of movement: # The leading edge protrudes via changes in the actin cytoskeleton, sometimes with protrusions called pseudopods # Membrane and surface receptors interact with the substrate (usually other cells) # Actomyosin mediates contraction of the cell body # The cell body is pushed forward and adhesion forces in the rear uropod release In more detail, after receptors on the cell recognize extracellular signals, cell contents are polarized to create different front and rear environments. Already, adhesion forces between the substrate and cell are present in the form of integrin/ICAM binding between cells. The uropod protrusion extends from the cell body due to actin polymerization and actomyosin extension, as cellular signals interact with cell and membrane contents. Actomyosin contraction pushes the cell forward by squeezing the cell contents in the direction of cell movement, prompting release of adhesion forces between the cell and environment and resulting in an overall change in position towards the extracellular signals. These cyclic steps ensure fast movement towards a specific stimulus, such as pathogenic proteins or other signals.  Mechanism  The uropod protrudes backward from the nucleus and main cell body and contains specific organelles, densely packed adhesion and signaling proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. Several cell organelles are present in the rear of the cell to aid in quick and efficient movement, including the microtubule-organizing center, the golgi apparatus, and the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria also localize near the uropod to efficiently deliver ATP to ATP-dependent actomyosin contraction. This redistribution of cell contents towards polarized structures is also important for cell activation, cell communication, and apoptosis, and thus uropod formation plays a crucial part in these functions. Though research is ongoing, many cell signals and mechanisms are known to play a part in uropod formation and retraction. In leukocytes, polarized RhoA signaling regulates uropod formation and retraction, in comparison with CDC42 signaling in the leading edge pseudopods. These enzymes, both in the Rho family, interact with other factors such as GEFs, GAPs, myosin II and Rac proteins to control front and rear cytoskeletal elements and create the cycle of movement important to cell movement. Cyclic GMP and AMP have been shown to affect uropod formation, and are generally important for cell polarization and chemotaxis. Uropod membranes generally have high density of CD43 and CD44 and adhesion receptors (ICAM-1, ICAM-3, B1 integrins, and ERM adaptor proteins). These receptors mediate cell- matrix and cell-cell interactions during migration and have an anchoring function, which serves to steady the leukocyte and interact with tissue cells. Lipid rafts segregated to the uropod and leading edge are also known to aid actomyosin activity.

Starring an ensemble cast, the film follows various characters from different backgrounds confessing to their wrongdoings and revealing their biggest secrets just 72 hours from what is believed to be \\"Judgement Day\\". It was released on April 18, 2013. Judgement Day marks John Cheng's final feature film role before his death on January 21, 2013. Plot With about 72 hours left to spend before \\"Judgement Day\\" supposedly arrives, various individuals start spilling out their greatest secrets. Cast * Mark Lee as a police officer. * Henry Thia as Liu Fu An, a man who decides to change his gender. * Chua En Lai as Richard * Rebecca Lim as Rebecca, Richard's girlfriend * Guo Liang * Edwin Goh * Julie Tan as Xiao Lu, a prostitute with AIDS * Lawrence Wong as Ah Song * Sebestian Tan as a car salesman. * Tender Huang as Taiwanese man * Ko Chia-yen as Li Shuzhen * John Cheng as medium Uncle Jiu. * Adrian Pang as Prime Minister Dr Ang Release The original release date in Singapore was put forth as \\"May 2013\\" in an earlier teaser poster; this has since been changed to April 18, 2013. Summary The film opens with a news report broadcast to Singapore that scientists have discovered a meteorite heading straight for earth and that there was only 72 hours left to live. Upon hearing this, Henry Thia's character tells his family that his last death wish was to become a woman, so he goes for MTF surgery to do this. We then follow the story of how his children are ridiculed in school for having two \\"mothers\\". In the end of the 72 hours, we are shown a scene of people at their HDB corridors looking out at the sky, bracing for impact. The meteorite whirls down from space; however, the meteorite burns out into a small stone which hits a boy squarely in the forehead for comedic effect. The people rejoice; however, scientists break the mood and report that another meteorite, which was ten times larger and sure to destroy earth, was coming. The film ends.

Biography Gilles Picot, a Norman squire, member of the local but ancient gentry, was the eldest son of Guillaume V Picot, squire de Gouberville, and Jeanne du Fou, daughter of Guillaume du Fou, squire of Barville, and Mesnil-au-Val and captain of the ch√¢teau in Cherbourg. Lord of the manor in Mesnil-au-Val, Gilles succeeded his father as ‚Äúlieutenant des Eaux et For√™ts‚Äù (in charge of watercourses and forests) for the viscounty of Valognes in 1543. In 1544, he inherited the manors of Gouberville and Mesnil-au-Val from his father and in 1560 the manor of Russy from his uncle Jean Picot, a cleric. He is the author of a diary or accounts book (livre de raison) of which only the years from 1549 to 1562 have come down to us; the original manuscript was found in the archives of the ch√¢teau in Saint-Pierre-√âglise. This Journal written in Middle French (republished in 4 volumes by the √âditions des champs, 1993-1994) is a firsthand report of the life of a country squire in the Northern part of the Cotentin during the 16th century. When he began writing his journal, the squire of Gouberville was about 30 years old. He was in the prime of his life, hardy, clever, well-trained, skilled in swordsmanship. He could shoot with a crossbow and with a musket. Competent at games of skill and strength, he enjoyed jousting with his friends. When necessary, he was also quite versed in using farm implements and driving heavy loads. An educated man, he could read in Latin and used the Greek alphabet to transcribe sentences in French when he wanted to keep some information secret. His methodical and orderly mind, such as it appears in his Livre de raison, reveals the common sense that he demonstrated in every occasion. However, the most distinctive features of this young squire are his compassion and his moral values which make him so endearing. On 28 March 1553, in his Journal, he mentioned the practice of distilling cider to make apple brandy, the first reference to the spirits known today as Calvados. He is buried somewhere in the church in Le Mesnil-au- Val, the exact location is unknown. Since 1986, an association called the Comit√© Gilles de Gouberville has been busy providing information about the Norman squire, organizing lectures and visits, and publishing annually Les Cahiers goubervilliens since September 1997. Twitter publishes a daily tweet from the Journal, using an entry from the same day 458 years ago. Further reading * Le Journal du sire de Gouberville, √âd.

It is situated in an estate near the town of Gransee southeast of the lake. History Schloss Meseberg Ceiling fresco by Bernhard Rode Built by the family in 1739 to replace a previous building on the site that had burnt down, the Schloss passed to the von der Gr√∂ben family in the second half of the century. In 1774, the property and adjacent land parcels were purchased by Prince Henry of Prussia, who resided in nearby Rheinsberg Palace, and one year later were gifted to his paramour, Christian Ludwig von Kaphengst (1740-1800). In this way Heinrich complied with the command of his brother, King Frederick II, to remove Kaphengst from the court at Rheinsberg. Kaphengst furnished and decorated the palace lavishly, commissioning ceiling frescoes from Bernhard Rode, including one depicting an apotheosis of Heinrich. The estate grew with the construction of additional buildings, including the stables. Under Kaphengst and his successors, the baroque garden was extended, and an English garden edging most of the lake shore was landscaped by Peter Joseph Lenn√©. The property was later purchased by the Lessing family, owners of the Berlin newspaper Vossische Zeitung. During the Nazi era, it was forcibly acquired by Hermann G√∂ring, only to be appropriated by the Soviet occupation in 1945. The East German government used it to house a grocery store and school rooms, which preserved it from demolition. A plan to renovate the dilapidated palace and turn it into a conference center for the Academy of Sciences was never realized.Nicholas Kulish (March 15, 2012), A Village Where Europe Can Take a Stroll and Plot Its Future New York Times. Following the reunification of Germany the estate was bought by the Messerschmitt Foundation in 1995. The foundation, devoted to preserving historical landmarks, spent 11 years and more than $30 million renovating the stucco building, with its Ionic half-columns and high mansard roof. In 2004, the Messerschmitt Foundation agreed to lease the palace to the Federal German Government for 20 years, for a symbolic annual rent of one euro. The government subsequently spent $17 million to install security and communications equipment and period furniture and paintings. Since 2007, it has been the retreat of the Chancellor of Germany (as Chequers is for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Camp David for the President of the United States). The government regularly holds its cabinet conclave at Meseberg. Chancellor Angela Merkel hosts many state guests at Meseberg. In their so-called Meseberg Declaration,Meseberg Declaration Press and Information Office of the Federal Government, press release of 19 June 2018.

Origin The former Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE). Two formations were organised in London District to command these units, provisionally known as the 2nd and 3rd London Air Defence Brigades, but soon numbered 26th and 27th.Flight 24 August 1922 Both brigades were based at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea. 3rd AD Bde's units were initially based at Lytton Grove, Putney, taking over buildings previously used by the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders).War Office to HM Treasury 19 February 1923, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file T 161/32/3.

As part of this reorganisation, 26th (London) Bde assumed command of all the gun and searchlight units of the two former brigades, while the 27th was reformed as 27th (Home Counties) Anti- Aircraft Group, based at RAF Kenley, to command new AA units in the South London suburbs.Routledge, p. 59.Frederick, pp. 1049‚Äì50.Monthly Army List Jan 1936 * 60th (City of London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA, (TA) (heavy anti- aircraft (HAA) gun unit formed in 1935 by conversion of 4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment)60 HAA at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Catford ** 168 Battery at Catford ** 169 Battery at Catford ** 194 Battery at Catford * 30th (Surrey) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE, (TA) (formed in 1935 from HQ Surrey Group AA Searchlight Companies RE) ** HQ at Kingston upon Thames ** 315 Company at Croydon ** 316 Company at Kingston upon Thames ** 318 Company at Guildford ** 323 Company at Ewell * 31st (City of London Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA) (searchlight unit formed in 1935 by conversion of 6th Battalion, the London Regiment (City of London Rifles))31 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Sutton ** 324 Company at Sutton ** 325 Company at Sutton ** 326 Company at Merton ** 327 Company at Hackbridge * 34th (The Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA) (searchlight unit formed in 1935 by conversion of 20th London Regiment (Blackheath & Woolwich), affiliated to the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment)34 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Blackheath ** 320 Company at Greenwich ** 336 Company at Blackheath ** 337 Company at Blackheath ** 338 Company at Eltham * 35th (First Surrey Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA) (searchlight unit formed in 1935 by conversion of 21st Battalion, London Regiment, affiliated to the East Surrey Regiment)35 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Camberwell ** 340th Company at Camberwell ** 341st Company at Camberwell ** 342nd Company at Camberwell ** 343rd Company at Camberwell The AA Groups took the more usual formation title of Brigades on 1 January 1939 after the Royal Artillery replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment'. Outbreak of war During the period of tension leading to the Munich crisis and eventually the outbreak of World War II, the Territorial Army grew enormously, and existing TA infantry battalions continued to be converted to AA regiments. The number of divisions and brigades was expanded, and the whole AA defence of the United Kingdom was taken over by Anti-Aircraft Command on 1 April 1939. When the UK declared war on 3 September 1939, 27th (Home Counties) AA Bde was a searchlight formation in 6 AA Division (also based at Uxbridge) and had the following composition:Routedge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files * Brigade HQ: Lingfield, Surrey * 31st (City of London Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA) ** HQ, 324, 325, 326, 327 Companies as before * 34th (The Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA) ** HQ, 302, 336, 337, 338 Companies as before * 70th (Sussex) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery (a newly formed TA Unit) ** HQ, 459, 460, 461 Batteries all at Brighton In August 1940, during the Battle of Britain, the RE 'Anti-Aircraft' (searchlight) battalions became regiments of the RA.S/L Index at RA 39‚Äì45 The Blitz By late 1940, at the height of The Blitz, 27 AA Bde was serving in 5 AA Division covering the important naval base of Portsmouth, with the following regiments under command:Farndale, Annex D.5 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45 * 31st (City of London Rifles) Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA)31 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 * 70th (Sussex) Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA) The AA Corps and Divisions were disbanded and replaced on 1 October 1942 by new AA Groups.

Hit and run The AA defences of Southern England were severely tested in the summer of 1942 by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and-run' attacks along the South Coast, and there was much reorganisation, accounting for some of the turnover of units listed earlier. In August 1942, 27 AA Bde was transferred from 5th AA Division to 3rd AA Division, a HQ brought down from Scotland to handle the increased workload.Routledge, pp. 402‚Äì4. However, all the AA Divisions were disbanded on 30 September.Routledge, pp 400‚Äì1. 27 AA Brigade joined the new 2 AA Group covering South East England, and took responsibility for S/L units in that area. After this major reorganisation in October‚ÄìDecember 1942, the brigade settled down with the following composition:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83. * 125th LAA Rgt ** 417, 418, 419 Btys * 1st S/L Rgt ** 1, 2, 7 Btys ** 8 Bty (attached to 71 AA Bde) * 34th S/L Rgt ** 302, 337, 338 Btys ** 336 Bty (attached to 47 AA Bde) However, in the spring of 1943, 125th LAA left 27 AA Bde, later joining 76 AA Bde, one of the formations earmarked for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). It was briefly replaced in 27 AA Bde by the return of 4th LAA Rgt, but that unit left permanently in May. After that, 27 AA Bde once again became purely a S/L formation.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247. In February, the brigade was strengthened to deal with renewed 'hit-and-run' attacks by Luftwaffe fighter-bombers attacking coastal towns at low level in daylight. 73rd (Kent Fortress) S/L Rgt joined from 56 AA Bde, where it had been covering airfields in Kent, and 355 S/L Bty was detached from 39th (Lancashire Fusiliers) S/L Rgt in 53 AA Bde in North West England, and travelled by train to join 27 AA Bde on the South Coast.355 S/L Bty War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11550. Because of the hit-and-run raids, the allocation of Lewis guns for local defence was increased from one to four and later six per S/L site. The guns had to be manned throughout the hours of daylight. On 11 March a raid on Hastings by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and Messerschmitt Bf 109s flew right over 355's Battery HQ, and a raid by Bf 109s on Ashford on 24 March was engaged by one of 355's sites. However, in May 1943, 355 S/L battery was disbanded, the ATS personnel and specialists being posted to other units in 27 AA Bde, the remainder being drafted as reinforcements to LAA units. In April, 73rd S/L Rgt was exchanged for 33rd (St Pancras) S/L Rgt from 66 AA Bde in East Anglia, which took over four areas of Kent under Biggin Hill Sector of No. 11 Group RAF. This area was under regular attack by Luftwaffe fighter-bombers, and the defensive armament of S/L positions was increased, with the existing Lewis guns being supplemented with twin Vickers K machine gun mountings and later twin 0.5-inch Browning machine guns on power mountings.Sainsbury, Chapter 5.

Each of 27 AA Bde's S/L regiments lost one of its four batteries, leaving:Routledge, p. 409.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. * 1st S/L Rgt ** 1, 2, 7 Btys * 33rd S/L Rgt ** 332, 333 334 Btys * 34th S/L Rgt ** 302, 336, 337 Btys * 36th S/L Rgt ** 317, 345, 346 Btys * 38th S/L Rgt ** 350, 351, 352 Btys * 61st S/L Rgt ** 432, 433, 434 Btys * 79th S/L Rgt ** 502, 503, 504 Btys * 83rd S/L Rgt ** 365, 513, 514 Btys In May and June 1944, while the build-up for Overlord was at its height, 38th and 61st S/L Rgts were transferred to 38 AA Bde in 2 AA Group (covering the Thames Estuary), but they returned a month later. In July 1944 came the start of the V-1 flying bomb campaign against London, though Kent was on the fringe of the V-1's route. 27 AA Bde's S/L layout was little affected by the massive reorganisation that AA Command had to carry out to meet this threat (Operation Diver).Routledge, p 413. However, as 21st Army Group overran the V-1 launching sites, the Luftwaffe began to launch them from aircraft over the North Sea. AA Command shifted units from Kent to deal with them, and in November 33rd S/L Rgt had to take over some of the vacated sites along the East Kent coast. By mid-October, 79th and 83rd S/L Rgts had been transferred to 56 AA Bde in 2 AA Group, and both regiments were disbanded shortly afterwards. By October 1944, the brigade's HQ establishment was 9 officers, 8 male other ranks and 23 members of the ATS, together with a small number of attached drivers, cooks and mess orderlies (male and female). In addition, the brigade had a Mixed Signal Office Section of 1 officer, 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit.AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. Conversion By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. At the same time the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Rgts at RA 39‚Äì45 61st S/L Regiment had already left the brigade in December and been converted into a Garrison regiment, while in mid-Jan 45, 1st S/L had joined 21st Army Group to defend Antwerp and the Scheldt Estuary. On 22 January 1945, HQ 27 AA Bde under Brigadier H.G. SmithIWM papers was converted into 303rd Infantry Brigade with the following units under command:Joslen, p. 399.Orbat.com * 33rd S/L Rgt became 632nd (St Pancras) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery 19th Londons at Regiments.org33 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 632 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 * 36th S/L Rgt became 634th (Middlesex) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery36 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 634 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 * 38thS/L Rgt became 635th (King's Regiment) Infantry Regiment, RA38 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 635 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 After initial infantry training, 303 Bde was sent to Norway in June 1945 as part of the liberation of that country (Operation Doomsday).

Historically, osteomyelitis of the jaws was a common complication of odontogenic infection (infections of the teeth). Before the antibiotic era, it was frequently a fatal condition. Former and colloquial names include Osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ), cavitations, dry or wet socket, and NICO (Neuralgia-Inducing Cavitational osteonecrosis). The current, more correct, term, osteomyelitis of the jaws, differentiates the condition from the relatively recent and better known iatrogenic phenomenon of bisphosphonate-caused osteonecrosis of the jaws. The latter is found primarily in post-menopausal women given bisphosphonate medications, usually against osteoporosis. Classification The classification is similar to the classification of OM generally, according to the length of time the inflammation has been present and whether there is suppuration (the formation of pus). Acute osteomyelitis is loosely defined as OM which has been present for less than one month and chronic osteomyelitis is the term used for when the condition lasts for more than one month. Suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaws is uncommon in developed regions, and more common in developing countries. In Europe and the United States, most cases follow dental infections, oral surgery or mandibular fractures. There have been many reported cases occurring in Africa which are coexistent with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or cancrum oris. In the pre-antibiotic era, acute OM of the jaws was more extensive. Massive, diffuse infections commonly involved the whole side of the mandible, or the whole of one side and the opposite side as far as the mental foramen. Localized osteomyelitis tended to be described as either vertical, where a short segment of the body of the mandible from the alveolar crest to the lower border was involved, and alveolar, where a segment of alveolar bone down to the level of the inferior alveolar canal would sequestrate, including the sockets of several teeth. Treatment with antibiotics has significantly altered the natural history of OM of the jaws. Today, however, the condition is often a hidden infection, due in part to not being visible on most dental X-rays unless there is a substantial loss of bone density. In addition, some schools of dentistry do not recognize \\"silent\\" OM of the jaws‚Äîoccurrence of the condition without visually obvious manifestations‚Äîin their curriculum. In addition, as circulation is intrinsically diminished in jawbones, antibiotics are frequently ineffective. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms depend upon the type of OM, and may include: * Pain, which is severe, throbbing and deep seated and often radiates along the nerve pathways. *Initially fistula are not present. * Headache or facial pain, as in the descriptive former term \\"neuralgia- inducing\\" (cavitational osteonecrosis). * Fibromyalgia. * Chronic fatigue syndrome. * Swelling. External swelling is initially due to inflammatory edema with accompanying erythema (redness), heat and tenderness, and then later may be due to sub-periosteal pus accumulation. Eventually, subperiosteal bone formation may give a firm swelling. * Trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), which may be present in some cases and is caused by edema in the muscles. * Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which may be present in some cases and is caused by edema in the muscles. * Cervical lymphadenitis (swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck). * Aesthesia or paresthesia (altered sensation such as numbness or pins and needles) in the distribution of the mental nerve. * Fever which may be present in the acute phase and is high and intermittent * Malaise (general feeling of being unwell) which may be present in the acute phase * Anorexia (loss of appetite). * Leukocytosis (elevated numbers of white blood cells) which may be present in the acute phase * Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein are sometimes present. * An obvious cause in the mouth (usually) such as a decayed tooth. * Teeth that are tender to percussion, which may develop as the condition progresses. * Loosening of teeth, which may develop as the condition progresses. * Pus may later be visible, which exudes from around the necks of teeth, from an open socket, or from other sites within the mouth or on the skin over the involved bone. * Fetid odor. Unlike acute OM in the long bones, acute OM in the jaws gives only a moderate systemic reaction and systemic inflammatory markers, such as blood tests, usually remain normal. Acute OM of the jaws may give a similar appearance to a typical odontogenic infection or dry socket, but cellulitis does not tend to spread from the periosteal envelope of the involved bone. If the infection is not controlled, the process becomes chronic and visible signs may be present, including draining fistulas, loosening of teeth and sequestra formation. Untreated chronic osteomyelitis tends to feature occasional acute exacerbations. Cause OM is usually a polymicrobial, opportunistic infection, caused primarily by a mixture of alpha hemolytic streptococci and anaerobic bacteria from the oral cavity such as Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium and Prevotella, (in contrast to OM of the long bones, usually caused by isolated Staphylococcus aureus infection). These are the same as the common causative organisms in odotonogenic infections. However, when OM in the jaws follows trauma, is the likely cause is still staphylococcal (usually Staphylococcus epidermis. Other risk factors can be any familial hypercoagulation tendency, including for example, Factor V (Five) Leiden heterozygosity. Pathogenesis OM may occur by direct inoculation of pathogens into the bone (through surgery or injury), by spread of an adjacent area of infection or by seeding of the infection from a non adjacent site via the blood supply (hematogenous spread). Unlike OM of the long bones, hematogenous OM in the bones of the jaws is rare. OM of the jaws is mainly caused by spread of adjacent odontogenic infection. The second most common cause is trauma, including traumatic fracture and usually following a compound fracture (i.e. one that communicates with the mouth or the external environment). In OM of the long bones, a single invading pathogenic micro- organism is usually found (commonly staphylococci spp.). The mandible is affected more commonly than the maxilla. This is thought to be related to the differences in blood supply between the mandible and the maxilla. The maxilla has a better blood supply, and has thin cortical plates and less medullary spaces. These factors mean that infections of the maxilla are not readily confined to the bone, and readily dissipate edema and pus into the surrounding soft tissues and the paranasal air sinuses. OM of the maxilla may rarely occur during an uncontrolled infection of the middle ear or in infants who have sustained birth injury due to forceps. The mandible in contrast has a relatively poor blood supply, which deteriorates with increasing age. The cortical plates are thick and there is a medullary cavity. The sites of the mandible most commonly affected by OM are (decreasing order of frequency) the body, the symphysis, the angle, the ramus and finally the condyle. The mandible's blood supply is primarily via the inferior alveolar artery, and secondarily via the periosteum. Compromise of this supply is a critical factor in the development of OM in the mandible. Most periapical and periodontal infections are isolated by the body which produces a protective pyogenic membrane or abscess wall to keep the area of infection localized. Micro- organisms which are sufficiently virulent may destroy this barrier. Factors which may contribute to this are decreased host resistance, surgery or repeated movement of fracture segments, as may occur with an untreated fracture. Mechanical trauma burnishes the bone, causing ischemia by crushing blood vessels and seeds micro-organisms into the tissues. The events preceding OM are acute inflammatory changes such as hyperemia, increased capillary permeability and infiltration of granulocytes. Proteolytic enzymes are released, and thrombus formation in the blood vessels and tissue necrosis occur. Pus accumulates in the medullary spaces of the bone, which increases the pressure and leads to collapse of the blood vessels, venous stasis and ischemia. Pus may also spread to the sub-periosteal layer, dissecting it away from the surface of the bone and further reducing the blood supply. The inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle is compressed within the mandible, causing anesthesia or paresthesia in the distribution of the mental nerve. Pus may drain via sinuses on the skin and in the mouth, and these may in time become lined with epithelium, when they are termed fistulas. Chronic OM is characterized by a degree of healing which takes place as a lesser degree of inflammation is present. Granulation tissue and new blood vessels form, and fragments of necrotic bone (sequestra) are separated from vital bone. Small sections of necrotic bone may be resorbed completely, and larger segments may become surrounded by granulation tissue and new bone (an involucrum). Sequestra may also be revascularized by new blood vessels, cause no symptoms or become chronically infected. Sometimes the involucrum is penetrated by channels (cloacae) through which pus drains to the skin or mouth. OM of the jaws often occurs in the presence of one or more predisposing factors. These factors are related to compromised vascular perfusion locally, regionally or systemically, causes of immunocompromise and poor wound healing. Specific examples include familial hypercoagulation, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, Agranulocytosis, leukemia, severe anemia, syphilis, chemotherapy, corticosteroid therapy, sickle cell disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, old age, malnutrition, smoking and alcohol consumption, radiotherapy, osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, fibrous dysplasia, bone malignancy and causes of bone necrosis such as Bismuth, Mercury or arsenic. Poor compliance or access to health care is also a risk factor. Rarely, OM of the jaws may be a complication of trigeminal herpes zoster. Prevention Regular dental and periodontal assessment and care. Treatment Culture and sensitivity of the wound site determines the choice of antibiotic; however positive cultures rates are generally low for OM, leading to the need for empirical treatment and an increased risk of antibiotic failure. PCR testing may also be done to identify microbe DNA. Repeated culture and sensitivity testing is often carried out in OM since the treatment is prolonged and antibiotic resistance may occur, when a change in the drug may be required. Prognosis Pathologic fracture of the mandible is a possible complication of OM where the bone has been weakened significantly. Epidemiology OM of the jaws can occur in all genders, races and age groups. The mandible is affected more commonly than the maxilla. Globally, the most common cause of OM of the jaws is the spread of adjacent odontogenic infection, followed by trauma, including fracture and surgery.

It was situated to the northern side of Martyrs' Square at the heart of the Beirut Central District. The building was the scene of important historical events, but plans to enlarge Beirut's main square led to its destruction in 1950. It was one of several Ottoman era building projects that shaped the architecture of Lebanon in Beirut. Overview Inaugurated in 1884, the Petit Serail was the seat of Beirut‚Äôs governor general in 1888 and hosted the Lebanese government and president during the French Mandate. Demolished in 1950, its foundations were uncovered and preserved in the mid-1990s. Background In the later half of the nineteenth century, the Beiruti authorities thought to move the seat of governorship from the decaying Emir Assaf saray also called Dar al-Wilaya (House of the Vilayet). The medieval structure was built in 1572 by Mohammad Assaf, the son of the Turkmen Emir Mansour Assaf. On 11 September 1840, the British fleet bombarded Beirut to evacuate Ibrahim Pasha's troops from the city and damaged the old saray in the process. The saray was restored in 1843 by the wali of Beirut Assaad Mukhles Pasha. In 1882 the board of administration of the Sanjak of Beirut decided to build a new administrative building and put up the Emir Assaf Saray for auction. The saray was sold in April 1882 to Mohammad Ayyas and then to members of the Sursock and Tueini families. The old saray was destroyed and replaced by the Sursock souks while work was underway on the construction of the new saray which will become known as the \\"Petit Serail\\" to differentiate it from the Kƒ±≈üla-i Humayun (the Ottoman barracks) which is better known as the Grand Serail. History The Petit Serail under the French rule The Petit Serail was planned as a civic center following the Tanzimat reform and according to the Beirut municipality project of 1878. The northern side of Sahet el-Bourj was chosen as a strategic site since it occupied the heart of the new extra-mural city. The new structure was commissioned by Beirut mayor Ibrahim Fakhri Bey, construction began in 1881 at the site of a former saray that was ordered demolished by the Wali Hamdi Pasha. The serail was built by Bechara Effendi Avedissian, chief engineer of the Vilayet of Syria and Youssef Effendi Khayat, engineer of the city of Beirut, but the project ran into financial difficulties as attested by a number of correspondence letters between the Wali of Syria Ahmad Hamdi Pasha and the Porte. Hamdi Pasha took up a loan form the Ottoman Bank, mortgaged public buildings and imposed new taxes in order to furnish the new serail's offices. In 1883, a park was inaugurated in the square in front of the Serail. The park was called \\"Hamidie\\" in honor of the reigning Sultan Abdul Hamid II, but was more commonly known as the Menshieh garden. The Petit Serail was inaugurated three years after the beginning of construction works in 1884. Under the French Mandate, urban planner De La Halle planned the enlargement of the al-Bourj Square and the building of a new governmental office complex. He proposed in his 1939 plan to destroy the Serail to open up the square the waterfront through a series of landscaped terraces. The destruction of the Petit Serail did not take place until 1950, after Lebanon gained its independence. Nevertheless, the planned clearing of the square was aborted and the Regent Hotel and the Rivoli building were constructed at the site of the Serail in 1953. Solidere destroyed the Rivoli and Regent Hotel buildings in the 1990s, and consequent excavations revealed the foundations of the Petit Serail which will be preserved inside the planned underground Beirut City History Museum. Function The Serail was built to serve as the seat of the Vilayet of Syria; it housed municipal and provincial offices including Beirut's judicial court. In 1888 Beirut became the provincial capital of the Beirut Vilayet and the Petit Serail hosted the seat of the Wali. Beirut Wali Azmi Bey transferred the seat of the vilayet to the Grand Serail, while the municipal offices and the telegraph service office were moved to the Petit Serail. Architecture Sahet al-Bourj and the Petit Serail in the background. The Petit Serail was built in an eclectic occidentalist style, mixing baroque architectural elements with more austere features, a style that was predominant in the Ottoman constructions of the 19th century. The body of the two-story building was raised on a plinth, giving the building a greater stature. The oblong facade was built in Sandstone and is decorated with neo- baroque windows and elements. The main entrance was flanked by an imposing marble gate giving way to a central court and to the building's floors. A crenelated cornice ran the entire surface of the roof complete with bartizans flanking the corners; a layout reminiscent of Medieval European castles. In the central axis of the main facade stood a large ornate gable decorated with volutes surrounding a clock. The structure had a surface area of 3500 square cubits and contained close to 80 rooms.

The history of United States antitrust law is generally taken to begin with the Sherman Antitrust Act 1890, although some form of policy to regulate competition in the market economy has existed throughout the common law's history. Although \\"trust\\" had a technical legal meaning, the word was commonly used to denote big business, especially a large, growing manufacturing conglomerate of the sort that suddenly emerged in great numbers in the 1880s and 1890s. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 began a shift towards federal rather than state regulation of big business.Interstate Commerce Act. It was followed by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, and the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950. Common law *Restraint of trade *Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co [1892] AC 25, a UK House of Lords case condoning cartels shortly after the Sherman Act 1890 was passed Late 19th century During the late 19th century hundreds of small short-line railroads were being bought up and consolidated into giant systems. Separate laws and policies emerged regarding railroads and financial concerns such as banks and insurance companies. Advocates of strong antitrust laws argued the American economy to be successful requires free competition and the opportunity for individual Americans to build their own businesses. As Senator John Sherman put it, \\"If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\\" Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act almost unanimously in 1890, and it remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act makes it illegal to try to restrain trade or to form a monopoly. It gives the Justice Department the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.Since the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, the FTC has had power to enforce section 1 of the Sherman Act administratively, under the rubric of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 45. See generally FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co. As that Supreme Court decision explains, the FTC also has authority to act against incipient Sherman Act violations and violations of its \\"spirit.\\" Progressive era Public officials during the Progressive Era put passing and enforcing strong antitrust high on their agenda. President Theodore Roosevelt sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while William Howard Taft sued 75. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the Northern Securities Company, which threatened to monopolize transportation in the Northwest (see Northern Securities Co. v. United States). One of the more well known trusts was the Standard Oil Company; John D. Rockefeller in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900‚Äì1904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon and now ExxonMobil), Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco), Standard Oil Company of New York (Mobil, again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California (Chevron), and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the \\"rule of reason\\": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors. *Industrial Commission (1898) to investigate railroad pricing, among other things *United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895) restricting monopoly regulation *Swift & Co. v.

P. Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee. In 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Antitrust Act to increase the government's capacity to intervene and break up big business. The Act removed the application of antitrust laws to trade unions, and introduced controls on the merger of corporations. United States Steel Corporation, which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did. In fact, it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition, and so contending that it was one of the \\"good trusts\\" that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful. Likewise International Harvester survived its court test, while other trusts were broken up in tobacco, meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison. One problem some perceived with the Sherman Act was that it was not entirely clear what practices were prohibited, leading to businessmen not knowing what they were permitted to do, and government antitrust authorities not sure what business practices they could challenge. In the words of one critic, Isabel Paterson, \\"As freak legislation, the antitrust laws stand alone. Nobody knows what it is they forbid.\\" In 1914 Congress passed the Clayton Act, which prohibited specific business actions (such as price discrimination and tying) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to \\"consent decrees\\", which provided an alternative mechanism to police antitrust. American hostility to big business began to decrease after the Progressive Era. For example, Ford Motor Company dominated auto manufacturing, built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted manufacturing efficiency. Ford became as much of a popular hero as Rockefeller had been a villain. Welfare capitalism made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers. Talk of trust busting faded away. Under the leadership of Herbert Hoover, the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of \\"respectable business\\". New Deal During the New Deal, likewise, attempts were made to stop cutthroat competition, attempts that appeared very similar to cartelization, which would be illegal under antitrust laws if attempted by someone other than government. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933‚Äì35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers preferred federal and state regulation‚Äîcontrolling the rates and telephone services provided by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;), for example‚Äîand by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions. The antitrust laws came to be seen by the Supreme Court as a \\"charter of freedom\\", designed to protect free enterprise in America.Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 359-60 (1933) (\\"As a charter of freedom, the act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.\\"). One view of the statutory purpose, urged for example by Justice Douglas, was that the goal was not only to protect consumers, but at least as importantly to prohibit the use of power to control the marketplace.United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 535-36 (1948). Post World War Two By the 1970s, fears of \\"cutthroat\\" competition had been displaced by confidence that a fully competitive marketplace produced fair returns to everyone. The fear was that monopoly made for higher prices, less production, inefficiency and less prosperity for all. As unions faded in strength, the government paid much more attention to the damages that unfair competition could cause to consumers, especially in terms of higher prices, poorer service, and restricted choice. In 1982 AT&T; was broken up into one long-distance company and seven regional \\"Baby Bells\\", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market. 21st century In 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued Microsoft. A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong- armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the Netscape browser. In 2000, the trial court ordered Microsoft split in two to punish it, and prevent it from future misbehavior; however the Court of Appeals reversed the decision and removed the judge from the case for improperly discussing the case with the media while it was still pending. With the case in front of a new judge, Microsoft and the government settled, with the government dropping the case in return for Microsoft agreeing to cease many of the practices the government challenged. In his defense, CEO Bill Gates argued that Microsoft always worked on behalf of the consumer and that splitting the company would diminish efficiency and slow the pace of software development. *Apple Inc. litigation While the sentiment among regulators and judges has generally recommended that breakups are not as remedies for antitrust enforcement, recent scholarship has found that this hostility to breakups by administrators is largely unwarranted.' In fact, some scholars have argued breakups, even if incorrectly targeted, could arguably still encourage collaboration, innovation, and efficiency.'

She was the last surviving member of the White Squadron, a team of female aviators who flew medical aircraft during World War II. Romania was the only country in the world to allow women to pilot medical missions during the war.  Biography  Born 7 September 1912 in Craiova, Romania. Her mother was an \\"independent woman\\" and music teacher, and her father, a military man, had become a colonel after World War I. She recounted that her introduction to flying came at an early age. > \\"When the first world war started, I came to Bucharest with the whole > family... I remember, I was 4 years old and I was with my mother on the > street when I first heard the air alarm sirens. The German planes bombed > Bucharest, with my mother in a basement, we would take shelter, but I was > anxious to see the planes.\\" At age 23, DrƒÉgescu received her pilot's license in 1935. She said later, \\"I obtained the seventh female patent in Romania.\\" With the threat of conflict growing in Europe in 1938, DrƒÉgescu was invited to join a new, all-female, aviation team which would become known as the White Squadron. The other four women to join with her were Virginia Thomas, Nadia Russo, Marina »òtirbei, and Irina Burnaia (another pilot, Virginia Dutescu, had become ill, withdrew and never flew again). Over the course of the war, the \\"White Squad\\" saved the lives of more than 1,500 soldiers injured on the front lines.  Wartime flying  Pilot DrƒÉgescu with a wounded soldier on board The White Squadron was equipped with three small planes, painted white, with the red cross sign on the fuselage and on the wings. Once Romania was entered the war against the Soviet Union in June 1941, the squadron started flying wounded soldiers from the front lines to Bucharest for medical care. DrƒÉgescu recounted later, \\"We were flying in the sky with the planes to the front line. And if we didn't have aerodromes near the place where we had to pick up the wounded, we had orders to land anywhere ... \\" The white planes were hunted by the enemy, but not in the sky because they flew a maximum of 50 meters above the ground, and the pursuing pilots were afraid to fly so low. But that didn't stop them from targeting the planes once they were on the ground. After the first month, the squadron's aircraft were repainted in camouflage colors. Once on the ground, the young pilots, dressed in white overalls, startled some wounded soldiers as if they were hallucinating. One, on seeing DrƒÉgescu, \\"started shouting at the orderly that was watching him: \\"John, an angel!\\" The poor man thought he had already died and was waiting to see Heaven ... \\" DrƒÉgescu flew in the siege of Odessa, the Crimean campaign, and the Battle of Stalingrad, and, after the other pilots' resignations and illnesses, she remained the only female Romanian pilot on the front.  Final years  After the war, DrƒÉgescu worked for several years as flight instructor at flight schools in Chitila and Ghimbav. She was allowed to fly until 1955, when her license was taken away. Later on she worked at the Ana IpƒÉtescu C.F.R. clinic in Bucharest, until she retired in 1967. During the country's communist era, the history of Romanian aviation and the contributions of DrƒÉgescu and the other women of the White Squadron were ignored. Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, their story received a more appropriate recognition. Mariana DrƒÉgescu was age 100 when she died in Bucharest on 24 March 2013.

Composite portraiture (also known as composite photographs) is a technique invented by Sir Francis Galton in the 1880s after a suggestion by Herbert Spencer for registering photographs of human faces on the two eyes to create an \\"average\\" photograph of all those in the photographed group.Benson, P., & Perrett, D. (1991). Computer averaging and manipulations of faces. In P. Wombell (ed.), Photovideo: Photography in the age of the computer (pp. 32‚Äì38). London: Rivers Oram Press.Galton, F. (1878). Composite portraits. Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 8, 132‚Äì142. Spencer had suggested using onion paper and line drawings, but Galton devised a technique for multiple exposures on the same photographic plate. He noticed that these composite portraits were more attractive than any individual member, and this has generated a large body of research on human attractiveness and averageness one hundred years later. He also suggested in a Royal Society presentation in 1883 that the composites provided an interesting concrete representation of human ideal types and concepts. He discussed using the technique to investigate characteristics of common types of humanity, such as criminals. In his mind, it was an extension of the statistical techniques of averages and correlation. In this sense, it represents one of the first implementations of convolution factor analysis and neural networks in the understanding of knowledge representation in the human mind. Galton also suggested that the technique could be used for creating natural types of common objects. During the late 19th century, English psychometrician Sir Francis Galton attempted to define physiognomic characteristics of health, disease, beauty, and criminality, via a method of composite photography. Galton's process involved the photographic superimposition of two or more faces by multiple exposures. After averaging together photographs of violent criminals, he found that the composite appeared \\"more respectable\\" than any of the faces comprising it; this was likely due to the irregularities of the skin across the constituent images being averaged out in the final blend. Since the advancement of computer graphics technology in the early 1990s, Galton's composite technique has been adopted and greatly improved using computer graphics software.Yamaguchi, M.

It was built as a coaching inn in 1754, on the site of a merchant's dwelling dating back to at least 1613. Local tradition claims that the site has housed a tavern or alehouse since 1198, although there is no documentary evidence to support this. Kelleher claims it first received a licence to sell ale in 1661, and the first mention of it as an inn occurs in 1668. History Pre-17th century Archaeological excavation, during September‚ÄîNovember 1989, of the land immediately adjacent to The Brazen Head demonstrated evidence that the area had been in use as early as the 13th century, when activities to reclaim the riverside marshland began. Wicker mats‚Äîused to establish foundations on the silted floodplain‚Äîand a section of post-and-wattle wall dating from the 13th century were found, along with many medieval pot sherds and other artefacts. Although The Brazen Head does not appear on H.B. Clarke's map of medieval Dublin c.840‚Äîc.1540, McMahon writes that there was another \\"substantial building\\" in the area, called \\"Carles Inn\\". 17th century Frank Hopkins, in his Rare Old Dublin: Heroes, Hawkers & Hoors (2002), writes that a \\"Brazen Head\\" on Bridge street is first recorded in 1613, described as a messuage‚Äîa plot of land for a house or a \\"residential building taken together with its outbuildings and assigned land\\"‚Äîowned by Richard and Elinor Fagan. However, this reference to a 1613 Brazen Head did not take place until 1700, where it appears in a writ issued against the estate by three merchants‚ÄîJohn Withington, James King, and John Kennan‚Äîrelating to an outstanding debt dating from 1613. In the 17th century, Bridge Street was a \\"residential area for the nobility and wealthy merchants\\", and residents included Sir Winston Churchill and the Marquess of Antrim. Fagan was a merchant and landowner from a distinguished lineage‚Äîhis grandfather, also named Richard, had been high sheriff of the county of Dublin in 1575 and lord mayor of the city in 1587. Fagan's wife Elinor was also his 2nd cousin, and her grandfather had been high sheriff in 1565, and lord mayor in 1573. Their grandfathers were brothers who owned land and property in Dublin, County Meath, County Sligo and Munster, and had also been Masters of Dublin's Merchants' Guild. As an only child, Elinor had inherited the entirety of her father's estate in 1599. The property on Bridge Street eventually passed to Richard's grandson‚Äîalso named Richard, and also married to an Elinor‚Äîbut was confiscated in 1691 owing to the younger Richard having fought in the Jacobite Irish Army at the Siege of Derry, the Battle of Aughrim, and the Battle of the Boyne during the Williamite War in Ireland. Following the Battle of the Boyne, William of Orange had offered a pardon to all Jacobite soldiers who laid down their arms. Fagan, then a captain in James's army, did so, and made for Connacht, but was intercepted by Jacobite rapparees and shot as a traitor. It was the activities of the rapparees that led to an order being issued for all officers who had laid down arms to report to the authorities on pain of being declared outlaw and having their lands and property confiscated. When the deceased Fagan failed to report, his estates were seized by the Crown. 18th century On 21 May 1703, the Brazen Head was granted to James King‚Äîone of the three merchants who had served a writ against the forfeited estate in 1700‚Äîand described as a \\"large timber house... containing 35 feet 6 inches in front, 49 feet in rear and 168 feet in depth with all outhouses, stables, yards etc.\\" Hopkins writes that the Brazen Head was extended in 1704 through the lease of adjacent property to the rear. At this time, Bridge Street was changing from a residential area to \\"a busy commercial centre\\" and the merchants began leasing the ground floor of their houses to shops and businesses, particularly those in the textile and hardware trades. At the Brazen Head, textile merchants John Lloyd and Stephen Sly sold various \\"Broadcloths, Druggets, Sarges, Damasks, Poplins, Shammy skins\\" and \\"woollen goods by wholesale or retaile.\\" The \\"large timber house\\" was replaced by the current buildings in 1754. By April 1765, the inn contained \\"thirty rooms, kitchen, cellar, scullery and many other conveniences, with sufficient stabling.\\" Timothy Dawson's research, in 1969, of historical documents relating to the inn found that the tenancy was advertised in 1765 by Robert Autchinson. In 1770, the inn was kept by Jack Geoghegan, who also owned a farm nearby, enabling him to sell \\"hay, grass and corn on more moderate terms than any other Inn or Hotel in town.\\" For several months in 1782‚Äî83, the inn was kept by Michael Dignan, who appears to have been less than successful as an innkeeper: his replacement, Denis Mitchell, placed an advertisement for the inn promising \\"the most unremitting care and attention\\" to please \\"gentlemen and traders\\" in an attempt to \\"regain the character the house so justly lost.\\" See also *List of pubs in Dublin References Footnotes Notes Bibliography  * Category:Pubs in Dublin (city) Category:Buildings and structures in Dublin (city) Category:17th-century establishments in Ireland ","title":"The Brazen Head"},{"id":"39090019","text":"Qiongzhou Bridge (), also known as the Nandu Bridge and the Nandu Ninth Bridge, is a bridge that spans the Nandu River, Hainan Province, China.

The winery has maintained a non-interventionist approach in the cellar, fermenting the wine only by means of native yeasts and using only large, neutral Slavonian casks, as Sangiovese is naturally rich in tannins and does not need to be supplemented by the wood tannins imparted by small barriques. He was always a defender of a 100% Sangiovese Brunello di Montalcino, even at times when his wines were considered old-fashioned. In 1990 he led a campaign to successfully block a massive landfill planned for the outskirts of Montalcino that would have put Brunello production at risk.

He was the Special Deputy Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan in September 2013 until August 2014 and concurrently as the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in February 2014 until August 2014. Early life Chang studied in Universit√© de Paris I in France from a Kuomintang scholarship. Early career Upon graduation, he returned to Taiwan and worked at the National Security Council. Chang had been teaching at Taiwanese universities as assistant professor at Nanhua University, Central Police University and Chinese Culture University. Political career In 2000, he joined People First Party (PFP) and ever since had been working closely with the party Chairman, James Soong, serving as the Director of the policy center of PFP. In 2005, he arranged the meeting between Soong with then-General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Hu Jintao after communicating with the then-Director of Taiwan Affairs Office Chen Yunlin. Before joining Mainland Affairs Council in 2012, Chang served for the National Security Council. ROC Mainland Affairs Council Political Deputy Ministry Cross-strait reciprocal representative offices In mid April 2013, Chang said that the ROC government is making the preparation for both sides across the Taiwan Strait to establish representative offices on each side by the end of 2013 after a draft bill was approved at the ROC cabinet meeting. Branch office of Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will be established in Taiwan, while branch office of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will be established in Mainland China, although no timetable has been set for the establishment. ARATS officers in Taiwan later will enjoy some certain degree of special rights which would not fall under ROC jurisdiction and granted some privileges in the discretion of ROC Cabinet. The bill is the base in which both sides sustain an equal and reciprocal relationship, Chang added. However, he also emphasized that ARATS branch office in Taiwan will never be the same like PRC Liaison Office in Hong Kong because Taiwan-Mainland China relations is completely different than Hong Kong-Mainland China relations. Cross-strait service trade In end of June 2013, Chang joined a delegation led by Lin Join-sane, Chairman of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to visit Shanghai from Taiwan for the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement signing. The Taiwanese delegation includes Cho Shih-chao, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs and Kao Koong-lian, Vice Chairman and Secretary- General of Straits Exchange Foundation. The cross-strait service trade agreement was signed on 21 June 2013 which consists of four chapters and twenty four articles. Under the agreement, 64 Taiwanese industries will be opened to Chinese Mainland investments, ranging from transportation, tourism and traditional Chinese medicine sectors. Meanwhile, 80 Chinese Mainland industries will be opened to Taiwanese investments, ranging from finance, retail, electronics, publishing and travel sectors. Chang said that the signing of the trade will make Taiwan and Mainland China the most stable market in the world and serves as a path for Taiwan towards the membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Investment from Mainland China will also help Taiwan become more competitive. SEF Vice Chairmanship and Secretary-General In early February 2014, Chang was appointed to be the vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), replacing Kao Koong-lian who had earlier on tendered his resignation. Chang's appointed also made the promotion of SEF Maa Shaw-chang from Deputy Secretary-General to become Deputy Chairman to help Chang share the workload. Chang's first task after assuming SEF post is to prepare for the upcoming 10th Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Culture Forum. Resignation and spy allegation On 16 August 2014, tendered his resignation from both MAC and SEF, citing family reasons as the reason. Lin Chu-chia, MAC Deputy Minister, was immediately appointed to replace Chang. Few days later on 21 August 2014, Chang held a press conference in Taipei responding to an allegation he received from the government that he had leaked national secrets to Mainland China thus that he was actually sacked from the MAC by Minister Wang Yu-chi. During the press conference, Chang said that he called on President Ma Ying-jeou to take care for himself because Ma had been 'hijacked' by a handful of people and deceived into believing allegations against him were fabricated by those people. The Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice even suspected that Chang had been recruited as a spy for the Communist Party of China. Legislators from the Democratic Progressive Party and People First Party responded by lashing out at the government for making such accusations towards Chang, and even asked that the cross-strait negotiations be temporarily halted. Chang was then being investigated by the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office for breaching the National Security Information Protection Act () for disclosing five confidential and secret pieces of information on cross-strait economics, trade and trade service agreements on at least two separate occasions. He was then barred from leaving Taiwan. On 25 August 2014, he appeared at the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office trying to clear his name from the spying allegation. After the interrogation, Chang was put into house arrest and listed as a defendant. On 28 August, the Investigation Bureau approved a search warrant for Chang's residence and six other locations. In a different occasion, President Ma Ying- jeou threw his approval behind MAC Minister Wang Yu-chi's decision to sack Chang. On 10 February 2015 the Investigation Bureau dropped the charges against him, and Wang Yu-chi immediately announced his resignation from his post as MAC minister, stating that he disagreed with the decision but would respect it and take responsibility. Later political career Chang announced that his bid to contest the Kuomintang nomination for the Taipei mayoralty in February 2018.

The English were led by Francis Drake and was part of his Great Expedition to raid the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. The English soldiers then occupied the city for over a month and captured much booty along with a 25,000 ducat ransom before departing on 1 February. Background War had already been unofficially declared by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Sailing from Plymouth, England, he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies, after which he struck at Santiago in November 1585 in the Cape Verde Islands plundering the place, then sailed for the Americas. The island of Hispaniola Drake arrived in the Caribbean in December at the uninhabited island of Saint Kitts, where he landed his sick and sought supplies. Whilst there he sent a small reconnaissance squadron to the Spanish city of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola.Bradford, Ernie Drake: England's Greatest Seafarer Santo Domingo was the capital of Spain's New World Empire and it was fortified on its landward side by a city wall built in the early 1500s known as the Fortaleza Ozama in which stood the Torre de Homenaje (tower of Homage). The governor, Crist√≥bal de Ovalle, was well provided with artillery batteries covering both land and sea and had nearly 1,500 men, of which 100 were cavalry. The naval defenses of the city consisted of one galley and although it was largely unseaworthy was still capable of posing a threat. English arrival As Drake sailed westwards he encountered his reconnaissance squadron, who told him that Santo Domingo looked too formidable to assault from the sea, but that they had found a good landing beach at the mouth of the Haina River about ten miles further to the west. Drake had the fortune of knowing that surprise would be on his side since the Spanish had no idea the English fleet was in the area. Just after midnight on 1 January 1586 Drake arrived off the Bajos de Haina, and Carleill and his soldiers landed on the beach which wasn't guarded. The path through the jungle that led towards the city was also defenseless and the English advanced forward. The main fleet under Drake meanwhile sailed ten miles along the coast to Santo Domingo. The Spanish soon saw the threat; troops were mustered, work began on building earthworks to defend the shore, whilst many of the townspeople began slipping out of the city.Tucker p. 54 At the mouth of the harbor, three ships were sunk to prevent any attempt to force the entrance but it was too late. Battle On New Years Day Drake's ships lay off the mouth of the harbor, just within artillery range and as English ships took up their stations, Drake ran out his guns and engaged the castle. The Spanish fire soon replied and one round shot hit the Elizabeth Bonaventure, but most of the balls fell short. Drake ordered his ships in closer, and soon they began firing at the castle and the earthworks and this got the Spanish distracted as he had hoped. Assault Carleill and 800 soldiers approached the city through the jungle, and by noon they were in sight of Santo Domingo. Drake then sent men in boats to make a show of attempting a landing by way of a diversion. The Spanish in response sent horse, foot, and artillery which advanced out of the city from the two gates nearest the shore, with the intention of taking up a position facing the sea with the cavalry covering their right flank. Scarcely had they formed however Carleill and his men swept out of the jungle, formed up into two columns of 1,000 men with standards flying and music playing appearing on the right flank of the Spanish. Cristobal de Ovalle, seeing that he would be cut off from the town, took up a new position covering the town gates, whilst his cavalry threatened the English flank and rear under cover of a herd of cattle. Carleill however placed his pikemen and musketeers on every side, so that the Spanish were driven back and the cattle simply ran into the jungle. With both columns still advancing they received the fire of the Spanish guns at very close quarters. An ambuscade of Spanish musketeers beside the road had no better success as these were quickly driven back by English fire. Within half an hour, the landing party had reached the western walls of Santo Domingo, and the majority of the Spanish troops and militia were in flight. File:Musketeer.jpgAn English musketeer at the time of the assault File:Carleill.jpgChristopher Carleill who commanded the English troops Capture The western defenses were pierced by two gates: the Lenba (the main gate) and a secondary one, closer to the beach. By this stage there were scarcely 300 Spaniards left, most of which had no firearms. Carleill ordered Sergeant-Major Powell to assault the secondary gate with a storming party, while the lieutenant-general led the rest of his men towards the Lenba. Both English columns broke into a run and charged at the push of pike. Following a mingled, fierce, hand-to-hand fight, the Spanish were swept on through both gates and then melted away, after which neither column met with any serious opposition. The stormers did not stop until the two English columns met in the Plaza. The English were now inside the town and began hunting the Spanish troops through the streets, heading towards the Fortaleza Ozama, the main defense of Santo Domingo; if this fell then Santo Domingo would fall. A small group of Spanish troops held out behind its walls, while the remainder of the city was captured without any opposition. Crist√≥bal de Ovalle fled the battle and left his wife behind, who became Drake's principal hostage. The fortress held out until nightfall still under bombardment by the English on land and sea, but under cover of darkness the remaining garrison slipped away by boat, and by dawn the English flag was flying over the Torre de Homenaje in the middle of the Fortaleza Ozama. The English secured their positions, the battle was over and Santo Domingo was now in their hands. The assault had cost Carleill only seven killed and around twenty wounded, and given the lack of serious resistance the Spanish losses were around the same although they had nearly 200 men captured. Occupation Drake ordered his men to repair the city's defenses, in case of a Spanish counter-attack. The harbor was also secured and ships of which there were over twenty were taken or burnt. The English sailors and soldiers then went on a looting spree; churches were singled out, ornaments were stolen, statues and windows smashed, religious tapestries ripped down, and altars desecrated. Then public buildings were looted and from private homes the English took what they could. While plenty of goods were captured, including food, wine, and tobacco, only 16,000 gold ducats were recovered from the Audencia's treasury. The cathedral however was saved from destruction as it was where Drake set up his headquarters and prayers and psalms were sung and said in thanks to God for their victory. Ransom Drake knew the Spanish would be willing to negotiate a ransom, in return for the saving of their town and the lives of his prisoners. On 12 January the head of the city judiciary, Juan Malarejo, approached Drake and negotiations began. Drake demanded a huge figure of one million ducats which the Governor declared himself wholly unable to pay. Malarejo procrastinated and as talks continued Drake ordered civic buildings and churches to be put to the torch, one after the other. Applying extra pressure on Malarejo; Drakes men began demolishing the city's imposing stone buildings, which exhausted the English sailors due to the intense labor. The next Spanish negotiator was Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez de Torrequemada, the royal factor on Hispaniola but Malarejo overruled him, being much more stubborn. So Drake set fire to more buildings and threatened to destroy his own headquarters the oldest church in the whole of the Americas but eventually Malarejo offered a ransom of 25,000 ducats. Payment Finally the deal was agreed, and Drake promised to spare what remained of the town and sail away from it if the ransom was paid promptly. Drake sent a delegation to the Spanish camp with a message with a black boy freed from slavery who had recently joined the English. The Spanish however thinking this as an insult stabbed and killed him which infuriated Drake so much that he had many Spaniards deliberately executed until the murderer was found dead or alive. The Spanish complied and brought the man to justice by hanging him in front of the city. The ransom was finally paid during the last days of January.

Upwards of 20 ships in the harbor were burned or sunk, the galley had been torched and three vessels were commandeered by Drake to replace three of his ships; Hope, Benjamin, and Scout that had to be abandoned as unseaworthy. One of the largest ships that was captured was a 600-ton armed merchant which the English renamed the New Years Gift. Two hundred and forty guns and quantities of merchandise were moved into the holds of the English ships, their ranks recruited from scores of liberated galley-slaves. A third of Santo Domingo itself lay in ruins and when the Spanish slowly returned they found all of its civic, military, and religious buildings had been destroyed. Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez de Torrequemada summed up the mood of the population in his report to the King: This thing must have had divine sanction, as punishment for the people's sins. As Drake left and headed south, news of his attack spread from Santo Domingo to other cities on the Spanish Main, warning that the English were likely to descend on them. Rumors soon spread to Europe and the Spanish got many conflicting reports of what happened. Pope Sixtus V commented about Drakes action: God only knows what he may succeed in doing. For Santo Domingo it would take many decades to recover from Drake's onslaught. For the Spanish it was major disaster, in particular a blow to prestige and for the English a huge morale boost both in England and on board the fleet. Drake's next target was the city of Cartagena de Indias on the mainland of New Granada. Drake attacked and captured the place giving it the same rough treatment as Santo Domingo; here the city was better defended and the ransom was more lucrative.

Useful in all smoking applications and with any kind of animal protein, it is best used with fish where the flesh of a fish such as salmon forms a pellicle that will attract more smoke to adhere to it than would be the case if it had not been used. Pellicle formation Before cured foods are cold smoked, they can be allowed to air-dry to form a tacky outer layer, known as a pellicle. The pellicle plays a role in producing better smoked products as it acts as a protective barrier for the food and also plays a role in enhancing the flavor and color produced by the smoke. Most animal proteins can be dried by placing them on racks or by hanging them on hooks or sticks. It is important that air be able to flow around all sides. They should be air-dried uncovered, in the refrigerator or a cool room. To encourage pellicle formation, foods can be placed so that a fan blows air over them.

A substance's aneugenicity reflects its ability to induce aneuploidy. Exposure of males to lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards may increase the risk of spermatozoa aneuploidy. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that cause DNA damage (see Tobacco smoking#Health). Smoking also can induce aneuploidy. For instance, smoking increases chromosome 13 disomy in spermatozoa by 3-fold and YY disomy by 2-fold. Occupational exposure to benzene is associated with a 2.8-fold increase of XX disomy and a 2.6-fold increase of YY disomy in spermatozoa. Pesticides are released to the environment in large quantities so that most individuals have some degree of exposure. The insecticides fenvalerate and carbaryl have been reported to increase spermatozoa aneuploidy. Occupational exposure of pesticide factory workers to fenvalerate is associated with increased spermatozoa DNA damage. Exposure to fenvalerate raised sex chromosome disomy 1.9-fold and disomy of chromosome 18 by 2.6-fold (Xia et al., 2004). Exposure of male workers to carbaryl increased DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa, and also increased sex chromosome disomy by 1.7-fold and chromosome 18 disomy by 2.2-fold. Humans are exposed to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in many commercial products.

Its obverse is Steady state, where you might know only the starting and ending figures but do not understand the process by which they were derived. Transient models will reveal the pattern of a process, which might be sinusoidal or another shape that will help to design a better system to manage that process. Transient models can be done on a spreadsheet with an ability to generate charts, or by any software that can handle data of inputs and outputs and generate some sort of a display. Transient modelling does not need a computer. It is a methodology that has worked for centuries, by observers noting patterns of change against time, analysing the result and proposing improved design solutions. A simple example is a garden water tank. This is being topped up by rainfall from the roof, but when the tank is full, the remaining water goes to the drain. When the gardener draws water off, the level falls. If the garden is large and the summer is hot, a steady state will occur in summer where the tank is nearly always empty in summer. If the season is wet, the garden is getting water from the sky, and the tank is not being emptied sufficiently, so in steady state it will be observed to be always full. If the gardener has a way of observing the level of water in the tank, and a record of daily rainfall and temperatures, and is precisely metering the amount of water being drawn off every day, the numbers and the dates can be recorded in spreadsheet at daily intervals. After enough samples are taken, a chart can be developed to model the rise and fall pattern over a year, or over 2 years. With a better understanding of the process, it might emerge that a 200litre water tank would run out 20‚Äì25 days a year, but a 400-litre water tank would never run out, and a 300-litre tank would run out only 1-2 day a year and therefore that would be an acceptable risk and it would be the most economical solution. One of the best examples of transient modelling is transient climate simulation. The analysis of ice cores in glaciers to understand climate change. Ice cores have thousands of layers, each of which represents a winter season of snowfall, and trapped in these are bubbles of air, particle of space dust and pollen which reveal climatic data of the time. By mapping these to a time scale, scientists can analyse the fluctuations over time and make predictions for the future. Transient modelling is the basis of weather forecasting, of managing ecosystems, rail timetabling, managing the electricity grid, setting the national budget, floating currency, understanding traffic flows on a freeway, solar gains on glass fronted buildings, or even of checking the day-to-day transactions of one's monthly bank statement. With the transient modelling approach, you understand the whole process better when the inputs and outputs are graphed against time.

Catholic priest who was responsible for the successful evacuation of civilians trapped in the New Guinea Highlands in 1942 after the Japanese landings at Lae and Salamaua.  Early life  His family lived at Whorouly, a small settlement on the Ovens River between Myrtleford and Wangaratta in Victoria, Australia. Glover was ordained to the priesthood on 6 January 1932 at St Patrick's Church, Albury, by Bishop Joseph Wilfrid Dwyer of Wagga. He received his primary education at the Christian Brothers' College, Albury, and later attended the Ecclesiastical College at Manly. Fr Glover first learnt to fly with Butler Air Transport Co. while a Parish Priest at Cootamundra, New South Wales, in 1936. He was posted to New Guinea with the Divine Word Mission in 1938 where he began flying aircraft for the Mission in 1940.  World War II  On 14 February 1942, the day that civil governance of Papua ceased, Fr. Glover joined the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles at Wau and was given the rank of Warrant Officer II by the NGVR Commanding Officer Major W.M. Edwards. On 7 March he was given the rank of lieutenant.War Service Record at http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au Following Prime Minister John Curtin's declaration of war with Japan on 8 December 1941, hundreds of civilians had been flown to Port Moresby from Wewak, Lae, Salamaua, Bulolo and Wau, by many people, including veteran miner Norman Wilde, who evacuated 11 Chinese from Salamaua in his Tiger Moth. A few others, including three Seventh-day Adventist missionaries, were left in the highlands after the evacuation of the Papuan Gulf area. These were Dave Brennan at the Omaura Training School, Alex J. Campbell, pastor at the highlands headquarters (Ramu, Kainantu), and Stuart Gander further west at Benabena. Due to the rapid deterioration of affairs at Rabaul, no news had reached them, and they were unaware of permission to leave. Some others made an journey from the May River over the divide to Daru on foot. Others walked from Madang to the highlands centre of Kainantu. After the town of Wau and Father Glover's church had been strafed by Japanese Zeros, he helped to evacuate Europeans from the Markham Valley. This included some people from Manus Island and survivors of the massacres in New Britain. Flying a Spartan 2-seater from Wau, re-built and maintained by Hungarian Karl Nagy, who had been Guinea Airways' chief engineer, Fr. Glover flew people to Port Moresby via Wau. As time went on this route became too dangerous, so they hid the Spartan in the gardens of the Seventh-day Adventist Mission Headquarters at Kainantu where Alex J. Campbell was in charge. Glover and Nagy then set out to walk to Madang, taking nine days instead of the usual four to make the trip. At Madang they knew a Fox- Moth 4-seater was still intact at the Catholic Mission's headquarters on Sek Island. The Moth was floated thirteen miles down the coast on a raft made from fuel drums, and while they worked on it near the Madang airfield, two air attacks took place. The plane remained intact and they flew it back to the Mission station at Kainantu. Here they worked on both planes and made a spare fuel tank for the Moth out of some leftover galvanised iron. It was hoped this would extend the range to enable it to reach Cairns to arrange evacuation of the refugees in the Highlands. Fr. Glover then decided to ferry some sick civilians to Mt. Hagen. Using the Spartan on the first trip, he found it wasn't powerful enough to get over the Purari Divide and had to return to Kainantu. On landing, he ran into the trip wire that had been strung across the strip to thwart enemy aircraft. He and his passenger weren't hurt, but the propeller on the Spartan was irreparably damaged. There were fifty people at Kainantu at this time and Fr Glover obviously thought that flying them out in the Moth was not a practical undertaking. He proposed a plan that seemed suicidal ‚Äì to fly to Mt. Hagen and then on to Thursday Island to alert the authorities to the plight of the people stranded in the highlands.War Zone Scramble ‚Äì Stories of Escape During World War II ‚Äì by Milton Hook They worked on the Moth for a week; in that time they made an auxiliary fuel tank out of some scrap galvanised iron and joined it to the existing tank with a piece of copper tube that Alex Campbell had salvaged from a plane that had crashed there in 1937. Nagy was to sit in the back nursing a bed pan full of extra fuel and transfer it to the main fuel tank with a large enema syringe donated by Alex Campbell from his store of medical supplies. The first attempt at reaching Mt. Hagen failed, but after some further modifications to the Moth a second attempt succeeded. On 28 March 1942 they left Mt. Hagen and crossed the mountains to the southern coast, where they ran into some very bad weather and made a forced landing on a beach to the west of Daru with only a cup full of fuel remaining. Here they persuaded some local natives to row them to Thursday Island. On the way they transferred to a lugger which took them the remaining distance to Thursday Island. Meanwhile, the people at Kainantu weren't aware that Fr. Glover had actually made his destination and groups of people had set out on foot for Mt. Hagen. The mission station had been taken over by the Australian military and was being used as a hospital. Campbell was undecided whether or not to start out for Mt. Hagen with the few remaining civilians until he heard over the radio that some American missionaries had been imprisoned by the Japanese on Bougainville. He then realised that the enemy weren't going to regard the missionaries as neutral. On 10 April 1942 the army asked Campbell if he wished to evacuate as they couldn't guarantee any support if he stayed. The mission had been bombed with minor damage resulting, but enemy planes were in the skies all around. He decided to leave and sent word to fellow missionaries Brennan and Gander to join him. Brennan walked in from Omaura six days later, and together they set off on the 320 km trek, picking up Gander along the way at Bena Bena. They crossed the Gafuka Valley and went through the Mairi Gorge, across the Chimbu River and on up the Wahgi Valley, reaching Mt. Hagen after nine days. There they waited with 80 others until on 13 May the first rescue planes arrived from Horne Island and they began to take them to safety.

Foto: 2010. Ljungstr√∂m rig is the name for the sailing rig designed by Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m with double main sails and rotating mast, but without boom, foresail, forestay and shroud. The early models of the Ljungstr√∂m sailboat had a stern stay but this was omitted around 1945, before the model 12 (Vingen 12). The Ljungstr√∂m rig is competitive towards the competing rigs from that time when close hauled and full run but is lacking at beam reach and broad reach. Its main purpose and advantage is, however, safety and ease of handling. History The first Ljungstr√∂m rig was developed by the Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m to enhance safety at sea. The family had been close to severe accidents with the traditionally rigged Ebella, nowadays named Beatrice Aurore, when in hard weather the crew had to walk on deck to take in sail. Ljungstr√∂m, in order to not risk the safety of his crew, designed a boomless rig handled completely from the cockpit.  Components   Mast  The mast is made of glued clean wood, conical, without stays or shrouds. Boom, pole, gaff, spreaders and such are completely omitted. The mast is supported by two ball bearings, one at the keel and one at the deck hole, and can thus rotate freely. The rotation is created using a wooden collar, with a V-shaped track, around the mast below deck. Around this collar an infinite rope sling runs through two blocks to a winch, powered by hand or an electric motor. In this way the sail is rolled onto the mast when less area is needed or when the sailing is finished. As a result of the conic mast, the clew will move up the less sail that exposed. As a result of the mast taper the clew will end up higher and higher the closer it is to the mast. The mast is hollow, partly to reduce weight (up to 4.5% of a keelboat's displacement), and partly so that the halyard can run inside the mast, and therefore manufactured in two halves. At the top is a metal bracket with pulley for the halyard which then runs inside the mast and comes out below deck, where a pulley is located under the mast root. The mast foot is tapered so the mast stands firmly in the lower tapered ball bearing. Level with the deck is the mast \\"bottleneck\\" where the upper ball bearing rests. By means of a bracket bolted to the deck upper surface the upper ball bearing is kept in place, thereby keeping the mast from being lifted from the lower layer.  Sail  A Ljungstr√∂m rig usually has two sails, stitched together at the luff. On all points of sail, except a full run, these sails are close together. In the unlikely event that one of the sails would rip the other still stands and the boat can safely reach harbor. The Ljungstr√∂m rig is often compared with a staysail with the big difference that the mast bends inversely to the forestay. This must be compensated for so that the luff is provided a belly which is <30% of the masthead deflection, about 2% of the luff length. Since the sail is hoisted throughout the season, it is appropriate that leach and foot consists of UV-resistant fabric that covers the entire mast in its furled state.  Sheeting  The two sails each have their own independent sheet. On previous models the blocks sat on the deck aft area but later improved forwarding with a pole which raised the sheeting point about one meter. Some models have a winch. The advantage of the Ljungstr√∂m rig, besides the simplicity and safety, is in the engineer's knowledge of fluid dynamics. The mast is rotated so that the sail rests on the mast at lee. This is to minimize turbulent flow on the leeward side of the mast and the propulsion force, which is so important, becomes almost undisturbed. This was totally new for that time and made a boat with Ljungstr√∂m rig point higher than its contemporary competitors. Today profiled masts addresses this problem, but hardly more efficiently. The real showpiece,however, is at full run where the two sails separate as butterfly wings, sheeted on each side, similar to a spinnaker, but with no extra booms or guys needed.

Will Museum of the Glades, formerly the Belle Glade Historical Society, is a museum of local history located in Belle Glade, Florida. The Museum of the Glades represents the total Glades experience with an archive collection that dates back to the early Belle Glade people present thousands of years ago, the Seminoles, early pioneer settlements, agricultural tools and innovations, the early hurricanes of the 20th century, and local history records through the 1960s. Part of Palm Beach County, the city of Belle Glade is on the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee and part of the Everglades Agricultural Area. The museum is a member of the American Association for State and Local History (AASLH). Museum History The museum incorporated as a non-profit in 1976 as a bicentennial observance. The museum's collection was housed in the Belle Glade Branch Library, part of the Palm Beach County Library System, until 2013 when the library relocated. Lawrence E. Will, the son of Glades pioneer Theodore Will, started the local archive with his own research, photographs, and manuscripts about pioneer life and the culture of the area. His writings on Lake Okeechobee and the northern Everglades produced six books. His writings were all based on first-hand accounts and interviews \\"during his time operating freight, passenger, and tow boats, as well as floating dredges, in all parts of the Everglades\\" His best known titles are A Cracker History of Okeechobee and the 1928 Hurricane-Okeechobee Hurricane and the Herbert Hoover Dike. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration, in partnership with the Smithsonian, excavated a prehistoric mound outside the city limits. Archeologists discovered a type site with artifacts dating back over 3,000 years old that explain a culture of prehistoric communities. The \\"Belle Glade People\\" were a thriving culture until the mid-1700s. The archives grew following the 1977 excavation of the Belle Glade Mound that held many artifacts including pottery, shells, and bones. In 2012, an archaeologist completed research on the Belle Glade Mound Collection at the Smithsonian, and the prehistoric Native Americans that lived in the area between 700AD-1500AD. For many decades, the archives were curated by Dr. Joseph Orsenigo until his death in 2009. In 2012, the Belle Glade Historical Society reorganized to become the Museum of the Glades. Archaeological Significance The Belle Glades Culture is estimated to have prospered from around 500 BC through 1500 AD. These early people were well organized and had an extensive trade network with other tribes in Florida. During the 1930s, archeologists excavated the Belle Glade Mound, which was the first large mound site to be uncovered.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Draco guentheri, p. 110). Taxonomy This species was originally described in 1885 by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger, who named it Draco guentheri. This species is also notable for having been collected by the Philippine national hero Jose Rizal during his exile in Dapitan, Mindanao in 1893 and identified it as a new type of lizard in which he tentatively named, Draco dapitani. Rizal sent specimens to Europe, to the German zoologist Benno Wandolleck. In 1900 Wandolleck, thinking Rizal's specimens represented a new species, described it and named it Draco rizali, thereby creating a synonym. Rizal's specimens, subsequently, were destroyed during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. In 1936 Hennig considered this lizard to be part of what he called a subspecies, Draco volans reticulatus. In 1993 Gaulke raised it to full species status. And most recently, in 2000, McGuire and Alcala once again recognized Boulenger's original Draco guentheri as a valid species. References Further reading *Boulenger GA (1885).

A heroin addict, he commits a series of petty crimes to afford his habit, along with fellow addict Bubbles. Biography Season 1 In season 1, Johnny is Bubbles' best friend and a drug addict with notoriously bad luck. He is naive and enthusiastic for \\"the game\\", and allows Bubbles to play the role of teacher. In the pilot episode Johnny is badly beaten by Bodie Broadus, Poot Carr, and other dealers after trying to pass counterfeit money to D'Angelo Barksdale's operation. This spurs Bubbles to become a police informant, but Johnny disapproves and takes no part in it except when arrested by the police. While in the hospital for that beating, Johnny discovers he is HIV positive; he also undergoes a colostomy operation. Season 2 Johnny is first seen by Detective Jimmy McNulty, stealing from a shopping centre with Bubbles. McNulty catches Johnny and Bubbles, but instead of arresting them asks them to find stick up artist Omar Little. At the end of Season 2, Officer Santangelo arrests Bubbles and Johnny stealing morphine from an ambulance. They are released because Bubbles gives information about Proposition Joe's dealers at the projects, when Cheese is shot in the shoulder by Brother Mouzone. Season 3 Johnny and Bubbles continue to steal from scrapyards. Bubbles would rather make money by continuing to inform detectives McNulty and Greggs. Johnny overdoses, and his body is discovered in a vacant house in Major Colvin's \\"Hamsterdam\\" free zone.

The term was first used in 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI in a speech \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" to refer to attempts to separate Christianity from Greek philosophical thought.Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 9 Subsequently, the term figured prominently in Robert R. Reilly's book The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis, to refer to what Reilly characterized as \\"the religion of Islam's divorce from reason and rationality.\\" The extent and significance of dehellenization in both the Christian and Islamic religious traditions continues to be widely disputed. Hellenization The Hellenistic Period begins with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and ends with the emergence of the Roman Empire.Ancient Greece History. History of Greece: Hellenistic. http://www.ancient- greece.org/history/helleninstic.html, accessed April 10, 2013. For the purpose of defining dehellenization, the Hellenistic Period is known for the emergence of a number of philosophical theories, including Peripateticism, Epicureanism, Pyrrhonism, Academic Skepticism, Cynicism, and Stoicism, among others. An underlying element common to all of these schools of thought is an emphasis on human rationality and the ability to reason.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. xi Of Christianity Pope Benedict XVI argues that several key ideas in Christian thought reveal the hellenization of Christianity: # According to the Pope, St. Paul's vision of the Macedonian man pleading with him to travel to Macedonia to help his people specifically foreshadows the necessary marriage of Biblical and Greek thought. # To demonstrate the fusion of Greek and Biblical thought, the Pope refers to the opening verse of the gospel of John: \\"In the beginning was the word.\\" Here \\"Word\\" translates the Greek word \\"logos\\" (ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ), meaning not only \\"word\\" but also \\"reason\\", so the verse can be paraphrased as \\"in the beginning there was reason.\\"Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 5 # The Pope also points to the concept of voluntarism, proposed by the Franciscan Blessed John Duns Scotus and developed by later scholars into the premise that we can only know God through a voluntary decision to do so.Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 7 Although Jesus's followers were reluctant to succumb to the Hellenistic rulers' attempts to force them into Greek idolatry and customs, the Pope argues that they were nevertheless able to extract the most enriching element of Hellenistic thought, namely that man has not only the ability but also the obligation to think rationally.Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Father at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 6 Of Islam The conquest of Persia and parts of Central Asia by Alexander the Great beginning in 330 BC was accompanied by an extensive dissemination of Greek culture and thought beyond the Mediterranean area. Although Persia was eventually reclaimed by the Persians, Hellenistic influence continued in the area.Malik, Brigadier S.K. Quranic Concept of War. p. 8 According to Reilly, most of the fusion of Islamic and Greek philosophy occurred between 660 and 750 AD when the Umayyad dynasty came to possess Sassanid (Persian) and Byzantine territories that were heavily populated by Greco-Christians and contained many Hellenistic centers of learning.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 13 Initially attracted to Greek thought for medicinal and mathematic purposes, many Muslims began to explore other aspects of Hellenism, in particular philosophy.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 14 Causes of dehellenization In Islam According to Reilly, the primary cause of the dehellenization of Islam was the rise of the Ash'arite sect and decline of the Mu'tazila sect in the ninth and tenth centuries.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. x The Mu‚Äôtazalites adopted the belief that man must be free, because without freedom, he would be unable to know God‚Äôs justice. Consequently, man was free and obligated to interpret sacred texts in the context of his time. The Mu‚Äôtazalite premise that the Qur'an was created implies that it is subject to reason, in contradiction to the orthodox belief that the Qur'an is eternal. The Mu‚Äôtazalites produced the first Greek-inspired Islamic school of thought, championing the idea of reason and rational morality.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 19 The Ash'arites evolved as a group in direct opposition to the Mu‚Äôtazalites. The Ash'arites opposed the Mu'tazalites on several levels. They argued that the Qur'an was coeternal with Allah, rendering it inalterable and uninterpretable by man. Whereas the Mu‚Äôtazalites held that God was reasonably required to reward and punish as he had promised, the Ash'arites argued that God is not required to do anything, since such requirements must necessarily limit him. Ash'arites insisted that any apparent inconsistencies in the Qur'an must not be questioned. In contrast, the Mu'tazalites believed that analyzing these inconsistencies is in accordance with man's necessity to reason: since God is not intuitive or physical, we must reason to his existence.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 24 Under the reign of Caliph Ja'afar al-Mutawakkil (847‚Äì861), adopting the doctrine of the Mu'tazalites became a crime punishable by death. Most of Mu‚Äôtazalite works were destroyed and bookstores were told not to sell any of their works. By the 12th century, Mu'tazalite influence had been almost entirely eradicated from Islamic society. This suppression of rationalist thought and elevation of orthodoxy signaled the general dehellenization of Islamic society.Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis. Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2010. p. 41 In Christianity Pope Benedict XVI proposes that a dehellenization of Christianity has stemmed from three different sources. The first stage of Christian dehellenization can be attributed to the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Reformers believed that faith had turned into a mere element in abstract philosophy, and that the religion needed to return to the idea of sola scriptura (scripture only).Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Fatehr at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 10 The second stage occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries due to the theology of Adolf von Harnack. Harnack advocated focusing on the simple life of Jesus Christ, and his humanitarian message in particular. Theology and belief in a divine being, according to Harnack, was a scientific history completely separate from the modern reason of humanitarian aid. The last stage, occurring currently in the twenty-first century, is a product of modern cultural pluralism. Cultural pluralism encourages other cultures to simply return to the simplicity of the New Testament, and refuse it with their own culture. The Pope affirms that such a method cannot work because the New Testament \\"was written in Greek and bears the imprint of the Greek spirit.\\"Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Faith, Reason, and the University: Memories and Reflections,\\" Lecture of the Holy Fatehr at Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg, September 2006, para. 11 Sources * Reilly, Robert: The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamic Crisis.

After completing his studies at Portsmouth School of Art he walked to London seeking fame and fortune. Producing pen and ink illustrations for books and magazines was the only way he could make a living. Most of his drawing was done with a Gillott 303 pen with a goose quill - \\"slapping in the pork\\", to use his own expression. Early in 1898 Frank and his wife Emily leased a derelict Elizabethan property near Billingshurst in West Sussex for an annual rent of nine-pence (3¬Ωp); it remained their home for the next 54 years.

Compiled with data from governments and institutes, the project was coordinated by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, and was presented by Mike Purucker of NASA and Colin Reeves of the Netherlands. As of 2007, it was considered to be \\"the first truly global compilation of lithospheric magnetic field observations.\\" and further improvements dated to 2009 relate to the full spectrum magnetic anomaly grid of the United States and also data of global marine magnetic anomaly. Some of the magnetic anomalies shown in the WDMAM generally relates to the altitude level of . Some of the significant features represented are of the Bangui Anomaly in the Central African Republic, the Chicxulub crater, the Thromsberg anomaly, the Richat Structure, the Atlantic ridge, the Bay of Biscay, the Sunda Arc and the Paris Basin. Background In evolving the WDMAM the lithospheric data related to data acquired from satellites, data of aero-magnetic survey and marine survey, in-situ data gathered from field stations and observatories are to be collated analyzed together, and this would need an international joint effort. The map is the product of years of work, research and coordination by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and numerous small organizations around the world including GETECH, a project of Leeds University, and Juha Korhonen of the Geological Survey of Finland have also been involved. International collaboration has been the key to the project. Mike Purucker of NASA said of the collaboration: \\"There are literally hundreds, perhaps thousands, of organisations around the world which hold this kind of data. One should not underestimate the diplomatic efforts needed to secure support and data contributions from these organizations.\\" Diplomacy was needed to acquire data from the Russians, Indians, and Argentinians and so on. It is available through the Commission for the Geological Map of the World. The map is compiled from a jigsaw of aeromagnetic surveys, incorporating both ground-based, airbome and marine magnetic data, but is incomplete. CHAMP, a German and Russian-built satellite which has been in orbit since 2001, has been of crucial importance to the map compilers. One of its principal achievements is that it has significantly improved the \\"pre-processing and the corrections applied to the CHAMP satellite measurements in order to obtain 'clean' satellite data compatible with ground data.\\" However, it has some large gaps in data, which is a hindrance to studying trans-national tectonics, and could benefit from further satellite observational additions to improve its coverage. Several different models were put forward as candidates for WDMAM by groups from NASA, Leeds University, the Geological Survey of Finland, National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and GeoForschungszentrum Potsdam, all using the same base data. Following a review, the NGDC candidate was chosen to form the basemap. Composition According to the BBC, the \\"global map shows the variation in strength of the magnetic field after the Earth's dipole field has been removed (Earth's dipole field varies from 35,000 nano-Tesla (nT) at the Equator to 70,000 nT at the poles). After removal of the dipole field, the remaining variations in the field (few hundreds of nT) are due to changes in the magnetic properties of the crustal rocks.\\" The map is graphically represented by illustrating those landmarks of high magnetism in red to yellow hues and those of lower or negative magnetism in blue hues. It can pick up numerous aspects of the earth composition, including the sea floor spreading under the oceans, and reserve deposits like iron ore at Kursk. It identifies some prominent magnetic anomalies on the African continent. The dominant factors for magnetic anomalies picked up on the map are \\"the thickness of the magnetised layer and the composition of the crust\\". Younger crust is typically thinner, and naturally has a lower number of magnetic materials.

The courtyard was previously the site of a dower house called Allanbank of the country estate of the now demolished Blackadder House. The ghost's name is derived from the eye-witness' claim that she is seen covered in the similarly named lace, with which the Laird of Allanbank tried to buy her silence about the affair. Though the story has consistently situated the ghost at the estate, the woman who came to be Pearlin Jean had her origins in Paris. Legend states that she was the lover of the Laird of Sir Robert Stewart, he was made a Baronet in 1684), and a Nun of Charity (as she was not confined to a cloister). Though their affair lasted for a long time, the Laird left Paris to return to his estate in Scotland. It is speculated that the Laird had become unfaithful, but he could also have been called back by his family to wed the daughter of Sir John Gilmour. Jean attempted to physically stop Stewart from leaving her by stepping out in front of his carriage. He ordered his driver to carry on regardless, and the woman fell. The wheels of the carriage then ran over her forehead, killing her. Her last words to Robert were: \\"I'll be in Scotland before you.\\" In what appeared to be a fulfilling of her prophecy, as Stewart arrived back on his estate for the first time, he saw his ex-lover sitting on top of the entrance to the estate, with blood covering her head and shoulders. This first sighting was at least prior to 1697. After this incident, seven local ministers from the Church of the Reformed Faith were asked to congregate in the house to exorcise the ghost to no avail. The household decided to hang the woman's portrait between the laird and his wife's, though when removed in a fit of jealousy by Lady Stewart, the house would become 'disquiet' again. The ghost was said to slam doors, open windows and walk throughout the house at all times of the day and night. As time progressed, Pearlin Jean's ghostly figure became that of a skeleton in Pearlin lace, rather than the figure seen by the first laird, dripping with blood. After the laird's death, her appearances were unsurprising to the staff, being reportedly unmenacing. The portrait of Pearlin Jean was later given to a knight, though its current whereabouts is unknown. In the 1700s, Thomas Blackadder was said to be infatuated with the figure of Pearlin Jean, and went to meet her in the courtyard. As soon as he realised the nature of the woman, he became incredibly frightened. Later in the century, 1790, ladies of the court reported being disturbed throughout their stay at the estate by footsteps pacing up and down their chambers. The legend was immortalised in song in the 1800s, the known lyrics of which are: > O Pearlin' Jean, O Pearlin' Jean, She haunts the house, she haunts the green > And glowers on us a' wi' her wullcat e'en And > For all the silver in English bank, Nor yet for all the gold, Would I pass > through the hall of Allanbank When the midnight bell has toll'd After the main house was demolished in the 1800s, with a bowling green being placed over the foundations, the ghost has faded into history, with no contemporary sightings. Even after this, in the beginnings of the 20th century the estate holders found it almost impossible to find tenants for the land. Many prospective inhabitants dropped out after they heard about Pearlin Jean.

It was originally described in 1911 by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill as Volvariopsis earlei, based on collections made in a Cuban banana field. The fungus was later shuffled to the genera Volvaria and Volvariella before molecular studies placed it in Volvopluteus, a genus newly described in 2011. The cap of Volvopluteus earlei is typically between in diameter, white, and is markedly viscid when fresh. The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and measures long and wide. It has a smooth, white, sac-like volva at its base. The cap produces a pinkish-brown spore print made of individual elliptical spores measuring up to 11 micrometers long. A saprotrophic fungus that grows on grassy fields, V. earlei has been reported from Africa, Europe, and North America. Microscopic features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species. V. earlei can be distinguished from the three other Volvariella by differences in the size of the fruit bodies, cap color, spore size, and the presence or absence and form of cystidia. Taxonomy This species was originally described by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1911 based on three collections made by his colleague Franklin Sumner Earle in Santiago de las vegas (Cuba) a few years earlier. It was originally described by Murrill in the genus Volvariopsis, created in the same publication, because at that time there was considerable confusion about which generic name was more appropriate for the mushrooms traditionally classified in the genus Volvariella. At the time of Murrill's proposal most species in this group were classified in the genus Volvaria erected by Paul Kummer in 1871, but mycologists realized that the name Volvaria was already taken as it had been coined by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle for a genus of lichens in 1805. A year later Murrill transferred his species of Volvariopsis to the genus Volvaria, citing practical concerns about usage of names for non-taxonomists: \\"A number of species of gill-fungi described by me from tropical America in Mycologia, 1911‚Äì1912, under genera not found in Saccardo's Sylloge, are here recombined for the benefit of those having or using herbaria arranged according to this work. Collectors, pathologists, and others who may not be intimately acquainted with taxonomic methods will probably find it more convenient to follow the one system until a comprehensive revision is completed, at least for some important groups\\". Ultimately, neither Volvaria nor Volvariopsis would be used as the correct name for this group. The generic name Volvariella, proposed by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899, would be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer's Volvaria against De Candolle's Volvaria was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. The combination Volvariella earlei would be made by Robert L. Shaffer, who authored the first comprehensive monographic revision of Volvariella in North America in 1957. The phylogenetic study of Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella earlei is closely related to Volvariella gloiocephala and that this group of species constitutes a separate lineage from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella. Therefore, this taxon was transferred to the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus. The specific epithet earlei comes from the surname of Franklin Sumner Earle, the collector of the original samples, to whom Murrill dedicated the species. The original specimens of this species are still preserved at the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden. Description The cap of Volvopluteus earlei is between in diameter, more or less ovate or hemispherical when young, then expanding to convex or flat. It can have a low, broad umbo in the center in old specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh fruit bodies; the cap is pure white, but sometimes develops pale brown tinges with age. The gills are crowded together, free from attachment to the stipe, ventricose, and up to 6 mm broad; they are white when young but turn pink with age as the spores mature. The cylindrical stipe is long and wide, and broadening towards the base. Its surface is white, smooth or slightly pruinose (as if covered with a fine white powder). The sac-like volva is up to high, white and has a smooth surface. The context is white in the stipe and cap and it does not change color when bruised or exposed to air. The smell and taste of the flesh are described as indistinct or herbaceous. The spore print is pinkish-brown. The cheilocystidia of Volvopluteus earlei are variably shaped and often have a long apical outgrowth. The spores are ellipsoid and measure 11‚Äì16 by 8‚Äì11 Œºm. Basidia are 20‚Äì40 by 8‚Äì16 Œºm; they are usually four-spored but sometimes two-spored, and, more rarely, one-spored forms can occur. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in most collections; if present they are scarce and similar to the cheilocystidia. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 30‚Äì70 by 10‚Äì35 Œºm, and are club-, spindle-, or flask-shaped, and usually each one has an apical outgrowth up to 40 Œºm long. The cheilocystidia completely cover the gill edge. In the form acystidiatus (N.C.Pathak) Vizzini & Contu, both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are completely absent. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix). The stipe cuticle (stipitipellis) is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap) are sometimes present; they measure 65‚Äì140 by 10‚Äì25 Œºm, and are mostly cylindrical. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Volvopluteus earlei is a saprotrophic mushroom that grows in gardens and grassy fields. It was originally found in banana fields in Cuba. In Africa, Spain and Italy it has been reported mostly in urban or anthropogenic garden areas. It usually fruits in groups of several mushrooms but it can also be found growing solitary. This species has been reported from Cuba, North Carolina, Mexico, Spain and Italy. Molecular data have so far corroborated that the European and African collections correspond to the same species. Similar species Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus gloiocephalus has larger fruit bodies (cap more than in diameter), has pleurocystidia, and the cheilocystidia lack long apical outgrowths. V. asiaticus has pleurocystidia and has predominantly flask-shaped cheilocystidia without long apical outgrowths. In V. michiganensis, pleurocystidia are also present, and this species has smaller spores, typically less than 12.5 Œºm long.

It was originally called the Wiltshire County Lunatic Asylum and later the Wiltshire County Mental Hospital. It opened in 1851 and closed in 1995. History Construction and inauguration The hospital was originally conceived in 1848 by a committee of Justices chaired by Sir John Wither Awdry for \\"providing an asylum for the pauper lunatics of the county of Wiltshire alone\\". Forty-eight acres of land was purchased from Mr THS Southeron at the end of Pans Lane in the parish of Roundway. The cost was raised by loans from the government and other subscribers to be paid back over 21 years. Construction was started in 1849. The architect was Thomas Henry Wyatt, well known for his institutional architecture. The style was Italianate and the first phase cost ¬£19,594. Construction was by T & W Piper, the addition of ironwork by Knight & Co. for railings around the buildings cost a further ¬£1,069. The principal building material was stone from the Murhill Quarries near Winsley and the roof slates came from Wales. The quarries were conveniently placed about 15 miles away along the Kennet and Avon Canal which had opened some 50 years earlier. The slates were likewise transported by canal. Developments in structure Originally the hospital was called the Wiltshire County Lunatic Asylum when it received the first inmates on 19 September 1851. When the hospital was first constructed it was insufficient for the population demand and extensions were added. This happened regularly as the population grew and it was only during the 1940s that no building extensions were added. 1858 saw a new female ward built and in 1863‚Äì66 three more wards were added. Further wards were added in 1877. In 1890 a third storey was added to the main building. A house called \\"Campfield House\\" was built for the Physician Superintendent in 1892 and a recreation hall and engine room were added in 1898 when the main power changed from gas to electricity. In 1922 the name of the hospital was changed to the Wiltshire County Mental Hospital. In 1927 accommodation for nurses was built. 1935 saw a further building programme to increase accommodation and in 1937 the hospital chapel was completed. Management and treatments The first Medical Superintendent was Dr. Thurnham, a liberal Quaker and well respected psychiatrist born near York and who had spent some years at the York Retreat. He was appointed in 1849 to enable him to work with Wyatt on the construction of the building. The hospital from its inception was managed by the Wiltshire Court of Quarter Sessions. In 1853 about 200 of the total of 333 patients were occupied on the hospital farm, in the kitchen, chopping wood or stonebreaking By 1880 cricket, bowls, country walks, theatricals and \\"Christy Minstrels\\" style shows were available for the patients. In 1889 the hospital became the responsibility of Wiltshire County Council. In 1912 there were about 1,000 patients in the hospital, with seclusion and restraints still in common use, and some patients were transferred to the Dorset County Asylum in Dorchester to relieve the overcrowding. From 1915 to 1920 the hospital was afflicted with outbreaks of tuberculosis and dysentery, which led to a negative inspectors' report. An innovation in the early 1920s was the use of warm baths lasting up to seven hours, with the patient under a sheet and with boards across the bath to facilitate meals. In 1928 occupational therapy was started, and in 1930 social workers were employed. 1930 also saw the Mental Treatment Act 1930, which affected the rights of patients and reinforced the idea that asylums were hospitals. During the 1930s, patients were attending entertainments outside the hospital, a \\"talking cinema apparatus\\" was installed in the hospital, and there was a canteen and library for patient use. Patients had also formed their own football and cricket teams. Electroconvulsive therapy was introduced in 1942, followed by the first prefrontal leucotomy operation in the hospital in 1946. In 1947 the National Health Service was established throughout the United Kingdom, and in 1948 the management of the hospital was transferred to the Ministry of Health. By the 1950s the hospital population was no longer increasing, and there were about 1,300 beds. Some patients were transferred to the Old Manor Hospital in Salisbury and some to Old Park House, a large residential home in Devizes and a recent purchase by the Ministry of Health to provide better accommodation. It was managed from Roundway. Inspection reports mention less crowding and everything satisfactory. The final years The 1950s witnessed the introduction of insulin coma therapy and antidepressants. The Mental Health Act 1959 brought further changes to the management of hospitals and patients. The laws relating to the detention of patients changed and all patients were deemed 'informal' and free to leave with special procedures necessary to specifically detain a patient if required. There was a trend to move mental care away from large institutions and this coincided with the development of modern effective antipsychotic drugs. By the 1960s the beds had been reduced to 800 and up to 300 patients were earning a small wage working in a rehabilitative factory managed by a local firm. The 1970s saw a further move to discharge people into the community, formalized in 1983 as the government policy of Care in the Community.Making a Reality of Community Care, Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales, 1986, The decision to close Roundway Hospital was finally made in the late 1980s, and in 1995 the remaining patients were transferred to the newly built Green Lane Hospital nearby. Roundway Hospital was decommissioned, and the land and buildings were sold for housing development. According to the archivist at the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives, the cemetery site at Drew's Pond is still in existence although all the stones were removed.

Kibbe found all but one of his victims on the freeways around Sacramento, California. On May 10, 1991, Kibbe was sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment for the murder of Darcie Frackenpohl and, at least initially, to serve his time at Pleasant Valley State Prison. In 2003, Kibbe accompanied prosecutors and detectives to a dry creek he remembered to try to find the body of Lou Ellen Burleigh, whom he had discarded in 1977. In 2007 a detective searched the area again. In 2009 Kibbe again returned to the site with detectives. Burleigh's body was not found and a Grand Jury was convened. After a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty, on November 5, 2009, Kibbe was sentenced to an additional six life sentences, this time for the murders of Lora Heedick, Barbara Ann Scott, Stephanie Brown, Charmaine Sabrah, Katherine Kelly Quinones, and Lou Ellen Burleigh. In 2011, a detective returned to the Burleigh dump site on his own, found a bone in the creek, and DNA testing proved it to be Burleigh's. Burleigh had left her Walnut Creek, California home in 1977 for a job interview but never returned. Kibbe kidnapped his victims, tied them up and silenced them with duct tape. He then proceeded to cut open their clothes in irregular shapes with scissors that had belonged to his mother. Then, he raped them and strangled them to death. Kibbe also cut off most of the hair of his victims to remove the duct tape before leaving the scene of the crime.

He formerly played for FC Twente, Go Ahead Eagles, FC Emmen, Nacional and De Graafschap.  Career  Peters played as a youth for KVV Losser and from there moved to the youth system of Eredivisie club FC Twente. In 2012, he joined second-tier Eerste Divisie club Go Ahead Eagles on a season-long loan. On 17 August 2012, he made his debut in professional football for the club from Deventer, and he finished the season with six goals in 39 appearances. After the loan deal expired, Peters returned to Twente where he would appear for the reserve team, Jong FC Twente, at that time also competing in the second-tier Eerste Divisie. There, he was a regular starter, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances. Ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 season, he moved to FC Emmen. With 23 goals, he finished the season second on the top goalscorer list that year, behind top scorer Sjoerd Ars. In July 2015, Peters signed a four-year contract with Portuguese club Nacional, who had finished seventh in the Primeira Liga the previous season. The club signed him on a free transfer. A month after his arrival, Nacional informed Peters that he could stay, but under different financial conditions than initially agreed. He did not agree to a restructuring of his contract and left. Because he was not yet registered with the Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional (LPFP) and had not made any official appearances for Nacional yet, he was able to look for a new club without any obstacles. Later that month, Peters reached an agreement on signing a two-year contract with De Graafschap, who had promoted to the Eredivisie in the previous season. After one season, he returned to FC Emmen. He finished the 2017‚Äì18 season as the club's top goalscorer with seventeen goals. He managed to qualify for the promotion play-offs with Emmen at the end of the season. In the return game of the play-offs final against Sparta Rotterdam (1-3 win), he provided two assists and thus helped FC Emmen reach promotion to the Eredivisie. On 29 August 2018, Peters signed a three-year contract with FC Volendam.

The station opened on 5 May 1835 on the Lines 25, 27 and 53. In 1835 the first public train journey on the European mainland arrived near the station. The passengers were transported to just south of the station, as there was no bridge over the canal until 1836. Lines were built in all directions from the station: North to Antwerp, south to Brussels and France, east to Leuven, Liege and Verviers and west to Dendermonde, Ghent, Bruges and Oostende. To the east of the station is the large Mechelen Train Works, where trains receive maintenance and heavy works, such as refurbishment. The station has 10 platforms, the 4 on the east side are a few metres higher than the others. In 2012 a new high-speed railway (Line 25N) opened between Mechelen and Schaarbeek, in the north of Brussels. This line also links Mechelen with Brussels Airport. There are 2 new platforms planned at the station to accommodate extra trains from this line. In 2013 major plans to modernise and rebuild the station started. It is planned to build a car park underneath the station and then to demolish the current station and rebuild it on the site of the current car park, just east of the station. The building work is expected to take 10 years.

Biography Early years Gerald Cranston Frederick Loughran was born in the Yeotmal province of the central plains of India. He was the youngest of eight children, having three brothers and four sisters. His forefathers emigrated from Ireland to India around 1800, while his paternal grandmother was of Russian descent. His father Albert Loughran (known as Locky) was a Chief Inspector of Police in the Central Province of India. His mother, Lizzie Cranston, was born of a British father and an Indian mother. He spent the earliest years of his life growing up on the family farm just outside the town of Damoh, and attended Wynberg Allen Memorial School in Mussoorie, a small village in the Himalayas. Personal life After the death of Gerry's father in 1949, the Loughran family emigrated to south London, England in 1953, following the sale of the family farm. He took up an apprenticeship at Kingston power station, qualifying after five years as an instrument engineer. 1963 saw the death of Gerry's mother, and also his marriage to Bobbi, whom he had first met in 1959. They had two sons, Jason and Jethro. At the end of 1981 he suffered a heart attack and stroke after which he lost the use of his left hand. He died on 17 November 1987, after another heart attack. Musical career Lockran discovered skiffle music and for three years played in skiffle group 'The Hornets', at well known venues such as the Skiffle Cellar. Lockran also appeared at the Finsbury Park Empire, London with Wally Whyton and The Vipers. Towards the end of the 1950s, Lockran met and become lifelong friends with two other young blues musicians: Cliff Aungier, another singer/guitarist and Royd Rivers, who played blues harmonica and 12-string guitar. Lockran and Rivers worked as a duo until 1963, playing live in pubs and clubs throughout Southern England, including the Red Lion in Sutton, Surrey which was one of England's first folk clubs. In 1961, Lockran acquired the guitar he was most associated with: a Martin D-28 as played by his biggest influence, Big Bill Broonzy. Lockran continued to perform solo throughout the early 1960s, and his live work included tours of France, Germany, Italy and Sicily. Fellow guitarist John Renbourn has cited Lockran as a key influence on his career: \\"He was a great player and a great guy who took me under his wing and gave me a platform\\" In 1964, he also began an association with Jersey in the Channel Islands, performing extensively on television and radio there. Around April 1965, he changed the spelling of his surname from Loughran to Lockran for stage purposes. His British live schedule at this time included a package tour called 'Kings of the Blues' with Long John Baldry, Alexis Korner and Duffy Power. On 6 August 1965, Lockran, together with Aungier and Rivers, founded 'Folksville', a folk and blues club at the Half Moon, Putney in west London which remains a thriving music venue. In 1966, Lockran secured a recording contract which resulted in the release of his first album Hold On - I'm Coming!, featuring Danny Thompson, Terry Cox and Ray Warleigh. He followed this release with Blues Vendetta in 1967, featuring \\"Jason's Blues\\", written for his three-year-old son. In 1969, The Essential Gerry Lockran was released, and he also featured on the Blues at Sunrise compilation album with Redd Sullivan, and Dave Travis. In the early 1970s, his career was managed by Nigel Thomas, who also represented Joe Cocker, The Grease Band, Faces, Chris Stainton and Juicy Lucy. During 1972 and 1973, Lockran toured the U.S., Canada and Europe as part of package of tours featuring these artists. The U.S. and Canadian tour headlined by Joe Cocker lasted three months, and involved 40 concerts at venues including Madison Square Garden in New York and The Forum in Los Angeles. This was followed by a two-month European tour through France, Holland, Italy, Germany and England. Lockran recorded further albums during this period, Wun (released in 1972),Pinup (released 1973) with Henry McCulloch, Neil Hubbard and others, then Rags to Gladrags (released in 1976) with musicians including Ronnie Wood, Mick Ralphs, Henry McCulloch, Neil Hubbard, Alan Spenner, Philip Chen, Pete Wingfield, Mel Collins, Bruce Rowland and Cliff Aungier. He then concentrated on touring in Europe, performing in Germany, Austria, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, France and Italy, working with blues harmonica players Matt Walsh and Walter Liniger, Hans Theessink and Ian Hunt, with whom he recorded The Shattered Eye (1979) and Total (1980). Around this time he also started to use the relatively new Ovation Legend guitar. During a tour of Belgium and Holland in 1981, he started suffering heart problems, which culminated in a heart attack and stroke, depriving him of the use of his left hand and effectively ending his career as a professional musician. Lockran never played guitar again, but turned to photography and poetry. He took promotional portraits of other musicians including Ralph McTell, Cliff Aungier and the psychedelic indie- group Ozric Tentacles which featured Gerry's nephew, Paul Hankin on percussion. In 1983, a private collection of his poems, Smiles and Tears was privately published by Waddling Duck Press. Discography *Hold On - I'm Coming!

After retiring from the courts, Moore served as the Assistant District Attorney in the Denver District Attorney's Office under Dale Tooley. Early life and education Ostis Otto \\"Otto\\" Moore, named for his father's best friends Otto and Ostis, was born on May 14, 1896 near Floyds Knobs, Indiana in a farmhouse. His parents were David Burke Moore and Charlotte Scott, who developed tuberculosis when Moore was about five years of age. Hoping to improve her health, the family moved to Denver, Colorado in 1901. They lived in a tent in northwest Denver during the first summer. Charlotte Scott Moore died in 1906. Moore's brother and sister were sent to Indiana to live with relatives for one year. They returned to Denver in 1907 and David Moore remarried the following year to the best friend of his mother. Moore left home and supported himself with three paper routes. Moore graduated from South High School, and in 1916 was accepted on a football scholarship to the University of Denver. He was the president of his freshman and sophomore classes and was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He served the military during World War I and returned after the war to the University of Denver, where he received his law degree in 1923. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Denver in 1969. Military After unsuccessfully being able to enlist into the Army Flying Service or the Marine due to a football injury, Moore was drafted into the US Army during World War I and spent 27 months in France. Career Early career In 1924, Moore joined the Denver District Attorney's office, and was charged with prosecuting bootleggers. Moore also investigated and had many incidents with the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which had a strong hold on politics in Denver in the 1920s and 30s. (In 1962, he was interviewed by James Harlan Davis about the KKK. He shared his reminiscences about his experiences during the height of the Ku Klux Klan influence in Colorado.) In 1927, around the time of the Great Depression, he left the district attorney's office and started his own law practice, often accepting produce and other goods as payment. In an effort to help senior citizens, he formed the National Annuity League and published a weekly paper for the elderly called the Bulletin Free Press. He worked with the United States House Committee on Ways and Means in Washington, D.C. on constructing legislation, which later became the Social Security Act. He also traveled the state and gave speeches and lobbied for support for the act. In 1936, his Colorado constitutional amendment was passed. In 1947, Moore wrote a book entitled Mile High Harbor about the movement to provide income for seniors. In 1939, Moore returned to the Denver District Attorney's office. After being defeated in the election for Denver District Attorney in 1940, he returned to private practice. The William Eugene Wymer case was one of several of his murder defenses that received national publicity. Colorado Supreme Court Moore was elected to the Colorado Supreme Court in 1948. He served from 1949 until 1968 on the bench. During his twenty years with the Court, Moore was involved in more than 5,000 decisions and wrote 1,038 opinions. He said of his time as a justice, \\"I particularly remember my dissents. I really relished them; they had more conviction. I may be wrong, but I'm never in doubt.\\" He served three terms as Chief Justice (1957, 1967 and 1968). In 1969, Moore retired from the Colorado Supreme Court. During his service, he wrote the majority opinion in 1968 that set a still-standing precedent that it is unconstitutional to require a defendant to prove insanity. He stated that it was the prosecution's burden to prove guilt or sanity: \\"It cannot be done ‚Ä¶ for the very simple reason that in this state our concept of due process of law prohibits it.\\" Later years In 1970, Moore was asked to write and update the Colorado Criminal Code. In 1971, Moore helped with the creation of the Sam Cary Bar Association, a group for African-American Lawyers. He served as an assistant Denver District Attorney from 1973 to 1983 at the request of the elected Denver District Attorney Dale Tooley. When Tooley resigned to run for Denver mayor in 1983, Moore continued in the office under Norman Early. Moore worked for two more years, and then retired at the age of 89 in May 1985. Personal life Shortly before he was drafted into the Army, Moore met Ruth Dye of Julesburg, Colorado, they corresponded while he was overseas and they were married in 1919. Moore and wife had one child together, Loahna Moore Chandler, who was born in 1926. Moore was a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Freemasons, Phi Delta Phi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He served two terms as president of the University of Denver Alumni Association. He was active in many civic and fraternal organizations. He was an honorary 33 degree Scottish Rite Mason and a member of the El Jebel Shriners in Denver. Moore's wife, Ruth, died in 1986. Moore died of natural causes on December 10, 1990.

History In 1897 Michael Farmer, who had moved into St. Winifred's in Belgrade Road in 1888, built in Avenue Road a house that included a room which could be used as a Catholic chapel. His son Edmund, who was ordained priest in 1894, was given permission by Cardinal Vaughan to say Mass in the room at St. Winifred's on condition that anyone could attend. In 1918 the workshop was altered to provide more space for the growing number of Catholics in Hampton. In 1923 the diocese bought Walnut Tree Cottage in Station Road. Father Harold Burton, who was the first priest to live at the cottage, set up a chapel there to say a daily Mass while the Sunday Mass continued in Avenue Road. In 1927 a wood and asbestos building was erected on concrete foundations at the Station Road site. Although regarded as temporary, it remained in use as the parish church for nearly 60 years. A new church dedicated to Saint Theodore of Canterbury was completed in November 1986. It was officially opened and consecrated on 22 March 1987 by the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Basil Hume. Architecture The church was designed by Austin Winkley. The stained glass windows are by Patrick Reyntiens. The wood sculptures are by David John. Services Mass is held on Saturday evenings, Sunday mornings and (except during August) on Sunday evenings. Weekday masses are also held on Monday, Thursday and Friday mornings and Wednesday evenings.

It has the largest circulation of any architectural magazine in Britain. The RIBA has issued publications since its foundation in 1834, and the magazine evolved from these. It was established in 1893 as the Journal of proceedings of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was the same year renamed Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects before becoming The RIBA Journal. Until the outbreak of the Second World War it appeared fortnightly, then monthly. From 1986 to 1987 it was rebranded The Architect: The Journal of the RIBA, then reverted to its previous title. It is often known simply as the RIBAJ, and its website is ribaj.com. It is a monthly publication in print, but updated daily online, where there is much extra material. It is edited by Hugh Pearman since 2006, with Eleanor Young as executive editor, Jan-Carlos Kucharek as senior editor and Isabelle Priest as assistant editor. Previous editors in order back to 1968 are Amanda Baillieu, John Welsh, Richard Wilcock, Jose Manser, David Pearce, Jonathan Glancey, Peter Murray, Monica Pigeon, Roger Barnard and Malcolm MacEwen. In 2016 the RIBAJ instigated the MacEwen Award, subtitled \\"architecture for the common good\\", named after its campaigning former editor and his town-planner wife Anni MacEwen. Between 1993 and 2008 the magazine was published in a joint venture with an outside publisher, the Builder Group, later absorbed into UBM. The RIBA kept a 25% stake. In 2008 the RIBA once again took 100% ownership, contracting out its publication to Atom Publishing. In 2012 the publication moved to RIBA Enterprises, the commercial wing of the Institute: since 2016 it has been published directly by the Institute. It is not paid for out of RIBA membership subscriptions, operating instead on a self-financing commercial basis through advertising, sponsorship and non- member subscriptions. This arm's length relationship extends to its independent editorial voice, which is by policy not controlled by the Institute. In 2015 the magazine moved into new offices at 76 Portland Place designed by architects Theis + Khan in what had previously been the Institute of Physics building. In 2012 the magazine launched a magazine supplement \\"Products in Practice\\" or PiP, which is published six times a year, edited by Jan-Carlos Kucharek. In 2013 both the RIBAJ and PiP were redesigned by Matt Willey, relaunching in September that year. In 2014 the website, ribaj.com was also redesigned and relaunched. The RIBA Journal operates a \\"digital first\\" policy whereby material is published first online. In January 2019 the cover was redesigned by Linda Byrne of consultancy Alphabetical Order. In 2009 and 2014 the RIBA Journal won the International Building Press National Journalism \\"Magazine of the Year\\" award in its non-weekly category In 2020 it was commended in the Memcom Awards. In March 2016 a critical independent survey of the RIBA by another publication, the Architect's Journal, asked the question \\"What does the RIBA do best?\\" Respondents voted for the RIBA Journal by a clear margin, with a high approval rating.

Early life Onians was born in Liverpool on 11 January 1899; his father was Richard Henry Onians. He served in the 4th South Lancs and the RAF in 1917-1918, and then gained a first class degree in classics at Liverpool University. In 1922 he became a research student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his thesis won the Hare Prize. Academic career Onians was a lecturer at the University of Liverpool in 1925-33, and professor of Classics at the University of Wales in 1933-1935. In 1936 he became Hildred Carlile Professor of Latin at the University of London until his retirement in 1966, and was thereafter an emeritus professor. Origins of European Thought Onians' doctoral research explored concepts in Homer and was awarded the Hare Prize in 1926, a condition being that the work should be published by 1929. He negotiated an extension to this time limit, and although a 1935 draft with the title Origins of Greek & Roman Thought, mainly concerning the body, the mind, the soul and fate is held by the British Library, his book was not published until 1951, as The Origins of European Thought: About the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate (Cambridge University Press).

Jules Brody wrote in 2014: \\"His prodigious learning and intellectual daring put Onians squarely in a class with Damaso Alonso, Ernst- Robert Curtius, Mario Praz, and Leo Spitzer.

These remained under grass for up to 10 years before being ploughed under again, while some eventually became permanent pasturage. It was a process used during the 16th century through the 19th century by \\"which a higher proportion of land was used to support increasing numbers of livestock in many parts of England.\\"Broad, John, \\"Alternate Husbandry and Permanent Pasture in the Midlands, 1650 ‚Äì 1800\\", The Agricultural History Review, Vol. 28, No. 2, pg 77-78, British Agricultural Society; 1980. Its adoption was an important component of the British Agricultural Revolution.Kerridge, Eric, The Agricultural Revolution, Taylor and Francis US; 1967, pg 40. Ley farming is a similar system of growing fodder on fallow plots of arable land, still used today. Description Convertible husbandry was a process that consisted of keeping arable land fallow for long periods as pasture for livestock. This system utilized fertilizer in the form of animal manure. Fertilizer was used in greater quantities due to the increase in animal husbandry and resulted in benefiting crop yields when it was time for tillage. Farmers sowed specific grass seeds to control the quality of their pasture. Historical context Before the 16th and 17th centuries, most farmlands in Britain used simple alternations of tilling and fallowing during different seasons over several years, while livestock was often kept on less productive land and commons. However, in the Midlands the rising population, density of settlements, lack of new areas into which cultivation could expand, and the 15th century enclosures of sheep flocks, led to a system of agriculture with increasing numbers of livestock. A possible factor that influenced the adoption of convertible husbandry was the changing skill levels of workers. In the words of historian Eric Kerridge, the combination of \\"floating of water-meadows, the substitution of up-and-down husbandry for permanent tillage and permanent grass or for shifting cultivation, the introduction of new fallow crops and selected grasses, marsh drainage, manuring, and stock breeding\\" were essential innovations of the British Agricultural Revolution. Although often praised as increasing yields and efficiency, this is debatable. Yields were often poor in the late Middle Ages and approximately equivalent to regular common fields. It was not always adaptable to the type of land or soil at all locations. Kitsikopoulos argues it was the introduction of fodder legumes, such as clover, in the early modern period which eventually truly achieved greater agricultural productivity. Although debatable, many agricultural historians also believe that the introduction of convertible husbandry was brought about with the introduction of the turnip. They argue that \\"the lowly turnip made possible a change in crop rotation which did not require much capital, but which brought about a tremendous rise in agricultural productivity.\\"Timmer, C. Peter, \\"The Turnip, New Husbandry, and The English Agricultural Revolution\\", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 83, No. 3 (Aug., 1969), pp. 375-395 They believe that this \\"fodder\\" crop pushed agriculture in a direction in which \\"alternating\\" husbandry was seen as more efficient than traditional permanent pasture farming and jump-started the improvement of crop rotation and agricultural output versus capital. Although the turnip was popularized by Lord Townshend during the mid-18th century, the use of turnips being grown as fodder was seen as early as the 16th century. Praise Convertible husbandry has been praised as the \\"best way to keep high fertility on both arable and pasture and to retain excellent soil texture and composition.\\"Slicher van Bath, B.H., \\"Agrarian History of Western Europe\\", 1963, pp 249-54. According to one author, the rotation it provided between pasture and arable land \\"not only produced the same amount of grain on a much reduced area, but broke the agrarian cycle of diminished returns by allowing more sheep and cattle to be kept, animals whose dung maintained\\" fertility.

While still at school, Raithel was swept up in the excitement of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was subsequently awarded the coveted Blood Order, even though he was not a member of the Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943. Raithel subsequently commanded a regiment of the newly formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and led it during fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia. Raithel was seriously wounded in mid-1944 and was replaced. When a new Waffen-SS division was to be raised in June 1944, the cadre was provided by the 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander. The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation, but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. Raithel quickly suppressed a mutiny by the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the division in mid-October 1944, but it was disbanded and its reliable troops were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. Raithel was then appointed to command a regiment of 6th SS Mountain Division Nord in Alsace, where his regiment fought the United States Army. He received a serious head wound during fighting northeast of Frankfurt in early April 1945 and was captured by the Americans. Raithel recovered from his wounds and had a career in agriculture after the war, working in South Africa for many years. He returned to Bavaria when he retired and earned a doctorate of history from the University of Munich. His interest in mountaineering continued and he regularly climbed in the Alps into his seventies. He maintained contact with his former comrades from the 6th SS Division, attending many reunions. On 12 September 1990 at the age of 82, he was returning home from the Semmering Pass in eastern Austria when he was killed in a traffic accident. Early life Born Helmuth Hans Walter Paul Raithel in Ingolstadt, Kingdom of Bavaria, a federated state of the German Empire, on 9 April 1907, he was the second son of a Bavarian Army officer. Raithel attended primary school then the Wittelsbacher-Gymnasium M√ºnchen (secondary school) until 1926. On 9 November 1923 at the age of 16, Raithel was walking his bicycle in Munich when he stumbled across the Beer Hall Putsch being led by Adolf Hitler. Swept up in the excitement, he fell in with a group led by Freikorps veteran Gerhard Ro√übach. After shots were fired, he took cover with some of the group in an alley, one of whom wrote down Raithel's name as one of the \\"party faithful\\" present that day. He was subsequently awarded the highly prized Nazi Party Blood Order, although he apparently did not have any political beliefs and was not a member of the Party at the time. After he successfully completed secondary school in early 1926, he joined the Reichswehr as an offizieranw√§rter (officer cadet) on 1 April 1926. He was posted to the 19th Infantry Regiment during which he spent four years commanding a Gebirgsj√§ger (mountain infantry) platoon. While he was with the regiment, the Reichswehr was absorbed by the Wehrmacht. Now part of the Gebirgs Brigade, Raithel gained experience as a signals officer and company commander, and was promoted to Hauptmann (captain). With the creation of the 1st Gebirgs Division in April 1938 he was appointed as the adjutant of the 99th Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment. At the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was an instructor at the mountain infantry school at Fulpmes in the Stubai Alps. He was married and he and his wife had two daughters. World War II Greece and Finland In August 1940, Raithel was transferred from instructional duties to command a battalion of the newly formed 6th Gebirgs Division, which had been deployed to France on occupation duty in anticipation of involvement in the planned invasion of the United Kingdom, Operation Sealion. When Sealion was abandoned, the division was sent first to Poland then in spring 1941 took part in the invasion of Greece. During the Battle of Metaxas Line in early April 1941, the division, led by Generalmajor (Brigadier) Ferdinand Sch√∂rner, breached the formidable Greek defences by crossing a snow-covered mountain pass considered inaccessible by the Greeks. This enabled the division to cut the rail line to Thessaloniki. Raithel was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class in late April 1941. Following the defeat of Greece and its allies, the division was deployed to Lapland in northern Finland in September 1941. Raithel remained as a battalion commander with the 143rd Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment of the division in Finland and was promoted to Major on 1 November 1941. Sch√∂rner became Raithel's mentor during their service with the 6th Gebirgs Division. In January 1942 he was awarded the German Cross in Gold. In August 1942 he was transferred to the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army Headquarters) reserve pool for an extended period, during which he returned to the mountain infantry school then served briefly with the 133rd Fortress Division on Crete. He was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 October 1943. Yugoslavia alt=a map of the NDH highlighting an area in the eastern part of Bosnia where the division operated In 1943, his mentor Sch√∂rner, now a General der Gebirgstruppe (lieutenant general), advised him to transfer to the quickly expanding Waffen-SS where regimental command would be easier to come by, particularly as his Blood Order was especially prized in the Waffen-SS. Raithel subsequently transferred to the Waffen-SS (and Allgemeine SS) on 30 November 1943, but still did not join the Nazi Party. He was immediately appointed to command a regiment of the newly formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), the rank-and-file of which were mostly Bosnian Muslims. Initially appointed as an SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel) commanding the 28th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment, he oversaw the completion of his regiment's training at the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) then led his regiment to fight the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in February 1944. The division was given the primary role of securing around of territory (the designated security zone) in north-eastern Bosnia within the NDH. The security zone encompassed the Posavina, Semberija and Majevica regions between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Spreƒça rivers. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) settlements in the Syrmia region to the north. Between March and June 1944 Raithel commanded his regiment during several major operations, including what may have been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of the war, Operation Maibaum (Maypole). He was promoted to SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) on 1 April 1944. Raithel led his regiment well, resulting in a serious wound in June 1944. On 11 June 1944, he was recommended for an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment, but it was not approved. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944, the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone. When a second Bosnian Muslim Waffen-SS division was to be raised in June 1944, the cadre was provided by the 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander. The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation, but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. The Bosnian Muslim members of the division mutinied on 17 October 1944, but Raithel quickly gained control over the situation. Following the mutiny, the division was formally disbanded on 31 October and reliable elements were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. Germany After a short time convalescing as part of the SS F√ºhrungshauptamt (SS headquarters) reserve pool, Raithel was appointed to command the 11th Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord in December 1944. In early January 1945, the division was located around Pirmasens near the French-Reich border, reeling from their losses in what was the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front, Operation Nordwind. Committed to a series of desperate counterattacks against the United States Army XV Corps, on one occasion Raithel's regiment infiltrated the American positions, surrounding five US infantry companies and taking 450 prisoners of war. The fighting depleted the already understrength regiment, with one company numbering only eight men by 20 January. The commander of one of the US battalions they fought in January 1945 ruefully described Raithel's regiment as, \\"the best men we ever ran into, extremely aggressive, and impossible to capture. There was no driving them out, for they fought until they were killed\\". After a quiet period in February 1945 absorbing replacements, the division was withdrawn from the defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had been converted into a kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsj√§ger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later they were fighting their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and the rest of what remained of the division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated over the next few days and weeks and were captured by the Americans. Personal life Raithel recovered from his wounds and had a career in agriculture after the war, working in South Africa for many years. He returned to Bavaria when he retired and earned a doctorate of history from the University of Munich. He continued with mountaineering and regularly climbed in the Alps into his seventies. He maintained contact with his former comrades from the 6th SS Division Nord and attended many reunions. On 12 September 1990 at the age of 82, he was returning home from the Semmering Pass in eastern Austria when he was killed in a traffic accident.

Critical response The three seasons of Attack on Titan were met with critical acclaim with praise for the storyline, animation, action sequences, soundtrack, and dub performances, though some criticized its dark tone. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network was sharply critical of the first two episodes of the anime adaptation. He did praise the show for \\"making giants freaky again\\", but added that \\"bringing back the terror of the fee-fi-fo-fum set does not a good show make\\". Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he \\"clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant.\\" However, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it \\"is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals\\", and \\"an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next.\\" Carlo Santos noted that \\"few [apocalyptic action shows] get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does\\". Santos described it as \\"a masterpiece of death and destruction\\" after watching only the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the \\"intense, impactful first episode\\" despite his feeling that it has \\"limited animation\\". Martin also compared Attack on Titan vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore. John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one \\"that anime fans should not miss.\\" Maya Phillips of New York magazine and Vulture praised the uniqueness of the series as she states, \\"In our current age of terrifying dystopian realities, it's hard to find a dystopian show with something new to deliver - and yet here it is.\\" As for Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian, he praised the animation of the series as \\"Spellbinding... It's all wonderfully acrobatic and intense.\\" Regarding the climactic episodes of the third season's second half, Manga.Tokyo called Isayama a \\"genius\\" for the way Attack on Titan handled the revelation about the Grisha's past linked the events with the beginning of the story of the manga. Crunchyroll listed Attack on Titan in their \\"Top 25 best anime of the 2010s\\". IGN and Polygon also listed Attack on Titan among the best anime series of the 2010s.
