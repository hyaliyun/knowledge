Background Born as June Dorothea Grabiner, she was the daughter of Harry Grabiner, vice-president of the Chicago White Sox in the 1930s. She had dark brown hair and green eyes. She stood 5'4\\" tall. She attended Parkside Grammar School in Chicago and the Starrett School for Girls. She later studied at UCLA. When she returned to Illinois, she matriculated at the University of Chicago. Marriage On January 3, 1940, Travis married Fred Friedlob. They had two daughters, Cathy and June. Friedlob died in May 1979 in Chicago. Screen actress comedian Joe E. Brown in Earthworm Tractors (1936) A Paramount Pictures vice-president noticed her in Miami, Florida, at a White Sox exhibition game. He offered Travis a screen test when she came to Pasadena, California, where the major league baseball team trained. The first time she was presented with a screen contract, she suffered from screen fright and turned it down. She returned to Chicago and school and the next winter, accepted a film studio offer in Palm Springs, California. Travis made her screen debut in Stranded (1935), a film which starred Kay Francis and George Brent. She played the role of Mary Rand. She followed this with a part in Not On Your Life (1935), with Warren William and Claire Dodd. Howard Hawks directed her in Ceiling Zero (1936), a Warner Bros. feature. In preparation for her role, Travis learned flying, navigation, and parachute jumping from Amelia Earhart. The aviator gave her instructions in September 1935, including the film stars James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. Also in 1936, she portrayed secretary Della Street to Perry Mason as played by Ricardo Cortez in The Case of the Black Cat. Travis (second from right) with Pat O'Brien, Martha Tibbetts, James Cagney and Stuart Erwin in Ceiling Zero (1936) She was Ronald Reagan's leading lady in his first movie, Love Is on the Air, in 1937. Her most notable film role was likely in The Star (1952) starring Bette Davis. Travis became known as the Queen of the B-movies on the Warner Bros. lot. Later, she said that if she had remained in Hollywood two more years, she would have been a star. However, following three years, she came home to Chicago for Christmas with her parents. She did not return to making motion pictures. Travis stopped regularly appearing in films after 1938, though she made minor appearances in The Star and Monster a Go-Go. Radio Travis played Stormy Wilson Curtis in the radio soap opera Girl Alone and Bernice in Arnold Grimm's Daughter, another soap opera. Stage actress By the late 1970s, Travis was performing on stage. She admitted that the transition from acting on film was a difficult one. Death On April 14, 2008, Travis, age 93, died in a hospital of complications from a stroke she suffered weeks earlier. She is buried in Chicago's Oak Woods Cemetery.

It operates the civilian network of marine VHF radio, medium frequency and Navtex transmitters and five coast radio stations: Tj√∏me Radio, Rogaland Radio, Flor√∏ Radio, Bod√∏ Radio and Vard√∏ Radio. The agency also issues licenses for ship radios, including callsigns and Maritime Mobile Service Identities, and issues recreational and commercial radio operator certificates. Telenor Maritim Radio is based in Bergen, has 100 employees and a revenue of NOK 160 million Norwegian krone (NOK). History S√∏rv√•gen and S√∏rv√•gen Radio The Royal Norwegian Navy was the first user of wireless telegraphy in Norway, when they purchased two Slaby‚ÄìArco units in 1901. They were installed on Eidsvold and Frithjof and tested the equipment out of the main base, Karljohansvern.Rinde: 377 Tests the first year failed to reach F√¶rder Lighthouse, but when moved to Jel√∏ya and the equipment recalibrated the following summer, the tests were successful. Additional sets were installed, especially after wireless telegraphy's successfully implementation in the Japanese Navy during the 1904‚Äì05 Russo- Japanese War. The Ministry of Defence approved the construction of two radio stations, Tj√∏me Radio near T√∏nsberg and Flekker√∏y Radio near Kristiansand, in 1905. These and later ship radios were delivered by Telefunken. This was followed up with including telegraphy as part of the training at the Norwegian Naval Academy and the establishment of a workshop at Karljohansvern, allowing the navy to repair and build their own stations. All coastal defense ships and torpedo boats had received wireless stations by 1909.Rinde: 378 The Telegraphy Administration took contact with the Marconi Company in 1899 to inquire about purchasing wireless systems. The thought had been to use a wireless connection to places where laying a cable would be prohibitively expensive, but high license costs caused them to dismiss a purchase. The agency established a cooperation with the navy in 1901,Rinde: 381 and the following year the decided to launch a program to establish wireless connections to the islands of R√∏st, V√¶r√∏y, Tr√¶na and Grip. R√∏st and V√¶r√∏y were selected for a trial to connected them to S√∏rv√•gen, based on the high costs of laying a cable in Moskstraumen, estimated at five times the cost of a wireless system. The system would also act as a trial to select a manufacturer. Marconi was disregarded because of its high price, but both Telefunken and Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de T√©l√©graphes & T√©l√©phones sans fils systems were installed in 1903 on a trial basis.Rinde: 382 Green Harbor, the initial site of Spitsbergen Radio R√∏st was selected as the initial site and AEG started installing the system in 1905. When R√∏st Radio and S√∏rv√•gen Radio opened in 1906, it was the second wireless telegraphy system in the world connected to the wired telegraphy network.Rinde: 385 Following the decision to create an international conversion on wireless telegraphy, resulting in Parliament deciding in 1907 that a permit would be required for a ship to operate a radio.Rinde: 388 The law was also specified so that private and municipal entities could not operate their own wireless network.Kallelid: 41 By then two Norwegian merchant ships were equipped with radios: Ellis and Preston. Both were owned by D. & A. Irgens and operating in American waters and had been equipped by the shipper, the United Fruit Company. The first ship in Norwegian waters was Det Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskap's Kong Harald in 1909. Two years there were 29 Norwegian ships with ship radios.Rinde: 389 The navy's radio stations at Tj√∏me and Flekker√∏y were taken over by the Telegraphy Administration in 1910, free of charge.Rinde: 394 The conditions were that the navy would have full control of all coast radio stations during war, that the navy's telegrams have the highest priority after distress and that they be consulted for further development of the network.Rinde: 396 V√¶r√∏y Radio opened the same year. The Telegraphy Administration launched a national plan in 1910 for building a network of coast radio stations, which would cover the coastline and included plans for a transatlantic service and a radio on Spitsbergen. The politician's main motivation were not tied to Norway having the world's third-largest merchant marine, but rather tied to the use by fisheries and coastal traffic. Bergen Radio on Rundemanen The Arctic Coal Company, based at Longyear City on Spitsbergen, took contact with the Telegraphy Administration in 1910 and requested that there be established a radio telegraphy network between the archipelago and Norway. Svalbard was then terra nullus and not part of Norway. To avoid an American company establishing a station on territory the authorities hoped would become part of Norway, the proposal was passed after three weeks' administrative and political proceedings.Rinde: 401 This resulted in Spitsbergen Radio (from 1920 Svalbard Radio) and Ing√∏y Radio being established.Kallelid: 43 The service made it popular to install radios on larger fishing vessels and allowed weather observations to be sent to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.Kallelid: 45 The Telegraphy Administration proposed in 1911 that all larger passenger and post-carrying ships should be required to have a radio, but the proposal was rejected by the government.Rinde: 390 Bergen Radio was originally proposed as a joint venture between the Telegraphy Administration and the navy, whereby the former would build the station and the latter would operate it. Instead the station was built and operated by the civilian agency. It was placed on top of the mountain Rundemanen, at above mean sea level.Rinde: 397 With a 5-kilowatt transmitter, this allowed it to send telegrams to ships mid-way in the Atlantic. For the first year after it opened in 1912, it sent 1,500 telegrams.Kallelid: 42 Bergen and R√∏st Radios were able to guide Italia to Narvik during a storm in 1913, and in 1915 Irma was able to help the drifting Iris after an SOS had been sent. Jel√∏y Radio in 1929 The Telegraphy Administration proposed in 1913 that all ship radios should be operated by the agency.Rinde: 392 Motivations included a desire to accelerate installation of such systems, difficulties controlling systems, which was at the time a problem with shortcomings on private telephone networks, and to avoid private monopolies. The proposal was dismissed by the government For the coast stations there were no proposals of permitting private installations.Rinde: 393 Funding was kept down, as it was competing with grants to expand the telephony network. Lack of coast stations caused ship-owners to not install ship radios, which again caused the authorities to down-prioritize construction of coast stations. Plans for a direct connection between Scandinavia and the United States was launched in 1910. Prices on transatlantic telegrams were high because of transit fares and made Norway dependent on foreign cable companies. A sea cable was estimated to cost between 30 and 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK), while a wireless connection proposed in 1912 was estimated to cost 2 million. Early estimates showed that the project would not be profitable.Kallelid: 47 The plans were passed in Parliament, but because of a slight delay, construction was placed on hold during World War I (1914‚Äì1918), and Stavanger Radio did not open until 1919.Kallelid: 48 The spark-gap transmitter created interference with other American radio stations and was soon out of date. A new NOK 1.5-million vacuum tube transmitter was installed in 1922 and the receiver station, originally at N√¶rb√∏, was moved to Fornebu in 1925. Jel√∏y Radio was created a few years later and Stavanger Radio was closed.Kallelid: 50 Flekker√∏y Radio in 1929 By 1920 there were 149 Norwegian-registered ships with wireless telegraphy, a number which doubled the following year following a British requirement to have a ship radio to call at British ports. Focus shifted towards closing the \\"radiofree gaps\\" to allow continuous coverage along the coast. Utsira Radio opened in 1919 and could cover all of the North Sea, including those areas which could not be reached from Bergen. In 1920 Kristiania Radio (renamed Oslo Radio in 1924) and in 1921 Fauske Radio opened as transit radio stations; Svolv√¶r Radio opened in connection with Fauske.Kallelid: 51 Grip Radio opened in 1920, but only had sufficient capacity to communicate with Kristiansund Radio.Rafto: 391 Bergen Radio became the first station to receive a vacuum tube transmitter in 1922. Because they produced continuous wave, Bergen Radio started transmitting a twice-daily audio weather forecast, in addition to the telegraphy weather forecasts. The first ships with vacuum receivers were the Norwegian America Line's Bergensfjord and Stavangerfjord. Vads√∏ Radio opened in 1923 and could reach the White Sea with its vacuum tube transmitters.Rafto: 520 √Ölesund Radio opened in 1925,Elveland: 8 the same year as duplex operations began at Bergen with a receiver station in Fyllingsdalen.Rafto: 524 Medico services were launched out of Bergen Radio from 1923, a free service which allowed for medical diagnosis and treatment advice from physicians at Haukeland Hospital.Rafto: 538 Isfjord Radio in 2007 High frequency (HF) services were introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of private telegrams by seamen.Kallelid: 53 Implementation was slow: by 1935 HF transmitters had been installed on about 100 Norwegian ships, and 450 ships by 1940. Wireless telephony was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast.Kallelid: 54 In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by wireless transmission.Rafto: 536 From 1927 new spark-gap transmitters over 300 watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940. Implementation of vacuum tube transmitters was slow: by 1937, 600 of 1000 Norwegian ships with a ship radio still had spark-gap transmitters. The coast stations all received vacuum tube transmitters by 1935.Rafto: 521 Jan Mayen Radio opened in 1927,Rafto: 532 Trondheim RadioRafto: 528 and Hammerfest Radio opened in 1929Rafto: 530 followed by Isfjord Radio on Svalbard in 1933,Rafto: 531 Bj√∏rn√∏ya Radio on Svalbard in 1934, and R√∏rvik Radio in 1935. The Telegraphy Administration established six radio stations on the east coast of Greenland in 1932: Karlsbakk, Myggbukta, Jonsbu, Storfjord, Torgilsbu and Finnbus. These were used for a combination of meteorological reports and serving the fishing fleet. The first two radio stations to close were R√∏st, Fauske and Flekker√∏y, all in 1938. Flekker√∏y was replaced by Farsund Radio, while Fauske was replaced with Bod√∏ Radio. The same year Flor√∏ Radio opened.Rafto: 527 There were thirteen operational coast stations in 1939,Espelid: 157 and from the mid-1930s these were all manned around the clock.Espelid: 158 Svalbard Radio in 2012 The German occupation of Norway during World War II (1940‚Äì45) caused a heavy wear on the radio equipment,Rafto: 592 and by the end of the war the coast radio network was non-operational. √òrlandet Radio opened in 1952. Norway had twenty-seven coast radio station in 1953, of which five were located in Svalbard and Jan Mayen. Twelve only had a telephony service, while the remainder had both telegraphy and telephony. The maritime VHF radio system was introduced in 1956. Because of the limited range of VHF compared to MF, an additional forty unmanned stations were established, connected with a manned station with relays. By 1957 there were 1,300 Norwegian ships with HF transmitters and Bergen Radio handled half a million telegrams per year. There were 5,000 telephone calls transmitted via the coast radio stations. The demand exceeded the capacity, so the Telegraphy Administration decided to build a new main HF telegraphy station. Rogaland Radio was located in Sandnes, south of Stavanger, with the receiver and offices located at H√∏yland and the sender located at N√¶rb√∏, away.Kallelid: 55 The facilities cost NOK 6 million and also took over Stavanger Radio's MF services. Up to nineteen operators were on duty at any given time. Its traffic peaked at half a million annual telegrams during the first decade, but the experienced a significant drop.Kallelid: 56 An important reason was the 1971 introduction of the radio telex, which could be handled automatically instead of by an operator. An important driver of the telex traffic was the petroleum industry in the North Sea. Telex traffic peaked at 550,000 sent minutes in the late 1970s. Radio telegraphy and radio telex was from then gradually replaced with Inmarsat, a communications satellite system, with Eik Earth Station in Rogaland being Europe's first ground station for Inmarsat.Kallelid: 57 Historic radio from Tj√∏me Radio on display in T√∏nsberg The coast stations has functioned as de facto rescue coordination centers. As more public and private resources were made available for search and rescue missions, problems with coordination became evident. Thus the government appointed a commission in the mid-1950s to look into the need for a coordinating body. It made its recommendations in 1959, which were implemented in 1970 with the creation of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway (JRCC SN) and the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway (JRCC NN). The establishment of relayed VHF stations proved the reliability of unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees.Elveland: 43 One of the advantages of remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often from other parts of the country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the coast station.Elveland: 44 The offices of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway and Bod√∏ Radio in downtown Bod√∏ R√∏rvik Radio closed in 1986.Elveland: 47 During the late 1980s the cost of operating the coast radios had escalated to more than NOK 100 million. To cut costs, √Ölesund, Hammerfest and Harstad Radio were closed in 1990 and all dedicated emergency listening rooms were closed in 1992, saving the agency NOK 23 million per year. All radio telegrams were from 1992 relayed via Rogaland Radio. The coast radios saw half its traffic disappear between 1983 and 1990. Jan Mayen Radio was remote controlled form Bod√∏ Radio via satellite from 1994. With the deregulation of the telecom market in 1998, Telenor demanded that the government compensate NOK 50 million for the deficits of operating the coast radio stations. The radio stations were upgraded in 2000, allowing the JRCCs direct access to the emergency channels. The five-member Ellingsen Committee, appointed by the government, recommended in November 2001 that the nine remaining coast radio stations be merged into two units and co-located with the two JRCCs. The rationale was costs savings and the existing possibilities of routing operations to adjacent stations and that fewer stations would not give less safety. The unmanning of three stations, Farsund, Bergen and √òrlandet, was carried out in 2004. The telephone number 120 was introduced on 1 February 2005, allowing recreational boaters to reach their closest coast radio station by mobile telephone. Telenor Maritim Radio also introduced a series of commercial services through the number; this was criticized by the JRCCs, who stated that the marketing could raise doubt as to whether contacting a coast radio station in an emergency was a free service or not. Svalbard Radio was remotely controlled from Bod√∏ Radio from 2006. Rogaland and Bod√∏ were moved and co-located with the JRCCs in Sola and Bod√∏. Tj√∏me Radio moved to Horten in 2008. Coast radio Map of Telenor Maritim Radio's network of VHF, MF and Navtex transmitters, as well as manned and former coast radio stations Regulations of the coast radio stations and services is regulated through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) of 1974, the International Maritime Organization's 1979 convention on sea rescue and the Maritime Act of 1994. The responsibility lies with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, which has delegated it to Telenor Maritim Radio. The public requirement to listen to emergency channels is the responsibility of the coast radio stations. These are also responsible to record messages of acute pollution at sea and transmission of navigational warnings. Telenor operates five manned coast radio stations: Tj√∏me Radio in Horten, Rogaland Radio in Sola, Flor√∏ Radio, Bod√∏ Radio and Vard√∏ Radio. Rogaland and Bod√∏ are physically co-located with the respective joint rescue coordination center. The border between Tj√∏me and Rogaland Radios goes at S√∏gne, between Rogaland and Flor√∏ Radios at Fedje, between Flor√∏ and Bod√∏ Radios at Vikna, and between Bod√∏ and Vard√∏ Radios at Troms√∏. The coast radio stations are responsible for listening to the emergency channels and relaying relevant information to the JRCCs, issue safety and navigational warnings, alert other vessels of distress situations and manage medical advice and commercial communications. Coast stations can also be reached via mobile telephones where there is service. The stations handled 4,189 resistances in 2012, consisting of 2,402 commercial vessels, 1,321 recreational boats, 348 fishing vessels and 118 others. As of 2012 Telenor Maritim Radio operates 154 VHF stations and 32 MF stations. MF stations are operated out of Tj√∏me, Farsund, Sola, Bergen, Flor√∏, √Ölesund, √òrland, Sandnessj√∏en, Bod√∏, Andenes, Troms√∏, Hammerfest, Berlev√•g, Vard√∏, Jan Mayen, Bj√∏rn√∏ya and Longyearbyen. Navtex transmitters are located at Tj√∏me, Sola, √òrland, Bod√∏, Vard√∏ and Svalbard. In addition to the coast, there is a VHF transmitter with coverage for most of the lake Mj√∏sa. VHF stations are also located on offshore installations. Telenor Maritim Radio offers VHF Data, a wireless Internet connection provided via the VHF channels and offers the same coverage as the VHF radio. The Norwegian Armed Forces have a military network of about 35 VHF stations along the coast. Inspection and licensing Approval of a ship radio is required as part of the vessels classification. Two agencies in Norway are approved for radio inspection: Telenor Maritim Radio and Emil Langva. Telenor has radio inspectors at ten locations: Oslo, Stavanger, Haugesund, Bergen, √Ölesund, Trondheim, Bod√∏, Svolv√¶r, Troms√∏ and Hammerfest. The division conducts two thousand inspects per year on Norwegian-registered ships and two hundred inspections per year on foreign vessels on behalf of classification societies and foreign agencies. Issuing of ship radio licenses are awarded by Telenor Maritim Radio for ships registered in Norwegian Ship Register and the Norwegian International Ship Register, based on a contract with the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority. This includes other facilities using the maritime frequencies, such as offshore installations, schools and stores. The responsibility includes licensing Inmarsat terminals, and awarding callsigns and Maritime Mobile Service Identities. There were 37,234 licensed vessels in 2012. For vessels operating under SOLAS regulations, Telenor Maritim Radio issues Restricted Operator's Certificate (ROC) for vessels entire operating within the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System A1 areas (VHF coverage) and a General Operator's Certificate (GOC) for operating in all areas. The agency also issues Short Range Certificates (SRC) and Long Range Certificates (LRC) for recreational users. It operates a course center at Rogaland Radio where it offers ROC, GOC and SRC courses. Telenor Maritim Radio issued 4,876 certificates in 2012.

Based in St. Louis, Missouri, SSM Health owns hospitals, pediatric medical centers, outpatient centers, clinics, surgery centers, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, physician offices, emergency centers, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, home care, and hospice.  History of SSM Health  SSM Health traces its roots to 1872, when Mother Mary Odilia Berger and four other sisters came to St. Louis from Germany, after caring for sick and wounded soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War. Facing religious persecution in Germany, they came to the United States. When they arrived in St. Louis they began providing nursing care to people in their own homes. That winter, when a smallpox epidemic hit St. Louis, the sisters cared for the sick and dying. For a short time, people referred to them as the Smallpox Sisters. In 1874, the congregation received its formal name: the Sisters of St. Mary (SSM) from the parish where their convent was located, St. Mary of Victories near the riverfront in St. Louis. Five years after their arrival in St. Louis, the sisters borrowed $16,000, to open their first hospital, St. Mary‚Äôs Infirmary. Almost 60 percent of their patients were unable to pay for their health care services. Account ledgers from this time identify those who were unable to pay for their services as an ‚ÄúODL,‚Äù a designation that stood for ‚ÄúOur Dear Lord‚Äôs.‚Äù During this time, the sisters relied on God to provide for their needs as they cared for the poor. Most of the health care facilities that today belong to SSM Health were previously part of a group of hospitals owned by the Sisters of St. Mary and centrally governed, but not centrally managed. In the mid-1980s, the sponsoring congregation decided to reorganize its hospitals into a system of centrally managed health care providers, and SSM Health was created in 1986. Today the system is managed by a team of professionals‚Äîboth lay and religious‚Äîand governed by members of the sponsoring congregation as well as by laypersons from the communities served by its facilities. In 2012, SSM Health stated that it was 'disappointed with the contraceptive mandate' regarding being legally forced to cover such items by the Affordable Care Act, against Catholic freedom of conscience. In 2013, Dean Health System, a large multi-specialty physician group and health plan, finalized a deal to merge Dean and its subsidiaries, including Dean Health Plan, into SSM Health. The merger became effective on September 1, 2013, after all necessary regulatory approvals were received. In 2018, SSM rebranded its Oklahoma hospitals. The health system's physician's group in the state became known as SSM Health Medical Group. Also in 2018, SSM Health acquired Agnesian HealthCare from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. SSM Health is sponsored by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary and is one of the largest Catholic hospital systems in the United States.

Geography  Altendorf lies in the Oberfranken-West (Upper Franconia West) Region.  Constituent communities  The namesake centre of Altendorf has 1,544 inhabitants while the outlying amalgamated centre of Seu√üling (or Seussling) has 542 (as of 1 January 2003). The community also has two traditional rural land units, known in German as Gemarkungen, also named Altendorf and Seu√üling (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby).  History  Before Secularization, Altendorf belonged to the High Monastery at Bamberg. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today's community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (‚ÄúCommunity Edict‚Äù) of 1818. Many finds from Celtic times point to early settlement. While Altendorf was first mentioned as a Slavic round village in 1096, the outlying centre of Seu√üling had already been mentioned as a church village by 800. Here stood one of Charlemagne‚Äôs 14 Slavic churches (Slavenkirchen). Seu√üling's parochial area reached well into the Steigerwald (forest).  Religion  The Catholic church in Altendorf is affiliated with Sankt Bartholom√§us, Buttenheim. Also within the community is the Catholic parish of Sankt-Sigismund Seu√üling. The parish church of St. Sigismund received its patronage when Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor had the saint's bones transferred from Saint-Maurice in the Swiss canton of Valais to Prague. The shrine was also set down in Seu√üling, holding one of the dead king's arms as a relic in the parish church. Denominational breakdown of the inhabitants: *Roman Catholic: 1,555 *Evangelical: 287 *other: 240  Population development  Within community limits, 1,274 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 1,542 in 1987 and 2,006 in 2000. In June 2007, 1,963 people lived in Altendorf. The population growth between 1961 and 1971 amounted to 80% owing to the community's favourable location for transport links and widespread building development.  Politics  The mayor is Karl-Heinz Wagner of the CSU. The community council is made up of 14 members, listed here by party or voter community affiliation, and also with the number of seats that each holds: * CSU: 4 * Unabh√§ngiger B√ºrgerblock (UBB): 3 * Zum Wohle der B√ºrger (ZWdB): 3 * Freie W√§hler Seu√üling (FWS): 3 * Aktive B√ºrger (AKB): 1 In 1999, municipal tax revenue, converted to euros, amounted to ‚Ç¨1,002,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to ‚Ç¨316,000.  Coat of arms  Altendorf's arms might heraldically be described thus: Under the chief gules, therein a key argent per fess the bit downturned, in Or a horse trippant sable. The German blazon, however, does not mention that the horse is trippant (standing with one forefoot raised), nor does it mention that the key's bit is downturned, but the arms are usually so executed. The black horse is already seen on a silver coin found in the lands settled by the Celts and believed to have been struck about 80 BC. The silver key in the chief (band at the top of a coat of arms) refers to the connection to the old noble family of Schl√ºsselberg (‚ÄúSchl√ºssel‚Äù literally means ‚Äúkey‚Äù in German).  Economy and infrastructure  According to official statistics, there were no workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in agriculture or forestry in 1998. In producing businesses there were 616, and in trade and transport 19. In other areas, 17 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls are employed, and 689 such workers work from home. Seven employed in processing businesses (as well as mining and quarrying). Four businesses are in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were 19 agricultural operations with a working area of 393 ha, of which 329 ha was cropland and 64 ha was meadowland.

The community's name derives from Bischofsberg. Supposedly, the Bishop (Bischof in German) of W√ºrzburg charged the community's founder with establishing a base at the important confluence of the rivers Regnitz and Main.  Geography  Bischberg lies in the Upper Franconia West planning region. The nearest railway stations are the ones in Oberhaid, Bamberg and Hallstadt. The highest point of Bischberg is the Vogelberg hill with 320 m.  Constituent communities  Bischberg's constituent communities are Bischberg, Rothof, Trosdorf, T√ºtschengereuth and Weipelsdorf, each with an adjoining traditional rural land unit, known in German as a Gemarkung.

The most important landowner was the Michelsberg Monastery, which in the 18th century also held the local overlordship. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today's community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (‚ÄúCommunity Edict‚Äù) of 1818.  Timber floating  Bischberg's location at the forks of the rivers Regnitz and Main led to the community's becoming an important way station for the log drivers from the Frankenwald (forest). In log driving history, Bischberg is called the ‚Äúsecond stop‚Äù. The first stop for log drives coming from the Kronach area was Schw√ºrbitz. The next station was then Bischberg. As the Regnitz's outflow into the Main strengthened this river considerably, twenty-seven of the small rafts that had been driven here downstream could be lashed together to make a St√ºck (‚Äúpiece‚Äù, meaning a great timber raft), which could then be driven farther down the Main, and then by way of the Rhine all the way to the Netherlands. Later developments in road and railway transport, however, ended the need for these drives, and timber floating died out.

He is also known by the name Professor Dr. Girma Amente Ghebresillasie. Life He is the son of Dejazmatch Yohannes Iyasu (1915-1977).Genealogy Through his father, Lij Girma is a grandson of Lij Iyasu, Emperor-designate of Ethiopia from 1913 until 1916 when he was deposed by Dejazmach Teferi Mekonen with the support of the British, French and Italian Ministers (Thesiger, Brice and Coli) and excommunicated by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which deprived him of his rights of succession. Iyasu was the son of Negus Mikael of Sion, and matrilineal grandson of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. Lij Girma Yohannes grew up in the monasteries of Asebot, Dega Estifanos (Lake Tana) and Debre Damo. At the age of 7 he left Ethiopia in 1968 with the help of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, grandson of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany in collaboration with Lij Mered and Lij Mesfin Birru (sons of Ras Birru Woldegabriel) plus the then Governor of Djibouti. He received his education at the London School of Economics (United Kingdom), University of California, Berkeley (USA) and Universities of Heidelberg, Bielefeld and Bremen (Germany). He has also worked as an instructor and researcher at the University of Bremen,Diaspora Forum University of Miami, London School of Economics and Haramaya University (as chairman of the governing board of the university). Iyasuist claimant Lij Girma claims that not only the governments of Empress Zewditu and Emperor Haile Selassie were illegitimate, but also that Haile Selassie himself was too far down the line of succession to claim the crown according to the rule of the Ethiopian royal house since Menelik I. As such, as a grandson of Lij Iyasu, he claims to be the leading core member of the Solomonic dynasty from the house of David and rightful monarch of Ethiopia.Lij Iyasu Michael, Emperor-Designate (Iyasu V) This however is not based or supported by any constitutional or traditional procedure, since Ethiopia did not receive its first modern constitution addressing order of succession until 1931, and the old traditional male line succession would have gone to Dejazmach Taye Gulilat after Menelik II and not to Lij Iyasu; Lij Iyasu, Ras Kassa and Emperor Haile Selassie were all descended from the royal house through female lines, and had roughly equivalent claims to each other. The claim of the Iyasuist line is based solely on the legal will of Emperor Menelik II which designated Lij Iyasu as his heir, and which opponents argue was cancelled by Lij Iyasu's excommunication. The Iyasuist claims are challenged by the excommunication of Lij Iyasu (Iyasu V) by Mattheos X, Abuna of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, and the fact that Iyasu declined to be crowned, citing the fact that he did not want to occupy a higher office before he united the Ethiopians and throw out the Italians from Eritrea. He was the founder of the first Ethiopian government auditing systems, municipality, the police force and judicial reforms. He was the first monarch to build Mosques for the neglected and highly disadvantaged Muslims of Ethiopia. Lij Girma is the only one currently making an active Iyasuist claim to the throne. His pretentions are however undermined due to the very large number of descendants of Lij Iyasu that exist with an equal or arguably superior claim. His claim may also be subject to the test of loyalties according to which members who have abjured their citizenship, faith, or married non-Ethiopians may fail. Lij Girma himself, being married to a non-Ethiopian, would fail this test. Lij Girma uses the title of H.I.H. Abeto-Hoy Lij Girma Yohannes Iyassu Menelik II (\\"Crown Prince of Ethiopia\\") as his title of pretence. The title of Crown Prince is also claimed by Leul Zera Yacob Amha Selassie the grandson of Emperor Haile Selassie I. The throne of Ethiopia since the reign of HIM Atse (Emperor) Menelik II have been subject to the guardianship of the Imperial Crown Council of Ethiopia. It was the Imperial Crown Council headed by Fitawrari Habtegiorgis Dinagde that removed the sitting(if uncrowned) Lij Iyasu (Iyasu V) for cause. The same Council elevated a royal cousin, Tafari Makonnen to be Crown Prince of Ethiopia, and proclaimed Zauditu Menelik as Queen of Kings, Lion of Judah, Elect of God and Empress of Ethiopia. The Crown Council actions paid heed to one of the wishes of Menelik II, who while alive had all but elevated his first cousin (father of Ras Tafari), Ras Makonnen, to be his successor. Ras Tafari Makonnen went on to become, again by consent of the Crown Council of the time, Emperor Haile Selassie I. The functions of the Imperial Crown Council, verification not only of constitutional legitimacy of an intendant monarch but also compliance of the same with the ancient code of the Fetha Negest is one of the most important in the Ethiopian crowns orders of succession. The Fetha Negest codes require an Emperor to be able to function in his role both as head of the nation, as well as head of the armed forces in times of conflict. The 1930 constitution of Ethiopia attempts to codify the order of succession in modern terms. But the centuries-old Fetha Negest and Fetha Negest scholars still prevail in discussions on points of law and conflict between the old and the new. Under the old Fetha Negest rules, Lij Girma's claims would be far junior to those of the male line heirs of Dejazmatch Taye Gulilat, and under the 1930 and 1955 constitutions, his claims would be non-existent. The male line heirs of Dejazmatch Taye Gulilat do not however currently make a claim on the Imperial throne. Lij Girma's claim to fame came in the 1999 re-interment of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I when a newspaper article suggested in an interview with him that he felt the late monarch deserved his fate. He demanding to know what was done with the remains of his grandfather Lij Iyasu, and also suggested that a search be conducted for his remains and that his bones should be placed in the tomb currently occupied by those of Princess Tsehai Haile Selassie in the crypt of the Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery where Emperor Menelik II is buried. He suggested that the Princess be reinterred at Holy Trinity Cathedral alongside Haile Selassie I and his heirs. The article was used by the EPRDF government as one of its many attempts to shed a negative light on the period of mourning for Emperor Haile Selassie and show that there were rifts within the monarchist movement. Lij Girma was widely condemned at the time for his lack of traditional Ethiopian etiquette and for the very coarse language he used in the article. Little has been heard of him in Ethiopia since. He is President of the Ethiopian Democratic Party in Germany. Family Lij Girma is married to Claudia Bertram, who, since their marriage, goes by the name Princess Claudia Iyasu Menelik. They have one son: * Lij Kaerrod Girma (Iyasu V Kifle Yacob). Lij Girma also has two daughters from a previous relationship with the daughter of an American industrialist.

It was first mentioned as Gusibach and as belonging to the royal court at Hallstadt in an Imperial document issued between 812 and 830. History=Name‚Äôs meaning As to the name's origin, there is no agreement. The Old High German word guza (‚Äúpour‚Äù) could refer to Gie√übach, but since the neighbouring community of Hoheng√º√übach does not lie on a brook (Bach means ‚Äúbrook‚Äù in German), the name might also have come from the names Gosbert or G√∂tz. The name in its current form crops up only in 1750, and only in the mid-19th century did it gain legal legitimacy. 9th to 17th centuries After Breiteng√º√übach's first mention as Gusibach in the early 9th century (about 812) and as being owned by the royal court at Hallstadt, Emperor Heinrich II donated the royal court along with G√º√übach upon the founding of the Bishopric of Bamberg in 1007 to the Bamberg Church as the bishop's demesne. Already by the first half of the 13th century, Breiteng√º√übach had its own House of God ‚Äì St. Leonhard. In 1392, G√º√übach was separated from the parish of Hallstadt and was granted its own parish rights. The G√º√übachers gave themselves a new village constitution in 1594, laying the basis for the community's administration for centuries to come. The schoolmaster, the smith, the barber-surgeon, the herdsman and a midwife were hired and salaried by the community. The community's own communal house, a community smithy and even a public bathhouse were all available in the community. In the Thirty Years' War, on 8 February 1633, half of G√º√übach was left in rubble and ashes. 18th and 19th centuries In 1750 came the first use of the name Breiteng√º√übach. Before Secularization, Breiteng√º√übach belonged to the High Monastery at Bamberg. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today's community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (‚ÄúCommunity Edict‚Äù) of 1818. 20th century to present World War I did not change the overall appearance of the locality and the farming community structure much. Also, World War II did not touch the community gravely. After World War II, new life slowly but steadily began to stir. A gymnasium was built, watermains and sewerage were laid, and a filtration plant was built. A new eight-grade elementary school came into being, and a sport centre was opened. Extensive and attractive building areas were laid out, among them a vast commercial area. A local recreational forest was bought and extended. All this fulfilled the requirements for the community to busy itself welcoming many newcomers. Community structure In the course of administrative reform, Hoheng√º√übach was amalgamated with Breiteng√º√übach in 1972, as were Unteroberndorf and Z√ºckshut in 1978. Breiteng√º√übach was classed as a small centre. By converting the former schoolhouse in the middle of the community into a town hall in 1979, the basis was laid for an administration close to the townsfolk. Constituent communities Breiteng√º√übach's main and namesake centre is by far the biggest of its Ortsteile with a population of 3,393.

Emperor Heinrich II donated it to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg, which then sold it to the High Monastery at Bamberg. Burgebrach was the original parish for more than 40 outlying places. It was granted market rights on 21 August 1472 by Bamberg Bishop Georg von Schaumburg. In 1499, on the Bishop's demands, three defensive towers had to be built, for which the Bishop exempted the market town from taxes. Walls were needless, as the boggy meadows and the Ebrach's two arms had long been thwarting enemy attacks. Thus Burgebrach was spared the fury of the Hussite and German Peasants' Wars. Only in 1550 was it beset by the notorious Margrave Albrecht Alkibiades‚Äôs, and on 16 February 1632 in the Thirty Years' War by the Swedes‚Äô plundering and pillaging. In 1706, a great deal of money and goods were forced out of the townsfolk by the French. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has no longer belonged to the High Monastery at Bamberg, but rather to Bavaria. Burgebrach once had Jewish inhabitants who had at their disposal a synagogue and a mikvah. The former has been converted into a home, while the latter, a ritual bath, is used nowadays as a garage. The dead were buried in Walsdorf. Population development Within town limits, 4,761 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 5,037 in 1987, 6,212 in 2000 and 6479 in 2006. In 2007 it was 6,438. Politics From 1990 to 2014, the mayor has been Georg Bogensperger (CSU). From 2014 on, the mayor is Johannes Maciejonczyk (CSU). The town council is made up of 20 members, listed here by party or voter community affiliation, and also with the number of seats that each holds and percentage of votes received: * CSU 7 (34.69%) * Freie W√§hler - √úberparteiliche Christliche W√§hlergemeinschaft 3 (16.36%) * W√§hlergemeinschaft Oberer Grund 3 (12.24%) * Ampferbach-Dietendorfer Liste 2 (9.63%) * W√§hlergemeinschaft Oberk√∂st- Hirschbrunn-Treppendorf 2 (9.43%) * Christliche W√§hlergemeinschaft Stappenbach 1 (5.91%) * W√§hlergemeinschaft Unterneuses 1 (6.01%) * W√§hlergemeinschaft Grasmannsdorf 1 (4.22%) In 1999, municipal tax revenue, converted to euros, amounted to ‚Ç¨2,610,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to ‚Ç¨776,000. Town partnership There is a partnership arrangement with the community of Kapsweyer in Rhineland-Palatinate. Culture and sightseeing=Buildings *The St. Vitus parish church with Gothic and Baroque elements has been witnessed since 1154. Building work on the tower was begun in the 13th century. On the right side in the choir space stand figures from the Veit Stoss school of those who endowed the Bishopric of Bamberg: Emperor Heinrich and his wife Kunigunde. *On the church square stands a Mount of Olives group in a hexagonal sandstone housing with rib vaulting, facing tracery and an off- centre cupola. *The parish house was once the Prince-Bishop‚Äôs hunting palace and in 1909 it was remodelled in the Neo-Renaissance style. *From the town‚Äôs fortifications the Upper Gate still remains (gatehouse from 1720), which still houses the town hall today with the administration building built onto it. *Windeck ruins in Ampferbach *Former Amt court/district hospital, now a community centre. Wayside shrines *Wayside shrine at the bridge, known as Beichtenmarter or Luthermarter. Outside the former gate fortifications stands today on a lobe of the fairgrounds, field no. 728, the Beichtenmarter (\\"Confessional Shrine\\"), and not very much farther is the Galgenberg ‚Äì the Gallows Mountain. The local historical inscription from 1958 describes \\"Hans Leisentritt‚Äôs\\" last minutes: \\"...The sun was climbing on this last day of September in full brightness high above the Jura. Hans Leisentritt did not see it, nor did he see the blue sky as he faltered through the North Gate. Before the Marter at the brook he knelt down and the sentence was read out once again. ‚ÄòCrucified Lord Jesus Christ, have pity with me!‚Äô In holy mercifulness the Lord on the Cross looked upon the poor sinner. A picture of misery of a man stumbled in fetters on towards the gallows. Nobody ran up to cut the ropes off from him so that he could run back into the market town, flee into the church and thereby be saved. None wanted to help him. Thus, he staggered on, up to the gallows. There, the hangman carried out his duty.\\" The Gothic Marter bears on its octagonal shaft the year 1522 and on the lantern 1512. The lantern itself is adorned on both front and back by a Crucifixion scene, and on the edges are found Emperor Heinrich and Empress Kunigunde. On the octagonal shaft, on the side towards the road ‚Äì when the light is just right ‚Äì the outlines of a human figure can be made out. At this wayside shrine, it is believed that Martin Luther preached on his way to Heidelberg, leading some to believe that the shape that could be seen on the shaft was Martin Luther's, thereby also leading others to batter the image with stones into unrecognizability. Whatever the truth is about this story, it cannot be confirmed that Martin Luther ever came to Burgebrach. On 8 June 1968, Alfred Seel noted this 220-cm tall memorial with its 60-cm wide lantern in his description of field memorials in the City and District of Bamberg. In 1976, Hanns Leitherer strengthened and restored the memorial and the municipality laid a sandstone plaque at the foot of the shrine bearing both names. *Wayside shrine on the heights, known as Ursula-Marter or Otto-Marter . This wayside shrine standing at field no. 401 is particularly worthy of mention, as it can be used as an outdoor altar. The Baroque 280-cm tall shrine was, according to the inscription on the back, made in 1703; the initials above ‚Äì J. G. H. and M. C. H. ‚Äì may refer to those who endowed the shrine. The lantern shows the following pictures: on the side towards the road (east side) is a representation of the Trinity; on the back (west side) is an image of Saint George fighting the dragon; the side towards Burgebrach (south side) was adorned with Saint John of Nepomuk; the side towards Ampferbach (north side) was adorned with Saint Catherine. Fruit hangers decorate the lantern and post. The acanthus that caps the images forms the base on the lantern for the crowning cross which was removed at some unknown time. The lantern and post have the same dimensions (50 √ó 30 cm). The inscription \\"Ren. 1811\\" points to a renovation. The last restoration ‚Äì in the 20th century ‚Äì was financed by the Heimatverein Burgebrach (\\"homeland club\\"). Two legends, although neither one's provenance can be confirmed, are connected with this place: #When the newly chosen Bamberg Bishop, coming from W√ºrzburg reached here on 1 February 1203, a delegation from Bamberg was already waiting to greet the new landlord. #Ursula von Windeck (14th century) was driving to Burgebrach for church services on Trinity Sunday (the first Sunday after Whitsun) with a team of horses. As the coach coming from the castle turned into the main road, the firecrackers were set off in Burgebrach; the horses shied. Ursula sent an ejaculatory prayer to the Holy Trinity and the approaching misfortune was averted. Ursula thereupon endowed a wayside shrine. In the front relief described as a representation of the Trinity, one does not see the usual representation of an at once glorious and dolorous Trinity, but rather God the Father gazes out from the clouds with outstretched arms, the dove, symbol of the Holy Ghost, sweeps across the middle of the relief over the Christ Child, who is being led by Mary and Joseph. Regular events *The church consecration festival (Kirchweih, or locally, Kerwa), known well beyond the community, takes place yearly on the Sunday after Michaelmas (29 September), so on the last weekend in September or the first in October. *Every three months ‚Äì quarterly, on the second Sunday in March, June, September and December ‚Äì markets are held in Burgebrach, which are well patronized. Economy and infrastructure Burgebrach is a subcentre and has its own hospital, the Steigerwaldklinik. Moreover, there are many retail businesses in Burgebrach. The firm IDEAL Automotive and the Musikhaus Thomann with worldwide online mail ordering further enhance the economy. Transport Through Burgebrach run Staatsstra√üe 2262 and Bundesstra√üe 22. The town may be reached by Autobahn through the Schl√ºsselfeld or Pommersfelden interchange on the A 3.

Geography Burgwindheim lies west- southwest of Bamberg in the Steigerwald (forest). It is found between Ebrach in the west and Burgebrach in the east, on the Mittlere Ebrach. History The name‚Äôs meaning is unclear. Could it have something to do with an early settler named ‚ÄúWind‚Äù, or does the community‚Äôs Wendish past yield the name? The leaping greyhound (a Wendish symbol) in the coat of arms might offer a clue. The community had its first documentary mention in 1140. It is believed to have been settled at the time of the Frankish taking of the land. In 1278, the knight Ludewig von Windeheim bequeathed his estate to the Cistercian Monastery at Ebrach. In 1363, Burgwindheim was granted market rights by Emperor Karl IV, making it the Steigerwald‚Äôs oldest market. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. Direct Imperial authority over the Monastery at Ebrach was only recognized once Secularization had taken place, meaning that its property, unlike the W√ºrzburg High Monastery‚Äôs belongings, never passed temporarily to the Archduke Ferdinand of Tuscany, but remained with Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform, the communities of K√∂tsch, Untersteinach and Unterweiler were amalgamated with Burgwindheim in 1972. The ten ‚Äì or eleven ‚Äì constituent communities are listed here with their population figures: *Burgwindheim 799 *Kappel 65 *Kehlingsdorf 48 *K√∂tsch 101 *Mendenm√ºhle 2 (counted demographically as part of Untersteinach) *Mittelsteinach 88 *Obersteinach 7 *Oberweiler 68 *Schrappach 55 *Untersteinach 127 (with Mendenm√ºhle) *Unterweiler 60 The community also has four traditional rural land units, known in German as Gemarkungen, named K√∂tsch, Untersteinach, Unterweiler and Burgwindheim, the same names as four of the constituent communities (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby). Population development Within municipal limits, 1,375 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 1,350 in 1987 and 1,445 in 2000. In 2007 it was 1,423. Politics The mayor is Heinrich Thaler (CSU).

Economy and infrastructure According to official statistics, there were 616 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in producing businesses in 1998, and in trade and transport none. In other areas, 45 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls were employed, and 461 such workers worked from home. In processing businesses there was one business, and in construction two, and furthermore, in 1999, there were 64 agricultural operations with a working area of 1 404 ha, of which 914 ha was cropland and 489 ha was meadowland. Education In 1999, the following institutions existed in Burgwindheim: *50 kindergarten places with 53 children *Primary school with 6 teachers and 144 pupils The Miracle of the Host A wonder that happened at the Corpus Christi procession in 1465 made Burgwindheim into a pilgrimage place. The Monstrance happened on an altar ‚Äúwithout outside help and without the wind‚Äôs influence‚Äù. The Host bread fell to the ground. The priest could not free it from the ground, even with all his strength. A wooden shed was built to keep watch on the bread. The convent at Ebrach prepared itself in an eight-day prayer to lift the bread up again. It was managed, and the Abbot of Ebrach brought the Host back into the parish church again. The event was regarded as a miracle, and only two years later arose a chapel to the ‚ÄúHoly Blood‚Äù. The number of pilgrims rose when in 1625 a spring sprang up, which was soon said to be miraculous. Burgwindheim in popular culture Burgwindheim, along with one other community in the Bamberg district ‚Äì Gundelsheim ‚Äì is mentioned in a poem entitled simply A Poem, whose authorship is unclear. However, it is likely by either Terry Jones or Michael Palin, since it does appear in a book that they wrote together, Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls. The poem itself uses only one rhyme, and both communities‚Äô names happen to fit the rhyme.

Buttenheim is Levi Strauss‚Äôs birthplace: the future inventor of blue jeans emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1847. Constituent communities The market community of Buttenheim has the following constituent communities: * Buttenheim, the namesake community * Dreuschendorf * Frankendorf * Gunzendorf * Hochstall * K√§lberberg * Ketschendorf bei Buttenheim * Senftenberg * Stackendorf * Tiefenh√∂chstadt History Buttenheim ‚Äì ‚ÄúBotho‚Äôs Home‚Äù ‚Äì had its first documentary mention in 1017. It lies on the north-south Regnitz Valley transport axis and was probably founded about 550. During a river journey from Forchheim to W√ºrzburg in 793, Charlemagne ordered churches to be built in the Regnitz area to convert the Slavs. It is assumed that one of Charlemagne's 14 ‚ÄúSlavic Churches‚Äù, which were built about 800 in the Radenzgau (a county roughly corresponding to today's Upper Franconia), stood in Buttenheim. Until the mid-17th century, Buttenheim was the most important place between Bamberg and Forchheim. Through Buttenheim ran the old trade road from Regensburg to Bamberg/Hallstadt and on to Magdeburg. Furthermore, the Saxon Road, another old connection, this one east-west, ran from the Steigerwald forest by way of Hirschaid to ‚ÄúFranconian Switzerland‚Äù. Parts of that road are still used, having been incorporated into the modern road Staatsstra√üe 2260. The Lords of Schl√ºsselberg, who had their first documentary mention in 1304, were resident in Buttenheim and until 1762 held an estate, the court and lordship over the village. These, however, later belonged to the Barons of Seefried. By the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, the community passed to Bavaria. Population development Within municipal limits, 2,619 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 2,786 in 1987 and 3,092 in 2000. In early 2005 it was 3,442. Politics The community's politics is dominated by a coalition that calls itself the CSU /Zum Wohl der Gemeinde/Neue W√§hlergemeinschaft and furnishes the mayor. The SPD, FDP and Greens are not represented on municipal council, but instead various other voter communities are, such as B√ºrgerblock Gunzendorf, WG Dreuschendorf, WG Ketschendorf or WG Frankendorf. In 1999, municipal tax revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨1,896,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to ‚Ç¨789,000. Coat of arms Buttenheim's arms might heraldically be described thus: Party per pale, dexter party per fess argent and sable, in argent a boar spear gules per pale, sinister in argent the chief gules, thereunder a knife azure per pale. The black and silver half of the shield is a reduced form of the arms borne by the old Lords of Stiebar, who were resident in Buttenheim. Their arms were parted and out of the parting line sprouted a Schweinsfeder (‚Äúswine‚Äôs feather‚Äù ‚Äì a spearlike war weapon somewhat similar to the boar spear mentioned in the blazon, which itself in German has a similar name: Saufeder, or ‚Äúsow‚Äôs feather‚Äù) with a golden bend. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) are the old Bamberg High Monastery's colours. This monastery had holdings in the community. The blue knife is an attribute of Saint Bartholomew, the patron saint of the Buttenheim church. Culture and sightseeing=Breweries In Buttenheim there are currently two breweries, St-Georgen-Br√§u and L√∂wenbr√§u; the outlying centres of Gunzendorf and Dreuschendorf each have one brewery. St. Bartholomew's Parish Church in Buttenheim Parish church in Buttenheim The Pfarrkirche St. Bartholom√§us in Buttenheim was likely among the 14 ‚ÄúSlavic Churches‚Äù built in the Radenzgau by the Bishop of W√ºrzburg at Charlemagne's behest. Schloss Buttenheim In Buttenheim, two castles were once to be found: the Oberes Schloss (‚ÄúUpper Castle‚Äù, also called Deichselburg) and the Unteres Schloss (‚ÄúLower Castle‚Äù). Both were owned by the Imperial Barons of Stiebar, who further owned three others in Aisch, Pretzfeld and Ermreuth. The Stiebar noble family can be traced back to 1253 and belonged to the former knighthood of the canton of Geb√ºrg, which was under direct Imperial authority, and which stretched among Kronach, Nuremberg, Buttenheim and Kulmbach. This noble family put many abbesses, Teutonic Knights and capitulars in the High Monasteries of Bamberg and W√ºrzburg. Between 1377 and 1560, at least fourteen members of this family were capitulars in the High Monasteries of Bamberg and W√ºrzburg. The Oberes Schloss (square with wall and four corner towers) was burnt down during the German Peasants' War in 1525 and never built again. The castle that still stands today in Buttenheim is the so- called Unteres Schloss, which originally served the von Lichtenstein family as a bower, was taken over by the Stiebars, along with other pieces of real estate in Buttenheim in 1438. The Stiebars had at their disposal in Buttenheim at that time jurisdiction over life and death, having inherited this from the von Schl√ºsselbergs. Under the Stiebars‚Äô ownership, the Lower Castle was burnt down several times: in 1492 in ‚Äúbloody feud between Albrecht Stiebar the Younger and Prince-Bishop Heinrich III of Bamberg‚Äù, in 1525 by ‚Äúrebellious people from out of town‚Äù and once again in 1561 through a castle servant's carelessness when he went to bed, forgetting to put the light in his room out. Hans Joachim von Stiebar, who in 1574 was elected to the First Knightly Council (Erster Ritterrat) of the canton of Geb√ºrg for the Bamberg and Forchheim area, thereby enjoying great prestige, repaired the damage. The Stiebars embraced Lutheranism quite early on, as witnessed by, among other things, the appointment of an Evangelical preacher at Schloss Buttenheim, which was mentioned in a document as early as 1591. In 1630, the Stiebars were stripped of their holdings at Imperial behest for having taken part in the Protestant Union‚Äôs struggles, putting Buttenheim, and thereby the Lower Castle, under Prince Georg Ludwig von Schwarzenberg‚Äôs ownership. The Stiebars, however, got their belongings back in 1648 under the Peace of Westphalia. In 1741, the chapel, which still stands today, was built next to the rubble of the castle, which had been destroyed by war. The castle lords, however, had to live in a side building. In 1762, with Imperial Baron Johann Georg Christoph Wilhelm von Stiebar‚Äôs death, this noble family‚Äôs main Franconian line died out. Their fiefdom went to the High Monasteries of Bamberg and W√ºrzburg, and also partly back to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg. Ownership stayed with the heirs, the widow and the daughters. In 1761 the Kammerjunker (variously translated as ‚Äúpage‚Äù or ‚Äúchamberlain‚Äù) Wilhelm Christian Friedrich von Seefried wed Elisabeth Sofie von Stiebar, whom he had come to know while he was a student of jurisprudence in Erlangen. A few years later, they moved to Buttenheim. Since the Lower Castle ‚Äú...had been destroyed or wiped out by fire (down to) the mediaeval, massive, square tower topped with a mansard roof...‚Äù, Wilhelm Christian Friedrich von Seefried built the current Baroque castle in 1774 onto the one tower that still stood, and in which is still found the Evangelical castle chapel. Wilhelm Christian saw to it that the Evangelical castle parish was newly confirmed. In 1790, Wilhelm Christian, who had set himself all his life to strengthening the Evangelical faith, was raised to the Imperial Barony. In 1814, a ‚ÄúProtestant castle parish‚Äù from the ‚ÄúCastle Chaplaincy‚Äù was consecrated, and on 27 August 1826, the castle chapel was consecrated as a communal House of God. Even today, the castle chapel still serves the Buttenheim Evangelical parish, which since that time has been put in the care of the parish of Hirschaid, as a House of God. Since Wilhelm Christian's time, the castle has been occupied almost uninterruptedly by his descendants. Curacy Church in Gunzendorf From the Baroque Kuratie-Kirche St. Nikolaus begins the Georgiritt (roughly ‚ÄúGeorge‚Äôs Ride‚Äù) to the Senftenberg, a nearby mountain. Senftenberg with St. George‚Äôs Chapel The Baroque community chapel of St. George on the Senftenberg is the destination of the Georgiritt. ‚ÄúGolden Village‚Äù of Frankendorf with climbing park Frankendorf, a village of timber-frame houses, became the winner of the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village ought to become lovelier‚Äù) in 1981. The district evaluation jury came to this conclusion in 1980: :‚ÄúThe almost fully preserved timber-frame ensemble with its 31 one-floor farmers‚Äô houses under memorial protection is without peer in Upper Franconia.‚Äù It goes on to say: :‚ÄúThe townsfolk‚Äôs community spirit and readiness to sacrifice were always exemplary for the district.‚Äù About the landscape, this was stated: :‚ÄúOrchards green the place in exemplary fashion; the valley is covered with groves of trees. The transition to free landscape is fluid.‚Äù Levi-Strauss-Museum Levi-Strauss-Museum Levi Strauss, the inventor of blue jeans was born in Buttenheim on 26 February 1829 as L√∂b Strau√ü. The house where he was born is now a museum. Built in 1687, the timber-frame structure was expanded in 1733 to house two families. Among the permanent exhibits can be seen the Strauss family's emigration documents and the publication of their emigration in the official journal. Museums The Kleines Haus der Kunst (‚ÄúLittle House of Art‚Äù) shows paintings, graphics, sculpture and photographs by Eastern European artists. Regular events Georgiritt The tradition-rich Georgiritt takes place on 23 April (Saint George's Day) and leads from Gunzendorf up onto the Senftenberg. This is a kind of pilgrimage to Saint George traditionally done on horseback.

History The former Cistercian Kloster Ebrach was founded in 1127 as one of the first Cistercian monasteries east of the Rhine by Berno and Richwin von Eberau, Frankish noblemen. In 1147, twelve monks from the mother monastery, Morimond, moved here. In 1200, Abbot Hermann I set to work on building the church, which was finished in 1280. It is 86 m long was built in the Gothic style. More than 50 windows, 26 altars and, above the portal, a rose window adorn the building. The windows were newly painted in 1887. The organ, with its 36 stops, is hailed as a masterwork. The abbey was dissolved in 1803 in the course of Secularization. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. Ebrach Abbey only fell under direct Imperial authority once it had been shut down. Until 1803, this had been successfully disputed by the Hochstift of W√ºrzburg. The abbey church became a parish church. Since 1851, the abbey buildings have served as a prison, nowadays known as Justizvollzugsanstalt Ebrach.

Throughout the community, the landlords were the Frensdorf administration, the Bamberg Chapter, the Collegiate Monastery of Saint Jacob at Bamberg, the Michaelsberg and St. Klara Monasteries at Bamberg, the Parish of Hirschaid, the Zollner von Brand, von Sch√∂nborn and L√∂ffelholz von Colberg families and the community itself. = The Schl√∂sschen= The estate, whose history reaches back to 1109, is also known as the Wingersdorfer Schl√∂sschen (‚ÄúWingersdorf Little Castle‚Äù). Its landlords and owners are known back to 1352. Its heyday began with its sale to the Bamberg book dealer Tobias G√∂bhardt on 26 October 1778 for 2,800 guilders. G√∂bhardt, who had also earned his money since 1764 reprinting books and who was therefore known at the Leipzig Trade Fair, held public offices from 1770 onwards, such as police court graduate lawyer and city councillor. He built on the estate's lands in 1778 and 1779 a building that dominated the whole valley. After his death, the Schl√∂sschen remained in the G√∂bhardt family's hands until 1799, at which time they sold it to two members of the Winkler von Mohrenfels family. After frequent changes in ownership, the old G√∂bhardt manor ended up under the Burkard family's ownership. On New Year's Eve 1995-1996, a firework rocket struck the now empty Schl√∂sschen. The fire that was thus started destroyed the roof truss, with the water from the firehoses also leaving stains. Because straw was being stored on the first floor and there was the danger of the fire's flaring up again from hotspots in the straw, parts of the outer walls had to be torn away so that the straw could more easily be removed. The owner was neither willing nor able to save the burnt ruins, and so the community council gave its consent in 2002 for the Baroque building's demolition.

Geography The community of Kemmern lies at an average elevation of 236 to 250 metres some seven kilometres north of Bamberg, right on the Main and at the foot of the Ha√überge‚Äôs (mountain range) outlying hills. It belongs to the Upper Franconia-West region in the upper Main Valley. Kemmern is nestled in an historic cultural landscape with a path system from the High Middle Ages. Many hiking and cycling paths connect Kemmern to places of interest to visitors (such as the Main Valley, the Ha√überge, the Steigerwald [forest], the ‚ÄúFranconian Switzerland‚Äù and the world heritage city of Bamberg). Although the community is not beset with heavy through traffic, the residential community of Kemmern is connected to the long-distance road network (Bundesstra√üen 4 and 173). The community has one of the traditional rural land units, known in German as Gemarkungen, also named Kemmern (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby). History Kemmern‚Äôs settlement history is very old and reaches far back into the first millennium BC, as shown by the origins of the Helenenkapelle (chapel) on the Semberg, which was a worshipping place as far back as Celtic times. In the Early Middle Ages, the border between the Germanic- and Slavic- settled areas ran through what is now known as Kemmern. Bearing witness to the Germanic-Frankish presence are the Germanic townsites ‚Äì now forsaken ‚Äì of Dertheim and Schiring. The earlier B√ºrg may have had Slavic beginnings as an important refuge and worshipping place for the Main Wends. The first time that Kemmern was mentioned in writing was in a document from 26 October 1017 AD as Camerin in the Radenzgau (a county roughly corresponding to today‚Äôs Upper Franconia). In this document, Emperor Heinrich II acknowledges an exchange agreement whereby, along with Erlangen and Forchheim also, among other things, four fishermen at Kemmern were transferred by Bishop Heinrich of W√ºrzburg to Bishop Eberhard of Bamberg. In the centuries that followed up until Secularization in 1803, Kemmern remained an Obleidorf (from Mediaeval Latin oblaia, an old term for things donated to spiritual institutions or monasteries; Dorf is ‚Äúvillage‚Äù in German) of the Bamberg Cathedral Chapter, but it nevertheless had at its disposal quite early on a definite measure of autonomy. So Kemmern could deal with its local business under a regulation, the village charter, which required no lordly sanction. For its protection, Kemmern had at its disposal a water-filled moat and three gatehouses. In the German Peasants' War in 1525, Kemmerners actively fought on the rebels‚Äô sides. In the winter of 1631-1632, Kemmern was beset by Swedish troops. How much suffering the Thirty Years' War brought Kemmern can be seen in what had happened by 1638 in the cathedral chapter households, of which there were 68, and of which only 26 were still occupied by this time. In the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763, Kemmern lay many times under quartering by various Imperial troops as well as under Prussian invasions and quartering, since the Prince- Bishop of Bamberg had chosen to side with Austria. With the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community passed to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today‚Äôs community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (‚ÄúCommunity Edict‚Äù) of 1818. For the 2,600 or so people who lived here then, Kemmern had at its disposal important institutions for basic services. Kemmern has been an autonomous parish since 1710. Between 1978 and 1980, the Roman Catholic parish of St. Peter and Paul was expanded. In these same years, floodwater control measures were undertaken. Because Kemmern lies on the Main, flooding is an ongoing threat. There were major events of this nature in February 1909 and December 1967 which showed how serious the problem could be. However, an excavation designed to forestall flooding was built between 1978 and 1980 to safeguard the community from this natural hazard. Since 1995, the community core has been undergoing an overhaul as part of a programme to promote municipal building. The community has been receiving help from both the state and the European Union for this. Population development Within municipal limits, 1,923 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 2,188 in 1987 and 2,565 in 2000. On 31 December 2005 it was 2,659 and on 31 December 2006 it was 2,592.

Geography Lisberg lies west of Bamberg. Constituent communities Lisberg‚Äôs main and namesake centre is the biggest of its Ortsteile, although Trabelsdorf is not much smaller. The community has these centres, each given here with its own population figure: *Barbarah√∂he: (does not exist demographically) *Lisberg: 998 *Neum√ºhle: 1 *Trabelsdorf: 794 *Triefenbach: 15 The community also has 2 traditional rural land units, known in German as Gemarkungen, named Lisberg and Trabelsdorf, the same names as 2 of the constituent communities (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby). History Lisberg is noticeable even from far away for the Burg Lisberg. This castle had its first documentary mention in 820 in a donation document, and it is among Germany‚Äôs oldest undestroyed castles. From 1600 to 1707, the Protestant line of the Barons of M√ºnster held Lisberg as a fief, and then until 1790 the Catholic line did so. The castle is now privately owned. Concerts are sometimes held in the castle‚Äôs courtyard. The palatial residence (Schloss) in the outlying centre of Trabelsdorf was acquired in 1664 by the Marshals of Ostheim and in 1700 it was newly built. It now houses the administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) of Lisberg (whose member communities are Lisberg and Priesendorf) and a medical practice. With the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, the Barons of M√ºnster- Lisberg saw their overlordship pass to Bavaria. The community of Lisberg has existed since 1978, consisting of the two formerly autonomous communities of Lisberg and Trabelsdorf. South of Lisberg can be found a Jewish graveyard on a plot of higher ground with some 130 gravestones. In Lisberg, about 1825, there were 17 Jewish families. The number had shrunk so sharply by the early 20th century, however, that the synagogue was sold. Politics Lisberg‚Äôs municipal council consists of 12 members besides the mayor, 6 of whom likewise belong to the √úPL, and the other 6 of whom are CSU members. In 1999, municipal tax revenue, converted to euros, amounted to ‚Ç¨640,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to ‚Ç¨115,000. Culture and sport Lisberg is regularly the venue for the so-called Donnersbergklassiker (‚ÄúThunder Mountain Classic‚Äù), a cycling race around the Steigerwald (forest).

It also serves as the second home field along with Jerry D. Young Memorial Field for the UAB Blazers. Regions Field is located adjacent to the Railroad Park, just south of downtown Birmingham. Baseball in Birmingham traces its history to 1885 with the establishment of the original Barons, and from 1910 to 1987, professional baseball teams called Rickwood Field home. In 1988, the Barons moved to Hoover Metropolitan Stadium, leaving the city of Birmingham without professional baseball. In 2009, a proposal surfaced to build a downtown stadium to bring baseball back to Birmingham. After a feasibility study was completed, in October 2010, the city lodging tax was increased to finance its construction and in November 2010, a tentative agreement was reached to bring the Barons back to Birmingham. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the new facility on February 2, 2012, and the park celebrated its grand opening on April 10, 2013. History The history of professional baseball in Birmingham began with the establishment of the Barons as one of the charter members of the original Southern League in 1885. In 1910, the Barons moved into Rickwood Field, and professional baseball in Birmingham was played exclusively at Rickwood through 1987. The final game played at Rickwood with the Barons as the primary tenant occurred on September 9, 1987, when they lost to the Charlotte O's 5‚Äì4 in the second game of the Southern League championship series. The following season, the Barons moved into the Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Hoover. From 1988 to 2013, the only professional baseball played in Birmingham was the annual Rickwood Classic, established in 1996. After two decades without baseball in Birmingham, in 2009 Corporate Realty Development brought forward a proposal to build a new stadium for the Barons adjacent to the Railroad Park. In April 2010, a privately funded, $40,000 feasibility study was commissioned, and in September its findings were released. The study indicated the construction of a stadium could potentially result in over $500 million in direct and indirect spending in the city. In October 2010, the Birmingham City Council approved an ordinance by a vote of 8‚Äì1 to increase the city's lodging tax by 3.5% to finance the construction of the stadium. At the time of its approval, the tax was expected to generate $5 million annually. Additionally, a provision in the ordinance called for a repeal of the tax by January 2012 if the Barons were unable to relocate or a primary tenant for the facility could not be found. On November 4, an agreement was reached between the City of Birmingham and Barons ownership to relocate the team as the primary tenant of the stadium upon its completion. In July 2011, the location for the stadium was unveiled as being along First Avenue South, between 14th and 16th Streets South. The majority of the properties involved were acquired through a land swap with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and the remaining were purchased from private landholders. In September, the building team for the stadium was released with 61% being minority-owned firms and most based in Birmingham. The official groundbreaking ceremony was held for the estimated $60 million stadium on February 2, 2012. At that time, the name of the stadium as Regions Field was unveiled, with the naming rights purchased by Birmingham-based Regions Financial Corporation. On March 14, the Birmingham Design Review Committee approved the site plan for the facility to allow for its construction to commence upon completion of the on-site demolition. After just over one year of construction, Regions Field opened on April 10, 2013, for a sold-out game against the Mississippi Braves. In 2013, the Barons and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) reached an agreement to allow for the Blazers baseball team to schedule as many games as would allow at Regions Field. As such, UAB scheduled 21 of their 30 home games for the 2014 season at Regions Field. In their first game played at Regions Field, the Blazers shutout UT‚ÄìMartin 5‚Äì0. Design Perspective from beyond center field in April 2013. The design team for the stadium included HKS, Inc. of Dallas and both Hoskins Architecture and GA Studio of Birmingham. The stadium facade utilizes brick and steel in an effort to both serve as homage to Birmingham's industrial past and to better blend with the surrounding neighborhood. Specifically, design elements inspired from Rickwood Field and Sloss Furnaces were utilized in its physical design. The main entrance is located at the corner of 14th Street South and First Avenue South, the main concourse is located at street level and the playing field is located below street grade. The original layout of the stadium had center field located at the northern end of the facility with the backdrop being the skyline of downtown Birmingham. However, its orientation was changed in the final design with center field located at the eastern end of the facility with the backdrop being the downtown Birmingham skyline, UAB and the medical district and Red Mountain. The change was made as a result of Birmingham's irregular street grid that is oriented about 30¬∞ from magnetic north in order to meet guidelines set forth by Major League Baseball for stadium orientation as it relates to sun angle. Looking towards the Birmingham skyline from Regions Field. July 15, 2015 As part of the overall design, 250 parking spaces are provided on-site as part of its grounds. However, in order to reach the 2,500 spaces necessary for the project as a whole, agreements were made to utilize existing parking garages owned by the Children's Hospital of Alabama, Jefferson County, Cooper Green Mercy Hospital and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, located within a 5‚Äì10 minute walk of the stadium. The Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority also provides free bus service to and from the stadium and the Central Station located on Morris Avenue.

Constituent communities  Pettstadt‚Äôs main and namesake centre is by far the biggest of its Gemeindeteile with a population of 1,914. The community furthermore has these outlying centres, each given here with its own population figure: * Eichenhof: 25 * Neuhaus: 24 * Schadlos: 17 The community also has one of the traditional rural land units known in German as Gemarkungen, named Pettstadt, the same name as the main centre (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby).  History  The community had its first documentary mention in 1070 as Betestat. The placename goes back to a personal name, Petto, which around the year 1000 was quite common in the Frankish-Thuringian area. In 1399 came the establishment of the parish of Pettstadt. In 1754, the Baroque church was built under architect Johann Jakob Michael K√ºchel. The community belonged to the Cathedral Chapter of Bamberg of the High Monastery at Bamberg, and with the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community passed to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today‚Äôs community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (‚ÄúCommunity Edict‚Äù) of 1818. In 2002, the administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) with Frensdorf, which had been instituted in the course of later administrative reform, was dissolved.  Population development  Within municipal limits, 1,041 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 1,411 in 1987 and 1,829 in 2000. On 30 June 2007 it was 1,923.

Culture and sightseeing  Pettstadt has something rather remarkable for a place of its size, namely a Baroque church by the famous master builder Michael K√ºchel, the parish Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. Pettstadt ferry One curiosity in Pettstadt is the Pettstadter Schmied, Upper Franconia‚Äôs only reaction ferry, which crosses the Regnitz not far west of the village and is used mainly by cyclists. The original Pettstadter Schmied (German for ‚ÄúPettstadt smith‚Äù) is the main character in a story that is well known throughout the region. It tells of master smith Sebastian Schubert, who died in 1910. About the turn of the 20th century, it is said that, at a very late hour at an inn, he would not comply with a gendarmerie patrol‚Äôs order to leave the inn. Instead, he said ‚ÄúDes mach ich, wie ich mooch‚Äù (dialectal German for ‚ÄúI do whatever I like‚Äù). The incident led to charges. The judge at the Royal Bavarian Amt Court, however, acquitted the accused citing an apparent lack of abusive or rebellious attitude. From this developed a well known Upper Franconian expression: Mach' es wie der Pettstadter Schmied (‚ÄúDo it like the Pettstadt smith‚Äù), which is taken as a demand to decide on one‚Äôs own authority.Entry about Pettstadter Schmied at pettstadt.de .  Sport and clubs  From the local club life have grown many events such as the Pettstadt Street Festival (Stra√üenfest) on the third weekend in July, which is attended by citizens from all over the district. The three biggest clubs, the Sportverein Pettstadt (SVP, a sport club), the Freihand Sch√ºtzenverein Pettstadt (FSV, a shooting club) and the Rauhe Ebrach angling club are successful even beyond the local region.

He has played part of one season in Major League Baseball, in 2007 for the Cincinnati Reds. Career McBeth attended the University of South Carolina, and in 2000 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected in the fourth round of the June 2001 Major League Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics as a center fielder. He never produced much with the bat during his first three years of professional baseball; he batted just .233 (205 for 881) with 19 home runs and 111 runs batted in. He did, however, show a strong arm and was persuaded to give pitching a shot. Splitting 2005 between Kane County (Single-A), the Arizona A's (Rookie League) and Stockton (Single-A), McBeth posted a 2-2 record and an earned run average of 3.62 over 25 appearances (all relief) and 31.1 innings pitched. McBeth started the 2006 season in Stockton as the team's closer. He was not scored upon in eight appearances, while also racking up seven saves. He was immediately promoted to Midland (Double-A), where he saved 25 games, posted an ERA of 2.48 and allowing opposing hitters to a paltry .213 batting average. His success at the Double-A level prompted yet another promotion, to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. Success was harder to come by at the minors' highest level; in 7.1 innings, he surrendered nine runs and failed to register a single save. Still, McBeth's composite 2006 numbers were impressive: 3-3 record, 3.07 ERA, 32 saves and an opponents' batting average of .198 in 70‚Öì innings pitched. In November 2006, McBeth was placed on the A's 40-man roster, preventing him from being chosen by another team via the Rule 5 Draft. In April 2007, McBeth was traded by the A's to the Cincinnati Reds, along with minor league pitcher Ben Jukich, for outfielder Chris Denorfia. McBeth made his major league debut with the Reds on June 6, 2007, against the St. Louis Cardinals. Four days later, on June 10 he recorded his first win against AL rival Cleveland Indians. On August 13, 2008, McBeth was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox, and was optioned to their Triple-A team, the Pawtucket Red Sox. On July 31, 2009, McBeth was called up to join the Red Sox bullpen following the trade of Justin Masterson. He was optioned the following day without making an appearance. In October 2009, McBeth was granted free agency. In 2010, he returned to the Athletics, and appeared in 14 games for the River Cats. He was granted free agency after the 2010 season. As of , McBeth lives in Chandler, Arizona, and is an area scout for the St. Louis Cardinals. Repertoire McBeth features a fastball that in 2005 was clocked as high as 93 miles per hour. He also features a slider and a changeup. His changeup has improved with the assistance of A's pitching coordinator (and former big-league hurler) Ron Romanick.

The route runs from the Maryland border near Burrsville, Maryland, where the road continues as Maryland Route 317 (MD 317), east to DE 1 in Milford. The route passes through Harrington, where it intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13), and passes to the north of Houston before coming to Milford, where it intersects DE 15, US 113, and DE 1 Business (DE 1 Bus.). DE 14 has a truck bypass of Harrington known as DE 14 Truck. DE 14 was first designated by 1936 to run from the Maryland border near Burrsville east to DE 26 in Bethany Beach. The road was extended south to Fenwick Island in 1939. In the 1940s, the road was realigned to bypass Rehoboth Beach. The route between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach was widened into a divided highway in the 1950s, with all of DE 14 southeast of Milford being upgraded to a divided highway by the 1970s. In 1977, most of DE 14 east of Milford was replaced with DE 1, with the eastern terminus being realigned to its current location by 1984. The DE 1 intersection became an interchange in 2019. Route description DE 14 westbound past US 113 in Milford DE 14 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD 317\\\\. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Vernon Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional homes and crossing Marshyhope Creek in the community of Vernon. The road curves to the northeast before bending east at the Whiteleysburg Road intersection. The route becomes Walt Messick Road and enters the city of Harrington. DE 14 runs past homes and some businesses before intersecting DE 14 Truck, which bypasses Harrington to the south. At this point, DE 14 heads northeast on Commerce Street into the downtown area. Here, the route turns east onto Clark Street and passes north of the Harrington Tower Railroad Museum before it crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. On the eastern edge of Harrington, DE 14 intersects US 13 in a commercial area, at which point DE 14 Truck returns to the route. Past this intersection, the route leaves Harrington and becomes Milford Harrington Highway, heading through a mix of farms and woods with some residential development and crossing Browns Branch. The road continues east through more rural areas, passing to the north of the town of Houston. Broad Street heads south from DE 14 to provide access to Houston. Farther east, DE 14 bends southeast and intersects the southern terminus of DE 15, crossing into the city of Milford. The road enters commercial areas, passing south of the Milford Solar Farm, and gains a center left-turn lane, coming to an intersection with US 113\\\\. Past this intersection, the route becomes Northwest Front Street and runs past homes and businesses a short distance to the north of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line and Silver Lake along the Mispillion River, narrowing back to two lanes. The road curves to the east, passing to the south of the Parson Thorne Mansion, and heads through the downtown of Milford, becoming Northeast Front Street at the intersection with North Walnut Street. DE 14 passes a short distance to the north of the Mispillion River, curving northeast and coming to an intersection with DE 1 Bus. Past this junction, the route runs through areas of farmland with some commercial development, ending at an interchange with the DE 1 bypass of Milford. At this interchange, access to and from southbound DE 1 is provided by South Silicato Parkway. The road continues as New Wharf Road past the interchange. The section of DE 14 west of US 113 serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from coastal areas in southern Delaware. The section of the route between Maple Avenue and DE 1 in Milford is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 14 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 15,509 vehicles at the US 113 intersection to a low of 2,358 vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 1. None of DE 14 is part of the National Highway System. History What would become DE 14 originally existed as a county road between the Maryland border in Burrsville and Rehoboth Beach by 1920. By 1924, the road was built as a state highway between Burrsville and Milford and was proposed as one between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach. A year later, the state road was completed between Milford and Cedar Creek and from Nassau to just west of Rehoboth Beach, with the sections between Cedar Creek and Nassau and into Rehoboth Beach under proposal. A bascule bridge was constructed over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal in Rehoboth Beach in 1926. In 1927, the state highway between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was finished with the construction of a bascule bridge over the Broadkill River. In 1931, a state gravel road was extended from Bethany Beach to the Indian River Inlet along the Atlantic Ocean, providing access to the inlet for recreational purposes. By this time, the county road between Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach was paved. In January 1933, bids were made for construction of a gravel road from Dewey Beach south to the Indian River Inlet as well as for a timber bridge across the inlet, connecting with the gravel road between the Indian River Inlet and Bethany Beach. This gravel road would provide a direct connection between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach and would provide better access to the Atlantic coast for recreation. The Ocean Highway between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach was completed in 1933. In fall of that year, the roadway between Bethany Beach and Indian River Inlet was paved, with recommendations to pave the road north from the Indian River Inlet toward Rehoboth Beach. In 1934, the Ocean Highway between the Indian River Inlet and Rehoboth Beach was paved. The same year, recommendations were made to extend the Ocean Highway south from Bethany Beach to Fenwick Island, where it would lead to a Maryland state highway continuing to Ocean City. DE 14 was designated to run from the Maryland border in Burrsville east to DE 26 in Bethany Beach by 1936. In 1939, a southern extension of DE 14 was built between Bethany Beach and the Maryland border in Fenwick Island as a gravel road. In 1940, a swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet. The same year, work began for a bypass of the route between Dewey Beach and west of Rehoboth Beach, which included a bascule bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. In 1942, the Rehoboth Beach bypass for DE 14 was completed. In addition, the roadway was paved between Fenwick Island and Bethany Beach by that year. In 1952, a new swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet after the previous bridge was destroyed by ice and tides in 1948. The route was widened into a divided highway between DE 18 (now US 9/DE 404) in Nassau and Rehoboth Beach in 1954 in order to provide relief to traffic heading to the beaches. Channelized intersections were built at DE 18 in Nassau and Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach. As part of this widening, DE 14 was moved to a new alignment to bypass Wescoats Corner, removing a concurrency with DE 18; the bypassed alignment is now US 9 Bus. (which replaced DE 18) and Wescoats Road. In 1956, DE 14 was realigned slightly north to its current alignment in Burrsville to meet a new routing of MD 317; the former alignment is now Knife Box Road. In 1965, a new dual bridge was constructed across the Indian River Inlet. By 1966, DE 14A was designated onto the former alignment of DE 14 through Rehoboth Beach. The divided highway portion of DE 14 was extended north to DE 16, which included a bypass of Nassau, and between the Indian River Inlet and South Bethany in 1967. The former alignment through Nassau is now Nassau Road. In 1971, the divided Miford Bypass between DE 14 southeast of Milford and US 113 north of Milford was completed. In 1971, a contract was awarded to widen DE 14 to a divided highway between Fenwick Island and South Bethany. This widening project was completed a year later. In 1973, construction was underway to make DE 14 a divided highway from the Milford Bypass to DE 16, which included a bypass of Argos Corner; this was completed in 1974. The former alignment through Argos Corner is now Argos Corner Road. In 1974, DE 1 was signed concurrent with DE 14 east of Milford and on the Milford Bypass. In 1977, DE 14 was truncated to the southern terminus of the Milford Bypass southeast of Milford, with DE 1 replacing the route between Fenwick Island and the south end of the Milford Bypass and DE 1 Bus. becoming concurrent with route between the Milford Bypass and Northeast Front Street. As a result of this, DE 14A was renumbered to DE 1A. DE 14 was realigned to follow Northeast Front Street to end at DE 1 on the Milford Bypass by 1984. On March 26, 2018, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to construct an interchange at the eastern terminus at DE 1 in Milford, with Governor John Carney, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, and DelDOT secretary Jennifer Cohan in attendance. Construction of the interchange at DE 1 in Milford eliminated the at-grade intersection and also built a connector road from DE 14 to Northeast 10th Street. A ribbon- cutting ceremony for the interchange at DE 1 took place on May 18, 2019, with DelDOT secretary Cohan, Senator Carper, and State Representative Bryan Shupe in attendance. Major intersectionsSpecial routes=DE 14 Truck Delaware Route 14 Truck (DE 14 Truck) is a truck bypass of DE 14 in Harrington. The route heads south from DE 14 on two-lane undivided Farmington Road, leaving Harrington and heading through farmland. DE 14 Truck turns east onto Tower Hill Road and crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade before coming to an intersection with US 13\\\\. At this point, the truck route turns north to form a concurrency with US 13 on South Dupont Highway, a four-lane divided highway. The road heads back into Harrington and runs through commercial areas, passing to the east of the Delaware State Fairgrounds, which is where the Delaware State Fair is held and the Harrington Raceway & Casino and Centre Ice Rink are located. US 13/DE 14 Truck crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at-grade, with the median widening to include businesses in it. DE 14 Truck ends at another intersection with DE 14. On March 24, 2007, construction began on a truck bypass of Harrington along Farmington Road, Tower Hill Road, and US 13 by making road improvements to accommodate truck traffic such as widening pavement and work on turning and acceleration lanes. The project, which cost $8.5 million, was completed on August 20, 2008, with Senator Carper and other officials in attendance for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. DE 14 Truck was designated in 2008 onto the truck bypass of Harrington. ;Major intersections Former DE 14A Delaware Route 14A (DE 14A) was the designation of the former alignment of DE 14 through Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach. The route began at DE 14 in Dewey Beach and headed north into Rehoboth Beach, where it turned to the west and intersected DE 14 again west of Rehoboth Beach. The route was a former segment of DE 14 that was bypassed by 1942 and received the DE 14A designation by 1966. By 1974, the route became cosigned with DE 1A, with DE 1A replacing DE 14A in 1977.

Panamanian golden frogs inhabit the streams along the mountainous slopes of the Cordilleran cloud forests of west-central Panama. While the IUCN lists it as critically endangered, it may in fact have been extinct in the wild since 2007. Individuals have been collected for breeding in captivity in a bid to preserve the species. The alternative common name, Zetek's golden frog, and the epithet zeteki both commemorate the entomologist James Zetek. Description Despite its common name, the Panamanian golden frog is a true toad, a member of the family Bufonidae. It was first described as a subspecies of Atelopus varius, but is now classified as a separate species. The Panamanian golden frog is a national symbol and is considered to be one of the most beautiful frogs in Panama. The skin colour ranges from light yellow-green to bright gold, with some individuals exhibiting black spots on their backs and legs. Females are generally larger than males; females typically range from in length and in weight, with males between in length and in weight. Toxicity The Panamanian golden frog has a variety of toxins, including steroidal bufadienolides and guanidinium alkaloids of the tetrodotoxin class. One of the latter, zetekitoxin AB, has been found to be a blocker of voltage- dependent sodium channels several orders of magnitude more potent than its analog saxitoxin. Their toxin is water-soluble and affects the nerve cells of anyone who comes in contact with it. Panamanian golden frogs use this toxin to protect themselves from most predators. Due to the risk of testing the poison on humans, it has been done with mice. Large doses can be fatal in 20 or 30 minutes. Death is preceded by clonic (grand mal) convulsions until the functions of the circulatory and respiratory systems cease. Distribution The Panamanian golden frog is endemic to Panama, living close to mountain streams on the eastern side of the Tabasar√° mountain range in the Cocl√© and Panam√° provinces. Its geographic range previously extended as far east as the town of El Cop√© in western Cocl√© Province before the onset of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, which caused the El Cop√© population to rapidly collapse in 2004. Vital habitat is lost each year to small farms, commercialized agriculture, woodlot operations, livestock range, industrial expansion, and real estate development. Individuals are kept in captive- breeding programmes in more than 50 institutions across North America and Panama. Ecology The lifespan of the Panamanian golden frog is 12 years. This toad is unusual in that it communicates by a form of semaphore, waving at rivals and prospective mates, in addition to the sounds more usual among frogs. This adaptation is thought to have evolved in the Panamanian golden frog because of the noise of the fast-moving streams which formed its natural habitat. The male tends to stay near the streams where breeding occurs, while in the nonbreeding season, the female retreats into the forests. The male uses a soft call to entice prospective mates, then grabs the female and hangs on when she crosses his path. If she is receptive, she will tolerate amplexus; if not, she will attempt to buck him off by arching her spine. Amplexus can last from a few days to a few months, with oviposition usually taking place in a shallow stream. Life history The development of A. zeteki can be divided into four stages: larva or tadpole, juvenile, subadult, and adult. During the larval stage, individuals emerge from their eggs after 2 to 10 days of development. They are entirely aquatic creatures at this stage and are found in waters with a temperature range from 20.4 to 21.3 ¬∞C and with depths of 5 to 35 cm. After emerging, they mostly spend time resting in shallow pools below cascades. This behavior is similar to A. certus. Wherever water pools in a stream, they are likely to be found, as long as it is connected to moving channels. The tadpoles, however, do not venture into the moving channels. Clinging to surfaces by suction of their flattened bellies, the larvae can be characterized as gastromyzophorous. They are typically around 5.8 mm in length and 4.3 mm in width. Their snouts are rounded, as well as their tails. The longest caudal fins on their tails are about three-fifths the length of the tail. Their mouths are large and ventral surrounded by labia which form an unbroken oral disc about 3.6 mm wide. The posterior lip has no papillae, but other lips are lined with single rows of small, blunt papillae. They are colored from dark brown to black dorsally, with golden flecks on their bodies. They develop this black and gold coloration as melanin floods their dermal layers, giving the larvae protection from the sun. When metamorphosing, their golden flecks are replaced with dark green ones. The tadpoles feed on algae and spend 6 to 7 months developing and growing. The juveniles of this species are amphibious, but have a far smaller range than subadults and adults. Normally, the juveniles are not found more than 2 m from their streams, and recently metamorphosed juveniles are more likely to be found next to the stream pools teeming with tadpoles. Like their adult counterparts, the juveniles go to higher elevations and recede into trees to prevent predation; however, due to their small size, the juveniles are not able to cover as much elevation and climb as highly into trees and shrubbery. At the onset of heavy and consistent rains, the juveniles flee from the open streamsides, which are normally where the grown adult males, which are very territorial, are known to roam. Territorial behaviors by adult males could be initiated by these rains. Visually, the juvenile has snout-to-vent lengths ranging from 8.4 to 17.1 mm. Their dorsal coloration is a deep and vivid green which matches the color of the moss that grows on the rocks in and around the streams of their habitat. There are also dark brown to black dorsal markings. Some of the juveniles are also known to have small dark markings on their digits. Their abdomen is either white or goldenrod yellow, occasionally with dark markings that do not match the ground color. The subadults of this species have full ranges, but they are sometimes found near adult males which is noteworthy because males of this species are fairly solitary and combative in the presence of other males. The subadult is about 28.3 mm long and weights about 1.1 g. They are more greenish in color which more closely resembles the color of the metamorphic juvenile than the brilliant and sometimes spotted golden color of the adult. The patterning of subadults is significantly darker than the adults. Behavior Panamanian golden frogs mating The Panamanian golden frog appears to socialize with other amphibians using sounds from the throat and hand-waving, like the semaphore motion used in courtship. The movements may be friendly or aggressive warnings. It is an \\"earless\\" species of frog, meaning it lacks tympanum. This, however, does not inhibit its ability to communicate with other members of its species through throat sounds. Despite lacking eardrums, the \\"earless\\" frog responds to vocalizations produced by members of its own species. The male frog responds to a pulsed vocalization, characterized by lower frequencies followed by higher frequencies, and so on, by exhibiting antagonistic behaviors such as turning to face the source of the sound and producing a pulsed vocalization in response. The pulsed call is used to demonstrate male position during combative situations. Like Atelopus varius, it is very territorial, living in the same site most of its life. As a result of this site fidelity, it will not hesitate to vocalize when another male frog encroaches on its territory. If this is not enough to get the intruder away, the frog is not hesitant to defend its territory through aggressive behavior. When encountering another male, male frogs will wave their forefeet as a sign of defense. The Panamanian golden frog, apart from recognizing sounds, is also able to locate the origin of a sound. This means it is capable of directional hearing. In all other species of frogs, the role of the eardrum is to pinpoint the direction of sound. Due to the very small size of the Panamanian golden frog, it is difficult to imagine another system of hearing that does not involve an eardrum apparatus. When A. zeteki encounters a predator, it often waves and lifts its foot at the predator to call attention to its stunning and beautiful coloring. This coloring is a warning of its toxicity, which is enough to make a predator no longer consider the frog as a meal. If the predator continues to approach, undeterred by the frog's warnings about its toxicity, the foot waving, often accompanied with vocalizations, will continue and increase in frequency and volume. Its toxicity is not a foolproof method of protection, since some animals, such as the colubrid snake Liophis epinephalus, are able to metabolize the frogs' poison. Ways to ward off predators and prevent predation are different in their diurnal habits versus their nocturnal ones, especially because the poison alone will not ward off every predator. Adult males, which are active on the ground during the day, recede into the trees and perch there at night. This is most likely a defense mechanism. If the predator is approaching at night, the frog cannot rely on a visual strategy for fleeing. They perch on trees because it gives them the advantage of hearing approaching predators or feeling their weight on the tree branch. The noise and tactile advantages of climbing a tree are better than the advantages of burrowing in the ground. Conservation The Panamanian golden frog began vanishing from its high mountain forests in the late 1990s, prompting a scientific investigation and rescue process that continues today. It was filmed for the last time in the wild in 2006 by the BBC Natural History Unit for the series Life in Cold Blood by David Attenborough. The remaining few specimens were taken into captivity and the location of filming was kept secret to protect them from potential poachers. Although captive populations seem to thrive well, reintroducing them to an area will not stop the threat of chytridiomycosis. No current remedies prevent or control the disease in the wild, but efforts are being made. One attempt was made to protect a wide variety of frogs from the disease by using the bacterium Janthinobacterium lividium that produces a chemical against the infections; however, the skin of Panamanian golden frogs was unsuitable for the bacterium used. The San Diego Zoo started a conservation effort and received their first frogs in 2003. Since then, they have been able to successfully breed 500 individuals in captivity but will not release them into the wild until the fungal disease is less of a threat. The San Diego zoo also sends money to Panama to keep up the conservation effort in the frogs' native country. Populations of amphibians, including the Panamanian golden frog, suffered major declines possibly due to the fungal infection chytridiomycosis. The infection is caused by an invasive fungal pathogen that reached El Valle, the home of the Panamanian golden frog, in 2006. Additional factors, such as habitat loss and pollution, may have also played a role. The temperature at which these amphibians keep may be correlated to chytridiomycosis; the fungus is more prevalent in colder conditions. If a cold period occurs, the behavior and immunity of the frogs may change around the same time more spores are released. When these frogs are infected with the fungus, their body temperatures rise to fight off the fungus. However, even if the infection leaves the frogs and body temperatures return to previous normal levels, the infection can re-emerge. Another study found that dry conditions added an average 25 days to the lifespan of infected individuals, while higher temperatures only added 4 days. Not only do these frogs face the threat of the fungal disease, but they also are threatened by human development. As trees are cleared for housing and urbanization, the habitat of A. zeteki is destroyed. Other threats include encroachment by agriculture, pollution, pet trade, and aquaculture. Project Golden Frog is a conservation project involving scientific, educational, and zoological institutions in the Republic of Panama and the United States. The intended outcomes of this project include a greater understanding of the Panamanian golden frog, a coordinated conservation effort by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, heightened awareness of current global amphibian declines, greater respect for wildlife among Panamanians and global citizens, and greater land preservation for threatened and endangered species throughout the world. This organization will use education and field studies, producing offspring through the already captive toads, and offering financial support to help preserve these toads.The Conservation Initiative. Ranadorada.org Two significant efforts to save these frogs have been made. The Amphibian Recovery Conservation Coalition, which started in 2004, exported the endangered amphibians to the US, believing it was a better environment for the endangered species. In 2005, the Houston Zoo established the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center (EVACC) in Panama, so the endangered frogs could have protected facilities in their native country. EVACC has become a tourist attraction and the populations of the housed species are watched closely by researchers. In early 2006, EVACC exceeded its capacity for housing golden frogs. In order to continue collection efforts, a partnership was formed with the Hotel Campestre in El Valle whereby rooms 28 and 29 of the resort were loaded with terrariums as a stop-gap measure. This was one of several conservation efforts covered in Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. Over 300 toads were kept in the so-called \\"golden frog hotel\\" and treated to daily cleansing rinses, 24-hour room service, and exotic lunches of specialty crickets until space could be made available in the EVACC. Experiment Prior to the spread of the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis fungus into Panamanian golden frog habitat, conservation organizations collected Panamanian golden frogs and placed them in captive survival assurance colonies. The skin of amphibians is host to a diverse resident bacterial community, which acts as a defense mechanism in some amphibians to inhibit pathogens. Researchers characterized the bacterial community from wild and captive Panamanian golden frogs originating from the same population with sequencing to assess how long-term captivity has affected this community. Species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and community structure of the skin microbiota were found to be significantly different between wild and captive Panamanian golden frogs. However, after approximately eight years of living in captivity, the offspring of the original captive Panamanian golden frogs still shared 70% of their microbial community with wild frogs. These results demonstrate that host-associated microbial communities can be significantly altered by captive management, but most of the community composition can be preserved. Reintroduction efforts from captive assurance colonies are unlikely to be successful without the development of methods to control chytridiomycosis in the wild. Researchers have experimented by using Janthinobacterium lividium to control the skin temperature in hopes the fungus would be kept at bay. It seemed to be a protective treatment at the early stage, but the frogs began to die after two weeks as the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is the causative agent of chytridiomycosis. Other methods of focusing on the phenotypic and genetic concordance to do the conservation have been used. Researchers designated A. various and A. zeteki as separate species, but they are poorly sorted based on physical characteristics, and better sorted based on mitochondrial DNA. In culture The Panamanian golden frog is something of a national symbol, appearing on state lottery tickets and in local mythology. When the toad dies, it is thought to turn to gold and to bring good luck to those fortunate enough to see it. In 2010, the Panamanian government passed legislation recognizing August 14 as \\"National Golden Frog Day\\". The main celebration event is marked annually by a parade in the streets of El Valle de Anton, and a display of Panamanian golden frogs at the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center in the El Nispero Zoo, El Valle.Happy First Annual National Golden Frog Day! Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project, 2010 Accessed September 28, 2010 The highly toxic skin of the frog has also been used for centuries by the native people of the Panamanian forests for arrow poison.

Geography=Constituent communitiesViereth= Viereth lies in the northeast outliers of the Steigerwald (forest) and right on the Main‚Äôs south bank. The community had its first documentary mention in 911 under the name Fihuriod, from the Old High German words corresponding with the Modern High German words Vieh (‚Äúlivestock‚Äù) and Ried (‚Äúboggy brook‚Äù). This makes the Viehbach, a brook (Bach) running through the village, Viereth‚Äôs namesake. Until the Bishopric of Bamberg was founded, Viereth was part of the Volkfeldgau (a mediaeval Gau lying between Bamberg and the Main Triangle), and thereby also part of the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. in 1008, the part of the community lying east of the Viehbach passed to the Bishopric of Bamberg. The part to the west, where the church stood, remained along with Trunstadt with the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg, as it had been all along. In 1803, in the course of Secularization and the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg was dissolved as a sovereign state and annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The Prince-Bishopric of W√ºrzburg was likewise abolished in 1803, and here arose once again for a short time the sovereign Duchy of Franconia. Following in 1806 was the annexation of great parts of the former Prince- Bishopric of W√ºrzburg by Bavaria. In 1807, as a result of a new administrative order, western Viereth and the parish of Trunstadt were assigned to the Archbishopric of Bamberg, meaning that the western Vierethers became the Bavarian Crown‚Äôs subjects only four years after their neighbours living east of the brook. Viereth has 1,806 inhabitants (as of 30 December 2004). =Trunstadt= Trunstadt lies in the north outliers of the Steigerwald on the Upper Main.

It is entered there along with the whole circle of surrounding places as bambergisches Lehen der Leutersheim von Lisberg (‚ÄúBamberg fief of the Leutersheims of Lisberg‚Äù). Changing lordly masters in the years that followed determined the community‚Äôs fate, whereby its location in the border areas between the Bishopric of Bamberg and the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg allowed it a certain freedom in its own development. As a Bamberg fief under the ownership of the Leutersheims at Lisberg, ownership passed to the Lords of Th√ºngfeld in 1399 and then in 1524 to Wolf von Krewelsheim (= Crailsheim). Particularly formative effects were wrought beginning in 1525 by the Crailsheims‚Äô overlordship. They determined the community‚Äôs religious allegiance, the community structure and the community‚Äôs prosperity, turning it into a wealthy market community in the northern Steigerwald (forest). The landowner was an adherent of the Reformation and belonged to Martin Luther‚Äôs watch as he made his way to Worms. As a result, the subjects, too, had to embrace the Evangelical faith, which, however, led to decades-long quarrels with the Bishopric of Bamberg and for a time to confiscation of all lands. This also made it necessary to hold Evangelical church services in part at the castle then belonging to the Lord. The events in those days have had their effect down to today, and even now, the proportion of Walsdorf‚Äôs population who follow the Evangelical faith is far greater ‚Äì almost 40% ‚Äì than in the overwhelmingly Catholic communities elsewhere in the district. The autonomous knightly estate of the Barons of Crailsheim passed with the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 to Bavaria. These lords, however, remained the local landowners until their overlordship was finally dissolved in 1848, and also remained the patron lords until the patronage, too, was dissolved in 1964. With effect from 1 July 1971, the formerly autonomous community of Kolmsdorf (with the outlying centres of Feigendorf und Zettelsdorf) freely chose to amalgamate itself with Walsdorf. The community of Erlau followed on 1 May 1978. Also on that day, Walsdorf and the neighbouring communities of Stegaurach, Lisberg (with Trabelsdorf) and Priesendorf formed an administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft), from which the two last-named communities withdrew again on 31 December 1979. Since 1 January 1980, Stegaurach and Walsdorf have been the only two member communities of the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft of Stegaurach. It should also be mentioned that throughout the aforesaid overlordship, there was an important Jewish presence in the community, made up mainly of livestock dealers and small businessmen. An autonomous, formerly Jewish Ortsteil lay in the southwest of the main centre with a great Jewish cemetery, to which Bamberg Jews on various occasions had to come to bury their dead for want of their own cemetery in Bamberg. For the time from 1812 to 1848, a book of the dead has been published and is on hand. A modest synagogue, now beset by further building, in the south of the old lordly seat still bears witness today to this small Jewish community.

The name stems from ‚ÄúZapfo‚Äù (Dorf means ‚Äúvillage‚Äù in German), and may well refer to an innkeeper who tapped beer (zapfen means ‚Äúdraw‚Äù, as from a beer keg, in German). The original overlords were the Meranians, who were followed by the Truhendingens, who in turn sold the community in 1390 to the High Monastery at Bamberg. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community has belonged to Bavaria. On 1 April 1945, a munitions train on a siding in Zapfendorf was struck by low-level bombers. Burning parts of this train rained down on the village and destroyed it utterly, leaving only a few houses unscathed. In 1955, Zapfendorf was designated a market. In 1972, the communities of Lauf, Oberleiterbach, Kirchschletten, Sassendorf, Reuthlos, Roth and Oberoberndorf were amalgamated with Zapfendorf, as was Unterleiterbach in 1978.

Thus Bindlach can be translated with \\"Village of the people chopping trunks\\"Haas, Helmut: Bindlacher Chronik, Bindlach 1983, herausgegeben von der Gemeinde Bindlach anl√§sslich der Rathauseinweihung im Jahre 1983 und der 800-Jahr-Feier. as the village is situated in an area rich with woods and a clearance had to be created prior to settlement. More recent research traces the name back to the Old Saxon word Binutlaka meaning \\"Small, standing lake overgrown with juncus\\". Charlemagne supposedly resettled deported Saxons in the area. Archaeological excavations have produced Celtic leftovers as well as remains from the Urnfield culture and the Bronze Age giving proof of settlement as early as 1300 BC. The first official mentioning in modern times occurred in a private charter Urkunde HU Bamberg 335 - Hauptstaatsarchiv M√ºnchen on April 6, 1178 as bintlvke. Being part of the Prussian Principality of Bayreuth, Bindlach was ceded to France in 1807 following the Treaties of Tilsit. In 1810 it became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The town as it is known today was formed in 1818. Culture Bindlach's Protestant church St. Bartholomew was built in the baroque style between 1766 and 1768 by Carl Phillip von Gontard and Rudolf Heinrich Richter. The altar with integrated pulpit and the organ are of extraordinary beauty. Infrastructure Bindlach is situated on the Bayreuth‚ÄìNeuenmarkt-Wirsberg line and is served by local trains. The Autobahn A9 crosses through Bindlach at the western edge of the old part of the town, separating it from the newer parts built in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Bundesstra√üe 2 runs through the old part of the town linking Bayreuth and Bad Berneck. Bayreuth Airport is on top of the hills on the eastern side of town; despite the name on Bindlach territory. Military Overlooking Bindlach from the east, a large American military base was maintained on top of the hills east of Bindlach (Bindlacher Berg). Its official name was Christensen Barracks but it was jocularly called The Rock by the soldiers stationed there. The main function of the base was securing the borders to the GDR and Czechoslovakia, both borders being only 70 km (43 mls) away. This was home to the 1st Squadron, 2nd ACR, (2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)) from the late 1950s into the 1990s. The base closed down in the early 1990s after German reunification and the opening of the borders to the east.

It is a state-recognised climatic spa.  Geography  Fichtelberg lies on the southeastern slopes of the Ochsenkopf, the second highest summit of the Fichtelgebirge mountains, and the most populous place in the Fichtelgebirge Nature Park. Fichtelberg lies on a major European watershed. Two rivers rise above the suburb of Neubau, the White Main, one of the two headstreams of the Main, which flows westwards to the Rhine, and the Fichtelnaab, which flows south and enters the Danube. Since 1857 Fichtelberg has belonged to the Bavarian provinces of Upper Franconia.  Municipal divisions  * Fichtelberg * H√ºttstadl * Neubau  Neighbouring parish  The only parish that borders immediately on Fichtelberg is Mehlmeisel.  Etymology  The origin of the name Fichtelberg, as well as the Fichtelgebirge, is probably to be found in mining lore and not, as long suspected, its dense, spruce forests. At the time the name originated, pollen analysis shows that in the North Bavarian region mixed forests of beech, fir and spruce existed. It was only due to the mining and smelting industry, that hardwood species were decimated and faster-growing spruce was planted to supply wood for the mines. At first, only a mountain called Vythenberg where the St. Vitus mine was located, was mentioned in a charter of 1317; this later became the Ochsenkopf. The original name later evolved into the word Vichtel or Fichtel and was eventually used for the entire terrain of present-day Fichtelgebirge. The first written record of the Viechtlpergs dates to 1508.  History  The history of the site at Fichtelberg is dominated by ore mining of the mining company Erzgrube Gottesgab im Glei√üingerfels am Fichtelberg. In 1600 the uppermost reaches of the Fichtelnaab valley near the present villages of Neubau and Fichtelberg was still covered with a rugged, forest-covered wilderness. Finds, such as a serpentine pendant in 1922 on the Ochsenkopf or a stone axe head excavated in 1935 east of Fichtelberg, suggest that the area around Fichtelberg was already inhabited in the Neolithic period, at least by hunters passing through. The absence of other finds, however, rules out any permanent settlement until the beginning of the 17th century. This was probably due to the steep slopes and significantly higher altitude along with a harsh climate and less fertile soils. Iron ore mining in the upper Fichtelnaab valley began in 1478, but only a small settlement of a few houses extended from the south up to the outskirts of what is now Fichtelberg today. In 1602, Johann Glaser founded a company of six influential and financially powerful men, in order to work with them to begin mining on Glei√üingerfels (about halfway between the modern villages of H√ºtten und Neubau), to search for suitable iron ore lodes, smelt them in blast furnaces using the most modern and profitable methods of the day and to process them profitably. The wood that was needed in large quantities in the furnaces, forges, hammers and foundries, was available in the extensive forests of the region. There was also enough water at first for the water wheels of the ironworks; when eventually the available water finally became insufficient, they promptly drove channels from the highest headstreams of the Main and the Steinach, and diverted the water. One example was the Bocksgraben. A thriving iron industry rapidly developed. Iron ore was processed in the royal foundry. At first, the mines were open cast, because the ore veins were on the surface. But eventually these pits collected too much water and there were no powerful pumps at hand. So adits were driven to enable the water to drain out. These hand-hewn tunnels were so big, that a large man could easily walk through them. The mine on the Glei√üinger Fels was called Gottesgab am Fichtelberg as was the important mining office established later far up the Fichtelnaab valley. The first accommodation huts appeared, the beginnings of a now growing and thriving mining settlement, and four furnaces smelted the silver iron that was mined in the Fichtelberg area. At this time, the region around Fichtelberg was the most important mining operation in the Electorate of Bavaria. Fichtelberg came under the Amberg ' and the Waldeck district court (Landgericht) in the Electorate of Bavaria. The mining office had the legal status of a royal estate (Hofmark). In 1808 the Fichtelberg Mining Office, as a border region, changed hand repeatedly between the Kingdom of Bavaria and Margrave of Bayreuth. Since 1857, when the district of the then Bayreuth District Court was enlarged, it has been part of the province of Upper Franconia. Ore mining and smelting had been the economic factor in Fichtelberg, but with the beginning of industrialization, ore mining became less and less profitable. On 26 March 1859 work ceased and, in 1862, the mining company closed. It was initially followed by an economic decline which could only be partially compensated for by quarrying of granite and 'greenstone' (Proterobas), which had already since been worked on the Ochsenkopf massif since the beginning of the 17th century - and which was used especially for glass production - and by the timber industry. Many residents left the area. After the Second World War, settlers came, mainly glass blowers from Gablonz, and helped Fichtelberg to renewed prosperity as an industrial site based on the glass and button production. Since then it has largely lost its industrial importance, but survives because of its scenic location on the southwestern slope of the Ochsenkopf, mainly from tourism, and its function as a winter sports centre. The Glei√üinger Fels mines are the oldest in northern Bavaria and are the only silver iron (Silbereisen) mine in the world, which is still accessible to the public.

History=1976 Optonica amplifier (SM-3636) and tuner (ST-3636) from 1978. The Optonica brand was created and first launched by Sharp in 1976 to compete in the high-end audio market along with established brands such as Sansui Electric, Sony, Panasonic, Sanyo, Yamaha, Nakamichi, Onkyo, Fisher Electronics, Technics (brand), Pioneer Corporation, Kenwood Corporation, JVC, Harman Kardon and Marantz. The brand was designed and built by Sharp, not contracted out to another supplier, and all of the items offered were of high quality standards and built in Japan. Sharp Corporation was responsible for marketing the products. The first series of receivers, the SA-2121, SA-3131, SA-4141 and SA-5151, were designed and built with silver front faces, knobs and switches. The SA-5151 was the most powerful unit, with minimum ratings of 85 watts RMS per channel into 8 Ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz with no more than .09% T.H.D! The early line included a modest selection of AM-FM tuners and amplifiers that were of similar design and build characteristics as the receiver line. Model numbers for amps consist of SM-4646, SM-3636, and SM-1515. Tuners were analogue as were amps, and they consisted of ST-3636 and ST-1515. All amps and tuners were silver face plated with same switches and knobs. Cassette players and recorders were offered, most with the silver faceplates, but a small line known as the \\"designer series\\" offered a black faceplate in model number ST-1515B and SM-1515B for both tuner and amplifier respectively.Optonica sales catalogue OP-FB 10/77, pg. 5, 7, 24 One notable product during the first run was their direct drive turntable RP-3636 that is sought after by collectors and audiophiles today due to the unique construction of Mikage Granite Stone that was developed by Optonica for use in turntable design.Optonica sales catalogue OP-FB 10/77, pg. 26, 27 It was a compound that virtually eliminated feedback, thus preventing resonance from reaching the tonearm. The turntable was very heavy, weighing in at 35.4 pounds. 1979 - 1980 Optonica stereo receiver (Optonica SA-5605) The second series was offered in 1979 and the line was expanded and redesigned with products that covered the entire spectrum of the high end market. The receiver line consisted of model numbers SA-5901/5905, SA-5601/5605, SA-5401/5405, SA-5201/5205 and SA-5101/5105. The receivers were offered in both silver and black. The top of the line consisted of model numbers SA-5901 and SA-5905, and this series offered 125 watts minimum RMS per channel into 8 Ohms from 20 Hz-20kHz with no more than 0.02% T.H.D; Optonica sales brochure OP-FB 8/79, pg. 8, 9. One of the unique features of the top of line product SA-5901/5905 and SA-5601/5605 was the ability to turn off radio section while still using receiver as amplifier. The top of the line turntable RP-3636 was continued along with turntables from the original run. New tuners ST-4201/4205 were added to the existing line, and new amplifiers SM-3201/3205 were added. A computer controlled cassette deck RT-6501/6505 was introduced, but was shared with an identical model Sharp cassette deck. Component cabinets SY-9406 and SY-800U were offered and an array of handles for the various components. In 1980 the line was expanded again, introducing unique design features into the products. The most notable was the dual arm system turntable RP-7705, famous for an APLD (auto program locate device) that enabled the operator to select a cut on the album and the tone arm would automatically be placed on the desired song.Optonica sales brochure OP-FB 8/79, pg. 48, 49 This turntable had a sensor arm that was built next to the tonearm. RP-4705 turntable was similar, but without APLD system. During this period Optonica still offered analog AM- FM tuners and amplifiers, but new digital tuners and amps were now offered with a Toroidal power transformer that allowed for high performance in a smaller size, offering two to three times the capacity of conventional transformers. This allowed for the new digital tuners and receivers to be much smaller in size, compared with the conventional line of analogue receivers, amps and tuners. Model numbers consisted of ST-7405 and ST-4405 for tuners and SM-7305 and SM-4305 for amplifiers. The cassette recorder line was increased with unique computer-controlled devices, among them model number RT-6905.Optonica sales brochure OP-FB 8/79, pg. 30, 31 This cassette deck was large and heavy, weighing over 34lbs. The speaker line consisted of the original models offered in 1976, but model CP-5151 became CP-5151A, providing circuit protection. All products came with a two-year parts and labor guarantee, and the speakers were given a five-year guarantee. 1981-present The analogue audio equipment was discontinued. Digital systems were offered with matched components consisting of an electronic time processor, electronic tape processor, electronic tuning processor, electronic stereo control amplifier, and electronic power amplifier. They were beautifully and elegantly styled and modernistic in design, with the 9100 series as the top of the line.\\"Optonica The Art Of Silence\\" 1981-82, pg. 5. It was offered in silver and bronze colors, with lower output models being offered and sold as a complete system with matched components. The APLD turntable now offered model RP-9100 as a remote control turntable. A tape processor (RT-9100 H/HB) was offered, similar to the unit introduced in 1979.\\"Optonica The Art Of Silence\\" 1981-82, pg. 12. The speaker line was expanded with CP-9100HW the top offering, and lower output models matched to each lower output system, and others were available for separate use. Separate component digital receivers were available. Model SA-5107, SA-5207, and SA-5407 were offered and a unique high powered amp (SM-110H) incorporated a freon cooling system to keep unit cool. A last series of advanced turntable equipment was offered, most notably RP-114VL BLST, a linear tracking upright turntable, that could play both sides of a record without having to change sides. It was fully automatic and available in both silver and black. This technology was offered in many Sharp portable systems and stereo systems as well. The end would come to Optonica in 1982 as a competitor in the high end audio market, however the brand would emerge in 1988 as a high end line of stereo television receivers, portable cassette players and recorders, stereo Hi-Fi VCR's, voice activated remote controls for VCR's, and a limited number of surround sound receivers. Marketed for a few years, the line and brand would be discontinued in 1991. Products Optonica's products were mainly hi-fi components such as single and dual cassette decks, turntables, speakers, receivers and amplifiers. Later Optonica products released from 1988 to 1991 included 20\\", 27\\", 32\\" CRT TVs, and VHS / S-VHS VCRs.

Named for Lieutenant (junior grade) John Thomas Eversole, (a naval aviator who was killed in the opening phases of the Battle of Midway), she was the first of two U.S. Naval vessels to bear the name. The vessel was torpedoed and sunk on 28 October 1944. Construction and commissioning Eversole was laid down on 15 September 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding of Houston, Texas and launched on 3 December, sponsored by Mrs. Sarah R. Eversole, mother of Lieutenant (junior grade) Eversole. The ship was commissioned on 21 March 1944 with Lieutenant Commander G. E. Marix in command. Operational history Eversole sailed from Boston 20 May 1944 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 19 June. After training with submarines in the Hawaiian Islands, she made an escort voyage to Eniwetok, then sailed to Eniwetok and Manus on escort duty. She returned to Eniwetok for antisubmarine patrols until 9 August, when she put to sea screening carriers for the attack on Morotai. She continued this duty, serving with the escort carriers in the initial assaults in Leyte Gulf on 20 October. After the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Eversole rescued downed pilots, screened two of the damaged escort carriers, and took wounded off one of the carriers. In the early morning of 28 October, Eversole made contact by sonar with a submarine, and half a minute later suffered the first of two torpedo hits. The ship was ordered abandoned. After the men were all in the water, the submarine surfaced and opened fire, then dived once more. Five minutes later there was a tremendous underwater explosion which killed or wounded some of Eversoles crew. Lights from the survivors' flashlights attracted two other escorts, one of which rescued the 139 wounded survivors, as the other began a series of attacks which sank , presumably the Japanese submarine which had torpedoed Eversole. Honors Eversole received two battle stars for World War II service. Over 40 of her crew were lost with the ship.

The carcinomas can metastasize or become large enough to interfere with the host's ability to eat, causing starvation. Richard E. Shope investigated the horns and discovered the virus in 1933, an important breakthrough in the study of papillomaviruses and neoplasia. The virus was originally discovered in cottontail rabbits in the Midwestern U.S., but can also infect brush rabbits, black-tailed jackrabbits, snowshoe hares, and European rabbits. History Richard Edwin Shope discovered the Shope papillomavirus Engraving from Tableau Encyclopedique et Methodique, 1789. In the 1930s, hunters in northwestern Iowa reported that the rabbits they shot had several \\"horn\\" protrusions on many parts of their bodies including their faces and necks. The virus is also a possible source of myths about the jackalope, a rabbit with the horns of an antelope, and related cryptids such as the wolpertinger. Stories and illustrations of horned rabbits appear in scientific treatises dating back many years, such as the Tableau encyclop√©dique et m√©thodique, from 1789. The Iowa reports led cancer researcher Richard E. Shope to investigate, and he discovered the virus in 1933. He separated the virus from horny warts on cottontail rabbits, and made one of the first mammalian tumor virus discoveries. Shope determined the protrusions were keratinous carcinomas due to the infection of CRPV. Shope's research led to the development of the first mammalian model of a cancer caused by a virus. He was able to isolate virus particles from tumors on captured animals and use these to inoculate domestic rabbits, which then developed similar tumors. This has contributed to our understanding of fundamental mechanisms in neoplasia, or the formation of a new, abnormal growth of tissue. The virus was sequenced in 1984, showing substantial sequence similarities to HPV1a. It has been used as a model for human papillomaviruses both before and after this discovery. The most visible example of this role is the HPV vaccine, which was developed based on and incorporating research done using the virus as a model. Similarly, it has been used to investigate antiviral therapies.  Genome  There is a lack of specific data about the reproductive cycle of papillomaviruses. Research is not conclusive about which coding regions are expressed before or after replication of viral DNA. The E1 region should carried the DNA required for cis and/or trans. E1 is the largest Open reading frame, which is the set of codons in the genome that code for proteins, encoding a 602 base protein. E1 is similar to COOH-terminal domain of the Simian virus 40, plays a role in viral DNA replication maintaining plasmids within a cell. Results have found that CRPV and BPV1 are found in the same location of the genome, which indicates that papillomaviruses likely have similar methods of replicating their genomes outside of a chromosome. A notable difference between the genomes of the four strains is that the E6 protein is almost twice as long in the CRPV as in any of the other strains of papillomaviruses. The E6 protein is somewhat homologous with a family of ATP syntheses that are found in mitochondria of cattle. The homology is significant enough to imply an evolutionary relationship between E6 and the beta chain of the ATP synthase family; however, they do not have the same function or enzyme activity. The E2 protein overlaps with the E4 open reading frames in the other papillomaviruses. These differences in the E2 proteins likely determine how oncogenic a virus is. The noncoding region has a homologies with BPV1. Other homologies exist, such as the fact that all papillomaviruses have repeated sequences in the noncoding parts of their genomes. CRPV has some notable repeats, some as long as 32 base pairs. Many pairs up stream of the transcription locations are homologous with promoter sequences in of SV40.  Life cycle = Replication cycle and transcription  The papillomavirus life cycle begins with cells actively multiplying in epithelial cells of basal and parabasal layers. The differentiation of these cells is necessary for this virus to complete its life cycle. Transforming proteins E6 and E7 induce the S-phase in the lower epithelial layers. Viral replication proteins E1 and E2 are also required to form the papilloma and keep the episomal viral genome replication low. Genome amplification will be restrained until viral replication proteins increase and several viral proteins are co-expressed. The infected, differentiating cells travel towards the epithelial surface during the viral cycle's late stage. In the upper epithelial layers, the promoter activity is altered during the virus‚Äô production. E4 proteins are expressed, and viral DNA amplification starts in the differentiated cells. Following this, the L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins are expressed and the infectious virions begin to assemble. Expression of the papillomavirus E4 protein correlates with the onset of viral DNA amplification. Using a mutant cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (SPV) genome incapable of expressing the viral E4 protein, it has been shown that E4 is required for the productive stage of the SPV life cycle in New Zealand White and cottontail rabbits.  Assembly and release  The virus particles are assembled in the upper epithelium. The virus capsomere icosahedral shell is packaged with an 8000 base pair genome, 360 L1 protein copies, and 12 copies of L2 proteins inside. L2 proteins gather at PML body nuclear structures and recruit L1 proteins during virus assemblage. L2 proteins are not necessary for assemblage, but it is possible that they augment packaging and infectivity. Capsid proteins have been thought to also gather at the PML bodies during packaging. Transmittance of the Papillomavirus requires release from the infected skin cell at the epithelial surface, as they are non-lytic. They are resistant to desiccation, enhancing their survivability during extracellular transfer between hosts. Cornified squame release from the surface of epithelial cells may also contribute to their survival. Immune detection of the virus in the host may also be hindered by antigen retention until the virus reaches upper epithelial cells.  Modulation of host processes  When Richard E. Shope began his research on SPV, little was known about the natural transmission of the virus vectors and interactions of the virus on its hosts. In the lab setting, Shope worked with the virus‚Äô natural host, the cottontail rabbit. Particularly, he worked with the cottontails of Iowa and other western states of the United States. He worked with these species because it was discovered that SPV had a restricted geographic range and was confined to the high plains of the western United States. Therefore, the major host species of SPV is the cottontail rabbit of the western United States. Cottontail rabbits in Shope's lab usually were infected with the virus through parasites such as rabbit ticks. When infected with SPV, hosts develop papillomas on hair-bearing skin, usually around the face and neck. Shope found through his research that rabbit epidermal cell transformation by SPV requires interaction with mesenchymal cells. It was further found that mesenchymal types support papillomatous transformation. Shope's research also investigated how vitamin A deficiencies or excess might affect host susceptibility to SPV. Shope found that deficiencies in vitamin A did not affect the relative growth of the papillomas, but in cases where there was excesses of vitamin A Shope papillomas were inhibited. Therefore, when SPV infects a host, vitamin A plays an important role in the host/virus interactions.  Location in the host  Fluorescent antibody study identified the locations of viral antigens in wild rabbit papillomas. They were present only in the nucleus of keratohyaline and keratinized layer cells, and not deeper down in proliferating epithelial cells. In domesticated rabbits, the viral antigens were present in much smaller quantity in only superficial, keratinized layers. The investigation proposed that the virus is only present in proliferating cell nuclei during early development, containing a deficient amount of proteins and mostly nucleic acid. The proteins may be immunologically specific in order keep its transmissibility, making it a masked virus.  Associated viruses  Most homologous papillomaviruses are actually CRPV and HPV1a. This is possibly because both of these viruses target the skin. From an evolutionary perspective, CRPV and HPV1a could have diverged recently, or they could have converged due to their similar target. CRPV is a member of the papillomaviruses so it is related to all viruses in this family.  Tropism  Infection of a rabbit's follicular cell, often occurs in locations including ears, nose, eyelids, and the anus. The infection first appears as a red and swollen area on the skin, followed by development of circular papilloma warts and keratinized horny warts. Although transmission between rabbits is high, the tumors themselves do not contain the infectious virus. 25% of Papilloma infections become malignant and form squamous cell carcinoma. Metastases can form in the lungs and lymph nodes, and if it advances further, can develop in the kidneys and the liver. Rabbit Papilloma displays tropism for the cutaneous epithelium. Warts are made up of nearly homogenous vertical tissue strands. Their outer coloration is typically black or greyish, and cut sections are usually white or pinkish white with a flesh-like center. Dark coloration is due to abundant melanin pigment. The warts are made up of several tight, branching, threadlike epidermis processes connected by narrow tissue cores. These growth structures indicate that the growth occurs simultaneously at several different centers, causing the surrounding tissue to bulge from the growth's lateral pressure. The normal epithelium abruptly transitions into a narrow zone of rapidly thickening epithelial layers, made up of rapidly multiplying cells. Rabbits re-infected with the virus exhibit some or complete immunity, and can transmit the virus to other wild rabbits, and from wild to domestic rabbits. A domestic strain cannot transmit it to another domestic rabbit, however. Immunologically, the papillomatosis virus is not related to fibroma or myxoma in rabbits.

In recent years Arnschwang has focused on the production of environmentally friendly energy from biomass and water.  Geography = Position  The municipality Arnschwang is situated in between the Bavarian Forest and the Bohemian Forest approximately 16 kilometres northeast of the town of Cham in the valley of the river Chamb.  History = Early history  The earliest inhabitants around Arnschwang left the Celts visible traces in the first century BC. In the so-called Castle Wood (\\"Burgholz\\") towards Zenching is a well-preserved Celtic square enclosure, which might probably have served for religious purposes or as a central meeting or court place for the village communities in the area.Prof. Dr. Alois Schmid: Die Viereckschanze von N√∂√üwartling. In: Festschrift und Dorfchronik der Ortschaften N√∂√üwartling und Grasfilzing. Freiwillige Feuerwehr N√∂√üwartling 1998, pg. 58-61. From the point of language of these first historical inhabitants can derive, by the way, also the river Chamb - the village Arnschwang its name: \\"wang\\" is meant flat field, meadow. This ending is preceded by the personal name \\"Aruni\\". Pastures in the near Chamb valley gave Arnschwang its name.Werner Perlinger: Arnschwang in fr√ºher Zeit. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 44-45. From the \\"pasturage of the Aruni\\", \\"Aruni-wang\\" became \\"Arinswanch\\", during the 14th century then \\"Orenswanch\\" and, finally \\"Arnschwang\\".Wolf-Armin Frhr. v. Reitzenstein: Lexikon Bayerischer Ortsnamen.C.H.Beck Verlag, 2006, pg. 20-21.  Origin of the parish  After establishment of monastery in Chamm√ºnster a church could have been founded few decades later also in Arnschwang in the year 795.Paul Mai: 1200 Jahre Pfarrei Arnschwang. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 23. The extraordinary size of the parish and the Upper Paladinate rare Martin¬¥s patronage of the church are strong indications of such an early establishment of the church.Max Heitzer: Arnschwang: Standort f√ºr eine karolinische K√∂nigskirche. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 32-35. It means that the parish Arnschwang is the first bifurcated parish from Chamm√ºnster. From the parish Arnschwang the town of Furth im Wald was bifurcated and made into independent parish in the year 1585 and finally the village Dalking in 1697.Max Heitzer: Die Pfarrei Arnschwang. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 123-124.  Castle and village in the Middle Ages  The first mention of Arnschwang is documented 1173. At that time a knightly vassal of the margrave of Cham was called like this village.Max Piendl: Landgericht Cham. In: Historischer Atlas von Bayern. vol.8, 1955, pg. 33.Moated Castle Arnschwang 1607 At this time the still recognizable structure of the village with the both settlement poles were established: The church with an impressive fortification on the highest point of the old village and the moated castle lying below the Chamb with farmyard and mill. After the family of the Arnschwanger followed in the 14th century the family of the Kaelbl and later the P√ºdensdorfer and the Sattelbogner. In the year 1426, the area was repeatedly attacked and pillaged by invading Hussites. When Emperor Henry was defeated with a large army in Bohemia in 1431 only Erasmus Sattelbogner, the knight of Arnschwang brought back his forces again.Werner Perlinger: Arnschwang im 15. Jahrhundert - eine st√ºrmischen Epoche. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 59-60. The folk theatre which is performed annually as The dragons sting of Furth im Wald - the so-called \\"Further Drachenstich\\" references to this event during the Hussite riots. In 1489 the noble knight of Arnschwang Sigmund von Sattelbogen and several other knights rebelled in the so-called \\"L√∂wlerkrieg\\" against the duke of Bavaria. As a result, Arnschwang was looted and the castle was destroyed.Werner Perlinger: Arnschwang im 15. Jahrhundert - eine st√ºrmische Epoch. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg. 64. Between 1527 and 1612 Arnschwang was in the possession of the Franconian noble family Fuchs von Wallburg.Max Piendl: Landgericht Cham. In: Historischer Atlas von Bayern. vol.8, 1955, pg.34. In the 30 Years War Swedish troops invaded and looted the village twice. In 1633 the plague inflicted Arnschwang and 280 lost their lives. At this grave situation and catastrophe, the people of Arnschwang vowed to make a pilgrimage to the Mother of God in Wei√üenregen close to K√∂tzting every year.Moated Castle Arnschwang around 1700 by Michael Wening  Arnschwang in the Early Modern period  In 1722 Alois Bonaventura, Earl of Kreuth took over the Hofmark Arnschwang. In this time the grand gallery above the vestry of the parish church was created, it can be admired till today. In 1801 Baron von V√∂lderndorff acquired the estate Arnschwang. He started to build up a sugar factory, tried with the manufacturing of glass and boiled, finally vinegar also. 1826 took over the Bavarian government the estate and sold the possessions afterwards to different private individuals.  Disastrous fire in 1858  On St. Michael, 29 September 1858, almost the entire village was destroyed by a fierce fire. The destruction was so severe that the school building, the parsonage and 41 houses with 142 shops burnt down, and 240 people became homeless. With a help of a nationwide collection the village was rebuilt.Alois Heitzer: Der gro√üe Arnschwanger Dorfbrand an Michaeli 1858. In: Historischer Verein Furth i.W. und Umgebung. vol. 7, 1996, pg. 171-193.  The modern municipality  In the course of the municipality reform in Bavaria the largest parts of the municipalities of Zenching and N√∂√üwartling were added to Arnschwang on 1 July 1972. pg 440 After bitter opposition by the citizens of Arnschwang the affiliation of the village to the administrative community Weiding was taken back after few years again. Now since 1985 Arnschwang is an independent municipality again.  Politics = Coat of arms  Blazon: Azure, a lowered silver waved bar growing to the golden haloed St. Martin with a red garment and a silver coat, the cut with the sword of the blue coat, on the top left coming a gold, red and silver divided split plaque. The coat of arms was approved at the 19th of April 1984 by the government of Upper Palatinate. The community of Arnschwang is located at the Chamb (wave beams) in the bassin of Furth and has a very old St. Martin¬¥s church. In the center of the coat of arms, therefore, the patron St. Martin was put. Besides, his sword should also have symbolic meaning, because the municipality area was often affected by war events. Especially during the Hussite Wars (1419‚Äì1433), the village had to suffer a lot. The former owner of the Hofmark Arnschwang, Erasmus von Sattelbogen has made a name to himself by his heroic fight against the Hussits. Hence the family coat of arms (divided by gold, red, silver) of the Sattelbogner family which became extinct in the 15th century, also found admission in the coat of arms. The affiliation to the territory of the Wittelsbach family is underscored by the silver and blue tinge.Heinrich Blab: Von der Hofmark zur modernen Gemeinde. In: Kirche und Gemeinde Arnschwang. 1995, pg.233.  Traffic = Road  Through the municipality area runs the route of the Federal Highway 20 which leads from Cham to the German-Czech border.  Railroad  Arnschwang owns a railway station in the section Cham-Furth im Wald. It is served almost every hour by the regional trains of the Oberpfalzbahn.  Air traffic  Close to Arnschwang a small airfield is located at the coordinates 49 16 19,2 N / 12 46 48,0 E.

It was first published in 1961 and received a Newbery Honor award in 1962. The novel is set in ancient Egypt around 1400 B.C., and tells the story of a young Egyptian boy named Ranofer who tries to reveal an evil crime and reshape his life. Plot summary Ranofer is an orphaned 12-year-old boy whose mother had died at birth. Ranofer had learned many things at a goldsmith's shop with his father Thutra. Without his half brother, Gebu, he would be living on the streets. His evil half brother beats and mistreats Ranofer. Ranofer has to stay with Gebu because his father, Thutra, died when he was young. His father knew Zau, the master goldsmith well. When the tallies of gold sweepings do not add up, Ranofer tries to figure out why. He determines that Ibni the Babylonian porter is smuggling gold to Gebu through wineskins that Ranofer unknowingly carries home. Ranofer tries to stop this, but Gebu forces him to continue, threatening to beat again and sell him into slavery. Ranofer makes two new friends, the Ancient and Heqet, but things take a turn for the worse when Gebu moves him to his stone cutting shop to be an apprentice after Ibni is caught. Ranofer doesn't like the job as much as his dream where he is to be apprentice by Zau, the master goldsmith. With the help of his new friends, Ranofer discovers that someone else is stealing gold at night after getting suspicious again. After Heqet suggests they work together to spy on Gebu and his evil helpers, they meet in a thicket near the river, share food, and talk about what they have heard during midday when Ranofer gets a break from his awful job at the stonecutters' shop. Ranofer breaks into Gebu's room and discovers a golden goblet which could not come from the area. Ranofer realizes that Gebu has been tomb robbing by the markings at the bottom which say the name of a pharaoh, Thutmose the Conqueror. Also with that evidence he realizes that no one can get as rich as Gebu was getting in one day which supports his theory. He asks the Ancient how tomb robbers are caught, and the Ancient replies, \\"They must be followed\\". Ranofer knows from Heqet's eavesdropping that Gebu will be going on another tomb robbing session during the upcoming feast, but keeps his findings to himself. Ranofer follows Gebu to the burial chamber. Meanwhile, Heqet and the Ancient have also gone to the Valley of the Kings looking for Ranofer, putting puzzle pieces together where he has gone and why. Ranofer runs out of the tomb after extinguishing the robbers' torch and one of the giant steps crumbles, trapping Gebu and his companion Wenamon. Ranofer put a boulder on top of the entrance, and then finds Heqet and the Ancient, who sit on the boulder while Ranofer returns to town. He manages to get into the palace, and tries to get an audience with the queen but is stopped by the palace guards. Qa-nefer, the queen's dwarf &\\"pet\\", believes his story although he finds Ranofer a little crazy. Ranofer finally gets an audience with the queen, and after telling her about the golden goblet with Thutmose's name on it, she decides to test his truthfullness about the tomb robbery by asking him, \\"What was the object leaning against the north wall of my parents' burial chamber?\\" Ranofer answers, \\"Majesty, it was your father's oaken staff,\\" and the queen immediately sends out soldiers, who catch Gebu & Wenamon. Finally, the queen asks what Ranofer wants most in the world. \\"A donkey,\\" Ranofer said, \\"so that I may earn a living for myself like the Ancient, be a student of Zau the Gold Master & make fine jewellery for Your Sublime Majesty.\\" He then trots off on his magnificent new donkey and the book ends with him meeting with the Ancient and Heqet, having changed around his life circumstances. Historical accuracy Very little is known about the lives of Egyptian artisans at the time of Thutmose was robbed about 200 years before the time of the novel. The tomb of Yuya and Tuya was discovered in 1905. The tomb had been penetrated, but was mostly intact. The discoverer, James Quibell, assumed that the robbers might have been disturbed in their act, giving the novel an interesting historical sense. Reception Kirkus Reviews called it \\"an exhilarating story\\" and noted \\"We are given a most worthy hero in Ranofer ...

Its name was used for the town portrayed in the film adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel, The Last Picture Show.  Geography  Anarene is located at .  History  Anarene was founded on the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad in 1908, the same year the Belknap Coal Company opened a coal mine in nearby Newcastle. It was named for Anna Laurene Graham, the daughter of pioneer settler J. M. Keen.Tarpley, Fred 1001 Texas Place Names, (1980) Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, p. 10 Keen began ranching in the area after serving in the Confederate Army in the American Civil War. Anarene's primary industry was the transportation of coal from the Newcastle mine. An oil field was discovered nearby in 1921. In 1929, Anarene had a population of 100, a store, a schoolhouse, a post office, a blacksmith shop, a filling station, and a two- story hotel. By 1933 the population had declined to 20. In 1942, coal production ended at the Newcastle mine. The Anarene railroad station closed in 1951, and the railway itself was abandoned in 1954. The same year marked the end of production at the Anarene oil field. The post office, established in 1909, was discontinued in 1955.Schmidt, Walter G. An Encyclopaedia of Texas Post Offices (1993) Chicago, Illinois: The Collectors' Club of Chicago, p. 38  Popular culture  The town portrayed in the 1971 film adaptation of The Last Picture Show is called \\"Anarene\\", although it is called \\"Thalia\\" in Larry McMurtry's novel. The film was actually made some 8 miles (13 km) to the north of Anarene, in McMurtry's hometown of Archer City, which is widely believed to have been the model for McMurtry's \\"Thalia\\". Director Peter Bogdanovich intended the film as an homage to Howard Hawks' Red River, set in Abilene, Kansas, and chose the name Anarene to evoke a correspondence. Anarene also appears in Bogdanovich's 1990 adaptation of McMurtry's sequel, Texasville.

Weltlich coached 22 seasons with a career record of 300‚Äì335. He was head coach at the University of South Alabama, Florida International University (FIU), University of Texas, and University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). Weltlich is one of only 19 coaches to lead three different programs to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Coaching career=Indiana Weltlich got his degree in education from Ohio State University in 1967 and was set to teach. But he met Army coach Bob Knight in Orrville, Ohio. Knight hired him as an assistant at Army, then took him to Indiana University, where in 1976 he helped coach a 32‚Äì0 team to the NCAA title. Ole Miss Weltlich left Indiana to become the head coach at the University of Mississippi. Weltlich manned the Rebel sidelines for six years (1977‚Äì1982) and directed Ole Miss to an SEC Tournament title and the program‚Äôs postseason debut in 1981. One episode of his aggressive coaching style, foreshadowing criticism levied against him later in his career, followed the team splitting two games in Illinois in 1979; after an all-night marathon bus/plane/bus trip that arrived back on campus on Christmas Day, Weltlich had the team dress for a tape session and practice. (This is described from player Sean Tuohy's point of view in both Michael Lewis' 2006 book The Blind Side, pp. 55‚Äì56; and Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy's own 2010 book \\"In a Heartbeat, Sharing The Power of Cheerful Giving\\", p. 48,) Upon setting up the projector to watch film (at 10 am on Christmas Day), Weltlich leaned into Tuohy's ear and said, \\"Hey Twelve, Merry Fucking Christmas.\\" Texas In 1982, second- year Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds hired Weltlich from Ole Miss to serve as the next Texas Longhorns men's basketball head coach. Nicknamed \\"Kaiser Bob\\" by Longhorn fans for his harshly disciplinarian approach, Weltlich was almost immediately faced with such a manpower shortage from the departures ‚Äî both voluntary and involuntary ‚Äî of so many Texas players that he famously had to press Texas male cheerleader Lance Watson into service during the Longhorns' abysmal 6‚Äì22 season of 1982‚Äì83.\\"Texas basketball from A to Z,\\" Austin American-Statesman Weltlich coached the US national team in the 1982 FIBA World Championship, winning the silver medal.1982 USA Basketball Weltlich's next three teams posted yearly improvements in overall records, with the 1985‚Äì86 team ‚Äî which finished with a 19‚Äì12 mark and a share of the Southwest Conference Championship ‚Äî representing the zenith of his tenure at Texas. After his teams finished 14‚Äì17 and 16‚Äì13 in the 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88 seasons, respectively, Weltlich was dismissed with two years remaining on his contract.\\"Timeline: A history of Texas basketball,\\" Austin American-Statesman Weltlich compiled a 77‚Äì98 record during six seasons as the head coach at Texas. None of his six teams managed an appearance in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament; only the 1985‚Äì86 team participated in postseason competition, losing 71‚Äì65 to Ohio State in the second round of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). FIU Weltlich served as head coach at Florida International University (FIU) from 1990 to 1995. Under Weltlich, the Panthers made their lone appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 1995, losing to Jim Harrick's UCLA Bruins, 92‚Äì56, in the field of 64. Weltlich had already announced his resignation effective at the end of the season, and notably said during the post-game interviews \\"If anyone knows of any openings out there, my number is...\\". South Alabama The 17-year coaching veteran was named the interim coach at the University of South Alabama on October 27, 1997 following Bill Musselman sudden resignation on October 7, 1997. Weltlich coached the Jags from 1997 to 2002 and compiled a record of 81-65 and three 20-win seasons. He resigned from South Alabama after the 2002 season, but he and his family remained in Fairhope, Alabama, where he is a middle school teacher, trying to complete the 10 years of service he needs to qualify for retirement from the state of Alabama.

The house is one of the few surviving buildings in the City of London dating from before the Great Fire of London in 1666. It is a Grade II* Listed Building. History The site was once owned by the Templars, but after the dissolution of the Order of St John, the building was rebuilt in 1610 and became a tavern called Prince's Arms. This coincided with the investiture of Prince Henry, son of James I, as Prince of Wales. During the 17th century, the house was known as the Fountain Inn and was visited by Samuel Pepys on 14 October 1661. He wrote \\"In the afternoon Captain Ferrers and I walked abroad to several places; among others, to Mr. Pim's my Lord's tailors and there he went out with us to the Fountain tavern and did give us store of wine.\\" On 28 November 1661, Pepys wrote \\"to the Fountain tavern and there stayed till 12 at night, drinking and singing, Mr. Symons and one Mr. Agar singing very well. Then Mr. Gauden, being almost drunk, had the wit to be gone; and so I took leave too\\" During the early 19th century a famous exhibition \\"Mrs Salmon's Waxworks\\" was held in the front part of the house, whilst the tavern continued in the rear. The house became the property of the London County Council in 1900 with the aid of a contribution from the City of London Corporation.Gibbon and Bell, History of the London County Council, 1889‚Äì1939 (London: Macmillan & Co., 1939), p. 484 It later passed to the City of London Corporation, which administers the property now. It is currently only viewable when special events are held there, and the City of London Corporation has recently completed a consultation with interested parties regarding the room's usage. The main feature is the fine and rare highly decorated Jacobean plaster ceiling, with the Prince of Wales's feathers and the initials \\"PH\\" in the centre. There is one wall of original Jacobean wood panelling left; the other panelling is Georgian. The unexceptional fireplace has a wood surround and panelling above, with an inscription above recording the connection with the diarist and great naval administrator, Samuel Pepys. There are also fine leaded lights with coats of arms and badges, best seen from within the room. From 1975, the room was a museum which hosted a Samuel Pepys exhibition ‚Äî Pepys was born in Fleet Street in 1633. The Samuel Pepys Club financed much of the original 1975 exhibition. The museum was closed to the public after a decade or so and is now empty of all furniture save for a large table. In the late 18th century it was a coffee house called Nando's. Lord Thurlow frequented the place before he went on to practise law in the 1770s. It later became a hairdressers and a plaque used to state it was once the home or palace of Henry the VIII also Cardinal Wolsey lived there.

Alcal√° was born in the City of Oaxaca in 1831. He showed an early interest in music, and began attending a school established by Professor Jos√© Domingo Martinez. His musical talent was soon evident, and he learned to play the piano, cello, viola, flute and ophicleide. He was an accomplished musician with all these instruments, but his main instrument was the violin. As a violinist, he was in demand not only in the churches, but also at popular dances and social gatherings. His persistence and dedication were rewarded by a scholarship from the State of Oaxaca, allowing him to continue his studies in Mexico City. At the conclusion of his studies he returned to Oaxaca, where he became a member of the Philharmonic Society of Santa Cecilia, an orchestra specializing in the performance of works of regional composers. A short time later he became the director of the Banda de M√∫sica de Oaxaca. The Macedonio Alcala Theater in Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico. A few years later he moved to Yanhuitl√°n. On July 30, 1854, Alcal√°, 23, married Petronila Palacios, 21, of Yanhuitl√°n. They had three children, two boys and a girl. Although he was recognized as an accomplished musician, he was unable to earn enough money in the profession to support his family. This led to depression and alcoholism. He intended to return to Oaxaca, but fell ill. His brothers refused to help, but the Philharmonic Society of Santa Cecilia came to his aid, supplying a doctor, medicines, and other forms of support. During his convalescence, a delegation of Indigenous from a nearby town, Tlacolula, arrived with the request that he compose a waltz in honor of the Virgin Mary, patron of their town. Although still far from well, Alcal√° worked hard on the waltz, \\"Dios nunca muere\\". It was a huge success from the first time it was played in public, and the town was very grateful. About 1867 he became professor of music at the Hacienda de la Concepci√≥n. He died in 1869 in Oaxaca. After his death his brother Bernab√© published \\"Dios nunca muere\\" under his own name, but natives of Tlacolula protested, and demonstrated that the work was really by Macedonio. The waltz is now the unofficial state anthem of Oaxaca. Oaxaque√±os stand when they hear it. Alcal√° was said to be passionate and high-strung, characteristics that distinguished his playing and his compositions. But he passed his life struggling with poverty, disease and alcoholism. Few of his compositions survive, because he was remiss in transcribing his improvisations. Among the surviving works are \\"Marcha Funebre\\" (Funeral March), \\"Solo dios en los cielos\\" (Only God in Heaven), \\"El Cohete\\" (The Rocket), \\"Ave Maria\\" and of course the well-known waltz \\"Dios nunca muere\\". He died in Oaxaca in 1869, at the age of 37. A theater and a street are named for him in that city.

Near Lautertal, there was between 1952 and 1992 a DECCA-transmitter. Geography Lautertal is in the north of the district of Coburg between the state of Thuringia and Coburg. The municipality consists of the six villages Unterlauter, Oberlauter, Tiefenlauter, Neukirchen, Tremersdorf and Rottenbach. The Buchberg (close to Rottenbach) is the highest elevation in the district. Infrastructure=Car Lautertal has two junctions to Bundesautobahn 73 motorway in the north and south. The former route of the Bundesstra√üe 4 is the longest main road of the village. Rail Transport The Eisenach- Lichtenfels railway line, also known as the Werra Valley Railway, ran through Lautertal until the 1970s. There was a train station in Tiefenlauter. Due to the fact that Thuringia belonged to the GDR, the train traffic was separated, later the route had to be abandoned. A reactivation is demanded by many, however the municipality is against it. Public Transport Oberlauter and Unterlauter are connected to Coburg by city bus line 2. The additional line 8318 connects all the other villages with Coburg.

Geographical Location Sonnefeld lies on Bundesstra√üe 303 between Coburg and Kronach and also between the Thuringian Forest and the Lichtenfels Forest. Municipal Division The municipality of Sonnefeld is divided in eleven districts: {valign=\\"top\\" * Bieberbach * Firmelsdorf * Gestungshausen * Hassenberg * Neuses am Brand * Oberwasungen * Sonnefeld * Weickenbach * Weischau * W√∂rlsdorf * Zedersdorf } History The first documented mention of Sonnefeld was in the year 1252. In 1260, a Cistercian nunnery was founded in Ebersdorf bei Coburg by Henry II von Sonneberg with the help from the nuns from Maidbronn. Three years later, in 1263, the nearby hamlet of Hofst√§dten became the property of the nunnery. When it burned to the ground in 1287, a new abbey was built and consecrated in Hofst√§dten for the nuns. In 1299, the villages of Weidhausen and Tr√ºbenbach were given to Sonnefeld Abbey in an exchange of properties with Bamberg. A church was added between 1330 and 1349 in the High Gothic style and became the Klosterkirche (monastery church). In 1526, the abbey was dissolved as a result of the Reformation. Since then, Sonnefeld has been an Evangelical Lutheran parish. The Thirty Years' War destroyed most of the houses and buildings in Sonnefeld and Hofst√§dten so the reconstruction was slow but steady. It got a big boost from the grant of market privileges by Duke Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg. In 1705, the district of Sonnefeld came to the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. In 1769, the parish church was rebuilt. In 1826, the district of Sonnefeld was given to the Duchy of Saxe Coburg and Gotha in the redistribution of lands between the surviving Saxon duchies. On 1 May 1851 the cantor Karl Herold founded a children's festival. On 23 June 1889 Sonnefeld and Hofst√§dten were merged as a single town under the name of Sonnefeld. In the same year, a war memorial was unveiled in the town square (Marktplatz), and the first railway line opened at Sonnefeld in 1901. During World War I, Sonnefeld had to surrender three church bells and the pipes of the church's organ to the war effort but they were replaced and dedicated in 1919 and 1924 respectively. On 1 June 1920, the dissolution of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha sent the district of Coburg, including Sonnefeld, to Bavaria. Before World War II, 1400 people were counted in Sonnefeld but in 1966 the population was down to 980 residents in 556 households. However, the subsequent additions, a total of 10 villages, to the municipality increased the population to 5,300. Coat of arms Blazon: Per fess azure and argent (divided horizontally in blue and white, with the top in blue), in chief a church argent roofed gules (with a profile of a white church with red roofs) and in base an oak tree erased proper. (The church is the former abbey church of Sonnefeld and the oak is the traditional symbol of Hofst√§dten). Politics The Town Council has 20 members. The municipal elections of 2008 led to the following distribution of the seats in the council: 8 seats for CSU, 7 seats for SPD, and 5 seats for Independents. Economy Until the 19th Century, Sonnefeld was primarily an agricultural village. Then basketmaking became the main business of the village, with products exported all over the world. After the end of World War I, workshops were created to make willow chairs, wicker furniture, baby carriages, and upholstered furniture. They were the ones that eventually replaced basketmaking. They were joined by industrial jobs in nearby towns and villages in the post-World War II boom. The prosperity made it possible for Sonnefeld to add a water supply system, a fully biological sewage treatment plant, an elementary school with a gym, and a heated swimming pool. Other Facts In Sonnefeld, Itzgr√ºndisch, a Main-Franconian dialect of the German language, is spoken.

Weidhausen was initially part of the Kloster monastery, later the Coburg principality, and then Bavaria in 1920. A manor was acquired by Georg von Erffa in Weidhausen in 1651. The two eagle wings in Weidhausen's coat of arms came from the crest of this family. The district of Tr√ºbenbach is represented in the coat of arms through the stream (using the 'bach' portion of its name, meaning 'stream' in German) with waves. The district of Neuensorg, whose residents were employed in forestry, were symbolized through the inclusion of wood cutting tools, the felling axe and the adze. The colors of gold and blue refer to the colors of Baron von Erffa. The colors of silver and red commemorate the membership of the community to the bishopric of Bamberg.

He is considered one of the architects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, and has also influenced immigration reform and abstinence education policy. Rector has written over 300 reports, articles, and commentaries on public policy and has testified before Congress more than 40 times. His writings include the book America's Failed $5.4 Trillion War on Poverty. Background Rector received his undergraduate degree from The College of William & Mary and his masters in political science from Johns Hopkins University. Rector has worked for The Heritage Foundation since 1984. He is the editor of the 1987 book, Steering the Elephant: How Washington Works, and the co-author of the 1995 book, America's Failed $5.4 Trillion War on Poverty. Rector has been a management analyst for the United States Office of Personnel Management and a legislative assistant in the Virginia House of Delegates. From 2001 to 2002, he served as a commissioner of the Millennial Housing Commission. Welfare reform Rector is a leading expert on conservative poverty and welfare reform policy. He has testified before Congress and written extensively on the subject. Rector played a major role in the design and crafting of the welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, which marked a significant shift in American welfare policy. Early in the reform process, the Wall Street Journal called Rector the ‚Äúleading guru‚Äù behind the Republican position on welfare, stating, ‚Äúto understand what Republicans are trying to do about welfare, don‚Äôt look to Newt Gingrich. Watch Robert Rector.‚Äù Rector promoted work and marriage as primary means to reduce material poverty and improve the well-being of the poor. His writing frequently expresses deep concern over the decline of marriage and rise of non-marital child bearing in low income communities and argues that dependence on welfare has harmed American society by discouraging marriage. He insists that welfare reform should seek to promote married two parent families. Rector has written frequently on the subjects of welfare and poverty, including the 1992 The Wall Street Journal article \\"America's Poverty Myth\\", which asserted that the US Census inaccurately measures poverty, and his 1995 book with William Lauber, America's Failed $5.4 Trillion War on Poverty, which criticized welfare laws in the US for allegedly rewarding breakdowns in family values. In 1995, The Wall Street Journal called Rector the \\"leading guru\\" behind the Republicans' position on welfare. In 2006, editor Rich Lowry of the conservative National Review called Rector, \\"the intellectual godfather\\" of welfare reform. Immigration reform=Role in opposing the 2006 immigration reform proposals Rector has been a researcher on immigration policy and has testified before Congress on the subject. In 2006, Rector published a report on the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act for The Heritage Foundation, stating that passage of the bill would lead to more than 100 million new legal immigrants within 20 years. Based on the report's findings, the Senate amended the bill to include restrictions on the guest worker program and visa caps. Rector has been featured in numerous media outlets as a conservative expert on immigration. Role in opposing the 2013 immigration reform proposals With statistical assistance from Harvard Ph.D. and then Heritage Research Fellow Jason Richwine, Rector wrote a report on the fiscal cost of proposed amnesty legislation to the United States. The report was published by the Heritage Foundation on May 6, 2013. Rector and Jim DeMint, a former U.S. senator and the newly installed Heritage Foundation president, introduced the report in an op-ed article in the Washington Post. The methods used in the report met with considerable criticism from a number of think tanks and immigration policy analysts across the political spectrum, including Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development, and many others. Later, widespread publicity of past research by study co-author Jason Richwine on race and intelligence as well as race and crime in the United States, as part of his Ph.D. dissertation at Harvard University under George Borjas, led to a greater backlash against the study. Richwine left Heritage as a result of the controversy. On June 23, 2013, Rector appeared on C-SPAN debating Alex Nowrasteh on the immigration legislation under consideration at the time in the United States Congress. Abstinence education Rector is a proponent of abstinence education. His advocacy prompted the inclusion of school-program funding for the teaching of abstinence in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Rector has published research papers for The Heritage Foundation that conclude a delay in the onset of sexual activity is linked to positive life outcomes. He is quoted as an expert on abstinence education by numerous media outlets, including The New York Times. In 1999, the Los Angeles Times called Rector the \\"architect of the abstinence-only movement.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Rector's Heritage Foundation research papers * Heritage Foundation bio * Category:The Heritage Foundation Category:College of William & Mary alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Human Events people Category:National Review people Category:American anti‚Äìillegal immigration activists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Robert Rector"},{"id":"10075537","text":"Michel Singher is a French-born conductor who is currently Artistic Director and conductor of Espressivo‚Äîa small, intense orchestra‚Äîin Santa Cruz, California.

Truett Theological Seminary is a Baptist theological seminary in Waco, Texas. The seminary, named after Southern Baptist preacher George Washington Truett, was founded in 1993 as part of Baylor University and is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. History Truett Seminary Narthex On July 24, 1990, the Baylor University Board of Trustees officially reserved with the Secretary of State of Texas the name ‚ÄúGeorge W. Truett Theological Seminary,‚Äù in the event the board decided sometime in the future to create a seminary. On March 2, 1991, the George W. Truett Theological Seminary was chartered and a fifteen-member Board of Trustees was named by the University‚Äôs Board of Regents to investigate the feasibility of operating a seminary. (On September 21, 1990, the University Trustees had changed Baylor‚Äôs charter in order to have greater freedom in the selection of the University‚Äôs governing board. By this action the University Trustees became Regents.) An organizational meeting of Seminary Trustees was held on July 18, 1991, at which time officers were elected and a statement of purpose was developed. A joint meeting with the Seminary Trustees and Board of Regents was held on January 17, 1992, and further investigation and discussion was authorized. On May 21, 1993, the Board of Regents approved the opening of George W. Truett Theological Seminary with the beginning of the 1994-95 academic year. In 1994 conservative leaders were in control of the Southern Baptist Convention. Seminary faculty at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and other SBC seminaries were being required to sign documents indicating agreement with Scriptural inerrancy. The Board of Regents and Trustees were able to avoid this requirement at Truett. Truett Seminary was and is more accepting of moderate theology. At the May 21, 1993 meeting the Regents voted to accept the offer of First Baptist Church, Waco, to house the Seminary on the second floor of the church‚Äôs B.H. Carroll Education Building for the first years of its operation. Space was designated for the exclusive use of Truett Seminary for administrative and faculty offices. Classrooms and other areas were specified for the joint use of the Seminary and First Baptist Church. Reminiscent of earlier years of theological education at Baylor, when classes for ministers were held by Rev. Benajah Harvey Carroll (B.H. Carroll), then pastor of First Baptist Church, in his study, Truett Seminary opened offices in the Carroll Education Building on August 1, 1993. Faculty offices were added in July 1994. The opening convocation service was held on August 28, 1994, with 51 students registered. The Truett Seminary inaugural class graduated from Baylor University in May 1997. Construction of the seminary on Baylor University's campus began in late 2001. It is located in the northwestern corner of Baylor's main Waco campus, seconds from Interstate 35. The building features three stories of classrooms, a courtyard, and the Paul Powell chapel. Classes began in the John Baugh campus of George W. Truett Seminary in January 2002. Starting in May 2006, the Seminary started their own graduation ceremonies, rather than participating in larger general Baylor University graduation ceremonies.

All three rivers originate in the wood's area itself.  Characteristics  The forested area is uninhabited. Several settlements developed on the borders of the forest: Meljak on the west, Guncati and Barajevo on the south-west and Ripanj on the north-east. The wood itself covers an area of . The most common species of trees are the oak types, Hungarian oak and Turkey oak, though the name of the woods means \\"small linden wood\\". The area is a popular picnic area for the citizens of Belgrade and many restaurants, villas, weekend houses and sport's fields are located in Lipoviƒçka ≈°uma. Attractions include the famed motel Lipoviƒçka ≈°uma on the Ibarska magistrala and the youth hostel, the court for the hurdle riding and a vast hunting area in the woods, with wildlife including roe deers, hares, pheasants and partridges. The area is for the most part organized as an official but unfenced hunting ground of Lipoviƒçka ≈†uma. It spreads between the altitudes of and covers . Roe deer and wild boar are being bred in the facility. The section of the forest, called Dugi Rt, was declared a protected area by the city on 29 November 2013. It is protected for the both biological (forest complex) but also for the geomorphological and hudrological values. The specificities of the Dugi Rt ridge and the bed of the Sremaƒçka river helped the development of the diverse flora and fauna. The entire forest is part of the Belgrade's outer green ring which mitigates the aftermaths of the bad urbanization. A chemical center of the Yugoslav army was located in the woods and was used as a reservoir for the rocket fuel. It was a target during the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia. Explosion and subsequent flames were visible kilometers away and caused an extensive damage to the woods itself which was burnt to the wide extent around the reservoir. Lipoviƒçka ≈°uma was the location of the headquarters of PTJ, the Counter-terrorist Unit,s a special operations and tactical unit of the Serbian Police.

Pleasant Township at the north end (PA Route 50). The road intersects with I-70 in Somerset Township (Eighty Four area) and Interstate 79 in North Strabane Township near Houston. It also intersects with US Route 19 in North Strabane Township. Route description PA 519 begins at an intersection with US 40 in the community of Glyde in North Bethlehem Township, heading north on a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through wooded areas with some farms and development, crossing into Somerset Township and reaching an interchange with I-70. Past this interchange, the road runs through more rural areas before reaching the community of Eighty Four. Here, the road passes homes and businesses as it comes to an intersection with PA 136. After this intersection, PA 519 heads into North Strabane Township and passes areas of commercial development a short distance to the east of the Allegheny Valley Railroad's W&P; Subdivision line, running through Wylandville. The route curves northeast into areas of farms before turning northwest and passing through the residential community of Gambles. The road crosses the W&P; Subdivision and continues northwest through farmland and woodland with some residential development. PA 519 reaches an interchange with US 19, with a park and ride lot located within the northwestern quadrant, and comes to an intersection with PA 980 a short distance later. At this point, the route turns to the west near areas of residential and commercial development, coming to an interchange with I-79. The road becomes Hill Church Houston Road here and heads northwest through commercial areas, crossing the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad and Chartiers Creek. After the latter, PA 519 enters the borough of Houston and becomes South Main Street, passing homes and businesses. In the commercial center of Houston, the route briefly turns south onto West Pike Street before heading west on Western Avenue past more residences. The road forms the border between Houston to the north and Chartiers Township to the south before fully entering Chartiers Township. PA 519 continues northwest through areas of farmland and woodland with occasional residential and commercial development, passing through McConnells Mills and Export. The road turns more to the north and enters forested areas, heading into Mount Pleasant Township. The route passes through the residential community of Westland and comes into a mix of farm fields and woods. PA 519 turns northwest and reaches its northern terminus at PA 50. History From 1936 to 1941, the original PA 519 was an Allegheny/Washington County route, running for 14.2 miles from the intersection of Saw Mill Run Blvd. and West Liberty Avenue (bordering the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Brookline and Beechview) to U.S. 19 (Morganza Road) in Morganza/North Strabane Township. In 1941, PA 519 was \\"swapped\\" with what was U.S. 19 at that time, now running along Morganza Road in North Strabane, joining then-PA 28 in South Fayette Township and ending at Crafton Boulevard/Noblestown Road (then-U.S. 22/U.S. 30) in Crafton Heights (PA 28/Noblestown Road continued with a right turn from here). In 1947, PA 519 was extended to its current southern terminus at U.S. 40 in Glyde. In 1954, the northern terminus was truncated to the intersection of Washington Ave. and PA 28 (Miller's Run Road, changed to PA 50 in 1961) in South Fayette Township. In 1972, the northern terminus (including the remaining segment in Allegheny County) was moved one last time to its current location at PA 50 in Mount Pleasant Township.

She is best known for her bestselling debut adult novel, Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen (Knopf, 1972), \\"one of the first novels to emerge from the Women's Liberation Movement\\" (Oxford Companion to Women's Writing). Early life and education Shulman was born in Cleveland, Ohio on August 17, 1932. She received a BA from Western Reserve University in 1953. She then moved to New York City to study philosophy at the Columbia University Graduate School and later received an MA from New York University. Writing Shulman first emerged as the author of the controversial \\"A Marriage Agreement,\\" (see it under \\"External links\\" below) which proposes that men and women split childcare and housework equally and details a method for doing so. Originally published in the feminist journal Up From Under in 1969, it was widely reproduced in magazines (Life, Redbook, Ms., New York) and anthologies, including a Harvard textbook on contract law. It continues to be debated, for instance in January 2007 in a Washington Post Blog. Three years later, following several children's books, Shulman published her first adult novel, the bestselling Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen (Knopf, 1972), which examines the contradictions and pressures on a young woman of the pre-feminist 1940s, '50s, and '60s, through the story of Sasha Davis from childhood through marriage and motherhood. Almost continuously in print, it was reissued in a 25th anniversary edition in 1997 by Penguin, a 35th anniversary \\"Feminist Classics\\" edition in 2007 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, and as an ebook in 2012 by Open Road. Her second novel, Burning Questions (Knopf, 1978), recreates the rise of the women's liberation movement and sets it in a historical context. Her third novel, On the Stroll (Knopf, 1981), takes on the themes of homelessness and abuse through the story of a shopping-bag lady and a teenage runaway who is preyed upon by a pimp, over the course of one summer. Her fourth novel, In Every Woman's Life... (Knopf, 1987), explores marriage, children, and singleness in a contemporary comedy of manners. After that, in her next three books, she turned to memoirs: Drinking the Rain (FSG, 1995), about her experience of living alone on an island without electricity, road, or phone, as she undergoes a midlife change; A Good Enough Daughter (Random House [Schocken], 1997), about her life as a daughter to loving parents whom she sees through to their deaths; and To Love What Is (FSG, 2008), an account of caring for her husband following a 2004 accident that left him seriously brain-impaired. In 2012 she published her fifth novel, Men√°ge (Other Press), a comedy of manners satirizing the rich and the literary life; and a collection of essays, A Marriage Agreement and Other Essays: Four Decades of Feminist Writing (Open Road). In addition, she has written two books on anarchist- feminist Emma Goldman: the biography To The Barricades (T.Y.Crowell, 1971) and Red Emma Speaks: An Emma Goldman Reader (Random House, 1972). Except for her three children's books (Bosley on the Number Line [McKay, 1970], Finders Keepers [Bradbury Press, 1971], Awake or Asleep [Addison Wesley, 1971]), all her titles are available as ebooks. Shulman has taught writing and women's literature widely in the U.S., including at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (Honolulu), where she held the Citizens Chair in 1991-2, New York University, New School University, the University of Southern Maine, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Yale. She received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Case Western Reserve University in 2001. Activism In the early 1960s Shulman was active in the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). She named the theater arts chapter, 7-Arts CORE, prior to the group's attending the 1963 March on Washington. She became opposed to the Vietnam War, counseling draftees on their rights at the Quaker Meeting House and the Washington Square Methodist Episcopal Church, both in Manhattan. In 1967 Shulman first became involved in the Women's Liberation Movement (WLM) in New York City by participating in the weekly discussion group, New York Radical Women; she subsequently joined several small consciousness-raising women's groups (Redstockings, WITCH, New York Radical Feminists), and feminist political action groups (CARASA, No More Nice Girls, Feminist Futures, Take Back the Future). In 1971, after their first production, \\"\\"Rape In\\"\\". she became a member of the Advisory Board of the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective - a NYC-based feminist theater group - and of the New York Feminist Art Institute. She was one of the planners of the first national demonstration of women's liberation, which catapulted the movement to national attention, the August 1968 Miss America protest in Atlantic City, a demonstration against oppressive beauty standards, which was a major theme of Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen. Shulman's activism included participation, beginning in 1969 and continuing to the present day, in a number of public speak-outs and conferences on such feminist issues as beauty standards, rape, violence against women, reproductive choice, marriage, and motherhood.Echols, Alice. Daring to Be Bad. University of Minnesota Press, 1989Brownmiller, Susan. In Our Time. The Dial Press, 1999 The goal of the speak-out was to initiate a public dialogue on experiences that at the time were widely considered taboo subjects of speech. In the film Speak Out: I Had an Abortion, Shulman and other subjects testify to having had multiple abortions. Shulman said that \\"not one was the result of carelessness\\" but, rather, all were due to the failure of the birth control devices she used. In 1992, as a Visiting Professor at the University of Hawaii, she was a founder of a Pacific chapter of the pro-choice political action group No More Nice Girls. The Pacific chapter organized demonstrations, held a speak-out on abortion, and put on street theater in Honolulu.Love, Barbara, ed. Feminists Who Changed America 1963-1975. University of Illinois Press, 2006 In the 1990s she was active on the board of THEA (The House of Elder Artists), an organization attempting to establish a new kind of retirement community in Manhattan for politically and artistically active seniors. In 1977, Shulman became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. In 2012, Shulman joined the Occupy movement and soon became part of the women's caucus, Women Occupy Wall Street, in which she helped put on four Feminist General Assemblies in New York City. Shulman is featured in the feminist history film She's Beautiful When She's Angry. Honors In 1979 Alix was awarded the DeWitt Wallace/Reader's Digest Fellowship; in 1982 she was a visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome; in 1983 she received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in fiction; in 1982-1984 she was VP of the PEN American Center; in 1998 she was a fellow at the Rockefeller Foundation Center in Bellagio, Italy; in 2000 she received the Woman 2000 Trailblazer Award from the Mayor of Cleveland; in 2001 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Case Western Reserve University; and in 2010 she received the American Jewish Press Association's Simon Rockower Award.

It is part of the municipal union of Sch√∂llnach. Geography The village is in the Donau-Wald region and is situated in the valley of the Kleinen Ohe river, which empties into the Danube in the Bavarian Forest. History The first mention of the village was as \\"Cella antisna\\" in the year 841, when Abbot Gotzbold of Niederaltaich Abbey declared that the village would pass to the Abbey after his death. The village had been granted to him by the king Louis the German the year before. In 1004, Holy Roman Emperor Henry II affirmed the Abbey's possession of Cella. In 1149 Pope Eugene III acknowledged the Abbey's possession of a parish church. It was located on an estate that would become the center of the township. The plague struck after the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). The first school master was registered in the year 1716. During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1745), in June 1742, the enemy plundered the church and the inn. On the 13th of December 1742 Croatian troops plundered the village again. Au√üernzell belonged to Bursar Straubing and to the district court of Hengersberg of the Elector Princes of Bavaria. The secularization of Bavaria brought the first parish school in the year 1803. The current parish was founded in 1818. The parish church of renovated in 1972 and its two aisles were widened. During the municipal reforms of 1978 Au√üernzell was combined with Markt Sch√∂llnach to form the Municipal Union of Sch√∂llnach. Population In 2000 the population of the community was 1,435. Attractions The cityscape is dominated by the Roman Catholic parish Church of the Assumption as well as the associated Saint Leonard church. The nave of the Church of the Assumption was constructed in 1550. A new transept was added in 1972. The tabernacle is late Gothic, and the chancel is Baroque. Au√üernzell is also the site of a pilgrimage of Saint Leonard. The new-Gothic Saint Leonard's Church was built in 1884 on the site of an older pilgrims' chapel.

De Laveleye was minister of justice (1937) and of public education (1944‚Äì1945). During World War II he was newsreader for Radio Belgique, a BBC station transmitted to occupied Belgium. Biography Victor de Laveleye was born in Brussels on 6 November 1894. He was a son of Auguste-Albert and Emma Lynen, who belonged to a well-known Antwerp liberal family. He also was a great nephew of the Liege professor √âmile Louis Victor de Laveleye. He studied law at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) and became a lawyer at the Brussels Court of Appeal.http://www.liberaalarchief.be/nieuwsbrief35_archief.html#artikel7 In 1926 he became a municipal councilor in Saint-Gilles, Brussels. He also gave lectures at the ULB and was a reporter at the Liberal Congress in 1932. He became a member of parliament, chairman of the Liberal Party (1936‚Äì1937) and for a few months Minister of Justice in Paul Van Zeeland's second government (1937). In 1940 he fled to London via France. At the end of July 1940 he received the proposal to take charge of the broadcasts of the BBC that were intended for German-occupied Belgium. On 28 September 1940, the first broadcast of Radio Belgique was aired. V sign In a radio broadcast on 14 January 1941, de Laveleye asked all Belgians to use the letter \\"V\\" as a rallying sign, being the first letter of victoire (victory) in French and of vrijheid (freedom) in Dutch. This was the beginning of the \\"V campaign\\" which saw \\"V\\" graffities on the walls of Belgium and later all of Europe and introduced the use of the \\"V sign\\" for victory and freedom. Winston Churchill adopted the sign soon afterwards, though he sometimes got it the wrong way around by displaying the back of his hand, a gesture that is widely used in Great Britain as a lewd and vulgar insult (it means \\"fuck off\\"). Later life After the liberation Victor de Laveleye became Minister of Public Education in the governments Pierlot V and VI, who did not last for five months (September 1944 ‚Äì February 1945). He was already ill and on 16 December 1945, being 51 years old, he died. Sports He competed for Belgium in tennis at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics and was an alternate, who did not play, on the Belgian 1928 hockey team.

The portico and pediment supported by four columns was built in the Corinthian order, with Hollington stone. The contractors were Messrs Gascoyne. The chapel was extremely popular with worshippers. The chapel was converted to the Coliseum Cinema in 1934. It was in direct competition with the Odeon (now Zanzibar nightclub) and was virtually opposite its biggest rival. The building was closed in August 1961 when plans for the widening of Traffic Street were approved. It was demolished in early 1962, and no trace of the building remains today.

It suggests there are ongoing background levels of both new species appearing and extinctions. Very occasionally, the record also appears to show mass extinctions of insects. The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event saw the greatest level of insect extinction, with the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene being the second highest. Insect diversity has recovered after past mass extinctions, due to periods where new species originate with increased frequency, though the recovery can take millions of years. In the Holocene Several studies seemed to indicate that some insect populations are in decline in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and has also been popularized as the windshield phenomenon. For many studies, factors such as abundance, biomass, and species richness are often found to be declining for some, but not all locations in many studies; some species are in decline while others are not. Every species is affected in different ways by changes in the environment, and it cannot be inferred that there is a consistent decrease across different insect groups. When conditions change, some species easily adapt to the change while others struggle to survive. Concerns of declines in insect abundance in the holocene have been attributed to habitat loss from land use changes such as urbanization or agricultural use, pesticide use, invasive species, and artificial lighting. The use of increased quantities of insecticides and herbicides on crops have affected not only non-target insect species, but also the plants on which they feed. Climate change and the introduction of exotic species that compete with the indigenous ones put the native species under stress, and as a result they are more likely to succumb to pathogens and parasites. As of 2017, at least 66 insect species extinctions had been recorded in the previous 500 years, which generally occurred on oceanic islands. For 203 insect species that had IUCN- documented population trends in 2013, 33% were in decline with variation in documented species across orders. Most scientific and public attention has been focused on the conservation of larger, charismatic vertebrates, and relatively fewer studies have been done on insect groups, especially Diptera, Orthoptera and Hemiptera. Data from the past from which to calculate trends is largely unavailable, and what does exist is mostly related to Western Europe and North America. Insect population assessments that have been undertaken were largely concentrated on the more popular insect groups, butterflies and moths, bees, dragonflies and beetles. Some studies have suggested a large proportion of insect species (up to a third of the known species) are threatened with extinction in the 21st century, such as a 2019 review by S√°nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, though ecologist Manu Sanders notes that many of these findings are often biased limited to specific geographic areas and specific groups of species. The methodology of the S√°nchez-Bayo & Wyckhuys study has been questioned; the search string used to sift through the scientific literature was \\"(insect* + decline* + survey)\\". This meant that the authors identified studies finding insect declines, but may have missed those that found increases in insect populations or stability. In assessing the study methodology, an editorial in Global Change Biology stated, \\"An unbiased review of the literature would still find declines, but estimates based on this 'unidirectional' methodology are not credible. However, according to the authors of that review \\"more than half of the surveys were obtained from references cited in other reports\\" and \\"the 73 insect surveys cover all species in a particular taxon ‚Äì irrespective of them exhibiting declines, stable or increasing trends in their distribution or abundance\\". Entomology professor Simon Leather suggested that media reports of an \\"Ecological Armageddon\\" may be exaggerated and advocated for more funding to allow better collection of long term data on the decline. Claims of pending mass insect extinctions or \\"insect apocalypse\\" based on a subset of studies have been popularized in news reports, but often make claims extrapolated beyond the study data or hyperbolize study findings. The Entomological Society of America has stated there are not sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects. For some insect groups such as some butterflies, bees, and beetles, declines in abundance and diversity have been documented in European studies. Other areas have shown increases in some insect species, although trends in most regions are currently unknown. It is difficult to assess long-term trends in insect abundance or diversity because historical measurements are generally not known for many species. Robust data to assess at-risk areas or species is especially lacking for arctic and tropical regions and a majority of the southern hemisphere. Conservation Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) of Papua New Guinea While biodiversity loss is a global problem, conserving habitat for species of insects is uncommon and generally of low priority, although there are exceptions. More commonly insect conservation occurs indirectly, either through the setting aside of large portions of land using \\"wilderness preservation\\" as the motive, or through protection of \\"charismatic vertebrates\\". Some studies estimate that global insect populations are in rapid decline, perhaps by as much as 80% in recent decades. The windshield phenomenon describes people noticing vastly fewer insects flying into the path of their cars after long drives, and this may reflect worldwide loss of insect abundance. Single-species insect conservation can preserve other species indirectly; this preservation-by-default is referred to as the umbrella effect. Showy insects such as butterflies or large, colourful beetles serve as flagship species, and can expand public awareness and financial contributions for conservation efforts. Wealthy nations such as the United States do list species of concern, and occasionally insects are placed on its Endangered Species List. In 2017 this list had classified over 80 insects as endangered species, the majority of them beetles or butterflies; a significant percentage of these listed insects are native only to the Hawaiian Islands. Migratory species, such as the well-known monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), are in need of special conservation methods. One species may require several habitat locations, even across international boundaries, for the different periods of their migratory patterns. Insect conservation has been labelled in the past as a concern only for the affluent. The developing country of Papua New Guinea has a \\"happily ever after\\" ending in their attempts to preserve the world's largest butterfly, Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae). This species is restricted to a very small range of habitat due to specificity in their diet. In the international market of insect collecting, the butterfly can retrieve up to US$2000. In 1978, the government of Papua New Guinea set up the Insect Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA) to regulate the exploitation and conservation of Queen Alexandra's birdwing and other valuable butterflies. Agriculture In agricultural ecosystems, biodiversity is important for the production of food and for ecological services such as the recycling of nutrients, regulation of microclimate and local hydrological processes, and biological control of pests. In the United States alone, pollination by bees accounts for over US$9 billion of economic revenue. According to some estimates, over ‚Öì of the human diet can be traced directly or indirectly to bee pollination. Losses of key pollinators have been reported in at least one region or country on every continent except Antarctica, which has no pollinators. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment concluded that with the global decline in the amount of pollinators, there is not a complete loss of fruit or seeds, but a significant decrease in quantity and viability in fruits, and a lower number of seeds.

A second generation Lithuanian American, Dan was born into a large military family as the son of Col. Albert E. Audick, Sr. and Stella (n√©e Matulevich) Audick. After his birth, he and his nine siblings moved to military bases in France, Virginia, Tennessee, Japan, Colorado, and Los Angeles, California. As a high school senior at Wasson High School in Colorado Springs, Audick earned All-State honors as an offensive lineman while contributing to the winning of what was then the AAA-Colorado high school football championship in 1971. In 2005, Audick was inducted with his teammates and coaches into the Colorado Springs Sports Hall of Fame. Audick was a scholarship student-athlete for the University of Hawaii Warrior football team from 1972 to 1977 and a team captain in the 1976 football season. Under the pioneering leadership of Coach Larry Price, he was one of the few former Warriors who made the transition from Division II Independent to Division IA Independent and who would go on to NFL careers and coaching careers. Professional career Audick was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1977 NFL draft. He started in 33 of 76 regular season games while playing for the St. Louis Football Cardinals, the San Diego Chargers, and the San Francisco 49ers. In post-season play, Audick started in 5 of 6 playoff games. Under the leadership of Coach Don Coryell, Audick played on a Chargers' team that clinched two consecutive playoff berths (1979 and 1980). With the 1980 San Diego Chargers, Audick started at the right tackle position in the AFC Championship game versus the Oakland Raiders where he protected Dan Fouts' frontside in the \\"Air Coryell\\" offense. In 1981, Audick was traded to the San Francisco 49ers. Though he was considered to be \\"undersized\\" for the left tackle position, he was tasked with the responsibility of protecting Joe Montana's \\"blindside.\\" Under the guidance of Coach Bill Walsh, Audick was a key contributor on the final 89-yard drive that led to the play that has been immortalized as \\"The Catch\\" in the 1982 NFC Playoffs versus the Dallas Cowboys. Audick subsequently started in Super Bowl XVI wearing number 61 for the 49ers' 26-21 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. When Michael Lewis's was researching for his 2006 book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game, he called upon several former NFL coaches and players who had played the left tackle position including Audick. Audick helped Lewis understand the role of the \\"undersized\\" versus the \\"prototypical.\\" In Lewis's book, Audick is credited with having played a contributing role in the evolution of the \\"undersized\\" left tackle position. In 2009, the book was made into a movie called The Blind Side. Audick was the first student athlete to graduate from the University of Hawaii and to contribute to a winning Super Bowl team. Dan was the defensive line coach in 1991 for Grossmont College in El Cajon, California. Academic career * Bachelor of Business Administration from University of Hawaii (1977) * Master of Business Administration from San Diego State University (1986) * Master of Arts in Organizational Management from University of Phoenix (1996) * Doctor of Education from University of Southern California (2004) In addition to his professional football career, Audick pursued three advanced degrees in the field of Sports Administration. Subsequent to his NFL retirement, he completed his MBA at San Diego State University in 1986. In honing his studies to Sports Administration, he crafted his coursework and thesis toward the design and development of a computerized feedback system for college and professional football teams. It was not until 2006 that SDSU formally graduated the official first class for a Sports MBA program . Audick was also an early participant in Internet education when he earned his second master's degree at the University of Phoenix's online program from 1994 to 1996. Audick completed his education by earning a doctorate in education in the field of Human Performance Technology at the University of Southern California. For his Ed.D dissertation, Audick used an instructional design enhancement to augment the instruction and communication of offensive passing routes and formations as compared with traditional approaches by using \\"eight points of a compass\\" coupled with measurable distances down field and a \\"grid and code\\" system, respectively.

Named for Ensign James A. Shelton, (a naval aviator who was reported missing during the Battle of Midway), she was the first of two U.S. Naval vessels to bear the name. Sheltons keel was laid down on 1 November 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding of Houston, Texas. The destroyer escort was launched on 18 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. John Shelton, and commissioned on 4 April 1944 with Lieutenant Lewis B. Salomon, USNR, in command. After fitting out and loading stores, Shelton steamed out of port on 21 April, in company with bound for Bermuda on her shakedown cruise. Upon completion, she underwent post- shakedown availability at the Boston Navy Yard from 25 May ‚Äì 15 June. She departed Boston on 16 June en route to San Diego via New York City, Hampton Roads, and Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. History Shelton arrived at San Diego on 6 July and sailed for Pearl Harbor three days later. She stood out from Pearl Harbor on 26 July as part of a convoy proceeding to Eniwetok. The convoy arrived there on 6 August and was dissolved. Shelton was then assigned as a unit in the screen for Task Force 57 (TF 57) ‚Äî composed of five carriers ‚Äî and routed to Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Island. After arriving there on 13 August, Shelton operated in the area until the following month when she was assigned to the Morotai Attack Force (TF 77). The DE was still off Morotai on 3 October in the screen for the escort carriers and when they were attacked by the Japanese submarine RO-41 at location . A torpedo wake was sighted at heading for the escort. In evading it, Shelton was hit on the starboard screw by a second torpedo, which caused severe damage and flooding. Fellow destroyer escort came alongside and removed the crew. Shelton was taken under tow but capsized and sank. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 November 1944. Honors Shelton received one battle star for World War II service. Thirteen of her crew were lost with the ship and remain on duty. References  Category:John C.

It is a deep fat pad located on either side of the face between the buccinator muscle and several more superficial muscles (including the masseter, the zygomaticus major, and the zygomaticus minor). The inferior portion of the buccal fat pad is contained within the buccal space. It should not be confused with the malar fat pad, which is directly below the skin of the cheek. It should also not be confused with jowl fat pads. It is implicated in the formation of hollow cheeks and the nasolabial fold, but not in the formation of jowls.  Nomenclature and structure  The buccal fat pad is composed of several parts, although exactly how many parts seems to be a point of disagreement and no single consistent nomenclature of these parts has been observed. It was described as being divided into three lobes, the anterior, intermediate, and posterior, ‚Äúaccording to the structure of the lobar envelopes, the formation of ligaments, and the source of the nutritional vessels‚Äù. Also, there are four extensions from the body of the buccal fat pad: the sublevator, the melolabial, the buccal, and the pterygoid. The nomenclature of these extensions derives from their location and proximal muscles. The anterior lobe of the buccal fat surrounds the parotid duct, which conveys saliva from the parotid gland to the mouth. It is a triangular mass with one vertex at the buccinators, one at the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and one at the orbicularis oris. The intermediate lobe lies between the anterior and posterior lobes over the maxilla. The intermediate lobe seems to lose a significant amount of volume between childhood and adulthood. The posterior lobe of the buccal fat pad runs from the infraorbital fissure and temporal muscle to the upper rim of the mandible and back to the mandibular ramus. The buccal fat pads are clearly visible on the cheeks of children of different age, complexion and constitution.  Function  Some people describe the buccal fat pad‚Äôs primary function in relation to chewing and suckling, especially in infants. This theory derives some support from the loss of volume to the intermediate lobe, which would be most directly involved in chewing and sucking, from infancy to adulthood. Another proposed function is as gliding pads that facilitate the action of the muscles of mastication. The buccal fat pad may also function as a cushion to protect sensitive facial muscles from injury due to muscle action or exterior force. 300px  Clinical uses  The Buccal fat pad is commonly used in facial recontouring. Several authors discuss the importance of the buccal fat pad in attaining good results from a facelift. Buccal flaps (not always including the buccal fat pad) are used in reconstruction of the periorbital area after injury. They are also used to repair congenital defects of the oral cavity or for repair of congenital cleft palate. Removal of the buccal fat pad is also sometimes used to reduce cheek prominence, although this procedure may carry with it a significant risk of damage to the buccal branch of the facial nerve and the parotid ducts.

Background In early June 1595, Don Juan Fern√°ndez de Velasco (governor of Milan and Constable of Castile) crossed the Alps with an army of 12,000 men from Italy and Sicily. In the Bishopric of Besan√ßon he was joined by Charles of Mayenne (chief of the Catholic League). Together they moved on Dijon in order to take the city. Warned of their movements, Henry IV raced to Troyes with 3,000 men that he was able to gather. The battle The battle took place on 5 June at Fontaine-Fran√ßaise (Burgundy). That morning, Henry IV accompanied his scouts. They encountered the Spanish troops by accident, and - as at the Battle of Eu the year before - Henry attacked them with light horse. Against all odds, he surprised them and forced them to retreat temporarily. After this charge, Henry decided to recruit local inhabitants (largely peasants) and to arm them with scythes and any metal object that might shine in the sunlight. He regrouped them on a hill with military troops, thus attempting to ruse the opposing force into believing he had a larger army. Meanwhile, Fern√°ndez de Velasco was convinced that Henry was waiting for reinforcements, and observing the troop movements from afar, came to believe that Henry's forces had superior numbers. He decided to retreat. Aftermath The French royal victory marked an end to the Catholic League, although the Eighth War of Religion would not come to a complete end until the signing of the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598 and the Spanish ceding of captured French towns.

Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of fungal hyphae. These patches grow adjacent to each other, leading to the appearance of a map or a patchwork field. Rhizocarpon geographicum located in the Arctic have been age-estimated at 8,600 years - the oldest living organism on Earth. When circular, or roughly circular, the diameter of this lichen species has been widely used to help determining the relative age of deposits, e.g. moraine systems, thus revealing evidence of glacial advances. The process is termed lichenometry. This technique is generally attributed to the work of Roland Beschel in the Alps Beschel, R. E. 1950. Flechten als Altersma√üstab rezenter Mor√§nen.Zeitschrift f√ºr Gletscherkunde und Glazialgeologie NF, 1:151-62. (Translated by W. Barr as Lichens as a measure of the age of recent moraines. Arctic and Alpine Research, 5, 303-309) Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual. Generally, the five largest lichen thalli diameters are taken, although several statistical methods have been used. If the growth rate is known, the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited. The growth rate curve, a graph of age of a lichen against the date of the substrate on which it is found has to be constructed for an area. Beschel originally used gravestones to produce a calibration curve. Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age, such as gravestones, historic or prehistoric rock buildings, or moraines of known age (e.g. those deposited during the Little Ice Age). Distribution This lichen species is broadly distributed and may be found in most cold areas with exposed rock surfaces.

Community structure  The comune Buttenwiesen belongs to the region of Augsburg. The community consists the main town Buttenwiesen and the municipality parts Frauenstetten, Lauterbach, Oberth√ºrheim, Pfaffenhofen an der Zusam, Unterth√ºrheim and Wortelstetten.  Facts  Area: The municipality of Buttenwiesen includes 6023 hectares and owns about 80 kilometers of community road. Population Development: Since 1970 the population in Buttenwiesen is steadily increasing. In 1970 they counted 4490, in 1987 4864 and in 2000 5627 people. At the end of 2009 there were 5740 inhabitants. Currently it's about 6040 inhabitants. Economy: In Buttenwiesen there are many companies. For example, the companies Erwin M√ºller Versandhaus GmbH, Romakowski GmbH & Co. KG, and the BauschLinnemann GmbH, which are quite important for the municipality. Workstations: In Buttenwiesen there are 1700 non-agricultural workstations, which leads to a solid economic position.  History  In the 12th and 13th centuries Buttenwiesen was owned by the Lords of Eberstall-Reisensburg. In 1270 it became part of the Markgrafschaft Burgau, which had the power over Buttenwiesen up to the 19th century. In 1805 it became part of bavaria. In 1978 the municipalities of Buttenwiesen, Frauenstetten, Lauterbach, Oberth√ºrheim, Pfaffenhofen a.d.Zusam, Unterth√ºrheim and Wortelstetten were united to one comune called Buttenwiesen. In the 1970s existed the idea to build a nuclear powerplant in Pfaffenhofen a. d. Zusam. Only in 1999 this idea was cancelled. Before that they also had the idea of building a test track for transrapid. But the citizens who were against these plans luckily won.  Policy  Since 2004 Norbert Beutm√ºller (Member of the Free Voters Buttenwiesen) is the Mayor of Buttenwiesen. He succeeds Leo Schrell, who was elected for the District Administrator of Dillingen. In July 2010 Beutm√ºller was reelected in a runoff election with 54.88% of the votes.  Leisure facilities and museums  For the freetime there are many activities in about 90 clubs. Also there are many bike and hiking trails, the Heritage Museum in the Zehentstadel, asolar-heated swimming pool in Lauterbach, the Riedblickhalle and in the winter there is an ice rink.  Education  Buttenwiesen has its own school. In Pfaffenhofen there is the Ulrich-von-Th√ºrheim-Volksschule Buttenwiesen and for the younger children, there are five kindergartens.  Renewable energy  Buttenwiesen is a rolemodel for other communities in relation to renewable energy. There are two solar parks, two biogas plants, three hydroelectric plants. Also the number of households, which are using solar energy is very high. Furthermore, produces the municipality on all of its public buildings solar energy.

In the academic circles of literature, religion, history, and anthropology, categories of traditional story are important terminology to identify and interpret stories more precisely. Some stories belong in multiple categories and some stories do not fit into any category. Anecdote An anecdote is a short and amusing or interesting story about a biographical incident. It may be as brief as the setting and provocation of a bon mot. An anecdote is always presented as based on a real incident involving actual persons, whether famous or not, usually in an identifiable place; whether authentic or not, it has verisimilitude or truthiness. Over time, modification in reuse may convert a particular anecdote to a fictional piece, one that is retold but is \\"too good to be true\\". Sometimes humorous, anecdotes are not jokes, because their primary purpose is not simply to evoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, or to delineate an institutional or character trait in such a light that it strikes in a flash of insight to the very essence. Novalis observed, \\"An anecdote is a historical element ‚Äî a historical molecule or epigram.\\"\\"Eine Anekdote ist eines historisches Element ‚Äî ein historisches Molek√ºl oder Epigramm\\": the quote is the epigraph to Gossman 20030 A brief monologue beginning \\"A man pops in a bar ...\\" will be a joke. A brief monologue beginning \\"Once J. Edgar Hoover popped in a bar ...\\" will be an anecdote. An anecdote thus is closer to the tradition of the parable than the patently invented fable with its animal characters and generic human figures -- but it is distinct from the parable in the historical specificity which it claims. Anecdotes are often of satirical nature. Under the totalitarian regime in the Soviet Union numerous political anecdotes circulating in society were the only way to reveal and denounce vices of the political system and its leaders. They made fun of such personalities as Lenin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and other Soviet leaders. In contemporary Russia there are many anecdotes about Vladimir Putin.Yatsko V. Russian folk funny stories The word 'anecdote' (in Greek: \\"unpublished\\", literally \\"not given out\\") comes from Procopius of Caesarea, the biographer of Justinian I, who produced a work entitled (Anekdota, variously translated as Unpublished Memoirs or Secret History), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the Byzantine court. Gradually, the term anecdote came to be applied to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. Apologue An apologue or apolog (from the Greek ·ºÄœÄœåŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ, a \\"statement\\" or \\"account\\") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly. It is like a parable, except that it contains supernatural elements like a fable, often the personification of animals or plants. Unlike a fable, the moral is more important than the narrative details. As with the parable, the apologue is a tool of rhetorical argument used to convince or persuade. Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of Jotham in the Book of Judges (9:7-15); \\"The Belly and its Members,\\" by the patrician Agrippa Menenius Lanatus in the second book of Livy; and perhaps most famous of all, those of Aesop. Well-known modern examples of this literary form include George Orwell's Animal Farm and the Br'er Rabbit stories derived from African and Cherokee cultures and recorded and synthesized by Joel Chandler Harris. The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a fable in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as \\"a satire in action.\\" An apologue differs from a parable in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be true in the sense that \\"when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it\\", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: \\"when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it.\\" The parable reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander). It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, Martin Luther thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume. The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does. The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with allegory, metaphor and imagination. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the slaves, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely Aesop and Phaedrus. La Fontaine in France; Gay and Dodsley in England; Gellert, Lessing and Hagedorn in Germany; Tomas de Iriarte in Spain, and Krylov in Russia, are leading modern writers of apologues. Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, \\"Le Coq et la Perle\\" (\\"The Cock and the Pearl\\"). On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, Corti, is said to have developed an apologue of \\"The Talking Animals\\" reaching twenty-six cantos. La Motte, writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters amour- propre by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but Rousseau contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form. A work by P. Soull√©, La Fontaine et ses devanciers (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France. Montesquieu wrote a propos his Persian Letters \\"There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be felt. Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy.\\" Chivalric romance As a literary genre of high culture, romance or chivalric romance is a style of heroic prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest. Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c.1600 they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously satirised them in his novel Don Quixote. Still, the modern image of \\"medieval\\" is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word medieval invokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes.C. S. Lewis, The Discarded Image, p. 9 Originally, romance literature was written in Old French, Anglo-Norman and Occitan, later, in English and German. During the early 13th century romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love, such as faithfulness in adversity. During the Gothic Revival, from ca. 1800 the connotations of \\"romance\\" moved from the magical and fantastic to somewhat eerie \\"Gothic\\" adventure narratives. Creation myth A creation myth is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it., \\"Creation myths are symbolic stories describing how the universe and its inhabitants came to be. Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions.\\" They develop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions; and they are the most common form of myth, found throughout human culture. In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths, metaphorically, symbolically and sometimes even in a historical or literal sense. They are commonly, although not always, considered cosmogonical myths‚Äîthat is they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness.See:  Creation myths often share a number of features. They often are considered sacred accounts and can be found in nearly all known religious traditions. They are all stories with a plot and characters who are either deities, human-like figures, or animals, who often speak and transform easily.See:  They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past, what historian of religion Mircea Eliade termed in illo tempore (\\"at that time\\"). Also, all creation myths speak to deeply meaningful questions held by the society that shares them, revealing of their central worldview and the framework for the self-identity of the culture and individual in a universal context.See:  Etiological myth An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like, or create a mythic history for a place or family. For example, the name Delphi and its associated deity, Apollon Delphinios, are explained in the Homeric Hymn which tells of how Apollo carried Cretans over the sea in the shape of a dolphin (') to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ' (\\"womb\\"), many etiological myths are similarly based on folk etymology (the term \\"Amazon\\", for example). In the Aeneid (published circa 17 BC), Vergil claims the descent of Augustus Caesar's Julian clan from the hero Aeneas through his son Ascanius, also called Iulus. The story of Prometheus' sacrifice-trick in Hesiod's Theogony relates how Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. Fable A fable, as a literary genre, is a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphised, and that illustrates a moral lesson (a \\"moral\\"), which may at the end be expressed explicitly in a pithy maxim. A fable differs from a parable in that the latter excludes animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech and other powers of humankind. Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the King James Version of the New Testament, \\"ŒºœçŒ∏ŒøœÇ\\" (\\"mythos\\") was rendered by the translators as \\"fable\\"For example, in First Timothy, \\"neither give heed to fables...\\", and \\"refuse profane and old wives' fables...\\" (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively). in First and Second Timothy, in Titus and in First Peter. Strong's 3454. ŒºœçŒ∏ŒøœÇ muthos moo'-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. _fiction_ (\\"myth\\"):‚Äîfable. \\"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\\" (2nd Peter 1:16) Factoid A factoid is a questionable or spurious (unverified, false, or fabricated) statement presented as a fact, but with no veracity. The word can also be used to describe a particularly insignificant or novel fact, in the absence of much relevant context. As read on his hit BBC Radio show \\"Steve Wright in the Afternoon\\". The word is defined by the Compact Oxford English Dictionary as \\"an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact\\". Factoid was coined by Norman Mailer in his 1973 biography of Marilyn Monroe. Mailer described a factoid as \\"facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper\\", and created the word by combining the word fact and the ending -oid to mean \\"similar but not the same\\". The Washington Times described Mailer's new word as referring to \\"something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact\\". Factoids may give rise to, or arise from, common misconceptions and urban legends. Fairy tale A fairy tale (pronounced /Ààfe…ôriÀåte…™l/) is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, dwarves, giants, mermaids or gnomes, and usually magic or enchantments. However, only a small number of the stories refer to fairies. The stories may nonetheless be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)Thompson, Stith. Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology & Legend, 1972 s.v. \\"Fairy Tale\\" and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in \\"fairy tale ending\\" (a happy ending)Merriam-Webster definition of \\"fairy tale\\" or \\"fairy tale romance\\" (though not all fairy tales end happily). Colloquially, a \\"fairy tale\\" or \\"fairy story\\" can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale. In cultures where demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike legends and epics, they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, people, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times.Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked, p. 9. Fairy tales are found in oral and in literary form. The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive. Still, the evidence of literary works at least indicates that fairy tales have existed for thousands of years, although not perhaps recognized as a genre; the name \\"fairy tale\\" was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.Gray, Richard. \\"Fairy tales have ancient origin.\\" Telegraph.co.uk. 5 September 2009. Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today. The older fairy tales were intended for an audience of adults, as well as children, but they were associated with children as early as the writings of the pr√©cieuses; the Brothers Grimm titled their collection Children's and Household Tales, and the link with children has only grown stronger with time. Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The Aarne-Thompson classification system and the morphological analysis of Vladimir Propp are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales. A fairy tale with a tragic rather a happy ending is called anti-fairy tale. Folklore Folklore (or lore) consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of a culture, subculture, or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics. The word 'folklore' was first used by the English antiquarian William Thoms in a letter published in the London journal The Athenaeum in 1846. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. Stith Thompson made a major attempt to index the motifs of both folklore and mythology, providing an outline into which new motifs can be placed, and scholars can keep track of all older motifs. Folklore can be divided into four areas of study: artifact (such as voodoo dolls), describable and transmissible entity (oral tradition), culture, and behavior (rituals). These areas do not stand alone, however, as often a particular item or element may fit into more than one of these areas. Folkloristics Folkloristics is the term preferred by academic folklorists for the formal, academic discipline devoted to the study of folklore. The term itself derives from the nineteenth-century German designation folkloristik (i.e., folklore). Ultimately, the term folkloristics is used to distinguish between the materials studied, folklore, and the study of folklore, folkloristics. In scholarly usage, folkloristics represents an emphasis on the contemporary, social aspects of expressive culture, in contrast to the more literary or historical study of cultural texts. Ghost story A ghost story may be any piece of fiction, or drama, or an account of an experience, that includes a ghost, or simply takes as a premise the possibility of ghosts or characters' belief in them. Colloquially, the term can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a short story format, within genre fiction. It is a form of supernatural fiction and specifically of weird fiction, and is often a horror story. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come. Whatever their uses, the ghost story is in some format present in all cultures around the world, and may be passed down orally or in written form. Joke A joke is something spoken, written, or done with humorous intention. Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole short story. The word \\"joke\\" has a number of synonyms. To achieve their end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other devices. Jokes may have a punch line, i.e. an ending to make it humorous. A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl). Legend A legend (Latin, legenda, \\"things to be read\\") is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and to possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", defined by a highly flexible set of parameters, which may include miracles that are perceived as actually having happened, within the specific tradition of indoctrination where the legend arises, and within which it may be transformed over time, in order to keep it fresh and vital, and realistic. The Brothers Grimm defined legend as folktale historically grounded.Norbert Krapf, Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the genre of legend from other narrative forms, such as fairy tale; he \\"reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded\\", according to Hans Sebald's review in German Studies Review 13.2 (May 1990), p 312. A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:Tangherlini, \\"'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization\\" Western Folklore 49.4 (October 1990:371-390) p. 85. > Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly > ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, > reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief > and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held > values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.\\" Myth of origins An origin myth is a myth that purports to describe the origin of some feature of the natural or social world. One type of origin myth is the cosmogonic myth, which describes the creation of the world. However, many cultures have stories set after the cosmogonic myth, which describe the origin of natural phenomena and human institutions within a preexisting universe. In Western classical scholarship, the word aition (from the Ancient Greek Œ±·º¥œÑŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"cause\\") is sometimes used for a myth that explains an origin, particularly how an object or custom came into existence. Mythology The term mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths.Kirk, p. 8; \\"myth\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica As examples, comparative mythology is the study of connections between myths from different cultures, whereas Greek mythology is the body of myths from ancient Greece. In the field of folkloristics, a myth is defined as a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form and how customs, institutions and taboos were established. Many scholars in other fields use the term \\"myth\\" in somewhat different ways. In a very broad sense, the word can refer to any story originating within traditions. Oral tradition Oral tradition and oral lore is cultural material and tradition transmitted orally from one generation to another.Vansina, Jan: Oral Tradition as History, 1985, James Currey Publishers, , 9780852550076; at page 27 and 28, where Vansina defines oral tradition as \\"verbal messages which are reported statements from the past beyond the present generation\\" which \\"specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only\\"; \\"There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation\\". He points out that \\"Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists).\\"Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: \\"Methodology and African Prehistory\\", 1990, UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa; James Currey Publishers, , 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; \\"Oral tradition and its methodology\\" at pages 54-61; at page 54: \\"Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another. Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted.\\" The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledges across generations without a writing system. A narrower definition of oral tradition is sometimes appropriate. Sociologists might also emphasize a requirement that the material is held in common by a group of people, over several generations, and might distinguish oral tradition from testimony or oral history.Henige, David. \\"Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications\\" Oral Tradition, 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press In a general sense, \\"oral tradition\\" refers to the transmission of cultural material through vocal utterance, and was long held to be a key descriptor of folklore (a criterion no longer rigidly held by all folklorists).Degh, Linda. American Folklore and the Mass Media. Bloomington: IUP, 1994, p. 31 As an academic discipline, it refers both to a set of objects of study and a method by which they are studiedDundes, Alan, \\"Editor's Introduction\\" to The Theory of Oral Composition, John Miles Foley. Bloomington, IUP, 1988, pp. ix-xii‚Äîthe method may be called variously \\"oral traditional theory\\", \\"the theory of Oral-Formulaic Composition\\" and the \\"Parry-Lord theory\\" (after two of its founders; see below) The study of oral tradition is distinct from the academic discipline of oral history, which is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events.Oral History It is also distinct from the study of orality, which can be defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.Ong, Walter, S.J., Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word. London: Methuen, 1982 p 12 Parable A parable isAdolf J√ºlicher, Die Gleichnisreden Jesu (2 vols; T√ºbingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899). a succinct story, in prose or verse, that illustrates one or more moral, religious, instructive, or normative principles or lessons. It differs from a fable in that fables use animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech and other powers of humankind, while parables generally feature human characters. It is a type of analogy. Some scholars of the Canonical gospels and the New Testament apply the term \\"parable\\" only to the parables of Jesus,John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew, volume II, Doubleday, 1994. though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as \\"The Prodigal Son\\" are central to Jesus' teaching method in both the canonical narratives and the apocrypha. Political myth A political myth is an ideological explanation for a political phenomenon that is believed by a social group. In 1975, Henry Tudor defined it in Political Myth published by Macmillan. He said In 2001, Christopher G. Flood described a working definition of a political myth as Tall tale A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events, for example fish stories such as, \\"That fish was so big, why, I tell ya, it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!\\" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the European countryside, the American Old West, the Canadian Northwest, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Tall tales are often told so as to make the narrator seem to have been a part of the story. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story. Urban legend An urban legend, urban myth, urban tale, or contemporary legend, is a form of modern folklore consisting of stories that may or may not have been believed by their tellers to be true. As with all folklore and mythology, the designation suggests nothing about the story's veracity, but merely that it is in circulation, exhibits variation over time, and carries some significance that motivates the community in preserving and propagating it. Despite its name, an urban legend does not necessarily originate in an urban area. Rather, the term is used to differentiate modern legend from traditional folklore in pre-industrial times. For this reason, sociologists and folklorists prefer the term contemporary legend. Urban legends are sometimes repeated in news stories and, in recent years, distributed by e-mail. People frequently allege that such tales happened to a \\"friend of a friend\\"; so often, in fact, that \\"friend of a friend\\" (\\"FOAF\\") has become a commonly used term when recounting this type of story. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. One example is the story of a woman killed by spiders nesting in her elaborate hairdo. More recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances, like the story of people ambushed, anesthetized, and waking up minus one kidney, which was surgically removed for transplantation (a story which folklorists refer to as \\"The Kidney Heist\\").

David's diligence in working closely with producers and directors to understand their vision has earned him top honors among Film & TV composers, winning ASCAP's prestigious Most Performed Themes and Most Performed Underscorehttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0888441/awards?ref_=nm_ql_2 awards every year since 2005. David began his musical journey studying piano at the age of seven. For years he worked as a studio session pianist/keyboardist and toured with Cher among other well-known artists. While continuing to refine his chops as a studio musician David studied composition, orchestration and conducting at Cal State University and the Dick Grove School of Music. A chance meeting with famed television composer Mike Post led to an offer as his studio keyboard player, which introduced him to the world of music supervision for television. David's first major breakout as a TV composer occurred when he landed a job with Mark Burnett for the first season of Survivor in 2000. At that time, Reality TV was new to audiences around the world; as a result, David was able to craft a style of music which today is commonly used for unscripted TV. As his success and workload increased he began to hire composers in order to keep up with the high demand of music. His venture as a one-man composer blossomed into a full-fledged composing house ( known as Vanacore Music ) with an impeccable reputation for producing music for unscripted television series. Today as President & CEO of Vanacore Music and co-owner with his wife Lisa, David continues to provide music for major network and cable shows in collaboration with his team of diversely talented composers and producers at his full-services, state-of-the-art music production facility in Los Angeles and recently established offices in Santa Monica and New York City.

He also led the establishment of Slough Estates. Background and education Percival Perry was born in Bristol, the third son of Alfred Thomas Perry and Elizabeth (n√©e Wheeler). He won a scholarship to King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham which he attended 1889‚Äì1894 then joined a solicitor's office but was unable to continue law studies from lack of funds.Richard Davenport-Hines, 'Perry, Percival Lee Dewhurst, Baron Perry (1878‚Äì1956)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Career 1903 Ford Model A Perry's first involvement with Ford At 17 Perry moved to London to work in the motor industry for H J Lawson. He prepared a technical report on the earliest Ford Model A cars imported to Britain. In 1904, Aubrey Blakiston established Ford's first British agency, the Central Motor Company, in Long Acre, London. Perry joined the company as a minority shareholder in 1905, and after Blakiston's departure became managing director in 1906. Cash flow was an issue despite loans from Perry's father-in-law, since Henry Ford insisted on payment up-front when cars for export were loaded at New York harbour. Perry travelled to Detroit to seek improved credit terms or investment in the company from Henry Ford. Although the mission was unsuccessful, good personal relationships were established with Henry Ford. Perry came up with the idea of Ford manufacturing cars outside North America to be sold across the British Empire and Europe. Ford By 1908, the Central Motor Company was in trouble, despite bringing in new partners and finance. Perry left the company, and briefly imported and sold REO cars. When Ford decided to pursue direct investment in Britain, he contacted Perry who in 1909 was appointed manager of a Ford branch company for Britain. Perry set up a network of exclusively Ford dealers, raced the company's cars and published comic verse promoting cars to the public. =Manufacture in Britain= In 1911 as head of the new Ford Motor Company (England) Limited he opened Ford's first factory outside North America in Trafford Park, Manchester. This operation, from 1914, included Britain's first mechanised chassis assembly system. =Unions= Perry broke trade unionism imposing job mobility, time wages and direct managerial control over production. He also followed Henry Ford's policy of paying his workers more than usual in their sector. The 1915 McKenna import duties enforced manufacture in Britain. In 1916 Perry formed Automobiles Ford in Paris to take over Ford operations in France. 1914‚Äì18 war Henry Ford's pacifist leanings did not make him or his company popular in wartime Britain. Perry, by contrast, devoted his time and effort to making Ford of Britain appear patriotic and loyal. From 1916 to 1919, this experience led to his strong objection to state controls over manufacturing, Perry served without remuneration as: * deputy controller of food production (Board of Agriculture and Fisheries) 1916 * director agricultural machinery department (Ministry of Munitions) 1917‚Äì18 * deputy controller mechanical warfare department (Ministry of Munitions) 1918‚Äì19 * director of traction mechanical warfare department (Ministry of Munitions) 1918‚Äì19 For this unpaid work he was appointed CBE in 1917 and knighted in 1918. After the armistice Perry was determined to run all European operations himself. Ford had supplied many vehicles to the war effort. Although successful in protecting Ford's UK position, Perry's active involvement in wartime British government did not play well with Ford's head office in Detroit. Their differences could not be reconciled and, in 1919, he was sacked. Ford's British operations were then run by managers sent from Detroit. Slough Trading Estate Limited Free from involvement with Ford, Perry was available to lead the consortium which in 1920 purchased the Slough military motor transport depot and converted it into a model manufacturing estate based on Trafford Park, Slough Trading Estate. In 1922 ‚Äì 1923, he persuaded Andr√© Citroen to begin building cars on the Slough Trading Estate. In 1922 he resigned as chairman and managing director though he retained his directorship and retired to live mostly on Herm in the Channel Islands where he wrote, with his wife The Island of Enchantment published in 1926. Henry Ford reviews his decision Dagenham Model Y, the first Ford designed for the market outside USA In the meantime, Ford's Detroit based management of Ford of Britain had not been successful. In 1928, Henry Ford asked Perry to become chairman, find directors and float a new British public listed company, Ford Motor Company Limited, 60% owned by Dearborn, taking over Ford operations throughout Europe and the Middle East and developing the new plants at Dagenham‚Äîthe largest automobile factory outside USA‚Äîand Cork in the Irish Free State. Perry formulated Ford's new European strategy. Though frustrated at times by deteriorating economic and political conditions he maintained English control over all European operations superintending factories and assembly plants in Eire, Denmark, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. In January 1932 Ford Dagenham began production of Ford Model Y the first Ford specifically designed for markets outside North America. Other involvements In addition to Slough Trading Perry held directorships with National Provincial Bank, The London Assurance and Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited and was briefly an advisor to the Minister of Food in 1939‚Äì40. During the depression he arranged Fordson Farms at Boreham in Essex, an experiment in co-operative farming. Many were surprised at his liking for poetry literature and the arts.The Times, Tuesday, 19 June 1956; pg. 13; Issue 53561 Obituary: Lord Perry.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics from 2007 through 2011. Listed at and , he both threw and batted left-handed. On May 9, 2010, Braden pitched a perfect game, the 19th in baseball history. The next season, shoulder problems were the first of a series of injuries that forced him to retire in 2014 after not throwing a pitch for two and a half seasons. Early life Braden was born in Phoenix, Arizona. He played Little League baseball in Stockton, California in the Hoover Tyler Little League. Braden graduated from Stagg High School in Stockton, where he played baseball and ran cross country. His mother, Jodie Atwood, died of cancer during his senior year. After his mother's death, he lived with his maternal grandmother. Braden was first drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 46th round of the 2001 MLB Draft, but he did not sign. Braden played two seasons of college baseball at American River College in Sacramento County, California, where he posted a combined record of 12‚Äì4 including a complete game against Fresno City College while allowing one hit and striking out 14 batters. He then played one season for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Professional career The Oakland Athletics drafted Braden out of Texas Tech in the 24th round of the 2004 MLB Draft. Minor League Baseball In 2004, Braden began the season with at Class A Short Season Vancouver Canadians. He made eight relief appearances, picking up a pair of victories and was promoted to the Class A Kane County Cougars and pitched exclusively as a starter. He made five starts for Kane County, and posted a 2‚Äì1 record. In 2005, Braden split the season between the Class A-Advanced Stockton Ports and the Double-A Midland RockHounds. He posted a 6‚Äì0 record for the Ports, and a 9‚Äì5 mark for the RockHounds. His composite total of 15 wins led all A's minor league pitchers and earned him Pitcher of the Year honors for the Athletics organization. He underwent shoulder surgery in the 2005‚Äì06 offseason. At the beginning of his minor league career, Braden was known for throwing the screwball; he abandoned it shortly after his shoulder surgery. Braden began the 2006 season on a rehabilitation assignment with the rookie league Arizona League Athletics. He made six starts, going 2‚Äì0 and moved up to Stockton, where was also 2‚Äì0 with a 6.23 ERA. He was promoted to Double-A Midland where he made one start, giving up six runs in innings pitched while receiving a no decision. His composite 2006 numbers were: 4‚Äì0 record, 4.10 ERA, 55 strikeouts and eight walks in innings of work. Oakland Athletics2007= Braden began 2007 in Double-A Midland and was called up to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats after one start. When Rich Harden got hurt on April 23, he was called up to the majors to replace him. On April 24, 2007, Braden made his first major league start and picked up the win against the Baltimore Orioles. He went 1‚Äì8 that season for Oakland, pitching innings across 20 games (14 starts) with 55 strikeouts and 26 walks. =2008= In 2008, Braden split time between Triple-A Sacramento and Oakland. He posted an ERA of 4.14 in 19 MLB games (10 starts), pitching innings with 41 strikeouts and 25 walks. =2009= Braden was Oakland's Opening Day starter in 2009, giving up three runs in six innings to the Los Angeles Angels on April 6 and taking the loss. He spent the entire season with Oakland, appearing in 22 games (all starts) while compiling an 8‚Äì9 record with 3.89 ERA, pitching innings with 81 strikeouts at 42 walks. =2010= Braden warming up before a game against the Boston Red Sox in 2010 On April 6, 2010, Braden's first outing of the season, he struck out a career high 10 batters in seven innings, allowing one run on four hits and walked one. He received a no-decision, but the team got the win in the tenth inning. On April 22, Braden was pitching against the New York Yankees when he became angry with Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez for breaking an unwritten rule when Rodriguez ran across the pitcher's mound on his way back to first base after a foul ball. At the end of the inning as the players were switching sides, Braden yelled at Rodriguez. Rodriguez offered no apology and later engaged Braden in the press, pointing to his short career and losing record. ;Perfect game On May 9, 2010, Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in MLB history against the Tampa Bay Rays in Oakland. He did it in 109 pitches, 77 of which were strikes, with catcher Landon Powell behind the plate. Braden had lost his mother to melanoma, so pitching the 19th perfect game in major league history was of even greater significance to Braden because he achieved the feat on Mother's Day. 10 years later, Braden claimed to have pitched the game while hungover. The Athletics celebrated the feat during the next homestand. On May 17, the A's placed a commemorative graphic on the outfield wall, next to Rickey Henderson's retired number. May 21 was called \\"Dallas Braden Day\\" by the City of Oakland. On May 22, Braden was awarded with the key to the city of Stockton at a Stockton Ports minor league game. Braden went on to finish the 2010 season with an 11‚Äì14 record in 30 starts for the A's. He threw five complete games along with two shutouts, pitching a total of innings with 113 strikeouts at 43 walks. =2011= Braden pitching in 2011 Braden went on to pitch in three starts in 2011, with a 1‚Äì1 record and 3.00 ERA, before feeling discomfort in his shoulder. It was revealed he had a torn capsule in his left shoulder and would need immediate surgery. Braden missed the remainder of the 2011 season. Retirement On December 13, 2011, Braden avoided arbitration by signing a one-year deal. He made $3.35 million in guaranteed money, with $400,000 in incentives. Braden missed the entire 2012 season and on August 21, Braden required an additional surgery, this time to repair the rotator cuff of his shoulder. The surgery would also sideline him for the first half of the 2013 season. Following the season, Braden was let go and he became a free agent. Braden officially announced his retirement on January 14, 2014, citing his arm being a \\"shredded mess\\". Career statistics Overall, in his five seasons with Oakland, Braden appeared in 94 MLB games (79 starts), compiling a 26‚Äì36 record with 4.16 ERA while pitching innings with 305 strikeouts and 141 walks. He did not have any postseason appearances, as the Athletics did not have a winning season in any of Braden's years with the team. Braden threw four pitches: a cutter at 82 MPH, a fastball at 86‚Äì88 MPH, a slurve at 72‚Äì79 MPH and a changeup at 72 MPH. Broadcasting career In 2014, Braden joined ESPN as a Baseball Tonight analyst and, the next season, moved into the broadcast booth as a color analyst on games. Early in the 2016 season, Braden was moved to ESPN's Monday Night Baseball booth following the network's dismissal of Curt Schilling. Braden was laid off with dozens of other ESPN employees on April 26, 2017. On July 14, 2017, Braden debuted on NBC Sports California as a new field-level analyst for the A's broadcasts. Since then, he has substituted for Ray Fosse in the TV booth as a color commentator. His trademark call for replays of A‚Äôs home runs is, ‚ÄúAll aboard! Next stop...Pound-town!‚Äù In 2017, Braden started a podcast and Facebook Live show, \\"Starting 9\\", with co-host Jared Carrabis on Barstool Sports. He also hosts a radio show on Barstool's SiriusXM channel called Dialed In with Dallas Braden. Personal life Braden helps give food and money for Charity Communities in Stockton. On Thanksgiving, he personally collects and distributes food for the needy. In 2001, the University of the Pacific in Stockton gave Braden an Annual Community Service Award. Braden threw out the first pitch at the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Little League World Series. In October 2015, the Los Rios Community College District honored Braden as a distinguished alumnus on behalf of American River College where he was a student and played baseball for two seasons.

Her exceptional promise as a singer was soon recognised, and she gave her d√©but concert with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris in 1919. Career This first concert was attended by Gabriel Faur√© and Maurice Ravel, both of whom went on to work closely with her in performances of their works. Faur√© accompanied her in the first performance of his song cycle Mirages in December 1919. For Ravel she gave the first performances of the orchestral version of his Deux m√©lodies h√©bra√Øques in 1920, and the Chansons mad√©casses in 1926. Her other associations with Ravel included a concert tour with him in Spain in 1928, participation in the Ciboure festival for the composer in 1930, and singing at a memorial concert after his death. Joseph Canteloube dedicated to her a set of his Chants d'Auvergne, and she gave the first performance of them in 1926, achieving considerable popular success. Her repertoire also included works by Ottorino Respighi, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger. Madeleine Grey travelled widely, especially in Italy and the United States, appearing at many festivals. She sometimes experienced the rising influence of anti-semitism, as in 1933 when her engagement at a concert in Florence was abruptly cancelled and she was replaced by another singer. When the war with Germany broke out in 1939 she was abroad, and did not return to France until 1947. She lived in Paris again from 1952, and died there in 1979. Reputation Ravel provided an early account of Madeleine Grey's voice in a letter recommending her to the conductor Ernest Ansermet: \\"She is one of the most remarkable interpreters: an attractive voice, fairly powerful, and very clear. And, very notably, perfect diction. Thanks to her, people have heard Sh√©h√©razade as something other than a symphonic poem.\\"Maurice Ravel. Lettres, √©crits, entretiens; [edited by] Arbie Orenstein. Paris: Flammarion, 1989. p.189 (Letter 180). ; . This view has been endorsed by a modern critic on the basis of her recordings: \\"Her voice is strong and clear, her diction excellent, her interpretations were individual and intelligent.\\"John Steane, in: Grove Music Online; edited by L. Macy; article on Madeleine Grey (accessed 12 March 2007) Recordings Madeleine Grey's legacy of recordings is small but significant. In 1930, she made the first recording of a selection of the Chants d'Auvergne by Canteloube (chosen from series I-III and filling 7 sides of 78 rpm records, 1 one of which was not issued). In 1932, she also made recordings of Ravel's Chansons mad√©casses, the Deux m√©lodies h√©bra√Øques and the Chanson h√©bra√Øque (6 sides of 78 rpm) which were supervised by the composer and which therefore give a unique insight into his expectations of performance. All of these recordings have been re-issued on CD (Pearl GEMM 0013). ReferencesPublications Grey, Madeleine. \\"Souvenirs d'une interpr√®te\\", in Revue musicale, n.185‚Äì187 (1938), ().

Erected between the 6th century BC and the 18th century AD, hero stones are found all over India. They often carry inscriptions displaying a variety of adornments, including bas relief panels, frieze, and figures on carved stone. Usually they are in the form of a stone monument and may have an inscription at the bottom with a narrative of the battle. The Earliest and oldest of such memorial Hero stones is found in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu is more than 2400 years old that is 4th Century BC. According to the historian Upinder Singh, the largest concentration of such memorial stones is found in the Indian state of Karnataka. About two thousand six hundred and fifty hero stones,the earliest in Karnataka is dated to the 5th century AD.Chapter \\"Memorializing death in stone\\", Singh (2009), p48 The custom of erecting memorial stones dates back to the Iron Age (400 BC) though a vast majority were erected between the 4th century BC to 13th centuries AD. Description Five panel Viragal from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription A hero stone was usually divided into three panels, but occasionally, into four or five panels depending on the event. The upper panel depicts the subject worshiping a deity such as a Shiva linga, the middle panel depicts the hero sometimes seated in a palanquin or a shrine being lifted toward the heavens by apsaras (heavenly nymphs), and the lower panels would display battle scenes One of the largest Viragallu, about 12 feet high is found in Betageri, Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu Department of Archeology found several hundred hero stones that had been erected in the memory of warriors who sacrificed their lives defending their community or region. Those that are carved with inscriptions narrate the act of the hero, the battle, and the name of king who fought the battle. The stones are found alone or in groups, often near an irrigation tank or lake outside a village. One hero stone dating to the 9th century Pallava King Dantivarman, depicts the hero riding a galloping horse beautifully dressed and carrying a spear. Another was recovered at Pappapatti in Usilampatti taluk and probably dates from the 18th century. This stone shows a warrior posed heroically, accompanied by his wife who holds a flower. Creating hero stones had been prevalent since the Sangam period dating back 2300 years, and continuing until the Nayaka and post-Nayaka period to about 19th century. In March 2014, a hero stone dating to the 8th century Pandya country, with an inscription in Tamil vatteluttu script was found in Vellalankottai in the Tuticorin district. and another that was installed by a woman in memory of her husband who killed a leopard preying in cattle that strayed into the hamlet. In 2017, two rare hero stones raised in honor of warrior-women riding to a battle were found, dating back 13th century. Hero stones were not always made in honor of a person(s). The Atakur inscription (also spelt Athakur) is one such hero stone. It is dated to 939 A.D. and includes classical Kannada poetic inscription commemorating the death of the favorite hound of Ganga King Butuga II (the hound died fighting a wild boar).Altekar (1934), p351 Gallery File:Pulimo-Kombai.jpgHero stone that is 4th Century BC Tamil-Brahmi inscription during Tamil Sangam age in Theni district, Tamil Nadu File:Hero stone with old Kannada inscription at the Tarakeshvara temple at Hangal 1.jpgHero stone from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription from the Tarakeshvara Temple at Hangal, Karnataka File:Hero stone (virgal) with old Kannada inscription at the Tarakeshvara temple at Hangal.jpgHero stone from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription from the Tarakeshvara Temple at Hangal, Karnataka File:Hero_stone_with_old_Kannada_inscription_in_the_Tarakeshvara_temple_at_Hangal_2.jpgHero stone from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription from the Tarakeshvara Temple at Hangal, Karnataka File:‡≤¨‡≥á‡≤°‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≤£‡≤ø ‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≥ç ‡≥ß.JPG Seven panel Hero Stone from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription from Siddapur taluk, Karnataka File:‡≤¨‡≥á‡≤°‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≤£‡≤ø ‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≥ç ‡≥®.JPG Seven panel Hero Stone from 12th century with Old Kannada inscription from Siddapur taluk, Karnataka File:Herostone - 3.jpgSeven panel Hero Stone from 1152 AD Old with Old Kannada inscription from Shimoga taluk, Karnataka File:Herostone - 5.jpgSeven panel Hero Stone from 1152 AD Old with Old Kannada inscription from Shimoga taluk, Karnataka File:Virgal (hero stone) in Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi 1.JPGHero stone with 1160 AD Old Kannada inscription from the rule of Kalachuri King Bijjala in Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi in Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Hero stone (virgal) with Kannada inscription in Kalleshvara temple at Bagali.JPGHero stone with 11th- or 12th-century Old Kannada inscription in Kalleshvara temple in Bagali in Davangere district, Karnataka File:Virgal (hero stone) in Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi 2.JPG Hero stone with 1180 AD Old Kannada inscription from the rule of Kalachuri King Ahavamalla in Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi in Shimoga district, Karnataka File:A virgal (herostone) in Kaitabhesvara temple at Kubatur.JPGHero stone with old Kannada inscription dated 1235 AD from the rule of Yadava King Singhana II in Kaitabeshvara temple at Kubatur in Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Herostones at Bandalike Trimurti Narayanagudi 1.JPGHero stone from 10th century with Old Kannada inscription at Trimurthi Narayana Gudi, Karnataka File:Herostones at Bandalike Trimurti Narayanagudi 3.jpgHero stone from 10th century with Old Kannada inscription at Trimurthi Narayana Gudi, Karnataka File:Herostone - 1.jpgHero stone with 1152 AD Old Kannada inscription, Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Herostone - 2.jpgHero stone with 1152 AD Old Kannada inscription, Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Herostone - 4.jpgHero stone with 1152 AD Old Kannada inscription, Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Herostone - 6.jpgHero stone with 1152 AD Old Kannada inscription, Shimoga district, Karnataka File:Herostone - 7.jpgHero stone with 1152 AD Old Kannada inscription, Shimoga district, Karnataka Image:Herostone in Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.jpgHero stone from Later Chalukya period at Siddhesvara temple at Haveri in Haveri district, Karnataka Image:Hero Stone with old-Kannada inscription at Arasikere.jpgHero stone with old Kannada inscription, 1220 AD, Arasikere, Karnataka Image:‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≤‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç.jpgMurugamangalam hero stone, Tamil Nadu Image:‡Æ®‡Æ∞‡Æö‡Æø‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç.JPGNarasinga Puram hero stone, 12th century AD, Tamil Nadu Image:‡Æ§‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æø ‡Æ®‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç2.jpgTatchampadi hero stone, Tamil Nadu Image:‡Æï‡Øä‡Æ≥‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æø ‡Æ®‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç.JPGOlakkaravaadi hero stone 12th century AD, Tamil Nadu See also * Paliya NotesReferences * * External links * Hero Stones * *Hero-stone Memorials of India *Rare Hero stone found near Erode *Pallava period 'herostone' unearthed in Vellore dt. *Government Museum Chennai *Huntington Archive Hero Stone *Ancient Hero stone goes missing in Goa Category:Monuments and memorials in India Category:Inscriptions by type Category:Monuments and memorials in Karnataka ","title":"Hero stone"},{"id":"10076480","text":"Tagmersheim is a municipality in the district of Donau-Ries in Bavaria in Germany.

She was also named after her World War II namesake, just like the other two frigates of the Romanian Navy, Regele Ferdinand and Regina Maria, which use the names of the two World War II-era Regele Ferdinand-class destroyers. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti served as the flagship of the navy between 1985 and 2004, when Regele Ferdinand (formerly ) became the new flagship. She is the largest warship of the Romanian Navy ever built in Romania. History The construction of the warship began on 1 March 1978 at the 2 Mai military shipyard from Mangalia. In 1984, she began sea trials. The warship was initially classified as a light cruiser by the Communist government and was named Muntenia, after the historical province of Romania. Nicolae Ceau»ôescu christened the ship himself on 2 August 1986. The cruiser was entirely a Romanian project, with the exception of the armament which was license-built or of Soviet origin. The warship had an excessive topweight that caused stability problems even in calm waters. As a result, in June 1988 Muntenia returned to the shipyard where she underwent a major reconstruction program that lasted until August 1992. On 2 May 1990, Muntenia was renamed Timi»ôoara in honor of the city where the Romanian Revolution of 1989 first started. The warship was also reclassified as a destroyer. However, on 27 August 1990, the destroyer was renamed MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, after the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti in World War I. On 1 April 2001, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was classified as a frigate by the Romanian General Staff.

Stockport North In boundary changes which took effect at the 1950 general election, Stockport was divided into two single- member constituencies. Hulbert was chosen for Stockport North, which was slightly better territory for the Conservatives than the South division. He retained the seat and in the new Parliament was designated as a Temporary Chairman of the House and as a Chairman of Standing Committees. From 1952, Hulbert was a Deputy Lieutenant of Middlesex, and he was also appointed as Honorary Colonel of no. 461 HAA Regiment of the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army) in the same year. He received a Knighthood in 1955. Business difficulty One of Hulbert's business posts was taken from him in September 1956. He had for a long time been a director of the R.F.D. Company, aeronautical engineers and fabric screen printers, and had been chairman since the 1940s. However, in the company's annual meeting in June 1956, he unsuccessfully proposed to appoint three additional directors. When the proposal was ruled out of order, Hulbert was asked to resign and agreed to do so in September. However, in the summer of 1956, Hulbert sent a letter to the company's shareholders asking for support to requisition an Extraordinary General Meeting to elect the new directors, which the board took as an indication that no resignation would be forthcoming and they therefore dismissed him as a director.\\"R.F.D.

That Was The Week That Was Hulbert was incensed when, on 19 January 1963, the BBC television programme That Was The Week That Was broadcast an item identifying the 13 members of parliament who had not spoken in the Chamber since the general election. He raised the issue as a question of Parliamentary privilege, saying that it was a claim that the Members concerned had not been attentive to their Parliamentary duties, and was inaccurate.\\"Privilege cry raised about 'The Week'\\", The Times, 24 January 1963. Many other MPs considered the complaint itself risible and laughed while he was making it.\\"Privilege Issue Raised on B.B.C. Satire\\", The Times, 24 January 1963.

The project was initiated by Woolwich Borough Council but failed to work and was demolished in 1965-66. The Auto Stacker was an automated system for parking cars, and effectively an automated multi-storey car park, using a combination of conveyor belts, lifts and dollies to move vehicles from ground level to one of 256 car park spaces. It was situated above a car showroom, workshop and petrol station on Beresford Street, on the site of the former Empire Theatre. Being situated along the A206 road, close to Woolwich market (Beresford Square) and the town's main shopping street (Powis Street), it was thought that the Auto Stacker, along with the introduction of parking meters, would solve the town's parking problems., Woolwich ‚Äì Survey of London, Volume 48, pp. 83-84.

It was built in 1960-61 at a cost of ¬£100,000. It was constructed more or less simultaneously with the comparable Zidpark at Southwark Bridge, a private enterprise. The Woolwich Auto Stacker was officially opened by Princess Margaret on 11 May 1961. At the opening ceremony, the demonstration vehicle got stuck and had to be manhandled in.

It was created in Burlington County, New Jersey, in the late 19th century. As the name suggests, it is a large breed, and is among the heaviest of all chicken breeds. Jersey Giant Chicken American Livestock Breeds Conservancy.  History  The Jersey Giant was created by John and Thomas Black; with the intent of replacing the turkey, the kind of poultry used primarily for meat at the time. They were produced by crossing Black Javas, Black Langshans, and Dark Brahmas. The Black Jersey Giant was added to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1922. The White variety was added in 1947, and Blue in 2002. Black Jersey Giants are, on average, a pound heavier than White Jersey Giants. Though the breed's present size is considerable, they were heavier in the past. For a time, they were raised as capons and as broilers by the meat industry. They grow much more slowly than today's more common meat birds, and are thus not widely used in the industry.  Characteristics  A large amount of food and time are required for the Jersey Giant to reach its full size. The Jersey Giant is a calm and docile breed. The cocks are rarely aggressive. The hens lay very large brown eggs, and are fair layers overall, known particularly as good winter layers. The birds are robust and fairly cold- hardy. The breed's plumage comes in blue as well as black and white; legs are willow in hue. Jersey Giant hens will go broody.

Early life  Caldwell was born in 1953 in Houston. His father was a tailor who made suits for James Brown, The Temptations and other celebrities. His mother was a high-school guidance counselor. His family lived in the Kashmere Gardens neighborhood of Houston, and Caldwell graduated from Kashmere High School. He attended Carleton College, receiving a B.A. in economics in 1975. Caldwell then attended the Wharton School of Business, receiving an M.B.A. degree in 1977. He worked briefly as an investment banker at First Boston in New York City before returning to Houston for a job at the bond firm of Hibbard, O'Conner and Weeks. Caldwell felt called to Christian ministry, attending the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University and receiving a masters in divinity in 1981. While working on his degree, Caldwell was appointed associate pastor at St. Mary's United Methodist Church in Houston. He had been a member of the Continental Airlines board of directors since May 1999.\\"Board of Directors & Company Officers.\\" Continental Airlines. Retrieved on February 5, 2009.  Pastorate  A major theme in Caldwell's preaching has been the need for his congregation to follow Jesus Christ's example with active involvement in community service. He retooled the Windsor Village United Methodist Church into a community help center. Nonprofit organizations begun by the church include Patrice House, a shelter for abused children; a tutoring program for schoolchildren, and a program matching teenagers with mentors. To accommodate the congregation, in 1993 the church purchased a former Kmart in an impoverished area of Houston and renovated it as the Power Center (for the retailing term \\"power center\\"). In addition to worship space, the Power Center includes a school, a medical clinic, satellite classrooms for a local community college, low-cost office space, a branch of the Chase Bank (there were previously no banks in the neighborhood), a WIC nutrition program and an AIDS outreach center. The Power Center's mission is to create jobs in the low- income neighborhood and teach members of the neighborhood to create wealth. Its motto is Isaiah 61.4: \\"They shall repair the ruined cities and restore what has long lain desolate\\". The Gospel of Good Success In 1996 the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story on Caldwell, which prompted Simon & Schuster to approach him about a book. The 1999 book, co-authored with Mark Seal, was The Gospel of Good Success: A Road Map to Spiritual, Emotional, and Financial Wholeness and describes Caldwell's theories on economic empowerment and success.  Relationship with George W. Bush  In 1996 George W. Bush, then governor of Texas, saw an article on Caldwell in the Dallas Morning News and contacted him. Bush spoke at the 1996 opening of the Power Center, and they agreed that a partnership between religious organizations and government could have positive social results. Although Caldwell is a political independent, in 2000 Bush asked Caldwell to introduce him at the 2000 Republican National Convention. Caldwell offered the benediction at Bush's 2001 inauguration. His prayer triggered controversy; Caldwell prayed in \\"the name that's above all other names, Jesus the Christ. Let all who agree say amen\\". Alan Dershowitz wrote, \\"The plain message conveyed by the new administration is that George W. Bush's America is a Christian nation, and that non-Christians are welcome into the tent so long as they agree to accept their status as a tolerated minority rather than as full equal citizens\\". Caldwell denies proselytizing, saying that he always prayed in the name of Jesus. Days after the September 11 attacks in 2001, Caldwell was invited by President Bush to speak at the memorial at the Washington National Cathedral. Later that day, Caldwell joined Bush on his visit to the World Trade Center site. Bush wrote in Decision Points, \\"it was comforting to have a friend and a man of faith by my side\\". In 2003, Bush visited the Power Center for its 10th anniversary. Caldwell again offered the benediction at Bush's second inauguration; this time he prayed, \\"respective of all faiths, I submit this prayer in the name of Jesus.\\" On May 10, 2008, Caldwell officiated at the wedding of Jenna Bush and Henry Hager in Crawford, Texas. Caldwell's work at the Power Center was an inspiration for Bush's \\"faith based initiatives\\", and Caldwell was influential in the creation of the White House Office of Faith- Based and Community Initiatives.  Relationship with Barack Obama  Caldwell endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, supporting him against John McCain in the presidential election. In August 2010, after media reports that 18 percent of Americans thought President Obama was a Muslim, Caldwell told reporters he had known Obama for years as a Christian who prays daily. He described the media questioning Obama's religion as \\"a 24-hour noise box committed to presenting the president in a false light\\".White House: Obama Is ‚ÄòObviously‚Äô Christian , KT Radio Network, August 20, 2010 Second book and recent work Caldwell published his second book, Entrepreneurial Faith: Launching Bold Initiatives to Expand God's Kingdom, in 2004. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Houston was home to thousands of displaced residents from New Orleans, Louisiana. Caldwell organized a food drive, Operation Compassion, with other churches in the Houston area to feed and pray for those living in the George R. Brown Convention Center and the Astrodome. Corinthian Pointe Caldwell, the Pyramid Residential Community Corporation and Ryland Homes built a Houston subdivision named Corinthian Pointe during the first decade of the 21st century.

Fraud charges  In March 2018, Caldwell and financial planner Gregory Allen Smith were accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding investors of 3.4 million dollars through worthless bonds. According to the 13-count indictment, Caldwell and Smith made millions selling historical Chinese pre-Communist government bonds as if they were valuable investment instruments. The bonds are worthless for that purpose, because China's Communist government repudiated them. They have historical value only, as collector's items. Instead of investing the funds, the two men allegedly used the money for personal loans, credit card balances, mortgages, and vehicles. The men each face up to 20 years in prison on wire fraud counts and 10 years on money laundering counts.Houston megachurch pastor, accomplice bilked investors out of more than $1M: Feds, CBS News, March 30, 2018 Caldwell maintains that the bonds are legitimate and that he is \\"100 percent innocent\\".Pastor Kirbyjon Caldwell, accused of swindling investors, '100 percent innocent,' attorney says, Click2Houston, April 2, 2018 On March 17, 2020, Caldwell pleaded guilty to fraud charges.

Founded in 1792 as the Calcutta Cricket Club, it merged later with the Calcutta Football Club (founded 1872) to become the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, and is located on Gurusaday Dutt Road. It has arguably the most picturesque cricket ground in Kolkata. Recent evidence in the form of an article in Hicky's Bengal Gazette, suggests the club existed in 1780 - which would make it the oldest cricket club in the world. It also has a set of fine restaurants, perhaps the most notable of them is one of Kolkata's well-known Chinese restaurant, Mainland China. Also nearby are Birla Temple and Gandhara Art Gallery.

It took place immediately after the Red Army withdrew from Siping in March 1946, and resulted in a Communist victory. Prelude On January 8, 1946, Liu Handong (ÂàòÁÄö‰∏ú), the commander of the Nationalist 107th Division, arrived at Siping with over a hundred associates to discuss the city's transfer from the Soviet Red Army to the Chinese administration. The Red Army still occupied the city at the time. Subsequently, on January 10, the Nationalists created the Liaobei (ËæΩÂåó) Province, with Liu Handong (ÂàòÁÄö‰∏ú) named the chairman of the province, and Nationalist provincial governmental member Li Chongguo (ÊùéÂÖÖÂõΩ) named the mayor of Siping. The Nationalists had neither sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to effectively assume control of the previously Japanese-occupied region of China, and they could not spare enough forces to hold the city long enough for reinforcements to arrive. The Nationalists at Siping recruited bandits in the region, including members from the Good Under the Heaven (Â§©‰∏ãÂ•Ω) and Flying Over the Grass (Ëçâ‰∏äÈ£û) gangs, to secure the local garrison. Enlisting the gangs angered the local populace, which already blamed the Nationalists for losing the region to the Japanese invaders. As a result, the Nationalists lost popular support in the region, a problem exacerbated by the fact that the hired bandits had fought the Nationalists both prior to and during the war and had cooperated with the Japanese invaders. The Nationalists recruited forces from the former Japanese puppet regime, such as the Iron Stone Units (Tie Shi Bu Dui, ÈìÅÁü≥ÈÉ®Èòü), to be part of the local garrison, which only increased the hatred from the local populace, which had suffered under the Japanese puppet regime. First Nationalist offensive and counterattack On January 25, 1946, L√º Zhengcao (ÂêïÊ≠£Êìç), the commander-in-chief of the communist Western Manchurian Military District, and Li Fuchun (ÊùéÂØåÊò•), the political commissar of the communist Western Manchurian Military District, redeployed the communist 10th Brigade and the 24th Brigade to the Pear Tree (Li Shu, Ê¢®Ê†ë), Changtu, and Gongzhuling regions surrounding Siping. In an attempt to eradicate the enemy and secure the city, the Nationalists launched an offensive against the Communists in late February. However, the former bandits proved no match for combat-hardened Communists who were veterans of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Nationalist force, consisting of former bandits from the Pressuring Nine Dragons (Ya Jiu Long, Âéã‰πùÈæô) gang, attacked the communist Siping Group and inflicted more than a dozen fatalities and injured a Communist squadron commander, Cheng Bizhen (Á®ãÁßâË¥û). The Communists quickly counterattacked, completely annihilating the attacking Nationalists. The failed attempt by the Nationalists provided an excellent excuse for the Communists to counterattack, and, in a short period of several days, the Nationalist strongholds at Crouching Tiger Village (Wo Hu Tun, ÂçßËôéÂ±Ø), Maolin (ËåÇÊûó), Baokang (‰øùÂ∫∑), and Twin Mountains (Shuang Shan, ÂèåÂ±±) fell into Communist hands. All the Nationalist garrisons guarding these strongholds were former bandits from various gangs, including the Old Second Brother (Lao Er Ge, ËÄÅ‰∫åÂì•), Seven Stars (Qi Xing Zi, ‰∏ÉÊòüÂ≠ê), Old Man Smile (Lao Tou Le, ËÄÅÂ§¥‰πê) and Nine Provinces (Jiu Sheng, ‰πùÁúÅ) gangs. The Nationalists were forced back on the defensive after their failure in the rural regions and the fighting temporarily stopped. Communist capture of Siping The clash resumed after the Soviet Red Army withdrew from Siping on March 13, 1946. On March 15, the airport in the western suburb of the city had fallen into Communist hands, and by the next day, the 6,000-strong Communist force had completed their siege of the city. At 4:00 AM on March 17, the assault on the city began. After ten hours of fierce battle, the city succumbed, with its entire garrison defeated. The Nationalist commander Liu Handong (ÂàòÁÄö‰∏ú) and his deputies, the former bandit chieftains Wang Dahua (ÁéãÂ§ßÂåñ) and Wang Yaodong (ÁéãËÄÄ‰∏ú) were captured alive. However, a few of the defenders, including the Nationalist chief of security Zhang Dongkai (Âº†‰∏úÂáØ) and deputy chief of security Wang Yongqing (ÁéãÊ∞∏Ê∏Ö), were able to escape by disguising themselves as beggars. The Communists had also captured 69 machine guns, 32 artillery pieces, over two thousand firearms, nearly two dozen automobiles, over 300 military horses and large amount of supplies from the Nationalist defenders. The Nationalists lost support from the local populace as a result of the defeat. Nationalist counteroffensive Chiang Kai-shek was furious that the city had fallen and sent out a force to retake the city. By March 21, 1946, the Nationalists had taken nearby Liaoyang, and by March 22, the Nationalists took Fushun and Tieling. On March 22, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiong Shihui (ÁÜäÂºèËæâ), the chief Nationalist administrator in Northeast China and Zheng Dongguo (ÈÉëÊ¥ûÂõΩ), the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist force in Northeast China, to launch a counteroffensive targeting Siping from the provincial capital of Shenyang. The goal was to take Siping before April 2. The Nationalist offensive was spearheaded by the New 1st Army and the 71st Army, and the Nationalist deputy commander-in-chief Liang Huasheng (Ê¢ÅÂçéÁõõ) was named as the frontline commander to set up headquarters at Tieling. Chiang‚Äôs plan collapsed when melting snow turned the roads to mud, bogging down the highly mechanized Nationalist force, making it unable to reach Siping. The Nationalists would also suffer another defeat in the Jinjiatun Campaign due to the harsh terrain which was hostile to the highly mechanized force.

The ICF serves an international audience through their website, and hosts a large community where cystinuric individuals, parents of cystinuric children, and physicians can share experiences and information for the purposes of education and support. History The website www.cystinuria.org was founded on October 17 of 2002 and was opened to the public later that month. The initial site featured the first version of the Cystinuria.org community forum as well as a dictionary to aid interested readers in understanding cystinuria-relevant scientific literature. In mid November, the first learning tutorial was published, providing readers with a basic understanding of amino acid structure and function with an emphasis on cysteine and cystine. More tutorials were added covering the relevant topics of stone formation, stone prevention, and antibiotic use (for patients with recurring infections). The development of educational tutorials continued into early 2004, when the site became the online home of the newly incorporated Cystinuria Foundation of America (CysFA). On August 8, 2005, following the successful organization of the first Cystinuria Sympoiusm, CysFA was dissolved and the International Cystinuria Foundation was incorporated in its place to reflect the goal of reaching out to affected individuals worldwide. On March 30, 2006, the ICF was awarded 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and classified as a public charity. Symposia A main goal of the ICF is to hold annual symposia where top experts in the cystinuria-related fields of urology, nephrology, genetics, and psychological health present educational information and cutting-edge research findings to general members of the cystinuric community. To date, the ICF has held three such symposia, two in New York City and one in Chicago.

A canopy bed is a decorative bed somewhat similar to a four-poster bed. A typical canopy bed usually features posts at each of the four corners extending four feet high or more above the mattress. Ornate or decorative fabric is often draped across the upper space between the posts and a solid swath of cloth may create a ceiling, or canopy directly over the bed. History Canopy bed of the Chinese Qing dynasty, late 19th or early 20th century. The canopy bed came into existence more for utilitarian means rather than for extravagance or decadence. Canopy beds with curtains that could completely enclose the bed were used by lords and noblemen in medieval Europe for warmth and privacy, as their attendants often slept in the same room. Until the 16th century, these beds, even those of the nobles, were fairly plain and understated. During this period, carved work on the headboard and posts became popular and more ornate canopy beds followed. \\"History Of The Four Poster Bed\\" In pre-Republican China, until 1911, the family's canopy bed was the most important piece of household furniture, and often part of the bride's dowry. As signifiers of status, these beds were often intricately decorated with auspicious motifs, particularly relating to fertility, longevity and a happy marital union.Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, plaque accompanying exhibit no. 2009.84, visited 2014 Modern canopy beds Modern canopy bed Today's canopy beds generally fit into one of two categories: traditional or contemporary. Most of the traditional canopy beds have a Victorian aesthetic, with either metal rod frames or intricately carved wood frames and posts. These throwbacks also often feature ruffled, pleated elaborate draping, sometimes with rather heavy cloth. In contrast, contemporary canopy beds generally employ a simpler design. Wood, metal, or a combination of the two is used in the construction of modern canopy beds, which usually have little to no detail on the foot and headboards and often feature sharp, geometric designs. The individual parts of modern canopy beds are called as follows: * Bed frame: A typical metal frame that supports the mattress and box spring independent of the headboard or footboard.Von Tobel, Jackie. \\"Bedding Basics: Key Bed Terms.\\" The Design Directory of Bedding.

It is celebrated on 7 September, the anniversary of the date in 1822 that prince regent Dom Pedro declared Brazil's independence from the former United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves. Formal recognition came with a treaty three years later, signed by the new Empire of Brazil and the Kingdom of Portugal in late 1825. Background Landing of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in Brazil, South America, 1500. The land now called Brazil was claimed by the Kingdom of Portugal in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese naval fleet commanded by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. The Portuguese encountered Indigenous nations divided into several tribes, most of whom shared the same Tupi‚ÄìGuarani languages family, and shared and disputed the territory. But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza killed tens of thousands. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively started in 1534 when King John III divided the territory into fifteen hereditary captaincies. This arrangement proved problematic, however, and in 1549 the king assigned a Governor-General to administer the entire colony. The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes while others slowly disappeared in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity. By the mid-16th century, sugar had become Brazil's most important export due to the increasing international demand for sugar. To profit from the situation, by 1700 over 963,000 African slaves had been brought across the Atlantic Ocean to work in the plantations of Brazil. More Africans were brought to Brazil up until that date than to all the other places in The Americas (Western Hemisphere) combined.See the tables here Through wars against the French, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast, taking Rio de Janeiro in 1567, and to the northwest, taking S√£o Lu√≠s in 1615. They sent military expeditions to the northwest of the South American continent to the Amazon River basin rainforest and conquered competing English and Dutch strongholds, founding villages and forts from 1669. In 1680 they reached the far southeast and founded Sacramento on the bank of the Rio de la Plata, in the Banda Oriental region (present-day Uruguay). At the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline, but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by explorers in the region that would later be called Minas Gerais (General Mines) in current Mato Grosso, Goi√°s and the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais saved the colony from imminent collapse. From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants came to the mines in an early \\"gold rush\\". The Spanish tried to prevent Portuguese expansion northwest, west, southwest and southeast into the territory that belonged to them according to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas division of the New World of The Americas by the Bishop and Pope of Rome, Pope Alexander VI (1431-1503, reigned 1492-1503) and succeeded in conquering the Banda Oriental region in 1777. However, this was in vain as the Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed in the same year, confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion, thus creating most of the current Brazilian southeastern border. During the French invasion of Portugal by Emperor Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family (House of Braganza) fled across the Atlantic Ocean with the help of the British Royal Navy to Brazil, establishing Rio de Janeiro as the de facto capital of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire during the ensuing worldwide Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). This had the side effect of soon creating within Brazil many of the institutions required to exist as an independent state; most importantly, it freed Brazil to trade with other nations at will. After Napoleon's Imperial French army was finally defeated at Waterloo in June 1815, in order to maintain the capital in Brazil and allay Brazilian fears of being returned to colonial status, King John VI of Portugal raised the de jure status of Brazil to an equal, integral part of a new status in a United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, rather than a mere colony, a status which it enjoyed for the next seven years, sending his son, Dom Pedro, as prince regent. Path to independence=Portuguese Cortes The Portuguese Cortes In 1820 the Constitutionalist Revolution erupted in Portugal. The movement initiated by the liberal constitutionalists resulted in the meeting of the Cortes (or Constituent Assembly), that would have to create the kingdom's first constitution.Lustosa, p.97Armitage. p.36 The Cortes at the same time demanded the return of King Dom John VI, who had been living in Brazil since 1808, who elevated Brazil to a kingdom as part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in 1815 and who nominated his son and heir prince Dom Pedro as regent, to govern Brazil in his place on 7 March 1821.Lustosa, p.106Armitage. p. 38 The king left for Europe on 26 April, while Dom Pedro remained in Brazil governing it with the aid of the ministers of the Kingdom (Interior) and Foreign Affairs, of War, of Navy and of Finance.Lustosa, pp. 109‚Äì10Armitage. p. 41 The Portuguese military officers headquartered in Brazil were completely sympathetic to the Constitutionalist movement in Portugal.Lustosa, p. 112 The main leader of the Portuguese officers, General Jorge de Avilez Zuzarte de Sousa Tavares, forced the prince to dismiss and banish from the country the ministers of Kingdom and Finance. Both were loyal allies of Pedro, who had become a pawn in the hands of the military.Lustosa, pp. 113‚Äì14 The humiliation suffered by the prince, who swore he would never yield to the pressure of the military again, would have a decisive influence on his abdication ten years later.Lustosa, p. 114 Meanwhile, on 30 September 1821, the Cortes approved a decree that subordinated the governments of the Brazilian provinces directly to Portugal. Prince Pedro became for all purposes only the governor of Rio de Janeiro Province.Lustosa, p. 117Armitage. pp. 43‚Äì44 Other decrees that came after ordered his return to Europe and also extinguished the judicial courts created by Jo√£o VI in 1808.Lustosa, p.119Armitage. pp. 48‚Äì51 Dissatisfaction over the Cortes measures among most residents in Brazil (both Brazilian-born and Portuguese-born) rose to a point that it soon became publicly known. Two groups that opposed the Cortes' actions to gradually undermine Brazilian sovereignty appeared: Liberals, led by Joaquim Gon√ßalves Ledo (with the support of the Freemasons), and the Bonifacians, led by Jos√© Bonif√°cio de Andrada. The factions, with quite different views of what Brazil could and should be, agreed only on their desire to keep Brazil co-equal with Portugal, united in a sovereign monarchy, rather than Brazil being merely provinces controlled from Lisbon.Di√©gues, p. 70 Avilez rebellion Jorge de Avilez (left) to return to Portugal after his failed rebellion, 8 February 1822. Jos√© Bonif√°cio (in civilian clothes) can be seen next to the prince. The Portuguese members of the Cortes showed no respect towards Prince Pedro and openly mocked him.Lustosa, p.120 And so the loyalty that Pedro had shown towards the Cortes gradually shifted to the Brazilian cause. His wife, princess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, favoured the Brazilian side and encouraged him to remain in the countryLustosa, pp. 121‚Äì22 which the Liberals and Bonifacians openly called for. Pedro's reply to the Cortes came on 9 January 1822, when, according to newspapers, he said: \\"As it is for the good of all and for the nation's general happiness, I am ready: Tell the people that I will stay\\".Lustosa, pp. 123-24 After Pedro's decision to defy the Cortes, around 2,000 men led by Jorge Avilez rioted before concentrating on mount Castelo, which was soon surrounded by 10,000 armed Brazilians, led by the Royal Police Guard.Lustosa, pp. 132‚Äì34 Dom Pedro then \\"dismissed\\" the Portuguese commanding general and ordered him to remove his soldiers across the bay to Niter√≥i, where they would await transport to Portugal.Lustosa, p. 135 Jose Bonif√°cio was nominated minister of Kingdom and Foreign Affairs on 18 January 1822.Lustosa, p. 138 Bonif√°cio soon established a fatherlike relationship with Pedro, who began to consider the experienced statesman his greatest ally.Lustosa, p. 139 Gon√ßalves Ledo and the Liberals tried to minimize the close relationship between Bonif√°cio and Pedro, offering to the prince the title of Perpetual Defender of Brazil.Lustosa, p. 143Armitage. p. 61 For the Liberals, the creation of a Constituent Assemblyto prepare a Brazilian constitution was necessary, while the Bonifacians preferred that Pedro create the constitution himself, to avoid the possibility of anarchy similar to the first years of the French Revolution. The prince acquiesced to the Liberals‚Äô desires, and signed a decree on 3 June 1822 calling for the election of deputies that would gather in a Constituent and Legislative General Assembly in Brazil.Lustosa, p. 145 From united kingdom to independent empire Prince Pedro is surrounded by a cheering crowd in S√£o Paulo after giving the news of the Brazilian independence on 7 September 1822. Pedro departed to S√£o Paulo Province to secure the province's loyalty to the Brazilian cause. He reached its capital on 25 August and remained there until 5 September. While on his way back to Rio de Janeiro on 7 September he received at Ipiranga mail from Jos√© Bonif√°cio and his wife, Leopoldina. The letter told him that the Cortes had annulled all acts of the Bonif√°cio cabinet, removed Pedro's remaining powers, and ordered him to return to Portugal. It was clear that independence was the only option left, which his wife supported. Pedro turned to his companions, that included his Guard of Honor, and said: \\"Friends, the Portuguese Cortes want to enslave and pursue us. From today on our relations are broken. No ties can unite us anymore\\". He removed his blue-white armband that symbolized Portugal: \\"Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to the independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil from Portugal!\\" He unsheathed his sword affirming that \\"For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom,\\" and later cried out: \\"Brazilians, Independence or death!\\". This event is known as the \\"Cry of Ipiranga\\", the declaration of Brazil's independence,Lustosa, pp. 150‚Äì53 Returning to the city of S√£o Paulo on the night of 7 September 1822, Pedro and his companions announced the news of Brazilian independence from Portugal. The Prince was received with great popular celebration and was called not only \\"King of Brazil\\", but also \\"Emperor of Brazil\\".Vianna, p. 408Lima (1997), p. 398 Pedro returned to Rio de Janeiro on 14 September and in the following days the Liberals had distributed pamphlets (written by Joaquim Gon√ßalves Ledo) that suggested that the Prince should be named Constitutional Emperor. On 17 September the President of the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro, Josƒó Clemente Pereira, sent to the other Chambers of the country the news that the Acclamation would occur on the anniversary birthday? of Pedro on 12 October.Lustosa, p. 153 Coronation of Emperor Pedro I on December 1, 1822. The official separation would only occur on 22 September 1822 in a letter written by Pedro to Jo√£o VI. In it, Pedro still calls himself Prince Regent and his father is considered the King of the independent Brazil.Lima (1997), p. 379Vianna, p. 413 On 12 October 1822, in the Field of Santana (later known as Field of the Acclamation) Prince Pedro was acclaimed Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. It was at the same time the beginning of Pedro's reign and also of the Empire of Brazil.Vianna, pp. 417‚Äì18 However, the Emperor made it clear that although he accepted the emperorship, if Jo√£o VI returned to Brazil he would step down from the throne in favor of his father.Lima (1997), p. 404 The reason for the imperial title was that the title of king would symbolically mean a continuation of the Portuguese dynastic tradition and perhaps of the feared absolutism, while the title of emperor derived from popular acclamation as in Ancient Rome or at least reigning through popular sanction as in the case of Napoleon.Lima (1997), p.339Barman (1999), p. 4; \\"Some weeks later he was acclaimed emperor as Pedro I of Brazil. In the terminology of the period, the word 'empire' signifying a monarchy of unusually large size and resources (as in the case of Russia), and this designation avoided D. Pedro's usurping the title of 'king' from his father, Jo√£o VI.\\" On 1 December 1822, Pedro I was crowned and consecrated.Vianna, p. 418 War of Independence The Brazilian Army entering Salvador after the surrender of the Portuguese forces in 1823. But in spite of these fine words, the new flag and the Acclamation of Pedro as Constitutional Emperor, the authority of the new regime only extended to Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo and the adjacent provinces. The rest of Brazil remained firmly under the control of Portuguese juntas and garrisons. It would take a war to put the whole of Brazil under Pedro's control. The fighting began with skirmishes between rival militias in 1822 and lasted until January 1824, when the last Portuguese garrisons and naval units surrendered or left the country. Meanwhile, the Imperial government had to create a regular Army and Navy. Forced enlistment was widespread, extending to foreign immigrants, and Brazil made use of slaves in militias, as well as freeing slaves to enlist them in army and navy. The campaigns on land and sea covered the vast territories of Bahia, Montevideo and Cisplatina, Gr√£o-Par√°. Maranh√£o, Pernambuco, Cear√° and Piau√≠. By 1822, Brazilian forces were firmly in control of Rio de Janeiro and the central area of Brazil. Loyal militias began insurrections in the aforementioned territories, but strong, and regularly reinforced Portuguese garrisons in the port cities of Salvador, Montevideo, S√£o Lu√≠s and Bel√©m continued to dominate the adjacent areas and to pose the threat of a reconquest that the irregular Brazilian militias and guerrilla forces, which were loosely besieging them by land supported by newly created units of the Brazilian army, would be unable to prevent. For the Brazilians, the answer to this stalemate was to seize control of the sea. Eleven former Portuguese warships, great and small, had fallen into Brazilian hands in Rio de Janeiro and these formed the basis of a new navy. The problem was manpower: the crews of these ships were largely Portuguese who were openly mutinous, and although many Portuguese naval officers had declared allegiance to Brazil their loyalty could not be relied on. The Brazilian Government solved the problem by recruiting 50 officers and 500 seamen in secret in London and Liverpool, many of them veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, and appointed Thomas Cochrane as commander-in-chief.Brian Vale 'Independence or Death: British Sailors and Brazilian Independence' I B Tauris, 1995 On 1 April 1823, a Brazilian squadron of 6 ships sailed for Bahia. After an initial disappointing engagement with a superior Portuguese fleet, Cochrane blockaded Salvador. Deprived now of supplies and reinforcements by sea and besieged by the Brazilian army on land, on 2 July the Portuguese forces abandoned Bahia in a convoy of 90 ships. Leaving the frigate ‚ÄòNiteroi‚Äô under Captain John Taylor to harry them to the coasts of Europe, Cochrane then sailed north to S√£o Lu√≠s (Maranh√£o). There he tricked the Portuguese garrison into evacuating Maranh√£o by pretending that a huge Brazilian fleet and army were over the horizon. He then sent Captain John Pascoe Grenfell to play the same trick on the Portuguese in Bel√©m do Par√° at the mouth of the Amazon.Brian Vale 'The Audacious Admiral Cochrane; The True Life of a Naval Legend', Conway, 2004 By November 1823, the whole of the north of Brazil was under Brazilian control, and the following month, the demoralized Portuguese also evacuated Montevideo and the Cisplatine Province. By 1824, Brazil was free of all enemy troops and was ‚Äòde facto‚Äô independent.Vale There are still today no reliable statistics Laurentino Gomes 1822 Nova Fronteira, Brasil 2010 Chapter 10, p. 163 related to the numbers of, for example, the total of the war casualties. However based upon historical registration and contemporary reports of some battles of this war as well as upon the admitted numbers in similar fights that happened in these times around the globe, and considering how long the Brazilian independence war lasted (22 months), estimates of all killed in action on both sides are placed from around 5,700 to 6,200.

Overwing exits are smaller in width and height than standard emergency exits on an aircraft, and therefore have a reduced evacuation capacity, and are typically added to aircraft where there is insufficient evacuation capacity at the main doors to obtain a 90 second evacuation, but where the addition of another set of full sized exits is not necessary to accomplish this. Overwing exits are primarily self-help exits meaning that in an emergency evacuation the passengers seated immediately adjacent to the exit will be responsible for assessing external hazards and opening the exit. Hazards The primary hazard involving the use of overwing exits is passengers not waiting to be given the command to evacuate, but rather initiating it themselves. While many passengers (especially frequent fliers) would believe that they are adult enough and educated enough to decide that they need to get out of an aircraft, they are not trained in the specific dangers or the sequence of events required to decide when a full-scale evacuation is needed. Also, passengers will frequently open an exit as soon as evacuation begins which may result in them evacuating into danger. This occurred in the Ryanair engine fire in Stansted Airport in 2002, where passengers evacuated themselves onto a burning wing, despite airport fire services personnel shouting at them to return inside the aircraft and evacuate via a usable exit. Typically, these problems do not occur at floor level, full sized, exit doors because these are operated by flight attendants in an emergency who have extensive emergency training. The preferred escape route for passengers, if they exit the overwing doors after an emergency on this EasyJet Airbus A319-100, is marked by red arrows on a white background. The arrowed route has non-slip paint so is safer to walk over than the rest of the wing. Another hazard in the use of overwing exits is them being improperly opened (usually a result of passengers in these seats not paying attention to the verbal briefing provided pre-departure, or not observing the opening instructions on the safety card and on the exit). The majority of overwing exits involve the passenger physically removing the hatch from its frame and disposing of it outside on the wing without blocking the exit. Research conducted at the Cranfield Institute in the UK showed that many passengers are prone to leaving the exit hatch on the seat next to the exit, thereby hindering other passengers' egress through the exit. Additionally, during aircraft evacuations, it has been found that the majority of overwing window exit designs of Boeing 737 (NG) Next Generation Line along with the Airbus A320, hamper evacuation in comparison with traditional floor level exits due to the inherent \\"step up and through motion\\" required of passengers as they exit the aircraft, unlike the designs of older generation wide body aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L1011 which are all floor level. Operation There are principally two types of overwing exits (excluding the full-sized door on the likes of the Boeing 747, which is not considered an overwing exit - referred to as a Type I exit) in use on modern aircraft. These disposable hatch type exit are called Type IIIA and Type IIIB exits. The first (older) type IIIA is the most common, where the operator must first remove the \\"plug\\" type hatch from its frame before disposing of it on the wing (or inside on the adjacent seats). The second type is the self-disposing Type IIIB hatch, found on more modern aircraft (such as the Boeing 737 Next Generation) which has been designed to both simplify the opening of the exit and to reduce the hazard of the removed hatch blocking the exit. This is accomplished by the passengers simply pulling in and down on a handle recessed into the top of the door and initiating the exit's self- opening mechanism, whereby the door rotates up and out on a hinge at the top of the exit frame. Depending on the height of the aircraft from the ground, an overwing exit may have an automatically inflating slide that is housed within the fuselage near to the exit(s). If the exit is opened the slide will automatically deploy and inflate to provide a means of evacuation from the wing to the ground. Only the slide and emergency lighting on the same side of the aircraft as the open hatch will operate. However, on aircraft where there is a pair of adjacent overwing exits on both sides of the aircraft (i.e. four in total), such as on some Boeing 767-300 variants, opening one of the pair of doors will deploy the slide. Should slide inflation fail, there is a manual inflation handle within the door frame of each exit (the location of which varies but is always indicated on the safety information card) which can be pulled to inflate the slide. Should this also fail exit and sliding down the extend flaps on the rear of the wing is possible. The (two hole) escape rope bracket on this EasyJet Airbus A319-100 has been painted yellow. Use in a ditching The use of overwing exits in a ditching varies from airline to airline but are generally a secondary (not primary) means of escape. On aircraft fitted with overwing exits, there is typically a raised escape rope bracket (about a third of the way from the door) attached to the wing's upper surface and typically painted yellow. This is accompanied by an escape rope found in the frame of the exit after opening the hatch. Once this rope is attached to the escape rope bracket, it will aid passenger evacuation onto the wing to await rescue or to enter the water (depending on the airline's procedures). On aircraft with life rafts to be launched via the overwing exit, the wing will be used to provide a boarding platform onto the life raft. On certain regional aircraft, the overwing exits are the only escape route in the event of a ditching.

The manor was in the gift of the Crown, and was held by numerous nominees of the Crown until 1466 when Lady Margaret Beaufort and her third husband, Sir Henry Stafford obtained the Manor by royal grant. Margaret Beaufort was the mother of Henry VII of England. History Lady Margaret Beaufort at prayer, by Rowland Lockey hung at the university college she founded, St John's College, Cambridge The first mention of a house on the site is in 1272. There is also later recorded use by Lady Margaret Beaufort, her son Henry VII and her grandson Henry VIII. Woking Manor House was converted into a palace by Henry VII in 1503 and was subsequently remodelled by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The site comprises buried and exposed ruins of its old buildings on a cut and grazed water meadow. It was held by numerous nominees of the Crown until 1466 when Lady Margaret Beaufort and her third husband (of four), Sir Henry Stafford obtained the Manor by royal grant. Depicted as the successful, unlikely kingmaker in The Red Queen (Gregory novel) by historian Philippa Gregory, she regularly figures at the Palace. She rose to prominence through astute marriages and through careful co-campaigning instilled the Tudor dynasty. She then founded many educational and religious institutions, such as Christ's College, Cambridge and St John's College, Cambridge. Her son was Henry VII of England. Historians differ on whether her House of Lancaster forces, close alliances and efforts contributed more to her success than mistakes, betrayals and unpopularity of Richard III of England.Arlene Okerlund, Elizabeth: England's Slandered Queen, Stroud: Tempus, 2006, p. 245. Her son's first parliament recognised for her a right to hold property independently from her husband, as if she were unmarried, exempting her from coverture.Jones & Underwood, 187. Towards the end of her son's reign she was given a special commission to administer justice in the north of England.Barbara J. Harris, \\"Women and Politics in Early Tudor England\\", The Historical Journal, 33:2, 1990, p. 259. The ruins of Woking Palace The palace was moated and can be separated into four parts: north east quadrant; the medieval barrel vault and the King's Hall, built by Henry VII in 1508, in the south east; the King's Garden on the south west; and the Copse to the north west, once the orchard. Woking Borough Council, as custodians, have built a protective roof over the barrel vault, installed a lockable door and carried out protective repairs to the remaining Tudor wall. The King's Garden was originally a formal kitchen garden but is now a rough meadow. The Copse contains two large linear fish ponds and a smaller round pond. The moat is on three sides whilst the River Wey enclosed the site on the fourth side. Henry VIII often visited Woking Palace and throughout his reign it underwent regular maintenance as well as some alterations. Additions approved commissioned by him included a new wharf by the river Wey and two new bowling alleys. Maintenance works included the replacement of bridge planks, alterations to room partitions, plastering and painting, replacement of glass in windows, retiling of roofs and fireplaces, and, the installation of new windows. Edward Zouch King James VI and I granted the estate to Knight Marshal Sir Edward Zouch in 1620. He may well have allowed its remains to be plundered to build a new mansion nearly a mile away, Hoe Bridge Place. Zouch was one of the proprietors of the Plymouth Colony in America and the North Virginia Company. He was first keeper of Woking Park, including the Palace, and in 1620 acquired it from a cash-strapped crown for a rent of ¬£100 a year and the duty of serving the first dish to the king on a feast on St James's Day. When the King was at Oatlands Palace he often came for revels with Zouch playing the fool, singing bawdy songs and telling bawdy tales. He stayed with Zouch at the start of September 1624 and hunted towards Busbridge. He wrote to the Duke of Buckingham that he would stay longer, \\"so earnest I am to kill more of Zouch's great stags.\\"John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 4 (London, 1828), pp. 1003-4. In 1631, not long before Zouch died, his tenants made a long list of grievances and exploitations. In his will he contributed to the maintenance of Old Woking Church, and requested that he was to be buried at night. By the reign of Charles II (1660-1685), the palace appears to have been abandoned and virtually ruined.History of the King's Works, volume 4 : 1485-1660 (Part 2) H M Colvin and others, (London, 1982), pp. 344-348. Archaeology 1400-1550 gold and amethyst pin found at the site, published under PAS government records The Portable Antiquities Scheme records cover many finds, including those subject to the Treasure Act 1996, creating the criminal offence of not declaring finds of precious metals, prehistoric base metal, and finds in association with them. The public record for the site as at comprises: #a 1400 to 1550 gold brooch/pin set with a fleur de lys made from amethyst (an inlay). #a \\"close parallel\\" to a c.1750-1900 copper alloy object, perhaps originally cylindrical and in the form of a lid, with a lead or solder filling. The parallelled object bears the image of a horse prancing to the left. Preservation, visitor facilities and future work Woking Palace has been critiqued among royal sites of the pre-16th century as an \\"excellent survival\\", highly diverse, with large archaeological potential spanning the island and the waterlogged moats. A high \\"amenity value\\" in legal planning terms (see listed building) attaches to the site equating to its relatively important national historic, architectural and archaeological values. The site is designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument (under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as amended by the in 1983). It is owned by Woking Borough Council.

All public education in the state is governed by the Missouri State Board of Education, which is made up of eight citizens appointed by the Governor of Missouri and confirmed by the Missouri Senate. HistoryElementary and secondary education Administration of primary and secondary public schools in the state is conducted by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Education is compulsory from ages seven to seventeen in Missouri, commonly but not exclusively divided into three tiers: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. The public schools system includes kindergarten to 12th grade. District territories are often complex in structure. In some cases, elementary, middle and junior high schools of a single district feed into high schools in another district. High school athletics and competitions are governed by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHAA). Missouri education also includes a virtual school program called Missouri Virtual Instruction Program (MoVIP). The Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) is an annual set of mandatory standardized tests taken by students in grades 3 through 8. Students also complete exams at the end of completing certain courses, with certain exams required for graduation, including Algebra I (required), Algebra II, American History, Biology (required), English I, English II (required), Geometry, and Government (required). There also is an alternate MAP test designed for students with cognitive disabilities who meet grade level and eligibility criteria, and the state uses the a test designed by the WIDA Consortium to evaluate English language skills. Homeschooling Homeschooling in Missouri is not regulated by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The state does not provide any monetary assistance or curriculum or materials to home schoolers. Parents who decide to home-school must provide 1,000 hours of instruction during the school year pursuant to Section 167.031 of the Missouri revised statutes. Parents must also keep a daily log and sample of academic work. Homeschool students frequently attend their local colleges and universities. According to Missouri State University's Enrollment department, homeschool students had higher than average ACT scores and better end-of-semester GPA than their peers.  Charter schools  Charter schools are permitted in metropolitan and urban areas of the state. The state board of education considers them public schools and there are no tuition charges. Colleges and universities Jesse Hall and the Francis Quad on the University of Missouri campus. Public colleges and universities in Missouri are administered by the Missouri Department of Higher Education. The state system of higher education includes 13 four-year universities and 20 two-year colleges, which includes the University of Missouri System, the state's public university system. The flagship institution and largest university in the state is the University of Missouri in Columbia. The others in the system are University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis, University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City and Missouri University of Science and Technology. The state also maintains another set of public universities that are not part of the University of Missouri system, which include Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, Missouri State University in Springfield, Truman State University in Kirksville, Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville and the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg. The state also funds a $2000, renewable merit-based scholarship known as Bright Flight, which is given to Missouri students attending an in-state university who earned a composite score on the ACT or SAT in the top 3 percent in Missouri, or a score among the top 5% of test takers nationally. Private universities in Missouri include Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis, Maryville University and Rockhurst University in Kansas City. There are numerous junior colleges, trade schools, theological seminaries, and church universities.

In imperial times, academies were designed with a strong emphasis on the Imperial examination system used to prepare scholar-officials for government work. By the time of the Qing dynasty (16441911), the Chinese government in 1662 and 1664 closed down schools as a strategy to counter Ming dynasty (13681644) loyalists.

History and original recording The song was co-written by Penn, a professional songwriter and producer, and Moman, a former session guitarist at Phil Spector's Gold Star Studio, and also the owner of American Sound Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. The song itself was ultimately recorded across town at Royal Studios, home of HI Records. In the summer of 1966, while a DJ convention was being held in Memphis, Penn and Moman were cheating while playing cards with Florida DJ Don Schroeder,Guralnick, Peter (2002). and decided to write the song while on a break. Penn said of the song ‚ÄúWe were always wanting to come up with the best cheatin‚Äô song. Ever.‚ÄùGordon, Robert (2001). The duo went to the hotel room of Quinton Claunch, another Muscle Shoals alumnus, and founder of Hi Records, to write. Claunch told them, \\"Boys, you can use my room on one condition, which is that you give me that song for James Carr. They said I had a deal, and they kept their word.‚Äù The song, lyrics and all, was written in about thirty minutes.Hoskyns, Barney (1998). Soul artist James Carr, as promised, first recorded the song in late 1966, and it became his trademark song, reaching number 10 on Billboard Magazine's Black Singles Chart, and crossing over to number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100. Six months later fellow soul singer Percy Sledge included his version of the song on his 1967 album The Percy Sledge Way, but it did not chart as high. Influences Van Morrison's song \\"Bright Side of the Road\\" includes the lyrics \\"From the dark end of the street, to the bright side of the road,\\" which some people believe was influenced by Penn and Moman's song.  Cover versions  In the years since Carr's original version many artists have recorded versions of the song.

The surviving fragments of the wall, originally extended about 80 meters, form an important source of Epicurean philosophy. The inscription, written in Greek, sets out Epicurus' teachings on physics, epistemology, and ethics. It was originally about 25,000 words long and filled 260 square meters of wall space. Less than a third of it has been recovered. Life Nothing is known about the life of Diogenes apart from the limited information he reveals to us. The inscription itself, which had been dated to the late 2nd century, has now been assigned on epigraphic grounds to the Hadrianic period, 117‚Äì138AD. Diogenes was wealthy enough to acquire a large tract of land in the city of Oenoanda to construct (or possibly buy) a piazza to display his inscription. As a man who had found peace by practicing the doctrines of Epicurus, he tells us that in his old age he was motivated \\"to help also those who come after us\\" and \\"to place therefore the remedies of salvation by means of this porch.\\" The inscription Diogenes constructed a rectangular piazza surrounded by a portico, and furnished with statues. On one of the smaller sides he placed a portal, with perhaps his mausoleum on the opposite side. On the two larger sides he inscribed a lengthy account of Epicurean doctrines. The inscription was 2.37 meters high, and extended about 80 meters. It was originally about 25 000 words long and filled about 260 square metres of wall space. It was discovered in 1884, and the first 64 fragments were published in 1892. Since then, more fragments have been discovered, notably in a series of excavations led by Martin Ferguson Smith. Perhaps a quarter of the inscription has been recovered. New parts are being discovered in the excavations of the Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut; among the parts discovered in 2008 was a statement on Plato's theory of cosmogony.Was Diogenes √ºber Platon dachte The inscription contains three treatises written by Diogenes as well as various letters and maxims: *A Treatise on Ethics, which describes how pleasure is the end of life; how virtue is a means to achieve it; and explains how to achieve the happy life. *A Treatise on Physics, which has many parallels with Lucretius, and includes discussions on dreams, the gods, and contains an account of the origin of humans and the invention of clothing, speech and writing. *A Treatise on Old Age, which appears to have defended old age against the jibes of the young, although little of this treatise survives. *Letters from Diogenes to his friends, which includes a letter addressed to a certain Antipater concerning the Epicurean doctrine of innumerable worlds. *Epicurean maxims, a collection of the sayings of Epicurus and other eminent Epicureans, which was appended to the end of the treatise on ethics. *Letters of Epicurus, which includes a letter to Epicurus' mother on the subject of dreams. J√ºrgen Hammerstaedt, philologist from the University of Cologne, and Epigrapher Martin Ferguson Smith, have translated some of the fragments discovered in Oenoanda. \\"He was a remarkable man and a cosmopolitan man,\\" says Hammerstaedt, commenting upon a quote from Smith‚Äôs translation of a passage in which Diogenes declares that he set up the inscription: \\"Not least for those who are called foreigners, for they are not foreigners. For, while the various segments of the Earth give different people a different country, the whole compass of this world gives all people a single country, the entire Earth, and a single home, the world.\\" [Archaeology Magazine, August 2015 \\"In Search of A Philosophers Stone\\"] NotesReferences  Further reading * *Clay, Diskin.

Upon his father's death in 1932, he became the head of the Royal House of Saxony. He was Captain √† la suite in the Royal Bulgarian Infantry, and Grand Master of the Order of the Rue Crown, and also a Knight in the Order of the Black Eagle and Knight Grand Cross in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. As head of the House of Wettin after 1932, he styled himself as Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen. Life He was born in Dresden, as the second son of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony and his wife Archduchess Luise, Princess of Tuscany. Friedrich Christian (right) and his brother George on a photograph by August Kotzsch in 1900 Friedrich Christian was made a lieutenant in the 1st Royal Saxon Leib- Grenadier Regiment No. 100 at the age of 10, in accordance a family tradition of the House of Wettin. In 1913, he studied at the Military Academy in Dresden. During World War I, he served General Staff on the Western Front. He received several medals for bravery. He was very gifted linguistically and was sent on diplomatic missions to King Alfonso XIII of Spain, to Sultan Mehmed V of Turkey and to Emperor Charles I of Austria. In 1918, Friedrich Christian was one of several candidates to the prospective Kingdom of Lithuania.Senn (1975), p. 36. On 13 November of that year, his father abdicated following the German Empire's defeat in the World War I. Friedrich Christian led the Saxon army home from Belgium and France to Germany, where they demobilized in Fulda. After the end of World War I, he turned to the study of law at the universities of Cologne, Freiburg, Wroc≈Çaw and W√ºrzburg. The subject of his PhD thesis was Nicholas of Cusa, who contributed significantly to the development of canon law in the late Middle Ages. While studying in Breslau, he was a member of the Catholic student union . However, he resigned his membership in 1928 or 1929, because of substantive disagreement. On 9 February 1920, he joined the KDSt.V. Thuringia W√ºrzburg. Here, he met Elisabeth Helene (1903-1976), a daughter of Albert, 8th Prince of Thurn and Taxis and his wife Archduchess Margarethe Klementine of Austria. Elisabeth Helene was an honorary chairwoman of the Thuringian Lady Student Federation. He married her on 16 June 1923 in Regensburg. After completing his PhD, he became a private teacher of the history of art. Around this time, his father asked him to take up the management of the family holdings in Saxony and Silesia. In 1923, his older brother Crown Prince Georg renounced his succession rights and joined the Jesuit Order. Friedrich Christian thus became heir apparent, and when his father died on 12 February 1932, he succeeded as Head of the Royal House of Saxony In 1933, remembering the prolonged link between the Electorate of Saxony and their country, the Polish Government wanted to propose him to become the new King of Poland, but the rise of Adolf Hitler and the upcoming of World War II prevented this from happening.Le Petit Gotha At time, Friedrich Christian and his family lived in Bamberg, where he led the Knights of St. Mary.

Later that year, the family moved via Hof and Regensburg to Bregenz, where the two youngest children had been living since 1940. Their close connections to the French, they were able, for instance, to arrange permission for Richard Strauss to move to Switzerland. In 1955, their relatives in the Thurn und Taxis family helped them find a new home in the Harlaching borough of Munich. Here Friedrich Christian, together with his sons Albert and Maria Emanuel, the chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the Association of People from Dresden, and te Munich chapter of the association of founded the (\\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\\").

The use of the term \\"eventually\\" can be often rephrased as \\"for sufficiently large numbers\\", and can be also extended to the class of properties that apply to elements of any ordered set (such as sequences and subsets of \\\\mathbb{R}). Notation The general form where the phrase eventually (or sufficiently large) is found appears as follows: :P is eventually true for x P is true for sufficiently large x) which is actually a shorthand for: :\\\\exists~ a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} such that P is true \\\\forall~ x\\\\ge a or somewhat more formally: :\\\\exists~ a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:\\\\forall~ x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:x\\\\ge a \\\\Rightarrow P(x) This does not necessarily mean that any particular value for a is known, but only that such an a exists. The phrase \\"sufficiently large\\" should not be confused with the phrases \\"arbitrarily large\\" or \\"infinitely large\\". For more, see Arbitrarily large#Arbitrarily large vs. sufficiently large vs. infinitely large. Motivation and definition For an infinite sequence, one is often more interested in the long-term behaviors of the sequence than the behaviors it exhibits early on. In which case, one way to formally capture this concept is to say that the sequence possesses a certain property eventually, or equivalently, that the property is satisfied by one of its subsequences. For example, the definition of a sequence of real numbers (a_n) converging to some limit a is: :For each positive number \\\\varepsilon , there exists a positive number N such that for all n>N , \\\\left\\\\vert a_n-a \\\\right\\\\vert<\\\\varepsilon . When the term \\"eventually\\" is used as a shorthand for \\"there exists a positive number N such that for all n>N \\", the convergence definition can be restated more simply as: :For each positive number \\\\varepsilon>0, eventually \\\\left\\\\vert a_n-a \\\\right\\\\vert<\\\\varepsilon . Here, notice that the set of integers that do not satisfy this property is a finite set; that is, the set is empty or has a maximum element. As a result, the use of \\"eventually\\" in this case is synonymous with the expression \\"for all but a finite number of terms\\" ‚Äì a special case of the expression \\"for almost all terms\\" (although \\"almost all\\" can also be used to allow for infinitely many exceptions as well). At the basic level, a sequence can be thought of as a function with natural numbers as its domain, and the notion of \\"eventually\\" applies to functions on more general sets as well‚Äîin particular to those that have an ordering with no greatest element. More specifically, if S is such a set and there is an element s in S such that the function f is defined for all elements greater than s, then f is said to have some property eventually if there is an element x_0 such that whenever x>x_0, f(x) has the said property. This notion is used, for example, in the study of Hardy fields, which are fields made up of real functions, each of which have certain properties eventually.  Examples  * \\"All primes above 2 are odd\\" can be written as \\"Eventually, all primes are odd.‚Äù * Eventually, all primes are congruent to ¬±1 mod 6. * The square of a prime is eventually congruent to 1 mod 24 (given that the prime is above 3). * The factorial of an integer eventually ends in 0 (given that the integer is above 4).  Implications  When a sequence or a function has a property eventually, it can have useful implications in the context of proving something with relation to that sequence. For example, in the context of the asymptotic behavior of certain functions, it can be useful to know if it eventually behaves differently than would or could be observed computationally, since otherwise this could not be noticed. The term \\"eventually\\" can be also incorporated into many mathematical definitions to make them more concise. These include the definitions of some types of limits (an arbitrary bound eventually applies), and the Big O notation for describing asymptotic behavior. Other uses in mathematics *A 3-manifold is called sufficiently large if it contains a properly embedded 2-sided incompressible surface. This property is the main requirement for a 3-manifold to be called a Haken manifold.

The series was Simonson's first comics and it led to his getting work in the comic book industry. The comics have been released by various publishers including Marvel Comics, Malibu Comics, Dark Horse Comics and IDW Publishing. Publication history The series began after Simonson joined the Washington Science Fiction Association (WSFA) after graduating college in the early 1970s with a Geology degree and did some work on the WSFA Journal. As part of their bid to host the 1974 World Science Fiction Convention (WSFC), he created what would become Star Slammers, which the group would personally print and distribute at various conventions, with each six-page episode appearing every three to four months. The final chapter appeared in time for the 1972 WSFC that saw WSFA win the vote. He rated the early part of the work as \\"pretty good fan art\\" which, by the end, had become \\"marginally professional\\", so bound the second half of the story into one volume and used it as his portfolio. Carmine Infantino, who was the editor-in-chief as DC Comics saw this portfolio and got him bits of work at DC, six months later editor Archie Goodwin gave him his breakthrough‚Äîdrawing \\"Manhunter\\", a backup feature in DC's Detective Comics written by Goodwin. The first Star Slammers title was published by Marvel Comics as Marvel Graphic Novel No. 6 in 1983, and later in 1994 a new five-issue limited series by Malibu Comics' Bravura imprint, though only four issues out of five were published. Dark Horse Comics published the final issue as a one-shot special in 1996. Dark Horse also published an 8-page Star Slammers story titled \\"Fever Dream\\" in Dark Horse Presents #114 (1996) that is a prelude to the 1994 Malibu series. In 2014 IDW Publishing republished the Marvel and Malibu material in an eight-issue reprint limited series, with the initial 60-page graphic novel broken down into the first three issues for which he created new covers and introductory pages. Simonson has said that he has plotted out another eight-part Star Slammers story that he would like to get around to when he is less busy.

It was a victory for Henry IV. Background At the death of Henry III of France, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre became by birthright the successor to the French throne (as Henry IV). Although he quickly declared his intention to \\"maintain and preserve the Catholic, apostolic and roman religion\\" of the country (), the major French cities sided with the Catholic League and its leader, the Duke of Mayenne (younger brother to the deceased Henry I, Duke of Guise). At that time, the royal army was in a shambles and Henry IV could only count on barely 20,000 men to conquer a rebellious country. In order to accomplish this task, he divided his troops into three commands: Henri I d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Longueville (1568-1595) for Picardy, Jean VI d'Aumont for Champagne, and Henry IV for Normandy (where he awaited reinforcements from Elizabeth I of England). On 6 August 1589, Henry set up camp with 8,000 men at the port of Dieppe. The Duke of Mayenne sought to take back this key strategic port from Henry's forces and to drive him from Normandy. He drew together 35,000 troops, plus Cambr√©sis militias, Lorraine troops led by the Marquis de Pont-√†-Mousson and a contingent of Spanish troops to attack the city.Kinard pg 85 Knowing that an attack against an army of this size would be pointless, and that staying in the city of Dieppe would be suicidal, Henry (after consulting with the Duke of Longueville and the Duke d'Aumont) decided to go to the city of Arques (today called \\"Arques-la-Bataille\\") and to construct important military defenses (raising of areas, rebuilding fortifications). The battle The ruins of the ch√¢teau of Arques, today. Between 15 and 29 September 1589, the troops of the Catholic League launched several attacks on Arques and the surrounding areas, but the Duke of Mayenne's forces were countered by royal artillery. The attacks were extremely deadly for both sides, and soon Henry IV's side found itself undermanned. Henry's rescue came from the sea on 23 September: 4,000 English soldiers under Roger Williams sent by Queen Elizabeth had left England in several waves over three days.Terry Breverton, \\"Williams, Roger\\" in Wales: A Historical Companion, Amberley, 2012. Seeing these reinforcements, the Duke of Mayenne decided to retreat, leaving Henry IV victorious. After the battle of Arques, Henri IV snatched a short rest in a neighbouring chateau, and before riding away he scratched with his diamond the following aspiration on one of the windows: \\" Dieu gard de mal ma mie.

It seeks to redefine the law relating to the provision of special education to children with additional needs by establishing a framework for the policies of inclusion and generally practicing the \\"presumption of mainstreaming\\" in Scottish education. The Act is an attempt to broaden the narrow definition of Special Educational Needs (SEN) which has typically been used to define children with special needs. Special Educational Needs (SEN) Under the SEN model, certain children were classified as having special needs, and a formal \\"Record of Needs\\" (RoN) was opened and maintained. The opening of an RoN placed a legal obligation on the local authority to meet the needs of the child or young person as defined in the record. Additional support, staffing, resources and places at special schools were largely dependent on the needs and targets set out in the student's RoN.Achievement of Deaf Pupils on Scotland: Record of Needs Principles The new Act defines a system of Additional Support Needs (ASN). The Act states that, at some point in their education, all children may require some form of additional support. The Act says: \\"A child may require additional support for a variety of reasons. These may include those who are being bullied, are particularly gifted, have experienced a bereavement, or are not attending school regularly, as well as those who have behavioural or learning difficulties, mental health problems, or specific disabilities such as deafness or blindness.\\" Implementation The Act places a duty on education authorities to establish procedures for identifying and meeting the additional support needs of children and young people. The identified needs must be kept under review and it will be the responsibility of all agencies to help education authorities meet their duties. The act defines such agencies as \\"including the local authority‚Äôs social work services, any health board, any other local authority or other agency specified by Scottish Ministers, such as Careers Scotland or further education colleges.\\" The new structure is intended to make accessing support easier for parents and carers. Where parents believe that their child has additional support needs they are able to request assessments which they believe are necessary; education authorities also have this ability. In situations where there is disagreement, education authorities will be under a duty to provide mediation services and they will be required to have arrangements in place for resolving disputes. The Act is intended to provide support for children with long or short term barriers to learning, including children with severe and complex needs. Where more than one support service is involved in the provision of support for a child, a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP) will be drawn up by the relevant agencies, (e.g., school and grief counsellor).Text of the Act Sources *Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 on Education Scotland *Text of the Act ReferencesExternal links * a brief guide to the 2004 Act for schools, parents and young people.

Playing career=Club Cushe played his club hurling with his local Naomh √âanna club in Gorey. He had some success with the club at underage level and in 1990 he captained the side to a Wexford intermediate hurling championship title. Inter-county In the mid 1980s Cushe joined the Wexford minor hurling team. He won a Leinster title with his native-county in 1985, however, Wexford later lost the All-Ireland final to Cork. Cushe later graduated onto Wexford's under-21 team where he won back-to-back Leinster titles in 1986 and 1987. Once again he was denied an All-Ireland medal, this time by Galway. Cushe made his senior debut in the first round of the National Hurling League in 1990. Six years later in 1996 Cushe was the Wexford full-back when he won his first senior Leinster title. He subsequently claimed his first, and only, All- Ireland medal following a win over Limerick in an unexciting final. Cushe captured a second Leinster title in 1997, however, Wexford were later defeated by Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. The following years proved difficult as Wexford and Cushe faced a resurgent Offaly in the Leinster championship. He retired from inter-county hurling in 1999. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Cushe maintained a keen interest in the game. Shortly after his retirement in 1999 he became a selector with the Wexford team. During his tenure on the management team Wexford had little success and he stepped down in 2002.

The military history of New Zealand during World War I began in August 1914. When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the New Zealand government followed without hesitation, despite its geographic isolation and small population. It was believed at the time that any declaration of war by the United Kingdom automatically included New Zealand; and the Governor (the Earl of Liverpool) announced that New Zealand was at war with Germany from the steps of Parliament on 5 August. The total number of New Zealand troops and nurses to serve overseas in 1914‚Äì18, excluding those in British and other Dominion forces, was 100,444, from a population of just over a million. Forty- two percent of men of military age served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, fighting in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. 16,697 New Zealanders were killed and 41,317 were wounded during the war ‚Äì a 58 percent casualty rate. Approximately a further thousand men died within five years of the war's end, as a result of injuries sustained, and 507 died while training in New Zealand between 1914 and 1918. The First World War saw MƒÅori soldiers serve for the first time in a major conflict with the New Zealand Army (although a number had fought in the Second Boer War when New Zealand recruiters chose to ignore British military policy of the time of disallowing 'native' soldiers). A contingent took part in the Gallipoli campaign, and later served with distinction on the Western Front as part of the New Zealand (MƒÅori) Pioneer Battalion. 2688 MƒÅori and 346 Pacific islanders, including 150 Niueans, served with New Zealand forces in total. Outbreak of the war Upon the outbreak of the war, the New Zealand Government authorised the raising of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. Mobilisation for the NZEF had already begun, with preparations discreetly beginning a few days prior to the declaration of war. Mobilisation quickly followed and by late September, the NZEF consisted of two brigades ‚Äì the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. Samoa The Union Flag being raised at the courthouse at Apia on 30 August 1914 The day after the declaration of war, the British Government requested New Zealand seize the wireless station on the island of Upolu, part of Imperial Germany's protectorate of German Samoa, deeming it \\"a great and urgent Imperial service.\\" A mixed force of 1,413 men, known as the Samoan Expeditionary Force (SEF) under the command of Colonel Robert Logan, plus six nursing sisters, sailed from New Zealand on 15 August 1914. After stopping in Fiji to collect some guides and interpreters as well as additional escort ships, the New Zealanders arrived at Apia on 29 August 1914. Germany refused to officially surrender the islands but with only a minimal military presence, there was little prospect for meaningful resistance. The Governor of German Samoa, Dr. Erich Schultz, sent a message from the island's radio station that no resistance would be offered. The New Zealanders proceeded to land at Apia and seized key buildings and facilities without interference. The only opposition encountered was at the radio station, where the equipment was sabotaged by the German operators. Logan officially declared German Samoa to be under the control of New Zealand the following day, 30 August 1914, in a ceremony at the courthouse in Apia. When Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee, commander of Germany's East Asia Squadron, learned of the occupation, he hastened to Samoa with the armoured cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau. Arriving at Apia on 14 September 1914, the approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders prepared to defend themselves. However, von Spee and his ships soon departed for Tahiti, with neither side opening fire. The SEF remained in Samoa until March 1915 at which time it began returning to New Zealand, a process completed by the following month. Middle East=Training in Egypt Map of the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 The Be'er Sheva Anzac Memorial Centre, Israel As early as October 1914 the main body of the NZEF sailed from Wellington. Diverted from their original destination in Europe, the New Zealanders were landed in Egypt along with elements of the AIF. In December 1914, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, under Lieutenant General William Birdwood, was formed to command both the AIF and NZEF components. The headquarters staff for this formation amounted to 70 officers and 550 men. These were mostly provided by the British and it was formally part of the British Army. The AIF was able to field one complete Australian division, and had one each of mounted and infantry brigades. To form the second infantry division of the corps, Birdwood included these with the two brigades of the NZEF. This division was to be known as the New Zealand and Australian Division, with Godley as its commander. While the New Zealand and Australian Division was forming and training in Egypt, elements were committed to the defence of the Suez Canal. On 26 January 1915, the four infantry battalions of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade ‚Äì the Auckland, Canterbury, Wellington and Otago Battalions ‚Äì and a supporting field ambulance were deployed in anticipation of an attack on the canal by Ottoman forces. This force was split between Ismailia and Kubri. On 2 February, after the Ottomans launched a raid on the Suez Canal, elements of the brigade took part in repelling the attack, with the Canterbury Battalion suffering the division's first losses in battle, with two men being wounded, one of whom later died. Gallipoli, Turkey On 25 April 1915, as part of the New Zealand and Australian Division, the New Zealanders landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula, and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign under the command of British General Alexander Godley. The combined British Empire and French operation was mounted in order to eventually capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul). Because of a navigational error, the Anzacs came ashore about a mile north of the intended landing point in their initial landing. Instead of facing the expected beach and gentle slope they found themselves at the bottom of steep cliffs, offering the few Turkish defenders an ideal defensive position. Establishing a foothold, the Anzacs found an advance to be impossible. On 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held ‚Äì the origin of the commemorative public holiday, ANZAC Day, recognised by New Zealand and Australia and held each year on 25 April. Evacuation from Gallipoli Despite the blunder at ANZAC Cove, the New Zealand soldiers fought valiantly throughout the campaign, which was a failed venture overall. The estimated casualties on both sides were 392,000 of whom 131,000 were killed, with New Zealand casualties of 2,721 dead and 4,852 wounded. At least 16,000 (perhaps 17,000) NZEF soldiers served at Gallipoli (the figure of 8556 given by Hamilton in his forward to Waite's demi-official 1919 history was always known to be too low; see link to ebook below). The Allied forces eventually evacuated in December 1915 and early January 1916. The significance of the Gallipoli Campaign was strongly felt in New Zealand (and Australia) where it was the first great conflict experienced by the fledgling nation. Before Gallipoli the citizens of New Zealand were confident of the superiority of the British Empire and were proud and eager to offer their service. The campaign in Gallipoli shook that confidence. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade (less two battalions) had meanwhile reached Egypt in November 1915 and was sent into the Egyptian desert to help defeat a Senussi invasion from Libya. The 1st Battalion fought two brisk but inexpensive actions south-west of Matruh as part of a mixed force (including British, Australians, and Indians), one on Christmas Day, the other on 23 January 1916. Both were successful and broke the back of the invasion. In mid-February the 1st Battalion rejoined the rest of the brigade at Moascar in the Suez Canal area. Palestine Campaign In Egypt, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was reorganised into the New Zealand Mounted Brigade and the New Zealand Division (infantry). Reinforcements from New Zealand replaced the Australian component of the division, which embarked for France in April 1916. The New Zealand Mounted Brigade, 147 officers and 2,897 other ranks, remained in Egypt as part of the Anzac Mounted Division. In April 1916, it was deployed to the Sinai Peninsula where it took part in the ultimately successful Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Turks. New Zealanders fought in most of the battles leading up to the fall of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Ottoman Army, and were praised for their fighting alongside their Australian and British comrades. In 1919, Field Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, said this of the New Zealand soldiers in the Sinai campaign; :::::: \\"Nothing daunted these intrepid fighters: to them nothing was impossible.\\" A total of 17,723 New Zealanders served in this campaign and New Zealand casualties were 640 killed in action and 1,146 wounded. Training in England While in England ‚Äì either freshly arrived from New Zealand or having already served at Gallipoli and awaiting transfer to the Western Front ‚Äì New Zealand troops were stationed at Sling Camp, an annexe of Bulford Camp in Wiltshire. The troops who were still stationed at the camp at the end of the war created the giant chalk kiwi known as the Bulford Kiwi whilst waiting to be repatriated. Western Front Infantry from the 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment, New Zealand Division in the Switch Line near Flers, taken some time in September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette In France, the New Zealand Division settled in on the stalemated Western Front and their first major trial was during the Battle of the Somme. It took part in the Fourth Army's attack on 15 September, under the command of the British XV Corps. By the time they were relieved on 4 October, the New Zealanders had advanced three kilometres and captured eight kilometres of enemy front line. 7,048 had become casualties, of whom 1,560 were killed. In June 1917, the New Zealand Division further distinguished itself in the storming of Messines Ridge and the capture of the village of Messines. On 7 June, after the detonation of nearly 500 tons of explosives in huge mines on both sides of the New Zealand sector, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades scrambled over the top, in and out of shell holes, and up the battered slopes. Carrying the German front line and supports, they were soon into the ruined village. The 1st Brigade passed through, helped on the left by a solitary tank, to the final objective. With prisoners and booty including many guns it was a striking success at no great cost; but the German artillery revived and by the time the division was relieved on 9 and 10 June it had lost 3,700 men, evenly distributed between the three brigades. The New Zealand Division's next major engagement was at Passchendaele in October 1917. The division had been training since the end of August to overcome the numerous concrete pillboxes in this sector. The first objective was the Gravenstafel Spur, attacked before dawn on 4 October, as part of a major advance. The 1st and 4th Brigades forestalled a heavy German counter-attack, and the supporting artillery barrage inflicted frightful slaughter on the waiting Germans. Crossing this scene of carnage, the 1st and 4th Brigades gained their objectives after a hard fight, inflicting exceptionally heavy loss on the enemy and capturing much equipment. For such a resounding success the 1,700 New Zealand casualties, though a sad loss, did not in current terms seem excessive. But heavy rain turned the countryside into a bog and tragedy lay ahead. A British attack on the ninth on Bellevue Spur and part of the main Passchendaele ridge gained a little ground at prohibitive cost. Heavy swathes of barbed wire still girdled the hillside, however, and belated and meagre heavy artillery made no impression on them, nor on the many pillboxes beyond. New Zealand gunners slaved to breaking point to get only a few guns and howitzers forward, but stable platforms and accurate fire were unattainable. The division returned to the attack on 12 October, with the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. There was little to encourage the men as they waited overnight in a morass under steady rain. Shelled in their assembly area, some were shelled again by their own guns when the thin barrage opened at 5.25 a.m., and then they led off into a deluge of small-arms fire, speckled with geyser-like eruptions as shells exploded in the mud. Worst of all was the wire, covered with deadly fire, its few gaps deliberate deathtraps. Some men tried to crawl under it, some threw themselves at it, two got right through and were killed in the act of hurling grenades at the loopholes of the nearest pillbox. The left gained 500 yards of slippery slope, the centre 200 heartbreaking yards, the right nothing until the 80-odd occupants of two blockhouses and a trench used up all their ammunition. Then they were captured, blockhouses and all, by two brave and skillful men, sole survivors of two Otago platoons. For these small gains, the New Zealanders suffered 640 dead and 2,100 wounded. For the first time the division had failed in a major operation. After this failure, the division continued to hold a sector of the line. The steady drain of men while units only held the line was less spectacular, though it made up half the losses of the division. Here, before withdrawing from the front, 400 more men were lost in the 4th Brigade alone. The division now had four brigades, making it one of the largest on the Western Front, and was stationed in the Polygon Wood area. An attack by the 2nd Brigade on 3 December 1917 gained useful ground but failed to capture Polderhoek Chateau. When the division was relieved, on 24 February 1918, three \\"quiet\\" months had cost 3,000 men, more than 1,873 of them killed. Nurses at a New Zealand hospital in France, 1918 As the Germans launched their great Spring Offensive of 1918, the New Zealand Division was rushed to stem a breakthrough in the First Battle of the Somme, which threatened Amiens. The gap was between the British IV and V Corps in the Ancre Valley. After confused fighting, the New Zealanders eventually gained the upper hand and soon were counter-attacking advantageous land, stabilising the British line. Later in the year, they excelled in the open country fighting that was brought about by the Allied counter-offensive. The advance of the New Zealand Division ‚Äì part of the Third Army's IV Corps ‚Äì during the 100 Days Offensive. In their last action of the war, the division captured the ancient fortress (Vauban- designed) town of Le Quesnoy in a daring assault on 4 November 1918. The day proved to be the division's most successful of their whole time on the Western Front as they pushed east and advanced ten kilometres, capturing 2,000 German soldiers and 60 field guns. The town occupied a strategic position in north- eastern France and had been held by the Germans since 1914. Although with no specific orders indicating that the town need to be captured with any haste, the New Zealand soldiers were determined to and just before midday the first New Zealand troops reached the outer walls and scaled them with ladders. Propping the ladders against the precariously narrow inner walls, sections of one New Zealand battalion ascended the walls and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with fleeing German defenders. The few thousand strong German garrison surrendered soon after New Zealand soldiers entered the town itself. The infantry were relieved on the eastern side of the forest at midnight on 5‚Äì6 November and the war ended five days later. The division left the Third Army on 28 November, and marched through Belgium, to entrain at the German frontier for Cologne and take up billets in neighbouring towns as part of the army of occupation. Demobilisation soon started and at M√ºlheim near Cologne the division was finally disbanded on 25 March 1919. The cost of maintaining the division for two and a half years on the Western Front was appalling. Altogether some 13,250 New Zealanders died of wounds or sickness as a direct result of this campaign, including 50 as prisoners of war and more than 700 at home. Another 35,000 were wounded, and 414 prisoners of war were ultimately repatriated. The total casualties therefrom approached 50,000, well over half the number of those who served in France or Belgium. Other theatres New Zealand also contributed to the war at sea, with the New Zealand Naval Forces being a division of the Royal Navy. Immediately after the start of the war, the cruiser HMS Philomel, loaned to New Zealand as a training ship, was augmented with 70 New Zealand reservists and sailed with two Royal Navy cruisers to escort the New Zealand troops sent to occupy German Samoa. Later in 1914 these three ships also escorted the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to Egypt. From January 1915, Philomel patrolled the Gulf of Alexandretta in the Eastern Mediterranean, supporting several landings and sustaining three fatal casualties, one being the first New Zealander killed in action in the war. She also took part in the defence of the Suez Canal, operations in the Gulf of Aden and patrols in the Persian Gulf. Although refitting from time to time at Malta or Bombay kept her seaworthy, age eventually forced her out of the war and in March 1917 she returned to Wellington for a major overhaul. New Zealand was not subject to any significant direct military threat during the war. Although Germany had plans for naval raids on Australia and New Zealand, the threat from her Asiatic Squadron did not eventuate, as that force moved across the Pacific before being destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. In June 1917, a German surface raider, the SMS Wolf entered New Zealand waters. She laid two small minefields in New Zealand waters and sank two merchant ships. One (the Port Kembla) off Farewell Spit, and another (the Wairuna) off the Kermadec Islands. Two fishing trawlers, the Nora Niven and Simplon, were fitted as minesweepers and took up sweeping duties in these areas. Another brief flurry of activity occurred when Felix von Luckner, imprisoned on Motuihe Island after being captured in the Society Islands, escaped and commandeered a small vessel before being recaptured in the Kermadec Islands. New Zealand also contributed a wireless troop to the Mesopotamian Campaign. The Wireless Troop was formed in New Zealand and arrived at Basra in April 1916. In Mesopotamia the New Zealand troop was amalgamated with the 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron, forming \\"C\\" Wireless Troop of the Anzac Squadron. The troop was much affected by disease, but once in operation was attached to the Cavalry Division in the assault on Baghdad. The Wireless Troop was among the first batch of troops to enter the city on 11 March 1917. The Wireless Troop joined further operations in Mesopotamia and was then moved to Persia. In June 1917, the troop was redirected to France, where it was absorbed into the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company. New Zealand had no air force of her own during the First World War but several hundred New Zealanders served with the Royal Flying Corps, the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Royal Air Force. The first New Zealand flying ace of the war was Flight Lieutenant Thomas Culling, who flew with the RNAS. He was killed in June 1917, having shot down five aircraft.  Recruiting and Conscription  When the supply of volunteers for reinforcements for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force slowed, conscription was introduced, with the first ballot held in Wellington on 16 November 1916. Men between 20 and 45 could be conscripted, subject to a medical check and limited rights of objection on conscience, family or business grounds. Conscription was extended to MƒÅori for the \\"Native Contingent\\" in late 1917, with the first \\"MƒÅori ballot\\" for the Waikato district held in May 1918. There was resistance in the Waikato (led by Princess Te Puea) to conscription. By the end of the war 552 MƒÅori had been balloted, but no MƒÅori conscripts had been sent overseas. And 2,227 MƒÅori served in the war; about 4.5% of the MƒÅori population or under half of the total contribution per head of the total New Zealand population.  Hospitals  Walton-on-Thames railway station was about one and a quarter miles from No 2 New Zealand General HospitalNew Zealand Hospitals were set up at Port Said and Suez in 1915, Walton-on-Thames in 1915, and Amiens, Brockenhurst, Codford and Hornchurch in 1916. Hospital ships Maheno and Marama were converted in 1915. Walton closed in 1919.  Repatriation  Shortages of shipping, influenza and strikes were among causes for delays in repatriating troops after the war. The frustration of the delay resulted in riots at Sling Camp in March 1919 and at Ismailia in July. Allied governments paid compensation for looted Egyptian shops. New Zealand's share of the cost was ¬£2,529 (2016 equivalent $250,000).  Cemeteries and Memorials  New Zealand war deaths are buried or commemorated in Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) cemeteries with other allied soldiers. Gallipoli dead are buried in 24 CWGC cemeteries in Turkey, and in CWGC cemeteries in Egypt, Gibraltar, Greece and Malta. There are memorials to the New Zealand missing on Chunuk Bair and at three CWGC cemeteries: Hill 60 Cemetery, Lone Pine Cemetery and Twelve Tree Copse Cemetery. On the Western Front missing New Zealand soldiers are commemorated in cemeteries near where they were lost rather than at the large memorials of Menin Gate and the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme. The New Zealand monuments to the missing are at Messines in Belgium and Armentierses, Longueval (Caterpillar Valley Cemetery), Grevillers, and Marfaux in France. There are four national battlefield memorials at Passchendaele, Messines, the Somme and Le Quesnoy.

Callenberg was born in Molschleben of peasant parents. Beginning in 1715 he studied philology and theology at the University of Halle. Sometime before 1720 Salomon Negri, professor of Syriac and Arabic at Rome, stayed in Halle for six months. Callenberg studied Arabic under him. Besides Arabic, Callenberg also studied Persian and Turkish.Mark A. Noll. Turning Points p. 277. From his youth he cherished the idea of working for the conversion of the Muslims in the Middle East, Russia and Tartary, but later he devoted himself to missionary work among the Jews. He established, in 1728, the Institutum Judaicum, the first German Protestant mission to the Jews, to which he attached a printing-office. In this office he printed the Gospel and other Christian books in the Jud√¶o-German dialect, and distributed them among the Jews, with the assistance of the Jewish physician Dr. Heinrich Christian Immanuel Frommann, who translated the Gospel of Lukas with commentary, which was revised and reprinted by Raphael Biesenthal in the 19th century. Frommann's records named him only as typist, but Callenberg was not proficient in Hebrew at all. His first interest was Islam and by travelling got in touch with Jews. He was a great support to Dr. Frommann. He also sent missionaries to other European countries, and was a patron of converted Jews. His plans for the conversion of Muslims were resumed somewhat later, but in these he utterly failed. The Institutum Judaicum existed until 1791. In 1727 Callenberg was appointed extraordinary professor of theology at the University of Halle, and in 1735 professor of philology. He died, aged 66, at Halle. Among the works Callenberg published are the following: * Prima rudivuenta linguse arabicx, Halle, 1729 * Scriptores de reli√ßione duhammedica, 1734 * Sp√©cimen bibliolhecx arabicx, 1736 * Arabic translations of the New Testament, The Imitation of Christ, Luther's Catechism, etc. * Kurtze Anleitung zur j√ºdischteutschen Sprache ertheilet von Joh.

It contains the main collections of Bristol's public library. Built in 1906 by Charles Holden, its design was influential in the development of Edwardian Free Style architecture. Holden would later go on to build the Edward VII Memorial Wing of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, giving Bristol two of its most highly regarded Edwardian buildings. The Library has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. Construction In 1899 Vincent Stuckey Lean left a bequest of ¬£50,000 to replace Bristol's old public library building on King Street. An architectural competition was organised, and won by the firm of H. Percy Adams with designs by his assistant Charles Holden, at a cost of ¬£30,000. The new library was built on land adjacent to the historic Abbey Gatehouse, and opened in 1906. Exterior architecture Because of the slope of the site, which falls away sharply to the south, the building has two basement levels creating five visible storeys at the rear, while only three storeys are visible at the front. The north front of the building is a blend of Tudor Revival and Modern Movement styles, designed to harmonise with the adjoining Abbey Gatehouse. The rear facades to the south and east are in a plainer style, with vertical features such as towers and flat buttresses being used to frame the great mass of the building. Holden's approach to handling large volumes, of which his design for the Library was one of the most highly regarded examples, made him influential within the Modern Movement. For this he has been compared with his contemporary Charles Rennie Mackintosh. A western extension was built in 1967, in a design sympathetic to the original building. Interior architecture In contrast to the exterior, the interior is largely Neoclassical, with extensive use being made of round-arched vaulting. The entrance hall, which is at the eastern end of the north front, has vaulting faced in turquoise glass mosaic. A variety of different kinds of marble is used for the flooring and other facings in the entrance hall and for the main staircase. alt=Entrance hall vaulting The ground floor next to the entrance hall contains the Lending Library. Above it is the Reference Library Reading Room, whose space includes the first floor and two tiers of galleries. It is tunnel vaulted, with glass above. Next to the Reading Room is the Bristol Room, which contains antique furniture and fittings brought from the old reading room in King Street, including an ornate oak overmantel carved by Grinling Gibbons. The building's size created a need to transmit natural light throughout the interior. Holden made extensive use of skylights, glass screens and glass-block roof and floor panels.

He was president of the Minnesota Newspaper Association in 1949. The association now recognizes individuals who have provided exceptional service to the field of journalism with its Al McIntosh Distinguished Service to Journalism Award. Ken Burns included several World War II-era excerpts from McIntosh's weekly column in his documentary \\"The War,\\" which are voiced by actor Tom Hanks. In an interview on the radio show Fresh Air, Burns claimed that McIntosh could have pursued a more prestigious journalistic career but chose to take the reins of a small-town newspaper. Burns also opined in the same interview that McIntosh would be the most important discovery his team made in the creation of the documentary. McIntosh owned and published the Star-Herald from 1940 until 1968, and first became famous after writing an editorial titled ‚ÄúA Tired American Gets Angry‚Äù in 1964. Life and career McIntosh was the son of the Rev. and Mrs. Donald M. McIntosh. His family lived in Grand Forks, North Dakota, before moving to Sioux City, Iowa, where he graduated from Central High School in 1922. McIntosh then attended Morningside College in Sioux City for three years, before enrolling at the University of Nebraska where he received his degree in 1928. He started his journalism career as editor of Nebraska Agwan, a university humor magazine, and as part-time employee at the Star. After graduation, he established himself at the City Journal as a writer as well as businessman. When the Rock County Star was offered for sale, he bought it, assuming ownership July 1, 1940. Two years later, the editor and publisher of the Rock County Herald, A.O. Moreaux, was killed in an auto accident. The estate offered the Herald to McIntosh, and he bought it, consolidating the two publications and changing the name to the Rock County Star-Herald.

He was martyred, executed by a firing squad by Soviet authorities. In April 1992 Benjamin was glorified (canonized) by the Russian Orthodox Church together with several other martyrs, including Archimandrite Sergius (Shein), Professor Yury Novitsky, and John Kovsharov (a lawyer), who were murdered with him. Background and education Benjamin was born to a priestly family in the pogost (village) of Nimenskii in the Andreevskii volost of the Kargopolsky Uyezd near Arkhangelsk in the Olonets Governorate in the northwest of the Russian empire. He graduated from the Olonets Theological Seminary in 1893 and earned his candidate of theology degree from the St. Petersburg Spiritual Academy in 1897, defending a thesis on Archbishop Arcadius of Olonets' anti- heretical activities. In 1895 he was tonsured a monk and given the name Benjamin; later that year he was ordained a hierodeacon (deacon-monk) and the following year he was ordained a hieromonk (priest-monk). Following his graduation he taught sacred scripture at the Riga Theological Seminary (1897‚Äì1898) following which he was inspector of the Kholm Theological Seminary (1898‚Äì1899) and the St. Petersburg Spiritual Academy (1899‚Äì1902). In 1902 he became rector of the Samara Theologocal Seminary and he was bestowed with the rank of archimandrite. In 1905 he became rector of the St. Petersburg Spiritual Academy. Vicar Bishop On Benjamin was consecrated Bishop of Gdov, a vicar bishop of the diocese of St. Petersburg. Metropolitan Antonii (Vadkovskii) of St. Petersburg and Ladoga officiated at the installment in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in St. Petersburg. Benjamin often served in the churches of the poorest and most remote suburbs of the capital and led the annual Easter and Christmas divine services at Putilovsky and Obukhovsky factories of St. Petersburg, and organized the charitable foundation of the Mother of God for the Care of Abandoned Women. He was known as \\"the indefatigable bishop.\\" Metropolitan of Petrograd After the arrest and deposition of Metropolitan Pitirim (Onkova) on , Benjamin administered the Petrograd diocese as vicarial Bishop of Gdov. On of that year, he was democratically elected by the clergy and the people to the archbishopric of Petrograd and Ladoga, the first bishop popularly elected in the Russian church.

Roslof, Red Priests: Renovationism, Russian Orthodoxy, & Revolution, 1905‚Äì1946 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002). The real conflict, however, came out into the open in 1922 when the Soviet authorities demanded the church hand over church valuables to pay for famine relief. The Russian church agreed to this, but refused to hand over certain valuables of religious or historic significance.Roslof, Red Priests, 42; Benjamin did not resist turning over the Church's valuables, believing it was his duty to help save lives, but insisted this be voluntary and not a plundering of church property by the Bolsheviks. On 6 March Benjamin met with a commission formed to help the starving that agreed to his voluntary dispersal of funds controlled by the parishes. Newspapers of that time praised the Benjamin and his clergy for their charitable spirit. In April, Benjamin reached an agreement with Petrograd party officials to hand over certain valuables and to allow parishioners to substitute their own valuables for other church valuables of historic or religious significance.Roslof, Red Priests, 49. However, party leaders in Moscow did not approve of that decision and declared that the confiscation of Church property would continue. Protesters gathered in Petrograd, shouting and throwing stones at those who were stealing from the churches. Arrest and execution Patriarch Tikhon and Metropolitan Benjamin Metropolitan Benjamin during his trial for \\"Counter Revolutionary Agitation\\" On 24 March twelve priests broke ranks with the other clergy, whom they called counter- revolutionaries and blamed for the famine, and called for unconditional surrender of all Church valuables to the Soviets. This led to outrage which Benjamin tried to calm, asking for a meeting with the authorities leading to an agreement that parishes would be permitted to keep their sacred vessels if they substituted other property of equal value. This pacified the situation until some priests tried to wrest control of the Church from Patriarch Tikhon and the established hierarchy. Benjamin excommunicated his priests involved with the coup which enraged the Soviets who threatened Benjamin with his and others' arrest and execution. Benjamin reacted by commencing meeting with his friends in order to say farewell and giving instructions for the administration of the diocese. In April and May 1922, a number of churchmen were arrested and tried as counter-revolutionaries for opposing the seizure of church valuables. Benjamin was placed under house arrest on 29 May and subsequently imprisoned after he had opposed efforts by Alexander Vvedensky to establish the renovationist All-Russian Church Administration as the new church government after Patriarch Tikhon abdicated on 12 May.Roslof, Red Priests, 54‚Äì55, 62. Benjamin was tried by a revolutionary tribunal with ten other defendants from 10 June to 5 July. As Benjamin entered the courtroom for his trial, people stood up for him and he blessed them. The defendants were found guilty and condemned to death, but the sentences of six of the defendants were later commuted by the Politburo, though not of Benjamin and others seen as the main instigators of counterrevolution.Roslof, Red Priests, 65. The defendants were given a chance to speak, and Benjamin addressed the court saying it grieved him to be called an enemy of the people whom he had always loved and to whom he had dedicated his life.

The area was originally settled circa 1800. Dunbarton grew after a train stop was built on a new rail line. In 1951, it was acquired by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission as part of a site for the Savannah River Plant. The nearest incorporated community is the town of Snelling, to the northeast. History=Early history The settlement of the town began with the construction of the Atlantic Coast Line in 1899 from Denmark, South Carolina, to Robins, South Carolina. Robins was on the railroad from Port Royal to Augusta, Georgia. Robins was in the area taken for the Savannah River Plant. This line of the railroad was later rerouted to the south of Dunbarton. This line is now part of CSX Transportation. The old line east of Dunbarton is a spur that now services the Savannah River Site. The town of Dunbarton was incorporated in 1910. Dunbarton is named after the Dunbar family. It was an agricultural, trading, and sawmill town. By the early 1950s, Dunbarton had a population of about 300, about 35 residences, about 15 commercial buildings, one church, two schools including Dunbarton High School, two cotton gins, and the railroad station. Four Mile High School, an African- American high school, was located just outside the town of Dunbarton. It had dormitories so that some students could board during the week. Exodus On November 28, 1950, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company announced that the Savannah River Plant would be built on about 300 sq. mi. of Aiken County, Barnwell County, and Allendale County in South Carolina. The Savannah River Plant was built for the production of plutonium and tritium for the H-bomb. About 6,000 people and 6,000 graves were to be relocated. This include the incorporated communities of Dunbarton and Ellenton and the unincorporated communities of Hawthorne, Meyers Mill, Robbins, and Leigh. A significant fraction of those removed were African- American farmers and sharecroppers. The government purchased or condemned the property. Many of the residents moved themselves, and in some cases, their homes to Barnwell, Williston, Jackson, Beech Island, Aiken, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia. Some moved out of state. Eventually, nearly all that was left behind was the streets, curbs, driveways, and walkways. Geography Dunbarton's location was approximately 33¬∞12'40\\" N and 81¬∞33' W. It was located at the intersection of South Carolina highways 39 and 64 and the railroad. Highway 64 is now SRS \\"B.\\" Highway 39 is now SRS \\"F\\" north of \\"B\\" and \\"B-6\\" south of \\"B.\\" Legacy An annual reunion of former Dunbarton residents started in 1952 and continues to this day.

Butler‚Äìclass destroyer escort built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Lieutenant Commander Thomas Olin Oberrender Jr., the engineering officer of the light cruiser , who was killed when that ship was torpedoed and sunk during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. Laid down in November 1943, launched in January 1944, and commissioned almost four months later, Oberrender served on convoy escort duty in the Pacific from late 1944, with an interlude protecting escort carriers during the early stages of the invasion of Leyte. She was heavily damaged by the explosion of the ammunition ship at Manus and was repaired there during November. Returned to service in December, Oberrender served on anti-submarine patrol during the Battle of Okinawa, during which she was irreparably damaged by a kamikaze attack in early May 1945. As a result, she was decommissioned and sunk as a target late that year.  Design  The John C. Butler‚Äìclass destroyer escorts were designed to meet a need for large numbers of cheap anti-submarine escort ships for ocean convoys, and as a result carried little anti-surface armament. The class was part of an initial requirement for 720 escorts to be completed by the end of 1944, which was significantly reduced. A United States Navy diagram of a destroyer escort Oberrender was long overall with a beam of and a draft of .

Armament and sensors  Oberrender mounted a main battery of two single turret-mounted /38 caliber guns, one forward and one aft of the superstructure, to protect against surface and aerial threats, directed by the Mark 51 Gunnery Fire-Control System. She also carried four Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) guns in two twin mounts, superfiring over the 5-inch guns, also controlled by the Mark 51 fire-control system, and ten single Oerlikon light AA guns. Equipped with three centerline torpedo tubes, the ship also carried two depth charge racks, eight K-gun depth-charge throwers and one Hedgehog spigot mortar as anti-submarine weapons. She was equipped with a QC series sonar, SL-1 surface search radar, and SA-2 air search radar. Construction and service= Construction, shakedown, and convoy escort duty  Launching of a sister ship at Consolidated Steel, April 1944 Laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Orange, Texas, on 8 November 1943, Oberrender (DE-344) was launched on 18 January 1944, sponsored by the widow of her namesake, Lieutenant Commander Thomas Olin Oberrender Jr., the engineering officer of , who was killed during the sinking of the latter in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. She was commissioned on 11 May 1944 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Samuel Spencer, who commanded the ship for the duration of her service. Following commissioning, the ship began fitting out at the Orange City Docks, followed by gunnery testing in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout the month she conducted further training and completed her fitting out at the Todd Galveston Dry Docks. Oberrender was then degaussed before sailing for Bermuda on 28 May. After arrival, the ship undertook a shakedown cruise off the island, attached to the Atlantic Fleet. Oberrender off Boston, 15 July 1944 For repairs to correct deficiencies found during shakedown, Oberrender was ordered to the Boston Navy Yard. She was ordered to Norfolk Navy Yard for further repairs in mid-July and remained there until 22 July, when she began the journey to the Panama Canal, escorting the oiler and tanker . Oberrender transited the canal on 1 August, after a stopover at Aruba. Assigned to Escort Division (CortDiv) 69 of the Pacific Fleet after exiting the canal, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 August, having escorted Nantahala and Nemasket there. Operating out of Pearl Harbor, Oberrender conducted training operations, including gunnery exercises, until 30 August, when she departed for Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, escorting a convoy along with the destroyer escort ; both returned with another convoy to Pearl Harbor on 18 September. With fellow destroyer escorts and , Oberrender escorted another Eniwetok-bound convoy, arriving at her destination on 30 September.  Leyte and Mount Hood explosion  Oberrender is visible in the top right, near the oil slick created by the Mount Hood explosion. With the other destroyer escorts of CortDiv 69, Oberrender left for Manus in the Admiralty Islands on 1 October, arriving at Seeadler Harbor five days later. Together with the destroyer escorts Walter C. Wann and ', and the destroyers , , and , she left Manus on 12 October, escorting Rear Admiral Thomas Sprague‚Äôs escort carriers to the Philippines for the invasion of Leyte. The destroyers and destroyer escorts screened the escort carriers of Rear Admiral Felix Stump's Task Unit 77.4.2 as they launched airstrikes against Japanese positions in the central Philippines from 17 October. The Lombrum Point ship repair dock, where Oberrender was repaired after the Mount Hood explosion Oberrender missed the Battle of Leyte Gulf due to being detached on 24 October to cover the movement of the escort carriers of Task Unit 77.4.1 to Morotai to take aboard replacement aircraft. After refueling in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, she returned to Task Unit 77.4.2 on 29 October for a voyage back to Manus. After arrival at Manus, the ship remained anchored in Seeadler Harbor, and on 10 November was from the ammunition ship when the latter exploded. She was heavily damaged by fragments and exploding ammunition from the resulting conflagration, and had to be towed to the Lombrum Point Ship Repair Dock for repairs that lasted the rest of the month. Oberrender lost one sailor missing, one killed, and seventeen wounded in the explosion.  Lingayen Gulf, escort and patrol duty  While Oberrender was under repair, CortDiv69 was attached to Task Force 79 of the Seventh Fleet. Following the completion of repairs, she went to Borgen Bay off Cape Gloucester for an anti-submarine patrol in early December. Returning to Seeadler Harbor on 11 December as part of the screen for Task Group 79.4, the destroyer escort conducted gunnery training there and en route to the Huon Gulf, where she patrolled from 18 December. With Task Group 79.2, Oberrender returned to Seeadler Harbor on 21 December, remaining there until the last day of the year, when she departed for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf as part of the screen for the task group. Again without result, she engaged a Mitsubishi A6M Zero attacking a convoy of transports. 636x636px Taking up duty on an anti-submarine patrol station in Lingayen Gulf between 9 and 12 January, Oberrender escaped the notice of Japanese kamikaze pilots, whose attacks damaged LeRay Wilson and the destroyer escort ', also on the patrol line. At the end of this period, she departed with Gilligan and the destroyer escort ' for San Pedro Bay. The three escorts acted as part of the screen for the Landing Ship, Tanks of Task Forces 78 and 79 until arrival at the bay on 17 January. On the next day, Oberrender left for Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, as part of the screen for two divisions of attack cargo ships, part of Task Group 78.6. The task group was diverted to Biak en route and after arrival there, she anchored at nearby Mios Woendi Lagoon until 27 January, when she began a three-day patrol off Biak before returning to Mios Woendi. Oberrender became part of the screen for the task group, known as the Third Lingayen Reinforcement Group, on 1 February. The latter departed from Biak with its transports carrying the 41st Infantry Division two days later, and she continued screening the task group, which unloaded its troops at Mangarin Bay on Mindoro on 9 February. After the unloading, the task group and its screen continued to San Pedro Bay, where it dissolved on 12 February, leaving Oberrender at anchor awaiting a new assignment. Three days later, she departed for Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, as part of the screen for attack transports of Task Group 78.5; the ship arrived there on 19 February and remained anchored there until 2 March, when she participated in anti-submarine training with the submarine '. Oberrender departed Ulithi on the next day, acting as part of the screen for three fleet oilers on their voyage to the Tarraguna Anchorage near San Pedro Bay, which was reached on 7 March. Anchored in the bay for several days, she became part of Task Group 51.1 in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa, and on 10 March participated in anti-aircraft firing exercises. With the task group, the ship conducted rehearsals for the landings in Leyte Gulf between 14 and 16 March, then returned to the anchorage.  Okinawa  On 21 March, Task Group 51.1, known as the Western Islands Attack Group, departed for the Kerama Islands, which it was to secure before the invasion of Okinawa. Oberrender was included in the task group screen with Task Unit 51.1.13, which also included Richard W. Suesens and ' from CortDiv 69 as well as the destroyers ', ', ', ', ' and ' of Destroyer Squadron 49. They arrived in the area of Kerama Retto on 26 March, and while the troops quickly secured the islands, Oberrender was placed on anti-submarine patrol. On the night of 29 March her lookouts spotted a Japanese G4M Betty bomber, flying above the transports she was escorting for the night. This was Oberrender's first Japanese aircraft sighting of the campaign. She fruitlessly fired 20 mm rounds at the aircraft, which did not attack. 350x350px When the invasion of Okinawa began on 1 April, known as L-Day, the task unit was dissolved and Task Group 51.5 under Captain Frederick Moosbrugger assumed control of the screen, in the waters surrounding the island, including Oberrender on anti-submarine patrol. Air attacks became more frequent, but she remained untouched, driving off a Zero and a D3A Val dive bomber with her AA fire in two separate actions on 2 April. A day later, the ship stood alongside fellow destroyer escort ' was damaged by a bomb, and she temporarily left her patrol station to escort the attack transport ' into Hagushi Bay. Oberrender departed Okinawa to escort attack transports returning to Saipan on 5 April, returning to Okinawa after a stopover at Ulithi on 17 April. Back in the Okinawa vicinity, she and fellow destroyer escort ' operated as an anti-submarine hunter-killer group for the next several days, on one occasion firing her Hedgehog (weapon) at several contacts that turned out to be schools of fish. After returning to her patrol station separately from England in late April, Oberrender briefly returned to the Kerama Islands for resupply on 30 April, then resumed her station later that day. For the next few days, the routine of patrolling was broken by the escort of transports from Hagushi Beach to Nakagusuku Bay on 2 May and a fruitless engagement with a G3M Nell bomber. Starboard side damage near forward fireroom While stationed with the outer anti-submarine screen to the west of the island on 9 May, Oberrender went to general quarters after receiving a report of an approaching kamikaze attack at 18:40. After picking up a lone Japanese aircraft on her radar ten minutes later, she increased to flank speed. Her lookouts sighted the plane at 18:52, and it entered a dive toward the ship. One of its wings was torn off by her anti-aircraft fire, causing the aircraft to veer to the right, but it still crashed into the starboard 20 mm mount, destroying the latter. The bomb carried by the aircraft penetrated the main deck and exploded in the forward fireroom, knocking out power and leaving her dead in the water. The explosion heavily damaged the ship and nearly broke her in half, blowing the starboard hull plating outwards for a quarter of her length and pushing up the main deck. In the attack, eight men were killed and fifty-three wounded; those killed were either in the forward fireroom or the 20 mm mount that the plane crashed into. Oberrender transferred her wounded to rescue patrol craft escort PCE(R)-855 and was towed to Kerama Retto by the fleet tug . Declared to be a constructive total loss, she was decommissioned on 11 July and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 July. Her serviceable equipment was removed and the hulk was used as a target for gunnery practice, being sunk on 6 November 1945. Awards Oberrender received three battle stars for World War II service, one each for her participation in the Leyte landings, the Lingayen Gulf Landing, and the assault and occupation of Okinawa.

Babcock first attempted to join the army at the age of fifteen, but was turned down and sent to work in Halifax until he was placed in the Young Soldiers Battalion in August 1917. Babcock was then transferred to the United Kingdom, where he continued his training until the end of the war. Having never seen combat, Babcock did not consider himself a veteran and moved to the United States in the 1920s, where he joined the United States Army and eventually became an electrician. In May 2007, following the death of Dwight Wilson, he became the last surviving veteran of the First World War who served with the Canadian forces. From that point he received international attention, including 109th birthday greetings from Queen Elizabeth II, the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian Prime Minister, until his death on February 18, 2010. Early life Babcock was born on July 23, 1900, into a family of thirteen children on a farm in Frontenac County, Ontario. According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located off Highway 38 in South Frontenac Township. His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to Maclean's, while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder. Although he was brought into the house on bobsleigh, he only survived another two hours. Babcock said that this was an \\"awful blow\\" to the family. School was never a concern for Babcock, and he did not earn his high school diploma until the age of 95. On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he \\"didn't do very much,\\" although he admits that \\"[i]t was a fun place to grow up.\\" Babcock partook in fishing, hunting, and swimming‚Äîespecially around the local Sydenham Lake‚Äîin order to pass the time with the other kids his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the Holleford crater, a remnant of a meteor strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John. World War I At the age of fifteen and a half, Babcock was impressed at Perth Road by two recruiting officers, one a lieutenant and one a sergeant, who quoted from the poem \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\". He was also enticed by the offered salary, which was $1.10 per day, as opposed to the 50 cents he could have made through physical labour. Babcock was recruited in Sydenham, Ontario and joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was then sent to Valcartier, Quebec. There Babcock underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physically fit, but underage. At the time, the minimum age for combat was eighteen. Babcock was turned down, but managed to make it all the way to Halifax by train before he was stopped by the company commander. In Halifax he was sent to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he wrestled freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France. The Young Soldiers Battalion trained the recruits for eight hours a day. In his spare time Babcock went on leave to Scotland, where he met his first girlfriend, a woman from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. He was also introduced to the pleasures of beer and the horrors of war that some of the older veterans had come across. Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the conflict, given the chance, but the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines. For this reason, Babcock claims that he never felt like \\"a real soldier\\" and rarely talked of his experiences until his centenary. He also never joined any veterans associations. Experiences Babcock's brother Manley enlisted after John and served with the Canadian Military Engineers as a sapper. Manley suffered a nervous breakdown after the war. This, in Babcock's eyes, was one of many psychological problems that occurred during and after the war. He recalled at least one instance where a soldier shot himself with a .45 after his comrades discovered that he had emigrated from Germany, while another ran himself through with a bayonet after a pack drill. Babcock also recounted the importance of honesty in the Canadian Army. In one case, one of his comrades stole a dollar watch and received nine months in prison and Babcock cited that as an example of the strict discipline in the military structure. By March 1918 he had been promoted to acting corporal, but was reduced to the rank of private for neglect of duty. By October of that year, however, he had been restored to acting lance corporal. Soldiers holding acting ranks in the Canadian forces receive the salary and allowances of the rank, but can be restored to a previous rank at any time due to their lack of the necessary training or experience to hold that position permanently. In Canada during wartime, individuals could be promoted to acting ranks in order to meet service requirements. After the First World War With relatives in the United States, Babcock paid the $7 head tax and moved there in 1921. He received a Canadian Army pension that totaled $750 shortly after the conflict and took advantage of veteran vocational training in his native country to become an electrician. He ran a small light plant in his home neighborhood of Sydenham, and later had a career as an industrial supply salesman in the United States. He became a United States citizen in 1946 after serving in the United States Army and achieving the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted to sign up for active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington. At the age of 65, Babcock became a pilot. As of 2006 he was in good mental and physical health, displayed by his ability to quickly recite the alphabet backwards, spell out his name in Morse Code, and take daily walks with his wife to keep in shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends. Babcock was married twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty years his junior whom he met when she was taking care of his first wife while she was dying. Babcock had one son (Jack Jr.) and one daughter (Sandra). One grandchild, Matt, was an army dentist in Iraq during the Iraq War. John and Dorothy resided in Spokane, Washington, where Babcock lived from 1932 until his death. Babcock was not the only centenarian in his family; his younger sister Lucy died in July 2007 at the age of 102. Last surviving Canadian veteran From the death of Dwight Wilson on May 9, 2007, Babcock was the last known Canadian veteran of the First World War. He was proud of his status as the last surviving Canadian World War I veteran, although he did not feel the need to be honoured in a specific state funeral. Instead, he was of the opinion that \\"they should commemorate all of them, instead of just one.\\" He was also quoted as saying \\"I'm sure that all the attention I'm getting isn't because of anything spectacular I've done. It's because I'm the last one.\\" Nevertheless, Babcock received much attention on the occasion of his 107th birthday, with wishes from Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada (who Babcock joked is a \\"nice looking gal\\"), Governor General Micha√´lle Jean, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay. James Moore, a Member of Parliament from British Columbia, visited Babcock personally to deliver gifts and greetings. For his birthday, Babcock and his wife went to Rosauers for his favourite meal of hamburgers and French fries. Among the gifts he received was a necktie adorned with a poppy pattern, a symbol of the First World War. In his hometown of South Frontenac, mayor Gary Davison sent a letter of congratulations, while the local coffee shop named their local blend, \\"The Jack,\\" after him. Babcock was invited to the opening of a Pentagon exhibit on March 6, 2008, featuring photos of nine First World War veterans, but was unable to attend. At the time he was one of only two of the veterans pictured to be alive, along with American Frank Buckles, who did participate in the event. In 2008, he was visited by Canadian officials and wrote to Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he was interested in regaining his Canadian citizenship in a letter that was hand-delivered to him in a cabinet meeting. The request was approved by the Prime Minister and the paperwork was signed by Governor General Micha√´lle Jean, after which officials from Citizenship and Immigration Canada were flown to Spokane to complete the swearing in ceremony. That same year, Babcock participated in the Canadian Remembrance Day ceremonies, appearing via video to symbolically pass the torch of remembrance, urging people to \\"hold it high\\". Babcock credited his longevity to the intense physical training that he received in both the United States and Canadian armies. Babcock died on February 18, 2010, at the age of 109, having been housebound since October 2009 following a case of pneumonia. He was cremated and his remains were scattered across the Pacific Northwest. Governor General Jean and Prime Minister Harper made statements of condolence shortly after his death and, on the anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge (April 9), Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, issued a statement marking the two events, stating: \\"As proud and grateful Canadians, we pause today to mark not only the ninety-third anniversary of this Nation's victory at Vimy Ridge but also to pay tribute to the passing of a truly remarkable generation who helped to end the most terrible conflict the world had ever known.\\" The local Royal Canadian Legion in Sydenham, Ontario has a collection of First World War items on display, including a roll call with Babcock's name on it, in his honour.

He now lives at Cil Farm, Berriew in a house once owned by Arthur Humphreys-Owen who served as an MP for Davies' seat from 1894‚Äì1906. In 2002, Davies underwent major surgery for rectal cancer. He went on to make a full recovery and in 2006 competed in a rugby game alongside Jonah Lomu to promote the message that is possible to make a full recovery following a serious illness and to raise money for charity. Professional career Davies was a farmer. He is a former Chairman of the Development Board for Rural Wales and also served as a Member of the Welsh Development Agency and the Welsh Tourist Board. Political career Davies' career in politics began in 1980 when he found his local District Council. He was Chairman of Montgomeryshire District Council from 1985‚Äì89, having previously served as Chair of the Planning Committee and Chair of the Finance Committee. Member of the National Assembly for Wales for the Welsh Conservative Party in the Mid and West Wales region from 1999 to 2007. Chair of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee in the First Assembly; and the Environment, Planning and Countryside Committee in the Second Assembly. Following the loss of his place in the National Assembly for Wales due to Conservative success elsewhere in the region, Davies challenged Lembit √ñpik, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire, at the 2010 UK General Election, having unsuccessfully challenged √ñpik at the 1997 General Election in the same seat. He beat √ñpik to become the Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. In September 2010 it was announced that Glyn was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Cheryl Gillan as Secretary of State for Wales, a role he lost in the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle. In 2015, he was re-elected in that year's general election with 45% of the vote. One of the votes for him was a drawing of a penis in the box next to his name, which was ruled valid. Davies was again re-elected in the 2017 general election, with a majority of 9,285. In July 2017, it was confirmed that Davies would resume his previous role (2010‚Äì2012) as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns. On 13 May 2019, Davies announced he would not be standing for re-election at the next general election. Comments about academics In October 2016, Davies tweeted a series of remarks about 'academics', suggesting that they lacked the status of experts and were universally out of touch with the real world. The remarks caused a significant backlash from the public, the press, and peers from within the Conservative Party. Since the incident, Davies has ceased using Twitter as a form of communication, and has refused to offer a public apology for his remarks. Blogging Davies blogs semi-regularly, on his web page 'A View from Rural Wales'. The British blogger Iain Dale is quoted as describing Davies as \\"By common consensus the best politician blogger in Wales and he's a real character\\". Davies kept up blogging after losing his seat in the National Assembly. In 2008, Davies defended the sacked former blogger Christopher Glamorganshire, and is quoted as saying \\"The Christopher Glamorganshire blog was on my list of 'my favourites'. It seemed to me to be written in a sensible and rational manner. Clearly, if his contract of employment said he was not allowed to blog, he doesn't have much of a case. But if it is simply a question of supposedly contravening the code, I think sacking him is very harsh and heavy-handed. This all smacks of the heavy hand of the state.\\" His blog was voted the second most popular Welsh political blog in Iain Dale's Total Politics Guide to Blogging 2008‚Äì09, a position he has maintained from the previous year.

Analysis Written as though it were a note left on a kitchen table, Williams's poem appears to the reader like a piece of found poetry. Metrically, the poem exhibits no regularity of stress or of syllable count. Except for lines two and five (each an iamb) and lines eight and nine (each an amphibrach), no two lines have the same metrical form. The consonance of the letters \\"Th\\" in lines two, three, and four, as well the consonance of the letter \\"F\\" in lines eight and nine, and the letter 'S' in lines eleven and twelve give rise to a natural rhythm when the poem is read aloud. A conspicuous lack of punctuation contributes to the poem's tonal ambiguity. While the second stanza begins with a conjunction, implying a connection to the first stanza, the third stanza is separated from the first two by the capitalized \\"Forgive\\". In a 1950 interview, John W. Gerber asked the poet what it is that makes \\"This Is Just to Say\\" a poem; Williams replied, \\"In the first place, it's metrically absolutely regular... So, dogmatically speaking, it has to be a poem because it goes that way, don't you see!\\" Critic Marjorie Perloff writes, \\"on the page, the three little quatrains look alike; they have roughly the same physical shape. It is typography rather than any kind of phonemic recurrence that provides directions for the speaking voice (or for the eye that reads the lines silently) and that teases out the poem's meanings.\\" Additionally, this typographical structure influences any subsequent interpretation on the part of the reader. Florence Williams's (Williams's wife) 'reply' to This Is Just to Say is included as a 'Detail' in the partially published Detail & Parody for the poem Paterson (a manuscript at SUNY Buffalo)From the note to the poems in The Collected Poems of William Carlos Williams, volume 1, 1909-1939, edited by A. Walton Litz and Christopher MacGowan Carcanet Press, Manchester 200 first appearing in 1982.The Atlantic Monthly (November 1982) page 145 Since Williams chose to include the 'reply' in his own sequence it seems likely that he took a note left by his wife and turned it into a 'poem'.

In the United States, ‚ÄúDark ‚Äôn‚Äô Stormy‚Äù has been a registered trademark of Gosling Brothers Ltd of Bermuda since 1991. Gosling's markets the drink through tie-ins to the sailing and sail racing community. Gosling Brothers uses this registration to prohibit US marketing of a drink under the name \\"Dark 'N Stormy\\", or a related, confusing name, unless it is made with Gosling Black Seal rum. Gosling's has litigated or threatened litigation over the mark against Pernod Ricard, Proximo Spirits, Picaroons Traditional Ales, Infinium Spirits' Zaya, and a cocktail blog.  Naming  Gosling Brothers has registered a version of the name that uses one apostrophe ('N), while the International Bartender's Association uses two apostrophes ('N'). Because of Gosling Brothers' threats of litigation, some sources use other variations on the name to describe similar drinks, such as a \\"Safe Harbor\\".

Club career Grayson's first club was local outfit Rowntree Mackintosh, playing in the Northern Counties East Football League Division One. He was snapped up by Doncaster Rovers in March 1990 where he stayed for just over a year. He has had spells at a number of clubs at various tiers, including York City, Chesterfield and Northampton Town in the Football League. Whilst at Northampton he scored the fastest ever hat- trick by a Northampton player, in five minutes against Hartlepool, and also helped the Cobblers win the Division Three playoffs. In 1997, he dropped back into non-league football with Hereford United who paid ¬£20,000 for him. He quickly became a fans favourite, scoring his first ever FA Cup goals in Hereford's 2‚Äì1 revenge win over Brighton, and went on to score a goal in every two games for the Edgar Street side. This was enough for Cheltenham Town to make a ¬£15,000 bid that the financially troubled Bulls couldn't refuse in March 1998. He was instrumental in Cheltenham's promotion to the Football League in 1998‚Äì99, scoring a spectacular goal against Morecambe, the winner against Rushden & Diamonds in a Conference Championship showdown. He was subsequently named Conference Player of the Year. During the 2001‚Äì2002 season, he scored one of his most memorable goals, a volley from at least 30 yards at Whaddon Road in the Division 3 game against Plymouth. His last appearances for the club were in the successful 2001‚Äì02 playoff campaign where he scored a vital equaliser in the semi-finals first leg and scored his penalty in the shootout in the second leg. For his final game for the Robins, at the Millennium Stadium he came on as a substitute and smashed a shot against the post, with recent signing John Finnigan netting the re-bound. He was soon released by the club and then joined non-league side Forest Green Rovers in the Conference. He spent two seasons at Forest Green Rovers, and then signed for Stafford Rangers in March 2004, scoring twice on his league debut against Moor Green. He played over 100 times for Stafford, notably scoring in the 2006 Conference North playoff final against Droylsden. Neil was named as an all- time cult hero both at Northampton and Cheltenham, in a FourFourTwo magazine poll. In 2010, he signed for Carlton Town and stayed for the 2010‚Äì11 season, scoring 17 goals in 46 appearances; a short period at Heanor Town in August 2011, where he made only one appearance, was followed by a return to Carlton for season 2011‚Äì12. However, his second spell with the club was considerably less prolific than his first; having played 26 games and scored only two goals, he moved once more to Heanor in January 2012. Making his debut for Heanor in a 2‚Äì1 East Midlands Counties League Cup quarter-final win over Blackwell Miners Welfare on 15 February 2012, Grayson scored on his league debut for the club, a 4‚Äì3 home victory over Oadby Town on 18 February 2012. He went on to make a further 8 appearances during Heanor's East Midlands Counties League Premier Division title-winning season in 2011‚Äì12, however did not add to his goal tally. Grayson signed in 2013 for Heanor's divisional rivals Sutton Town, playing for the club until their resignation from the league at the end of the 2013‚Äì2014 season. International career Neil Grayson was capped four times, scoring three goals, for the England National Game XI from 1998 to 1999.

The orchestra is staffed, managed, and conducted entirely by students. Each year, the members of the orchestra select the next year's conductor, always an undergraduate. In turn, at the beginning of the new year the inaugurated conductor auditions new and returning members of the orchestra. BachSoc generally performs four times per year, with concerts featuring works for chamber orchestra ‚Äì interpreted broadly to include intimate chamber pieces as well as mid-sized symphonies ‚Äì taken from an eclectic set of historical periods. Works featured in recent seasons have included Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3, Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 6 and 7, Barber's Adagio for Strings, Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf (narrated by the Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes), and Villa-Lobos' Sinfonietta No. 1. The Bach Society Orchestra has been an official undergraduate organization of the University since the 1954‚Äì55 academic school year. At its founding, the orchestra loosely devoted itself to performing the music of J.S. Bach. Since then, the repertoire has grown to span the historical continuum from baroque to the contemporary. The orchestra's annual composition and concerto competitions have become respected institutions of the Harvard music scene. Alumni include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, composers John Adams and John Harbison, conductors Joel Lazar, Andrew Schenck, Alan Gilbert, Isaiah Jackson, Christopher Wilkins, Hugh Wolff, and Samuel Wong, and members of top American symphony orchestras.

Actress Vanessa Downing originated the role and made her debut during the pilot episode broadcast on 17 January 1988. Downing quit the role in 1990, and Debra Lawrance was then cast. Pippa departed on 18 March 1998, but Lawrance has reprised the role for numerous returns between 2000 and 2009. Casting Carol Willesee was initially hired for the \\"pivotal role of foster mother, and earth mother\\" Pippa Fletcher.Mercado, Andrew, p.252 In his book Super Aussie Soaps, Andrew Mercado opined that casting the then wife of current affairs show host, Mike Willesee, was a publicity dream. Of Willesee's casting, producer John Holmes said \\"She had just started acting and was pretty raw, but she had a warmth about her.\\" When filming began, the Seven Network became worried because Willesee had not signed a contract. The actress later revealed she had a verbal agreement that she could have time off during the school holidays, as well as later starts and early finishes, so she could spend time with her family. The network realised that that situation would not work for a show scheduled to film five episodes per week and they decided to recast the character and reshoot the footage Willesee had already filmed. Holmes explained that it would have been \\"irresponsible\\" to allow an unsigned actress to keep filming when she could walk out at any time. The pivotal role of Pippa was then given to Vanessa Downing at very short notice and the actress had to juggle a theatre production in which she was appearing along with the filming of the pilot episode of Home and Away. Downing made her debut as Pippa on 17 January 1988. She appeared as Pippa until 1990, when she suddenly quit the series, apparently due to missing working with her former co-star Roger Oakley, who played her on-screen husband Tom. Producers did not want to kill off the character, as she was crucial to the storyline, so they recast the part instead. Auditions were held and it came down to two actresses; Jackie Woodburne and Debra Lawrance. Lawrance commented \\"We were, and still are, very dear friends. She and I were short-listed together and after our call back audition we caught up for coffee. We both genuinely agreed that we didn't mind if the other got it.\\" Lawrance won the role and immediately took over from Downing in July 1990; there was no break in the storyline for the character, when Downing departed, Lawrance appeared as Pippa in the following episode with no attempt to explain the sudden change of appearance. Lawrance remained in the role until 1998 and has subsequently returned to guest star.Mercado, Andrew, p.263 Storylines Pippa is the daughter of Bert (Kevin Healy; Peter Collingwood) and Coral King (Jessica Noad). Pippa married her brother Danny's (John Clayton) army mate Tom Fletcher in 1969 and they foster Frank Morgan (Alex Papps) in 1978 after his parents Les (Mario Kery) and Helena (Lee Sanderson) are incapable of looking after him. As time passes they take in more children from various homes and institutions; Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), Sally Keating (Kate Ritchie) and Steven Matheson (Adam Willits). Tom is retrenched in early 1988 and the family leave the city and relocate to Summer Bay and buy the local Caravan Park from Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Local troublemaker Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) causes problems for the family by picking fights with Carly. After Bobby is cleared of several crimes, The Fletchers agree to foster her, much to ire of their neighbour, Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). Pippa takes a part-time job at Ailsa Hogan's (Judy Nunn) general store and later discovers she is pregnant, despite Tom having a vasectomy. This is a concern as Pippa had rheumatic fever as a child, it weakened her heart and doctors warned her that she should not have children. Danny visits for ANZAC Day as he and Tom both served in the Vietnam War. He asks Pippa to help him commit suicide as he was left in a wheelchair from the war, which she refuses. Danny later gains a new lease on life and leaves. Pippa then gives birth to a son, Christopher (Ashleigh Bell- Weir) and a christening is held. Pippa and Tom later adopt Sally. When Tom suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized for several weeks, Pippa begins to feel the strain. Coral visits and offers to help out physically and financially. It soon emerges that Coral is shoplifting and she tells Pippa she misses the standard of living prior to Bert's retirement. When Tom recovers and returns home, He accuses Pippa of having an affair with local shark Hunter Zac Burgess (Mark Conroy) and their marriage undergoes a testing time but they manage to put it behind them. Pippa is left devastated when Tom suffers a second heart attack and dies. Michael Ross (Dennis Coard) arrives in Summer Bay several months later and Pippa is clearly attracted to him but feels guilty as Tom has only been dead a few months. Despite resistance from Sally and Michael's son Haydn (Andrew Hill), Pippa and Michael marry. Pippa then falls pregnant again and gives birth to another son, Dale (Olivia Alfonzetti). Several months later Dale dies of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). The family are in debt, which is exacerbated further when Michael takes out a loan to pay off Haydn's gambling debts. This leads to arguments and Pippa and Michael separate over Christmas 1994 but reconcile after Sally runs away. In 1996, Michael drowns while trying to save Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark) during a storm which floods the Bay. Pippa then builds up a strong bond with fellow widow Angel Parrish (Melissa George) whose husband Shane (Dieter Brummer) had also died several months earlier. Pippa is later awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for her years of service as a foster carer. Ian Routledge (Patrick Dickson) begins staying at the caravan park and takes an interest in Pippa and wants her to come travelling with him. She declines but when Ian returns a few months later, she accepts his offer and she, Christopher and Ian leave the Bay to live in the Carrington Ranges. Sally later attends their wedding in 1999. The next year Pippa, along with many other past residents, return to Summer Bay for Sally's wedding to Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren). After Sally jilts Kieran, Pippa comforts her. Pippa then sells the house to The Sutherland family before departing. In 2002 Pippa appears on a video with a special message she made for Sally during Summer Bay's 150th anniversary celebrations. The next year, she and Christopher (now played by Rian McLean) return for Sally's wedding to Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy). Two years later she returns for Alf's 60th birthday celebrations. Pippa returns again to comfort Sally, following Flynn's death of cancer and the next year when Sally's wedding to Brad Armstrong (Chris Sadrinna) fails. Pippa returns twice in 2008, First at Sally's bedside where she meets Sally's long-lost twin brother, Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) and several months later to help Sally with her departure from Summer Bay. When Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) leaves on a trip the following year, Alf asks Pippa to look after Geoff (Lincoln Lewis) and Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) and she stays for a week. Reception Pippa was placed sixth in TV Week's list of the \\"Top 10 Aussie TV mums\\". A writer for the publication said \\"Kind-hearted Pippa helped dozens of fosters kids, along with her own son, Dale, get on the straight and narrow with reliable doses of tough love. Pippa oversaw Sally's (Kate Ritchie) progress from child to independent woman, and once Sally was on her feet, Pippa left town to make a new life. Being a good mum, Pippa has returned for all the family's rites of passage.\\" Writers for the publication later included Pippa at number six in their feature on the \\"Top 20 Home And Away characters of all time\\". They wrote that the character was \\"kind-hearted\\", but had \\"more than her share of grief\\". The episode featuring the death of Pippa's newborn son, Dale, won the Australian Film Institute award for Best Episode In A Television Drama Serial in 1993. It was presented to executive producer, Andrew Howie.

The spirit is not made with coconuts. Production Coconut brandy is produced from the sap (\\"toddy\\") of borassus flowers that are extracted by a process called tapping and paring. The toddy is sourced from the borassus palm in Sri Lanka, where the borassus palm is tapped and pared for a total of 8 months, beginning in the first week of April and ending the second week of December each year. The toddy's main constituent is sucrose, and it naturally ferments in the wood casks it is brought to the distillery in. Under normal conditions during toddy collection this sucrose will ferment without aid, due to naturally occurring yeast. At the distillery, the fermented toddy is transferred into wood storing vats where it is filtered. It is then pumped into the distillation house where the distiller uses both a pot still and a patent still to distill different batches of toddy. the Toddy is double distilled in the French pot still and single distilled in the patent still by a continuous distillation process. During distillation, the distillate of toddy is placed in wooden holding vats which are transferred to warehouses for maturation. Oak casks and hamlilla wood casks are used to age the coconut brandy. Coconut brandy bottled after two years labelled as a V.S., while brandy labelled X.O. has a minimum of 10 years maturation, which emulates cognac grades.

These data may be stored pending recovery of the device or relayed to a central data store or internet-connected computer using an embedded cellular (GPRS), radio, or satellite modem. The animal's location can then be plotted against a map or chart in near real-time or, when analysing the track later, using a GIS package or custom software. While GPS tracking devices may also be attached to domestic animals such as pets, pedigree livestock and working dogs, and similar systems are used in fleet management of vehicles, wildlife tracking can place additional constraints on size and weight and may not allow for post-deployment recharging or replacement of batteries or correction of attachment. As well as allowing in-depth study of animal behaviour and migration, the high-resolution tracks available from a GPS-enabled system can potentially allow for tighter control of animal-borne communicable diseases such as the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.USGS Release: Satellites Help Scientists Track Migratory Birds: GPS the Latest Tool in Fight Against Avian Influenza (9/6/2006 9:38:16 AM) Attachment=Collar attachment A jaguar wearing a tracking collar Collar attachment is the primary attachment technique where the subject has a suitable body type and behaviour. Tracking collars would normally be used on the animal's neck (assuming the head has a larger circumference than the neck)BBC NEWS  Technology  Snow leopard fitted with GPS tag but also on a limb, perhaps around an ankle. Suitable animals for neck attachment would include primates, large cats, some bears etc. Limb attachment would work well in animals such as kiwi, where the foot is much larger than the ankle. Harness attachment Harness attachments may used in situations where collar attachment is not suitable, such as animals whose neck diameter may exceed that of the head. Examples of this type of animal may include pigs, Tasmanian devils, etc. Large, long-necked, birds such as the greylag goose may also need to be fitted with a harness to prevent removal of the tag by the subject.CSL - Goose Project Direct attachment Direct attachment is used on animals where a collar cannot be used, such as birds, reptiles and marine mammals. In the case of birds, the GPS unit must be very lightweight to avoid interfering with the bird's ability to fly or swim. The device is usually attached by gluing or, for short deployments, tapingP. G. Ryan, S. L. Petersen, G. Peters and D. Gr√©millet, \\"GPS tracking a marine predator: the effects of precision, resolution and sampling rate on foraging tracks of African Penguins\\" in Marine Biology, International Journal on Life in Oceans and Coastal Waters, Volume 145, Number 2, August 2004, pp. 215-223 to the bird. The unit will then naturally fall off when the bird next moults. In the case of reptiles such as crocodiles and turtles, gluing the unit onto the animal's skin or carapace using epoxy (or similar material) is the most common method and minimises discomfort.Godley, B.J., et al., \\"Post-nesting movements and submergence patterns of loggerhead marine turtles in the Mediterranean assessed by satellite tracking\\", Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 287 (2003) p.121 In deployments on marine mammals such as phocids or otariids, the device would be glued to the fur and fall off during the annual moult. Units used with turtles or marine animals have to resist the corrosive effects of sea water and be waterproof to pressures of up to 200bar. Other attachment methods Other applications include rhinoceros tracking, for which a hole may be drilled in the animal's horn and a device implanted. Compared to other methods, implanted transmitters may suffer from a reduced range as the large mass of the animal's body can absorb some transmitted power. There are also GPS implants for large snakes, such as ones offered by Telemetry Solutions. Software=Embedded Duty Cycle Scheduling - GPS devices typically record data about the animal's exact location and store readings at pre-set intervals known as duty-cycles. By setting the interval between readings, the researcher is able to determine the lifespan of the device - very frequent readings drain battery power more rapidly, whereas longer intervals between readings might provide lower resolution but over a longer deployment.P. G. Ryan, S. L. Petersen, G. Peters and D. Gr√©millet, \\"GPS tracking a marine predator: the effects of precision, resolution and sampling rate on foraging tracks of African Penguins\\" in Marine Biology, International Journal on Life in Oceans and Coastal Waters, Volume 145, Number 2, August 2004, pp. 215-223 Release Timers - Some devices can be programmed to drop off at a set time/date rather than requiring recapture and manually retrieval. Some may also be fitted with a low-power radio receiver allowing a remote signal to trigger the automatic release. Analytical Locational data provided by GPS devices can be displayed using GIS packages such as the open- source GRASS or plotted and prepared for display on the World Wide Web using packages such as Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), FollowDem (developed by Ecrins national Park to track ibex) or Maptool. Statistical software such as R can be used to display and examine data and may reveal behavioural patterns or trends. Data retrieval=Argos GPS tracking devices have been linked to an Argos Platform Transmitter Terminal (PTT) enabling them to transmit data via the Argos System, a scientific satellite system which has been in use since 1978. Users can download their data directly from Argos via telnet and process the raw data to extract their transmitted information.FANCY, S. G., L. F. PANK, D. C. DOUGLAS, C. H. CURBY, G. W. GARNER, S.

In 1906, he visited the US and played for Kerry in the New York Championship, which they won. He also took part in the Croke Memorial, which pitted Kerry against Louth. This game went to a replay with Kerry winning it at Jones Road. It was the first time a four- figure sum was received for a match and with this money the G.A.A purchased Croke Park in Dublin. Fitzgerald captained the two winning teams of 1913 and 1914 against Wexford but retired from the game after Kerry's defeat in 1915 against the same opposition. After the Easter Rising he was held in detention at Frongoch internment camp in Wales. Whilst there, he organised Gaelic football matches. Later life He later wrote a book on Gaelic football entitled How to play Gaelic football which was the first of its kind in the organisation. After retiring from play, he continued in the administrative side of the organisation. He became representative to the Central Council 1917, Kerry selector 1918, and delegate to Congress 1919. He served on the Munster Council from 1920 until his death. He was the first chairman of the East Kerry Board and also Chairman of Dr Crokes GAA Club. In 1929 he was appointed a special vice-chairman of the Kerry Selection Committee without a vote, in appreciation of his service to the county. Dick was also a member of Killarney Urban District Council from 1917 until his death.  Death  On September 26, 1930 Fitzgerald died following injuries sustained when falling from the roof of the Killarney courthouse. The circumstances of his death were never fully explained but it was claimed that he was drinking heavily at the time. Immediately after his death the Dr Croke Club began a campaign to develop a field in his honour. Following several years of fundraising, Fitzgerald Stadium opened in May 1936.

Unlike the other Empire Builder games, it is set in a fantasy world with dragon-based locomotives. Eden Games licensed the game from Mayfair to produce a Windows version of the game, Rail Empires: Iron Dragon. Gameplay The goal of Iron Dragon is to connect seven of the game‚Äôs eight major cities with rails and amass 250 gold pieces. Players spend money to build railways and earn money by using them to deliver goods such as dragons, wands, spells, pipeweed, gems, wine and ale. Demand cards indicate three different combinations of good requested, city to which to deliver, and payout; generally longer distances between good production regions and destinations yield higher payouts. Players can upgrade trains for speed and cargo capacity, hire foremen to reduce building costs in various terrain, and even set sail to deliver cargo. Interaction between players is limited to competition for routes, as only one player can own the connection between any two markers, and the usually negative effects of event cards, which affect all players but may harm some more than others.

Cribbage, sometimes called cribbage pocket billiards, cribbage pool, fifteen points and pair pool, is a two-player pocket billiards game that, like its namesake card game, has a scoring system which awards points for pairing groups of balls (rather than playing cards) that total 15. Played on a standard pool table, participants who a ball of a particular number are required to immediately pocket the companion ball that tallies to 15 when added to the prior ball's number. Each pair so pocketed counts as a cribbage; there are seven such pairs, and the 15 ball counts as an eighth by itself after all of the others have been pocketed. The first player to score five cribbages wins the game. Gameplay (Billiard Congress of America)=Setup At the start of cribbage, a standard set of fifteen pool balls are racked at the end of a pool table, with the of the rack centered over the and the 15 ball placed at the rack's center. All other balls are placed randomly except that no two of the three corner balls may total to fifteen. Such an open-ended racking rule is unusual in that most pool games require particular balls to be placed at the corners of the rack and sometimes in fixed positions inside the rack as well. The arrangement thus results in 134,120,448,000 possible racking patterns (14 √ó 12 √ó 10 √ó 2 √ó 11!).A cribbage rack: The 15 in the middle, apex ball on the foot spot, and no two corner balls adding up to fifteen. An is required in cribbage, meaning that on the break either a ball must be pocketed or at least four balls must be driven to rails (as opposed to a such as used, for example, in straight pool and one-pocket). The object of the game is to score 5 cribbages out of a possible 8 in a full rack of 15 balls. Cribbages A cribbage is a pair of numbered balls which, when added together, total to 15 points. A cribbage only lies where the two partner balls forming the cribbage are each legally made, i.e., where no is committed on the same strokes that pocket the balls, or the shot is otherwise deemed illegal. The one exception to pairing is the 15 ball, which itself becomes a cribbage but only once all other of the rack have been pocketed. Thus, not including the 15 ball, the available cribbages are the 1-14, 2-13, 3-12, 4-11, 5-10, 6-9 and 7-8. Rules of play A cribbage only counts when the paired balls are pocketed in succession in the same . Where a player pockets a first paired ball and is thus on a cribbage, if the companion ball is not pocketed on the next stroke, the shot is a foul and the unpaired balls of any cribbages not completed are to the . If the foot spot is occupied, balls are spotted as close as possible to the foot spot on the stretching back from the foot spot to the . The penalty for all fouls is the ending of the player's inning; no points are lost, and the incoming player has the option of shooting from position or taking from the (behind the table's ). In older rules a foul was a loss of one point. Three successive fouls in cribbage is a loss of game. Pocketing the 15 ball when it is not the last ball on the table is not a foul. Instead it is immediately spotted and play continues without penalty.Billiard Congress America (1995‚Äì2005). General rules of pocket billiards: Rules 3.10, 3.18 and 3.19 . Retrieved March 15, 2007. When players pocket more than one ball on a single at any time, a situation often arising on the , they may shoot at any companion balls, but must pocket each in succession in any order. If incidental balls are pocketed on the same stroke that a cribbage is completed, they add to the succession of cribbages the player is \\"on\\". When a player fouls by failing to pocket an unpaired cribbage while on a succession of unpaired balls, only unpaired balls are spotted; the prior successful cribbages count toward the score. Normal ball and rail foul rules apply in cribbage. This is a requirement present in most pool games that a player must contact an with the cue ball and after that contact, either pocket an object ball, or some ball including the cue ball must contact a rail. When a foul results from the cue ball into a pocket or jumping it off the table, the player has cue ball in hand from the kitchen. When a player has cue ball in hand from the kitchen and all object balls are also behind the head string in the , a player has the option of having the object ball nearest the head string relocated to the foot spot. If in this situation two or more object balls are equidistantly closest to the head string, the player may designate which ball is to be relocated.

It was carried on Foxtel, Austar and Optus TV, as well as other subscription TV services. The channel was set up by the Victorian thoroughbred racing industry and Sydney metropolitan racing clubs as an alternative to Sky Racing and as an attempt by the racing clubs concerned \\"to capture the valuable assets of racing media rights and leverage them to the benefit of racing\\". Sydney Turf Club. Retrieved 15 July 2007. TVN was 50% owned by Victorian racings organisations Melbourne Racing Club, Victoria Racing Club, Moonee Valley Racing Club and Country Racing Victoria; and 50% by the Sydney- based, Australian Turf Club. It launched in May 2005 and ceased almost 10 years later in March 2015.  History  Prior to the launch of TVN, Sky Channel purchased the rights to broadcast race meetings from almost all racing clubs across the country and then resold the rights to pubs and clubs, back to the racing venues and also to DTH subscribers. TVN was formed after TabCorp, the owner of Sky Racing, pulled out of plans it was developing with Racing Victoria Limited in February 2005 to launch a dedicated thoroughbred racing channel apart from Sky Channel's other broadcasts, which included harness racing and greyhound racing, with Sky Channel chief executive Peter Caillard stating that \\"the fledgling TVN model is a risky proposition to all the racing codes and is not in a position to showcase thoroughbred racing to its full potential\\". Victorian racing clubs planned to continue launching the service and won the support of the Australian Jockey Club and Sydney Turf Club when they announced their intention not to re-sign with Sky Channel when their contracts came up for renewal in March 2005. Both the AJC and STC supported TVN and a partnership was formed with Racing Victoria Limited. In May 2005, existing contracts between Victorian raceclubs and Sky Channel ended and these were then signed over to TVN. The service was initially only available on the Foxtel platform, but Sky Channel had exclusivity agreements with some race meetings through Sky Racing. In August 2005, Sky successfully obtained an injunction against TVN and pay TV carrier Austar, stopping Austar from broadcasting TVN. However, broadcast agreements were eventually extended to Austar and Optus. On 21 January 2015, after years of stalled broadcast rights negotiations with Tabcorp, Racing NSW withdrew its support for TVN and brokered a new deal which would see its race meetings broadcast exclusively on Sky Racing. This new deal left TVN with the broadcast rights to only Victorian-based meetings. In February 2015, TVN announced their closure and ceased broadcasting on 15 March 2015. Sky Racing launched a brand new channel on 21 March 2015. Sky Throughbred Central - which replaces Sky Racing World, showcases race meetings from New South Wales, as well as extended international coverage. General Manager of Sky Racing Gerard Patane said \\"The decision to rebrand our thoroughbred-only channel reflects the recently announced 10-year deal with Racing NSW and the Australian Turf Club.\\"  Programming  Main programs were Raceday Live and Racenight Live. Raceday Live provided extensive coverage of the three main thoroughbred meetings of the day, mostly from Victoria and New South Wales. Racenight Live provided coverage of Singapore and Hong Kong thoroughbred meetings and also coverage of Canterbury (Sydney) and Moonee Valley (Melbourne) night meetings in spring and summer. It also provided coverage of Royal Ascot meetings in June.

In conjunction with the nuclear football, the Gold Codes allow the president to authorize a nuclear attack. Gold Codes, as well as a separate nuclear football, are also assigned to the Vice President in case the president is incapacitated or otherwise unable to discharge the duties of office pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.The Football. Brookings Institution Gold Codes are arranged in a column and printed on a plastic card, nicknamed \\"the biscuit\\". The card is similar to a credit card, and the president carries it on his or her person. Before it can be read, an opaque plastic covering must be snapped in two and removed. Gold Codes are generated daily and provided by the National Security Agency (NSA) to the White House, The Pentagon, United States Strategic Command, and TACAMO. For an extra level of security, the list of codes on the card includes codes that have no meaning, and therefore the president must memorize where on the list the correct code is located. The concept behind the codes is that they permit the president to positively identify themself as the commander-in-chief and thereby authenticate a launch order to the National Military Command Center (NMCC). Protocol Should the president decide to order the launch of nuclear weapons, they would be taken aside by the \\"carrier\\" of the nuclear football and the briefcase opened. Once opened, the president would decide which \\"attack options\\" (specific orders for attacks on specific targets) to use. The attack options are preset war plans developed under OPLAN 8010, and include major attack options (MAOs), selected attack options (SAOs), and limited attack options (LAOs). The chosen attack option and the Gold Codes would then be transmitted to the NMCC via a special, secure channel. Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear policy consultant, explained in 2018: \\"Once [the president's] identity is verified, he gives the order and it is transmitted down the chain of command. The chain of command goes from the president through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then, if we‚Äôre using long-range weapons, down through the Strategic Command, then the order is relayed to our forces in the field. It always happens extremely quickly.\\" As commander-in-chief, the president is the only individual with the authority to order the use of nuclear weapons.Presidential Authority and Nuclear Weapons: Taking Back Our Rights. University of Pennsylvania Law School. A two-man rule applies, however: the National Command Authority comprising the president and Secretary of Defense must jointly authenticate the order to use nuclear weapons to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is argued by Franklin Miller that the president has almost single authority to initiate a nuclear attack since the Secretary of Defense is required to verify the order, but cannot legally veto it. However, Section 4 of the 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows for the vice president, together with a majority of cabinet heads or Congress, to declare the president disabled or unfit to execute the duties of the office.

He played college football at Vanderbilt University and was selected in the sixth round of the 1970 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He is the author of books about professional football, including The Crunch and the 1984 novel On Any Given Sunday. Early years One of four children of a U.S. Air Force officer, Toomay was born in California and lived various locations, including Hawaii, upstate New York, and northern Virginia. He attended Thomas Edison High School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he was an all-state player in football, basketball, and baseball, graduating in 1966. In football, he received high school All-American honors as a running quarterback. He accepted a football scholarship from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was given a chance to play both basketball and football for the Commodores. As a sophomore, he made the decision to focus on football, where he was converted from quarterback, to a safety, later linebacker, and finally defensive end. As a senior, he played in the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Toomay was selected in the sixth round of the 1970 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys, the 153rd overall pick. At the beginning of his career, he was an undersized defensive end, used mostly in substitution situations. In his third season in 1972, with the imminent retirement of George Andrie, Toomay became the starter at right defensive end, although he was limited with a broken hand. The NFL didn't start recognizing quarterback sacks as an official statistic until ; however, the Cowboys have their own records, dating back before the 1982 season. According to the Cowboys' stats, Toomay is unofficially credited for leading the team in 1973 with a total of 8 sacks (second on the team). He also had one interception and recovered one fumble. Toomay was considered a character and an intellectual during his time with the team. He was a member of the \\"Zero Club\\" which prided itself on performing behind the scenes. Their first rule, \\"Thou Shalt Not Seek Publicity,\\" kept their members (Toomay, Blaine Nye, and Larry Cole) out of the limelight. Although Toomay remained a starter in 1974, he shared playing time with Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones, the first overall selection of the 1974 NFL draft. That year Toomay was used mainly on running downs. During his five seasons with Dallas, Toomay was a productive and durable player (never missing a game) and was a part of two Super Bowl teams: runners-up in V and champions in VI. Buffalo Bills On July 19, 1975, after playing out his option in Dallas, Toomay was a free agent and signed with the Buffalo Bills. Dallas received a second round draft choice in 1977, that was eventually used in a deal package to draft running back Tony Dorsett. Toomay was the Bills' defensive MVP in 1975, but was involved in different controversial official calls, including being called for elbowing head lineman Jerry Bergman, which contributed to a loss against the Miami Dolphins (31‚Äì21), that ended Buffalo's playoff chances. At the end of the year, he was left unprotected for the 1976 NFL expansion draft. Through the years, there has been speculation that the publishing of his insider view in the book The Crunch, was the main reason behind this decision. In a Sports Illustrated \\"Where Are They Now?\\" article in 2014 about the winless 1976 Bucs, Toomay said of his book that it was \\"in retrospect, the kind of book you write AFTER your career is over, not while you're still playing.\\" Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected him from the Bills roster in the 1976 NFL expansion draft and he was the starter at right defensive end for their winless inaugural season (0‚Äì14), and he registered 49 tackles and 3 sacks. In a \\"worst to first\\" deal, the Bucs traded him to the reigning Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in July 1977, in exchange for a draft choice. Oakland Raiders The Oakland Raiders credited Toomay with a team leading 14¬Ω sacks in 1977. In 1978, he was credited with 5 sacks after seeing little playing time. Often used in obvious passing situations, he was known by fans as \\"Third down Pat.\\" He was released in August 1979, then returned and played that season, then retired, after having problems with his knee. Personal life Toomay published a series of books, including the novel, On Any Given Sunday. He also played the part of an assistant coach to Y. A. Tittle in the Oliver Stone film of 1999, Any Given Sunday. His father John (1922‚Äì2008) was , played professional basketball in the late 1940s, and was a two-star general in the U.S. Air Force.

The MCO appears throughout the year in about 60‚Äì70 concerts and performances. It consists of 45 musicians from 20 different nations. Its activities include concerts, opera projects, chamber music as well as CD recordings. Strong artistic links have been established with Daniel Harding (principal guest conductor 1998‚Äì2003, music director 2003‚Äì2008, principal conductor 2008‚Äì2011 and conductor laureate since 2011) and Claudio Abbado. The MCO has stable residencies in Ferrara (Ferrara Musica, founder: Claudio Abbado) and Lucerne (Lucerne Festival). The MCO's repertoire reaches from baroque to contemporary music. The MCO is a free financed orchestra without any state support. Friends and sponsors are needed to maintain the artistic life of the orchestra. Biography The Mahler Chamber Orchestra was founded in 1997 on the initiative of Claudio Abbado and a group of musicians from the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra who wished to continue to play together even after reaching the youth orchestra's age limit. The combined principles of artistic curiosity and the broadest possible spectrum of repertoire, both at the highest possible musical level, guided the ambitious ensemble in its founding and continue to shape its work today. The ensemble‚Äôs repertoire reaches from baroque to contemporary and includes everything from chamber music to symphonic programming, from operatic standards to world premieres. In order to maintain these high standards, collaboration with high-profile partners has been of particular importance from the very beginning, in the selection of soloists and conductors as well as concert promoters and venues. Alongside founder Claudio Abbado, Daniel Harding has been a determining figure in the development of the orchestra. Serving at first as principal guest conductor, Harding became music director in summer 2003, Principal Conductor in 2008 and Conductor Laureate in 2011. The orchestra also maintains close artistic relationships with its Artistic Partner Leif Ove Andsnes. Projects with noted specialists in particular techniques or repertoire also make up an important element of the orchestra‚Äôs program, strengthening its reputation as a multi-faceted ensemble. Baroque workshops, at which specialists instruct in historical performance practice, have been a part of the MCO‚Äôs schedule since 2004, and the MCO works regularly with experts in early or contemporary music, such as Reinhard Goebel or Jonathan Nott. The independently financed MCO is also unique in the flexibility of its organisational structure. The core of the MCO is made up of approximately 45 musicians of 20 different nationalities; additional musicians are engaged as needed. The ensemble comes together for single projects, composing itself according to the specific requirements of each individual program. This has led to the development of a cultivated and sensitive orchestral sound which has become the ensemble‚Äôs trademark. Rather than having a single fixed home base, the orchestra has residencies in various European cities, which provide rehearsal opportunities and often a launching point for worldwide tours. The Mahler Chamber Orchestra is orchestra-in-residence in Ferrara. Long-term contracts also connect the orchestra to the Lucerne Festival, where the orchestra has performed since 2003. The orchestra had its international breakthrough just a year after its founding with Mozart‚Äôs opera Don Giovanni, which premiered at the Festival International d‚ÄôArt Lyrique d‚ÄôAix-en-Provence in 1998 under the direction of Claudio Abbado and Daniel Harding. The ensuing world tour of this production not only brought the ensemble international acclaim, but also led to a residency contract with the Aix-en-Provence festival. Since then, the orchestra has collaborated on many notable and successful productions in Aix, including: The Turn of the Screw (Daniel Harding/Luc Bondy, 2001), Eugen Onegin (Daniel Harding/Irina Brook), The Love of Three Oranges (Tugan Sokhiev/Philippe Calvario, 2004), Cos√¨ fan tutte (Daniel Harding/Patrice Ch√©reau, 2005) and Written on Skin (George Benjamin/Martin Crimp, 2012.) A residency contract with Ferrara Musica was signed in 1998, providing for two concert series a year. In addition to opera projects with Claudio Abbado, concert series with MCO music director Daniel Harding and renowned guest conductors such as Christopher Hogwood, Philippe Herreweghe, Paavo J√§rvi, Murray Perahia and Vladimir Ashkenazy also take place here. Soloists such as Cecilia Bartoli, Martha Argerich, Christian Tetzlaff or Emanuel Ax join the orchestra for concert programs that serve to draw ever increasing attention to the orchestra both in Ferrara and on an international level. In its sixteen years, the MCO has recorded several prize-winning CDs. Discs recorded under the direction of Daniel Harding include: Don Giovanni, The Turn of the Screw (recipient of several awards, including the Choc de l‚Äôann√©e 2002), Haydn Cello Concertos with Gautier Capu√ßon (Choc du monde de la musique 2003, among others), Gustav Mahler‚Äôs Fourth Symphony in a recording received enthusiastically by the international press (all released by Virgin Classics) and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs Cello Concerto. The Deutsche Grammophon release of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique as conducted by Marc Minkowski received the Jahrespreis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik 2003. Recordings with founder Claudio Abbado have also been released by Deutsche Grammophon: Italian opera arias with Anna Netrebko, and works for oboe by Mozart and Lebrun with Albrecht Mayer. The live recording of Beethoven‚Äôs 2nd and 3rd piano concertos with Martha Argerich was honoured with a Grammy Award, and the recording of violin concertos of Stravinsky and Alban Berg with Kolja Blacher won a Diapason d‚ÄôOr. In 2013, the first album of the Beethoven Cycle with Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist and conductor was released, featuring Piano Concertos nos. 1 and 3, in February 2014, the second album cycle was released, featuring Piano Concertos nos. 2 and 4. The annual concerts at the Lucerne Festival (where the Mahler Chamber Orchestra performs not only as the core of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, but also in its usual formation in its own concerts), regular opera and concert projects at the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden and at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, chamber music series, invitations to high-profile European festivals and extensive tours to locations around the world - the list of activities grows ever longer. Daniele Gatti has been appointed artistic advisor of MCO starting from 27 May 2016.

A man of apparently dashing bearing, Douglas was with the Franco-Scots army when it unsuccessfully besieged Carlisle Castle in 1385, the defending Governor being Lord Clifford. He is recorded as there performing feats of valour and killing many Englishmen. According to Andrew of Wyntoun: :\\"A yhowng joly bachelere :Prysyd gretly wes off were, :For he wes evyr traveland :Qwhille be se and qwhille be land :To skathe his fays rycht besy :Swa that thai dred him grettumly\\" (Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland ix, c.21) Marriage Douglas certainly had gained his spurs by 1387 when he married Egidia (or Gelis) Stewart, princess of Scotland, a daughter of King Robert II. According to the Liber Pluscarden, Egidia Stewart's beauty was well renowned. Charles V of France had \\"sent a certain most subtle painter to do her portrait and portray her charms, intending to take her to wife.\\" But the King of France and all other of Egidia's admirers had lost out to the chivalric charms of Douglas. As part of her marriage portion went the lands of Nithsdale in south-western Scotland, Herbertshire in the county of Stirling and an annuity of ¬£300. Ireland Within his first year of marriage the young Nithsdale led a punitive raid against Irish raiders who had been troubling the tenantry of his father's Fiefdom of Galloway. In early summer 1388, with a party of 500 well prepared veteran men-at-arms he sailed into Carlingford Lough, landed outside the town and summoned their leaders. The chief of the townsfolk offered a sum for a temporary truce, to which Nithsdale agreed. Secretly the townsfolk sent off to Dundalk for reinforcements, with which they were obliged. 800 spearmen from Dundalk surprised the Scots camp by night, and were supported by a sortie from Carlingford town. The Scots, veterans of years of brutal Border warfare, drove the Irishmen off, captured the town and burnt it, seized the Castle and captured 15 ships in the harbour. En route back to Scotland Nithsdale \\"ravaged\\" the Isle of Man. Nithsdale's expeditionary force sailed back into Loch Ryan with enough time to participate in the raiding of Northern England that was to culminate in the Battle of Otterburn on 19 August, in which he fought with distinction.  Feuding, Crusading and Death The year after Otterburn a truce was called between Scotland and England. Nithsdale on a knightly quest for glory decided, about 1389, to join the Teutonic Knights, who were fighting the Lithuanians in Baltic region. Nithsdale had previously quarrelled with Lord Clifford, a former adversary at Carlisle and whose forebear had claimed Douglasdale under Edward I of England's oppression. While both were abroad, it is alleged that Clifford challenged Nithsdale to single combat, and that Douglas even went to France to obtain special armour for the fight. Clifford, however, died on 18 August 1391,Richardson, Douglas, Plantagenet Ancestry, Baltimore, 2004, p216: but Nithsdale is said to have kept their 'tryst', and whilst walking upon the bridge leading to the main gate at Danzig was \\"killed by the English\\".Maxwell v1, pp 127-8 The burghers of Danzig decided that \\"upon account of a signal service which the Douglas family did to this city in relieving it in its utmost extremities against the Poles, the Scots were allowed to be free burghers of the town\\". Subsequently, the stone fascia of the Hohe Thor (High Gate) was adorned with the coat of arms of this nobleman and for centuries it was commonly referred to as the Douglas Port or Douglas Gate, described as such as late as 1734.Fischer Th. A., The Scots in Eastern and Western Prussia, Edinburgh, 1903, p123-3 In 1391, Douglas was in the Baltic, and became involved in a brawl with Sir Thomas de Clifford, in which Douglas was killed.

City San Blas is a port and popular tourist destination, located about north of Puerto Vallarta, and west of the state capital Tepic, and three hours drive from Guadalajara. The town has a population of 8,707. Municipality The municipality had a population of 37,478 in 2005. The Islas Mar√≠as, the site of an infamous prison colony, are part of the municipality. History In 1768, the Bourbon Visitador Jos√© de G√°lvez decided to found the port of San Blas as a jumping off point for military expeditions to Sinaloa, Sonora, Baja California and Alta California.Priestley, Herbert Ingram. 1916. Jos√© de G√°lvez: Visitor General of New Spain (1765-1771). Berkeley: University of California. The military nature of San Blas distinguished it from the commercial port of Acapulco to the south. A subtext to the founding of San Blas may have been G√°lvez' desire to curtail tax evasion on trade with Asia out of Acapulco, which was controlled by businessmen of Mexico City.Trejo Barrajas, Den√≠, and Marie Christine Duggan. 2018. ‚ÄúSan Blas and the Californias: Hispanic Trade in the Northern Pacific Rim in a Time of Great Change‚Äù in Mains‚Äôl Haul, San Diego Museum of Maritime History. Both Acapulco and San Blas tied New Spain to Asia through Manila. G√°lvez also founded a shipyard in San Blas, with the next shipyard being Cavite in the Philippines. From 1774, navy ships delivered mail from San Blas to Manila. By tradition, the crew could carry private merchandise, so there was a small commercial subtext to San Blas from its inception Pardo Hern√°ndez, Claudia Patricia (1994). San Blas y su relaci√≥n con Filipinas, 1790-1820. Trabajo de licenciatura en historia. Iztapalapa: Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana. In the 1790s, the Bourbon monarchy approved special permits for private ships to sail from Cadiz to San Blas.Trejo Barajas, Den√≠. 2006. ‚ÄúImplicaciones del comercio por el puerto de San Blas durante la guerra de Independencia,‚Äù Revista de Indias 66: 711-736. In 1801 and 1807, two ships of the Royal Philippine Company stopped in San Blas, though they were officially permitted only to sail to Lima.Vald√©s Lakowsky, Vera. 1987. De las Minas al Mar: Historia de la Plata Mexicana en Asia 1565-1934. Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica. It was not until crisis broke out in the Spanish Empire in 1810 that San Blas opened its ports to trade between Lima, Panama, San Blas, Guaymas, Monterey and Manila. Silver mined in Mexico's northwest was shipped out of San Blas to pay for imports of goods, particularly from Panama, which was flooded with British products that entered through Jamaica on the other side of the isthmus. At first, only two ships were assigned to the port: the packet ship San Carlos, commanded by Juan P√©rez, and El Principe, commanded by Vicente Vila. G√°lvez ordered four new vessels to be built, one of which was the schooner Sonora, later sailed in 1775 by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra to Alaska. In many ways, San Blas was a poor choice for a deep sea harbor and settlement. The harbor was so small that it could never hold more than four ships at a time. Silting caused by the nearby R√≠o Grande de Santiago resulted in the need for the harbor to be regularly dredged. The climate's stifling humidity and torrential rains from July to October, coupled with extensive mangrove swamps that surrounded the settlement, resulted in San Blas being plagued by clouds of voracious mosquitoes. A variety of sicknesses were endemic, including dysentery, typhoid fever, malaria, and other fevers. Naval officers and workers regularly complained about the climate. When Alessandro Malaspina visited in 1791, he found San Blas's climate so unhealthy that he refused to stay there, instead transferring his operations and some of San Blas' ships and personnel to Acapulco. San Blas's location was useful and logical, however, because it minimized travel time from Guadalajara and Mexico City without increasing the total distance to the Californias. Also, the area around San Blas had a plentiful supply of hardwoods useful for ship building and repair. Fresh water was also available year round. A hillside fort was built in 1770 to defend the town's sea trade with the Philippines. Its front has stone carvings of the kings of Spain. On the hill behind the fort are the ruins of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, built in 1769. The ruins once contained the bronze bells that are said to have inspired Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, \\"The Bells of San Blas\\". The ruins of a 19th-century customs house are on Calle Benito Ju√°rez, three blocks from the main plaza. During the colonial period, hardwood forests provided the raw materials for ships that did a brisk trade with the Philippines and the Manila galleon until the shipping moved to the port at Manzanillo, and later to Acapulco. San Blas and California Spain's colony in California was supplied by two supply ships out of San Blas which arrived once a year. on March 12, 1768 Jun√≠pero Serra, Father President of the California Missions, departed for California on the locally built barque Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n. On March 16, 1775, the San Carlos was set to depart San Blas, Mexico, for San Francisco Bay, stopping in Monterey to unload supplies for the mission there. The vessel was a product of the shipyard established on the Santiago River. Her length was 58 feet, the officers and men numbered 30. San Blas and Nootka San Blas also became the base for Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest. The Chinese were willing to pay up to $120 per otter hide (about $2,700 in 2019 dollars) which stimulated exploration of the Northwestern Pacific. From 1789 to 1795, San Blas was responsible for establishing and maintaining the Spanish post at Nootka Sound and Fort San Miguel. For about twenty years in the late 18th century, San Blas was one of the busiest ports and shipbuilding centers on the Pacific coast of the Americas, rivaling Acapulco, the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific Manila galleon convoy. A dock in San Blas At its height, the town had 30,000 inhabitants and became headquarters of Spain's General of the Southern Seas. Yaqui deportations During the 1900s, San Blas served as the arrival port for thousands of Yaqui men, women and children forcibly removed from their lands and sold into slavery.Turner, John Kenneth, Barbarous Mexico, Chicago: C.H. Kerr & Co., 1910, pp. 41‚Äì77 At San Blas, these families were forcibly marched 200 miles to San Marcos and its train station. Those who did not die on the march were sold into slavery at San Marcos, where they were deported to the sugar cane plantations in Oaxaca, the tobacco planters of the Valle Nacional, and the henequen plantation owners of the Yucat√°n for use as slave labor. Most of the enslaved workers died within the first year of their captivity. ClimateRecreation and tourism The area is noted for its surfing. Playa de Matanchen was famous for having the longest surfable wave in the world, as listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. A hurricane and subsequent storm surge filled part of the bay with sand, greatly reducing the size of the waves. The area has an abundance of migratory birds in the surrounding estuaries and lowland palm forests, attracting significant numbers of birders.

The flow of gameplay cycles between expository cut scenes revealing the plot, towns and menus for procurement and management of items and equipment, and battles which pit the playable characters against computer controlled opponents in battle maps. Progression through Black/Matrix is plot-driven, and the player has limited influence on the overall course of the game - evidenced by the absence of an overworld map mode. The gameplay in Black/Matrix is broken into chapters based on plot themes,RPGFan Reviews - Black/Matrix RPGFan.

The visual style of the cut scenes varies based on version; Black/Matrix and Black/Matrix + use the same graphical style seen in town and battlefield maps, while Black/Matrix AD employs visual novel style static landscapes with large character sprites superimposed over them. Regardless of form these scenes announce events such as the addition of new playable characters, and occasionally offer the player opportunities to recruit optional characters such as white-wing slaves and, depending on the version, unused master characters. Battle mechanics Battles are organized into turns which alternate between the player and the computer. During the player turn any player-controlled character can perform actions in any order, with a maximum of three actions per character per turn. Every character can use the actions \\"move\\", \\"attack\\", and \\"item\\", though depending on the character and the point in the game, they may have others actions as well. The move action allows a character to travel on the map; battlefield maps are composed of square tiles and the number of tiles in a given character's range is determined by their statistics. Characters have a single preset attack technique and can equip any type of weapon appropriate to that technique; for example, a character with the \\"stab\\" attack type can equip rapiers, spears, and staffs. Additionally, characters automatically respond by counterattacking, defending, or attempting to dodge when they are attacked; the player can switch the response at any time through the \\"Waiting Stance\\" command. Specific, plot-determined characters have access to the \\"magic\\" command at all times, while others require special equipment to unlock it. Spell effectiveness varies from turn to turn, as governed by a \\"Biorhythm\\" clock.GameFAQs: Black/Matrix (SAT) FAQ/Walkthrough by Oogami. (2001) Retrieved on 2008- April 5. In place of conventional magic points to manage magic use, Black/Matrix uses a system called \\"Blood Points\\". Blood Points can be distributed to individual playable characters before battles to expend in spell casting. Blood points are accrued by attacking the prostrate bodies of defeated enemies, effectively killing them. (Some fallen playable characters are susceptible to the same fate, after which they are lost permanently.) Additionally, the player can infuse a weapon with Blood Points to improve its effectiveness and possibly unlock a special attack called a \\"latent ability\\". Latent abilities function like spells in that they cost Blood Points to use and add various effects to the damage dealt by the weapon. At the conclusion of each battle the game evaluates the player's performance and assigns a letter grade-based rank, which determines the value of bonus items and the amounts of money and experience points the player is awarded. Experience points go into a common pool and the player distributes it to the characters at will, choosing which characters gain experience levels. Upon level-up, the player also determines how a given character's statistics mature, allowing for customization.

He became just the third freshman in Falcons' history to lead the team in scoring. After two successful seasons, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the third round, 79th overall, of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Following his junior season, Matsumoto began working out with the Flyers' AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms.

Four months later Matsumoto made his NHL debut on November 1 against the Flyers. Matsumoto scored his first NHL goal on November 3, 2010 against Rick DiPietro of the New York Islanders. The game was also his first multi-goal game in the NHL, as he added a second goal in the third period.

These forms of English are sometimes considered as a pidgin if they have derived in a context where more than one language is used. Under the most commonly accepted definition of the term, broken English consists of English vocabulary grafted onto the syntax of a non-English speaker's native language, including word order, other aspects of sentence structure, and the presence or absence of articles in the speaker's native language. Typically, the non-English speaker also strips English phrases of linguistic markings that are definite articles or certain verb tenses. In some communities, young people may intentionally adopt versions of the English language that older people consider to be broken English. This has been documented, for example, among the MƒÅori of New Zealand, where the younger generation was more proficient in English than the previous generation, but intentionally made modifications to the language to assert their own sense of cultural identity.Raymond Hickey, Standards of English: Codified Varieties Around the World (2012), p. 347. In literature, broken English is often used to depict the foreignness of a character, or that character's lack of intelligence or education. However, poets have also intentionally used broken English to create a desired artistic impression, or as a creative experiment writing somewhere between standard English and a local language or dialect.Peter France, The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation (2001), p. 34. For example, in Henry V, William Shakespeare used broken English to convey the national pride of Scottish and Irish allies in the King's invasion of Normandy.Paula Blank, Broken English: Dialects and the Politics of Language in Renaissance Writings (2002), p. 136. When Henry himself last implores the French Princess Katherine to marry him, knowing that her command of the English language is limited, he says to her: \\"Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English.\\"Paula Blank, Broken English: Dialects and the Politics of Language in Renaissance Writings (2002), p. 167, quoting Henry V, Act V, scene ii.

It was originally produced by Gilbey's, a Dublin spirits merchant using distillate sourced from Jameson's Bow Street Distillery. In the 1980s, the brand was purchased by Irish Distillers, the producer of Jameson Irish whiskey. It is the largest selling single pot still Irish whiskey in the world. As of 2020, there are six variants available: Redbreast 12 Year Old, Redbreast 12 Cask Strength, Redbreast 15 Year Old, Redbreast 21 Year Old, Redbreast Lustau Edition (matured for its final year in Bodegas Lustau sherry casks) and Redbreast 27 Year Old (New addition since March 2020). update 2020 named best whiskey in the world  History  W&A; Gilbey was founded in London in 1857. By 1861, the company had opened a branch on what is now O'Connell Street in Dublin. At the time, it was customary for distilleries to sell distillate to wine merchants or \\"bonders\\", who had ample supplies of casks through the importation of fortified wines and would mature the whiskey themselves under bond. By the 1870s, Gilbey's ‚Äì described as a \\"wine importer and distiller\\" at the time ‚Äì had more than 300,000 gallons of whiskey from Dublin distilleries in stock under bond and sold whiskey to consumers under its own labels. These whiskeys were aged at least six years in Gilbey's own sherry casks at its bonded warehouses on Dublin's Harcourt Street. By 1903, a whiskey known as John Jameson & Sons Castle \\"JJ Liqueur\\" Whiskey 12 Year Old was marketed in a bottle of similar shape and markings to those used for subsequent bottlings of Redbreast. This whiskey was produced using distillate sourced from the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin, the home of Jameson whiskey. Although this whiskey was likely the forerunner of Redbreast, the first official mention of \\"Redbreast\\" only dates back to 1912, when Gilbey's referred to the sale of \\"Redbreast\\" J.J. Liqueur Whiskey 12 Year Old. \\"Redbreast\\" was a nickname given to one of the whiskeys by Gilbey's chairman at the time, who was an avid birdwatcher, in reference to Robin Redbreast. In 1968, Irish Distillers opted to phase out the supply of bonded whiskey to merchants such as Gilbey's. This threatened the future of the whiskey brand, as Irish Distillers controlled all the whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland at that point. However, following pleas from Gilbey's, Irish Distillers agreed to continue to supply distillate for the production of Redbreast. In 1971, Irish Distillers closed all its Dublin distilleries (including Bow Street) and consolidated production at the New Midleton Distillery, a purpose-built facility in County Cork. As a result, production of Redbreast whiskey moved from Dublin to Cork. In 1985, Gilbey's ceased production of Redbreast. It entered into an agreement to sell the brand to Irish Distillers in 1986, and the brand was subsequently relaunched in 1991 after several years of absence from the market. Initially launched as a standalone 12 year old, Redbreast has since been released in 15 year old, 21 year old, and other variants.Bottle of 12-year old Redbreast  Bottlings  Initially relaunched in 1991 as a 12 year old, several variants have been marketed in recent years, including: * Redbreast 12 Year Old, 40% ABV, aged in Olorosso sherry casks and some ex-Bourbon barrels * Redbreast Lustau Edition, 46% ABV, aged for 9 to 12 years in traditional Bourbon and sherry casks before being finished for one year in first fill sherry butts seasoned with Bodegas Lustau sherry * Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength, 57.2% ABV, aged in first fill Olorosso sherry casks and non-chill filtered * Redbreast 15 Year Old, 46% ABV, aged in Olorosso sherry and Bourbon casks * Redbreast 21 Year Old, 46% ABV, aged in ex-bourbon and first fill Olorosso sherry casks Limited editions that are no longer in production but potentially still available through specialist retailers (as of 2016) include: * Redbreast Mano a L√°mh, 46% ABV, aged solely in ex-Olorsso sherry butts and non-chill filtered * Redbreast 12 Year Old 1970s, 40% ABV, a rare version bottled in the 1970s * Redbreast 1999 Single Cask, 58.5% ABV, aged in sherry casks, the first single cask Redbreast release * Redbreast 12 Year Old Gilbeys 1/2 Bottle, 40% ABV, a rare version likely bottled in the 1960s  Accolades  The Redbreast whiskey variations have won several awards in recent years. * 2019, Gold Medal San Francisco World Spirits Competition. * 2019, Winner Ultimate Spirits Challenge. * 2018, Gold Medal International Wine and Spirits Competition. * In 2007, Redbreast 15 Year Old was named Irish Whiskey of the Year. In addition, Redbreast 12 Year Old and Redbreast Mano a L√°mh were both rated as top-ten whiskey buys in John Hansell's Buyer's Guide.  Notability  Redbreast is one of a handful of single pot still whiskeys in existence today and one of only two to have been produced almost continuously since the early 1900s (the other being Green Spot). Although once the most popular style of whiskey consumed in the world, pot still whiskey fell out of favor in the 20th century, due in part to the rise of cheaper, less intense blended whiskeys. As a result of falling demand, most Irish whiskeys were either reformulated as blends or discontinued. Single pot still whiskeys, which are historically unique to Ireland, are similar to single malts in that they are produced solely from pot still distillate. However, in contrast to malts which only use malted barley in the mash, single pot still whiskeys are produced from a mixed mash that contains both malted and unmalted barley.

At the 2011 census, Kettering had a population of 984.Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 Census QuickStats History The area was explored by Bruni D'Entrecasteaux in 1792 and was settled in the early 19th century by timber cutters, whalers and sealers. Life was hard and the people who lived in the area rarely settled for long preferring the life in Hobart Town to the whaling stations and logging camps. It was just north of Kettering in Oyster Cove that the last Tasmanian Aboriginal settlement was established in 1847. Aborigines from all over Van Diemen's Land had been rounded up some years earlier and isolated on Flinders Island. In 1847 the remnants, now only 44 people, were taken to a reserve at Oyster Cove. By 1855 there were only 16 people left and by 1869 only Truganini remained. She died in 1876 but it was not until 1976 that her ashes were thrown to the winds on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Little Oyster Cove Post Office opened on 19 October 1868 and was renamed Kettering in 1892. Geography and environment The Kettering region, although sheltered by Bruny Island is increasingly subject to foreshore erosion, communities in some areas have decided to sandbag sections of coast to reduce the effects.Flora Fox, Flora Fox, News and Information about Southern Tasmania 2011 Today Today the area is noted for its orchards (apples, cherries, pears) and Kettering has become an important service centre for the local farmers. Like so much of the area south of Hobart, both towns have become centres for commuters and alternative lifestyle dwellers who find the peacefulness suits them. These tiny settlements are now the focus of marine activities. Kettering is the centre for fishing in the region. It has two major marinas, South Haven Marina and Oyster Cove Marina, as well as many smaller, privately owned jetties. Approximately 400 boats are located in Kettering whether on moorings or in marinas. The Bruny Island Ferry, Mirambeena, runs from Kettering numerous times a day. Kettering has a thriving community involved in many artistic pursuits. There are many artists and crafts people living in Kettering and the Southern Channel. 2008 saw a local production of Under Milk Wood, presented as a radio play in the local Community Hall which was very successful. It also was at the centre of the 2008 Art Trail an event which included 3 exhibitions and 9 artists' studios opened to the public. The success of the initial experiment led to the 2010 Art Trail. The local Kettering Music Group have been organising 4 or 5 chamber music concerts a year, now known as the Kettering Concerts and a Jazz in July concert since 2004. The next Art Trail is planned for August 2012. In July/August 2016, Kettering was the filming location of the 15 million dollar TV series, The Kettering Incident, which aired on Foxtel and BBC. At the 2016 Australian federal election the Kettering booth recorded a 32% Liberal vote, 31% Labor vote and 27% Greens vote, with the remainder going to the Arts and Christian Democratic parties. Features and services * General supplies and petrol are available at Kettering Central. * The Oyster Cove Inn is a mansion built in the 1930s. A major refurbishment undertaken in 2009 has restored it to its original glory. The Inn sits at the head of Little Oyster Cove and has superb views over Oyster Cove Marina to the bay and Bruny Island. * The Kettering Oval is used throughout the summer mainly for Cricket but also for events such as The Taste of the Huon which showcases some of the Channel and Huon Valley's finest food and wine. * Kettering has a Post Office owned by Australia Post and run locally by Rose and Mike Larner as part of the Kettering Central Complex. This consists of the Kettering LPO, General Store and take away, DVD hire, UNITED fuel and gas, local Butcher and The Cove hair salon. * Kettering has two caf√©s, the Mermaid Caf√© situated next to the Bruny Island Ferry Terminal and Pasha's located halfway along Ferry Road specialising in Turkish cuisine.

Bunz played at California State University, Long Beach and Oakmont High School before being drafted in the first round of the 1978 NFL Draft by the 49ers. He had a small role in the 1979 movie North Dallas Forty. He has been teaching physical education at Sutter Middle School, in Sacramento, California for over 22 years.  The Stop  In Super Bowl XVI (January 24, 1982), Bunz made one of the most famous tackles in NFL history. On a critical 3rd-and-Goal from the 1-yard line, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson passed to Charles Alexander in the right flat, but Bunz came up fast, grabbed Alexander around the waist, and hurled him backward before he could break the plane of the goal line. Had Bunz tackled Alexander low, his momentum certainly would have carried him into the end zone. Known as \\"The Stop\\", the play was followed by another stop on 4th down, slowing Cincinnati's comeback and ultimately propelling the 49ers to their first Super Bowl title.  Personal life  Bunz is a lifelong Placer County resident who grew up in Roseville with his older siblings Ben and Dennis. He retired from the Detroit Lions at age 30 after a contract dispute, and became a teacher at Sutter Middle School in Sacramento. He and his wife own a farm on the Placer County Wine Trail. In 1984 Bunz opened Bunz & Company restaurant and sports bar in his hometown of Roseville, California. He sold the restaurant in 1999, and it closed in the summer of 2012.

Porteranthus) is a genus of two species of perennial herbs in the family Rosaceae. Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, Indian-physic, American ipecac. This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America. Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger lower leaves are divided into palmately arranged leaflets. Plants bloom in May, June, or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp as if they were wilted. The flowers mature into small capsules. These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used in herbal medicine. Classification and name Traditionally this genus is considered to be related to Spiraea,Focke, W.O. 1894. Rosaceae. In Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien nebst ihren Gattungen und wichtigeren Arten insbesondere den Nutzpflanzen unter Mitwirkung zahlreicher hervorragender Fachgelehrten. Edited by A. Engler & K.

[using the name Maloideae for the subfamily now known as tribe Maleae]Potter, D., et al. (2007). Phylogeny and classification of Rosaceae. Plant Systematics and Evolution. 266(1‚Äì2): 5‚Äì43. [Referring to the subfamily by the name \\"Spiraeoideae\\"] Gillenia has a haploid chromosome number of 9, while Maleae have a haploid chromosome number of 17 (which was probably produced from a Gillenia-like ancestor by doubling the genome and then losing a chromosome). Flower structure and fossil evidence also point to Gillenia sharing distinctive features with the Maleae. Another similarity between Gillenia and Maleae is susceptibility to Phragmidium fungus. Differences between Gillenia and Maleae include the chromosome number and the latter being solely woody pome bearing plants, while Gillenia is herbaceous and has a dry follicular fruit. The name Porteranthus (Britton ex Small), named for Thomas Conrad Porter, has sometimes been used for this genus. The name Gillenia was thought to be already occupied by Gillena, a very similar name used by Michel Adanson as a synonym for Clethra (under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants \\"names that are so similar that they are likely to be confused\\" should be treated as homonymsICN 2011 Melbourne Code Art. 53.3-5). However, a proposal to formally conserve Gillenia was mooted after it was determined that Gillena was not validly published and a vote at the International Botanical Congress decided that it and Gillenia were not likely to be confused. Thus, Gillenia is the correct name (and Porteranthus was validly published but is superfluous and illegitimate Art. 52.1). Species The two similar species can be distinguished by their stipules. In G. stipulata, the stipules at the base of the leaves, which are round and deeply toothed, persist throughout the life of the plant. In G. trifoliata the long slender stipules are quickly deciduous, this species also tends to have longer leaves and petals. *Gillenia trifoliata or Porteranthus trifoliatus‚Äîmountain Indian physic, Bowman‚Äôs root *Gillenia stipulata or Porteranthus stipulatus‚ÄîIndian physic Images Image:Gillenia trifoliata0.jpgGillenia trifoliata flowers Image:Gillenia fruit.jpgMature fruit, an aggregate of follicles ReferencesExternal links *USDA PLANTS Database: Gillenia *Plants for a Future database: Gillenia Category:Amygdaloideae Category:Rosaceae genera Category:Medicinal plants ","title":"Gillenia"},{"id":"10079125","text":"War of the Ring is a fictitious military conflict in J.

A bag in the hole scores 3 points, while one on the board scores 1 point. Play continues until a team or player reaches or exceeds the score of 21 by means of cancellation scoring.  Rules and regulations = Equipment and court layout  Cornhole matches are played with two sets of bags, two boards and two to four players. There are four bags to a set. Each set of bags should be distinguishable from the other; different colors work well. The American Cornhole League's rules call for double-seamed fabric bags measuring and weighing Although bags used to be filled with corn kernels (hence the name Cornhole), bags are nowadays usually filled with plastic resin or another material that will maintain a consistent weight and shape. Bags are usually dual sided, with each side of the bag being a different material that reacts faster or slower on the board. Faster bags are preferred in humid conditions where bags will not slide as readily. Additionally, professional players may use different materials depending on their personal throwing styles. Players with a lower, harder, throw may use more rotation and a slower bag material. Players with higher, softer throws may throw with less rotation and prefer a more reactive bag. Each board is , with a hole centered from the top. Each board should be angled with the top edge of the playing surface above the ground, and the bottom edge above the ground. A regular court places the holes apart, or between the bottoms of the platforms. Shorter distances can be used when younger players are participating or there is not sufficient room. Bags are tossed from the pitcher's box, which is the rectangular area directly to the left or right of a platform. The bottom of the platform forms the foul line.  Gameplay  Cornhole being played during a pre-game tailgate party at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce‚Äî note that the player behind the board is not conforming to current rules for official gameplay because she is not in either pitcher‚Äôs box. Cornhole matches are broken down into innings or frames of play. During each frame, every player throws four bags, alternating teams between each throw. A player must deliver the bag from either the left or right pitcher's box, and remain in that designated pitchers box for the duration of the game in doubles or crew (in crew, each player will only throw 2 bags, however). In singles play, a player will throw from both the right and left pitcher's box during the game as the players walk down to retrieve their bags in their designated lane. At no time will opponents throw from the same pitcher's box during a frame. Players may not step over the foul line or outside of the pitcher's box while pitching. Each player must deliver the bag within twenty seconds. The time starts when the player steps onto the pitcher's box with the intention of pitching. The player who scored in the preceding frame pitches first in the next frame. If neither player scores, the player who pitched first in the preceding inning pitches first in the next inning. Note: No foot can land past the front of the board until the bag leaves the hand, otherwise the point does not count. A typical cornhole board, with two colors of bag Cornhole can be played as singles, doubles, or crew format (4 players to a team). In doubles play, four players split into two teams. One member from each team pitches from one board and the other members pitch from the other. The first side of players alternate pitching bags until both players have thrown all four of their bags, then the players pitching from the opposing cornhole board continue to alternate in the same manner until all four of their bags are delivered and the inning or frame is completed. In singles play, two players play against each other. Delivery is handled in the same manner as doubles play. Both contestants pitch from the same cornhole board and alternate their pitches until all of their bags have been pitched, completing the inning or frame. In crew format, each end of the board consists of two players from each team, with eight total players (4 per team). Players will throw two bags each per frame, still in alternating fashion.  Scoring  In order to score, the bags must either be tossed into the hole or land on the board. A bag that falls through the hole is worth three points. The bag can be tossed directly into the hole, slide into the hole, or be knocked into the hole by another bag. A bag that lands on the board and is still on the board at the end of the inning is worth one point. If a bag touches the ground and comes to rest on the board, it is removed from the board prior to continuation of play and not worth any points (commonly referred to as a \\"dirt bag\\"). Scoring is done by cancellation (e.g., if Team A scores 12 points in the frame and Team B scores 10 points in the frame, Team A is awarded 2 points). Play continues until a player or team reaches or exceeds 21 points. In the common version of cancellation scoring, the total score for each team for the inning is totaled each round, and then the difference of the two scores is awarded to the team with the higher score. It is thus only possible for one team to score points each inning. For example, if one team lands two bags in the hole and one on the board for 7 points, and the other team lands one bag in the hole and two on the board for 5 points, 5 points from the round would cancel out, and the first team would thus score 2 points. Because only one team can score points in each frame, it is impossible for both teams to reach or exceed 21 points in the same inning, and therefore ties are impossible. A cornhole match is played until the first player or team reaches 21 points at the completion of an inning. The winning team does not need to win by two or more points. Gameplay strategy varies by player and skill level. At the professional level, players can easily slide all 4 bags into the hole if no bag blocks the path. Defensive strategies are often employed to slow down game play or force opponents to make difficult decisions, such as throwing a blocker bag that rests in front of the hole. This forces an opponent to either slide through the blocker bag to reach the hole, throw another blocker behind the bag, or attempt a riskier airmail shot over the bag (throwing directly into the hole without touching the board). An uncommon version of scoring also includes a 2-point option. A bag is worth 2 points if it is on the board and hanging over the hole, but has not fallen through the hole. This version of game play disincentives aggressive game play and riskier airmail shots. Other unofficial scoring variations require one team to earn exactly twenty-one points to win. If a team's score exceeds 21 after any inning, the result differs among various house rules. Options include that the team must return to fifteen points, that the team must return to their prior score, that the team must return to their prior score and deduct one point from that score, and that the team must return to their prior score and deduct from that the number of points they scored in the most recent inning. In some variations, if a team's score goes over 21 three times before their opponents reach or exceed 21, they win the match.  History  The game described in Heyliger de Windt's 1883 patent for \\"Parlor Quoits\\" displays most of the features of the modern game of \\"cornhole\\", but with a square hole instead of a round one. Quoits is a game similar to horseshoes, played by throwing steel discs at a metal spike. De Windt's patent followed several earlier \\"parlor quoits\\" patents that sought to recreate quoit game-play in an indoor environment. His was the first to use bean-bags and a slanted board with a hole as the target. He sold the rights to the game to a Massachusetts toy manufacturer that marketed a version of the game under the name \\"Faba Baga\\". Unlike the modern game, which has one hole and one size of bags, a \\"Faba Baga\\" board had two different-sized holes, worth different point values, and provided each player with one extra-large bag per round, which scored double points. In September 1974, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article written by Carolyn Farrell about a similar game called \\"Bean-bag Bull's-eye\\".Popular Mechanics, September 1974, page 138 available online at https://books.google.com/books?id=DNUDAAAAMBAJ&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Bean-bag bull's-eye was played on a board the same width of modern cornhole boards (24\\"), but only 36\\" long as opposed to the 48\\" for cornhole. The hole was the same diameter (6\\") but was centered 8\\" from the back of the board as opposed to the 9\\"-center of cornhole boards. Each player threw two bags, weighing 8 ounces each, \\"in succession.\\" In cornhole, the players alternate throwing 4 bags, each weighing 15.5-16.5 ounces. The boards in bean-bag bull's-eye were placed \\"about 30 ft. apart for adults, 10 ft. for kids.\\" Scoring was essentially the same as that used in cornhole (3 points for a bag in the hole, 1 point for a bag remaining on the board, and cancellation scoring). In the Chicago area, cornhole is often referred to as \\"bags.\\" The game spread in Chicago, Illinois, and the Northwest region of Indiana in the late 1970s and early 1980s, perhaps due to the Popular Mechanics article mentioned above. The game's popularity on Cincinnati's west side in the 1980s spread to surrounding areas in Kentucky and Southeast Indiana. The American Cornhole League (\\"ACL\\") was founded in 2015 by Stacey Moore. According to ACL's website, it promotes and develops cornhole as a sport on every level, created software and apps to manage cornhole leagues, tournaments, special events, and player development. The American Cornhole Organization (\\"ACO\\"), established in 2005 and headquartered in Milford, Ohio. As of August 1, 2019 ACO claimed on its website to be the \\"governing body for the sport of cornhole.\\" The American Cornhole Association (\\"ACA\\") is an organization whose sole mission is to help cornhole players enjoy the game of cornhole. According to its website, \\"[o]ne of the most important ways to achieve this goal is for people to have high-quality equipment to play on.\\" Accordingly, it appears that ACA is more focused on selling cornhole-related products and equipment than it is on being a sanctioning body of the sport; however, it does have its own rules and does sponsor events.  Variations  Smaller versions, with scaled-down board, bags, and holes are available for indoor and children's use from a variety of vendors.  Terminology  The following is a list of terms commonly used in cornhole: * Airmail: A bag that does not slide or bounce on the board but goes directly into the hole, usually over an opponent's blocker bag. * Back door, jumper Dirty Rollup: A cornhole that goes over the top of a blocker and into the hole. * Backstop: A bag that lands past the cornhole but remains on the board creating a backboard for a slider to knock into without going off the board. * Blocker: A bag that lands in front of the hole, blocking the hole from an opponent's slide shot. * Cornfusion: When players or teams cannot agree on the scoring of a given inning. * Cornhole or Drano: A bag that falls in the hole, which is worth three points. The alternative name is a reference to a trademark, that of a sink clog clearing product. * Cornholio: Same as grand bag or as just cornhole, depending on region; named for the alter-ego of the character Beavis in the animated TV series Beavis and Butt-Head. * Dirty bag: A bag that is on the ground or is hanging off the board touching the ground. * Frame: A single round or turn during which a player and opponent each throw 4 bags. * Four bagger: A sequence of a player making all four bags in the hole during a frame. There is a tradition in some areas where any social player who puts all four bags in the hole on a single turn gets to sign the board, often with some type of ceremony and recognition. * Flop or floppy bag: Type of toss that didn‚Äôt spin the bag horizontally or vertically. Without rotation or spin. * Hammer: When one or more hangers (see below) are around the hole, a so-called hammer can be used. A hammer is a bag thrown as an airmail bag with a high arch in an attempt to take hanger bags into the hole with it. * Hanger: A bag on the lip of the hole ready to drop. * Honors: The player or team who tosses first, resulting from the team scoring last or winning the coin toss before the first frame. * Hooker: A bag hitting the board and hooking or curving around a blocker and going in the hole. * Jumper: A bag that strikes another bag on the board causing it to jump up into the cornhole. * Shortbag: When a bag lands on the ground just before the cornhole board. * Skunk, whitewash or shutout: A game that ends in a 21‚Äì0 score or, by some unofficial rules, ends in an 11‚Äì0 score. * Slide, or slider: A bag that lands in front of the hole and slides in. * Swish: A bag that goes directly in the hole without touching the board. More often referred to as 'Airmail' * Wash: When each team has scored exactly the same number of points in an inning, thereby \\"washing out\\" all points scored in the inning. * Woody: Refers to any cornhole bag that has been pitched and remains on the cornhole board playing surface at the conclusion of the frame.

During his service as secretary, he witnessed the shifting of decision-making powers from the military departments to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a process that continued throughout the 1960s. He observed that the Air Force ought to investigate technologies that would have some bearing on future aerospace military operations, leading to \\"Project Forecast,\\" a study initiated in March 1963. Biography Zuckert was born in New York City. He attended public elementary and high schools in suburban New York, received preparatory education at the Salisbury School, Salisbury, Connecticut, and earned his bachelor of arts degree from Yale University in 1933. Zuckert entered the combined Yale Law School-Harvard Business School course sponsored by William O. Douglas, who later served on the Supreme Court. That course, a pioneer experiment by Yale and Harvard, supplemented legal training with administration to foster an awareness of the business problems of clients. After graduation, Zuckert became a member of both the Connecticut and New York Bars. He later became a member of the Bar in the District of Columbia. In 1940, he became an instructor in government and business relations at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, and later he became an assistant dean. While at Harvard he also served as a special consultant to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces in developing statistical controls. In 1944 Zuckert entered the US Navy as a lieutenant and worked in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, where he was assigned to the service's inventory control program. In September 1945 he was released from the Navy to become executive assistant to the administrator, Surplus Property Administration, under W. Stuart Symington. When Symington became assistant secretary of war for air in February 1946, Zuckert became his special assistant. With the passage of the National Security Act in 1947 and Symington's subsequent appointment as the first secretary of the Air Force, Zuckert took the oath as assistant secretary of the Air Force. His principal duties were in the field of management. He helped institute Symington's program of \\"Management Control Through Cost Control,\\" an initiative to place the U.S. Air Force on a business-like basis, using accepted industrial practices as a yardstick for establishing Air Force procedures. Zuckert represented the Air Force in the formulation of the fiscal 1950 budget, the first joint Army-Navy-Air Force budget in U.S. history. The accomplishment that Zuckert considered his most professionally satisfying stemmed from President Harry S. Truman's 1948 directive requiring the armed services to abolish segregation. Working with Lieutenant General Idwal H. Edwards, head of Air Force personnel, Zuckert oversaw implementation of the integration program. In addition, Zuckert served as the Air Force member of the Interservice Committee created by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal to develop a Uniform Code of Military Justice for the Department of Defense. Remaining in the secretariat after Thomas K. Finletter succeeded Symington as secretary, Zuckert was charged with handling the \\"highly controversial and vexatious problem of the civilian components, including the reserves and the Air Force National Guard.\\" As Finletter concentrated more on larger issues, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and nuclear weapons development, Zuckert dealt with the daily operations of the office. When he left his position as assistant secretary in February 1952 to become a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, he left an Air Force cost-control system that had established a new high point in sound business administration within the military establishment, and he had secured a personal reputation as one of the top-flight, younger career officials in government. In December 1960, Robert S. McNamara, President-elect John F. Kennedy's designee for secretary of defense, recommended to Kennedy that Zuckert be appointed Air Force secretary. Zuckert was nominated and confirmed in January 1961. With nearly six years of Air Force experience, Zuckert was better prepared for and more knowledgeable about the secretariat and its organization than any previous appointee. Zuckert was involved in controversies associated with the XB-70, AGM-48 Skybolt, and the TFX (later the F-111) weapon systems, and with direct participation in the war in Vietnam. Both he and Air Force Chief of Staff General Thomas D. White opposed the administration's decision to cut the XB-70 bomber. Zuckert later admitted that he erred in promoting the bomber because of its increasing vulnerability to enemy defenses. The TFX was a tactical fighter-bomber designed and built for both the Air Force and the Navy. In negotiations over the development of that weapon, Zuckert supported the administration, which wanted the plane, against the Air Force, which did not. In so doing, he strained his relationship with the Air Force and lost a measure of the confidence it had placed in him. When the Skybolt missile was canceled in December 1962, Zuckert and the Air Staff were allied, as they had been during the XB-70 debate, against the secretary of defense and the administration. Zuckert often found himself to be the \\"man in the middle,\\" at times supporting the Air Force against the secretary of defense and the administration. Shortly after Zuckert left office in September 1965, the Air Force instituted the Zuckert Management Award, which is given annually in September to a general officer or high-level civilian for \\"outstanding management performance.\\" The award perpetuates Secretary Zuckert's commitment to sound and effective management within the Air Force. Zuckert himself attended every awards ceremony through 1998. Until his retirement in 1988, Zuckert practiced law, did consulting and was active in pursuing his long- standing interest in corporate governance. Over the years he served as a director of several small, technically oriented companies. On June 5, 2000, Eugene Zuckert died at the age of 88 of pneumonia complicated by a heart ailment.
