Wheatley means wheat fields in old English, located at the eastern end of the central ridge that runs through most of the town. The surrounding region was often flooded in the times before the River Don was rerouted and extra drainage channels dug, and lies on the old floodplain of the Don, which peaked at today's Thorne Road. Originally the suburb was part of the Wheatley ward of Doncaster but due to the expansion of housing during the post war era and boundary changes, the area became a separate area in its own right. History The 1930s saw the first houses built in what would become Wheatley Hills. Originally known as the Hills Lane Estate, it centred on The Grove with the eastern edge being marked by Boundary Avenue. Wheatley Hills reached its present size during the 1950s with the development of the Ennerdale Estate to the south of the original Hills Lane Estate, and the Greenleafe Estate east of Boundary Avenue. Sport North 1 East Rugby Union team, Wheatley Hills RUFC are named in conjunction with the suburb. They are based at Brunnel Road in the York Road Industrial Estate just outside Doncaster Town Centre. Notably the training ground is not actually in the Wheatley Hills area. The club was originally formed as Wheatley Secondary Modern Old Boys in the 1960s but very soon became an 'open club' still playing its home games at the school and using the nearby Wheatley Hotel as its headquarters. In the 1970s the club moved to the Pilkington Glassworks Recreation Ground and Social Club before acquiring its present site. Wheatley Hills Tennis Club lies on Greenhouse Road. Established in 1954, the club offers professional coaching to players of all ages.socialtennis.com - Wheatey Hills Tennis Club Retrieved 29 January 2011 The Wheatley Golf club lies nearby on Armthorpe Road. The course itself ranges in length, alongside Leger Way adjacent to the west of Wheatley Hills. Transport In 1902, Wheatley Hills was served by the Doncaster Tramway from the town to the terminus on Thorne Road. A trolleybus service in the 1950s became available further into the suburb when the tram service became defunct in the late 1920s to mid-1930s. Today, Wheatley Hills is well served by public transport links to Doncaster Town Centre.

They are frequently the subject of guides and seminars on how to make friends and/or meet people. Different situations may call for different openers (e.g. approaching a stranger on the street versus meeting them at a more structured gathering of people with like interests). An opener often takes the form of an open-ended question, which can lead to further comments or conversation as well as creating topics for future conversations (e.g. \\"How's your mandrill doing?\\"). A closed-ended question (e.g. \\"Nice weather today, isn't it?\\") is regarded as potentially less effective because it can be answered with a simple \\"Mm-hmm,\\" which is essentially a conversational dead end, requiring the initiater of the conversation to start from scratch.Media College: Open-Ended Questions How to Start a Conversation notes that in conversation openers, \\"There really are only two topics to choose from - The situation [or] the other person. Secondly, there are only two ways to begin a conversation: State a fact [or] ask a question/opinion\\".Persuasion Skills Ltd : How to Start a Conversation Accordingly, openers are often linked to props, e.g. \\"Do you have a cigarette?\\" \\"Wow, you're reading Crime and Punishment, that's one of my favorite books...\\" \\"I like your skirt, where did you get it?\\" etc. Many venues, such as singles tennis events, etc. are geared toward prop-based conversation openers. Some people keep conversation pieces for this purpose. Judy Ringer's We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations points out that an entirely different set of openers may be used for sensitive conversations, e.g. about employee performance, in which a main goal may be to avoid putting the person on the defensive.

Early life Elizabeth Fairburn was born at the Church Missionary Society (CMS) station at Kerikeri, New Zealand, in 1821. She was the daughter of Sarah Tuckwell and her husband, William Fairburn. In 1834 William Fairburn and his wife opened a mission station at Puriri in the Thames district. Their five children, Richard (aged 15), Elizabeth (13), John (11), Edwin (7), and Esther (5), remained at Paihia where they attended the CMS school conducted by Marianne Williams. Life with Colenso Elizabeth became fluent in MƒÅori, and in 1840, aged 19 years, was teaching MƒÅori children and young people at her father's mission station at Maraetai. When Bishop Selwyn visited the mission, he engaged Elizabeth to teach at St. John's College, which was then at the Waimate Mission. Here she met missionary and printer William Colenso. The pair married on 27 April 1843. Following Colenso's ordination as a deacon in September 1844 the couple, with their infant daughter Frances Mary (Fanny), established the Waitangi Mission at Ahuriri, Napier. In September 1845 Elizabeth went overland to the Rev. William Williams' mission station at T≈´ranga, Poverty Bay for the birth of her son Ridley Latimer (Latty). After several unhappy years of marriage, Elizabeth became aware that William was the father of Wiremu, a child born in 1850 to Ripeka Meretene, a member of the household. In November 1851 her husband was suspended as a deacon, and in 1852 was dismissed from the mission as the consequence of his adultery. Only after William's adultery became public knowledge in 1853 did the couple separate, though they never divorced. After her separation the CMS engaged Elizabeth to work as a teacher at the Kaitotehe Mission near Mount Taupiri in the Waikato. To England In 1860 the First Taranaki War broke out and the mission stations in the vicinity of the fighting were abandoned. Elizabeth took her two children, Fanny (17), and Latty (15), to England to finish their education, and settled in Tottenham, north London. In 1863, Hariata and Hare Pomare, members of a tour party of MƒÅori organised by Wesleyan lay preacher William Jenkins, stayed with the Colensos. On 26 October 1863 Hariata gave birth to Albert Victor, who was named after the Queen's deceased husband. On 4 December 1863 Elizabeth accompanied Hariata and Hare Pomare as interpreter on a visit to Queen Victoria. Having grown up speaking the MƒÅori language from a young age, Colenso helped oversee the publication in England of a MƒÅori language edition of the Old Testament, a lengthy undertaking which continued until the mid-1860s. She also helped prepare the revised New Testament for press, correcting the printed copy, and sometimes suggesting alternative translations. Later life in New Zealand and the Pacific Latty entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1866, and Elizabeth and Fanny left England in October of that year, returning to Auckland by early 1867. In 1869 Elizabeth started a school for MƒÅori children at the mission house at Paihia and kept it going until the end of 1875. At this time, Elizabeth travelled to Norfolk Island to help in the work of the Melanesian Mission, at the request of Bishop John Selwyn. Here, she translated Christian materials into the Mota language, which was chosen as the 'lingua franca' of the Mission. In 1879 Colenso visited New Zealand and travelled to ≈åtaki to see her daughter Fanny and son- in-law, William H. Simcox. In 1891 Elizabeth again visited New Zealand; this visit also included a visit to her family in ≈åtaki. In January 1895 Fanny moved to Norfolk Island. Elizabeth retired from mission life in 1898, at the age of 76, by which time she was suffering increasing pain from rheumatism. She lived to the age of 83, dying on 2 September 1904 at Forest Lakes, ≈åtaki. References Ross, C.

From the Rue de Rivoli, it stretches to the Rue du Mont Thabor. The hotel was opened in 1815. It received the \\"Palace\\" distinction from the French government in 2011. Le Meurice is owned and operated by the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel operator based in London. The hotel has a staff of over 400 and houses 160 rooms decorated in the Louis XVI style, which start at US$1,235 per night. History=Early years In the mid-18th century, the French postmaster, Charles-Augustin Meurice (born 1738), understood that English tourists wanted to be on the continent with the comforts and conveniences they were used to at home. In 1771, Meurice opened a coach inn on Rue Edmond Roche in Calais, the H√¥tel Meurice de Calais. In 1815, he opened the H√¥tel Meurice in Paris, originally located at 223 Rue Saint-Honor√©. Le Meurice offered everything to make life easier for the traveler; apartments of various sizes, areas set aside where travelers could sit and talk, specialty laundry soap, English-speaking staff, and currency exchange, among other amenities. The hotel advertised, \\"For an English traveler, no hotel in Paris offers more benefits than Le Meurice.\\" Hotel lobby In 1835, Le Meurice moved from Rue Saint Honore to its current location on the Rue de Rivoli, in a new luxurious building, close to the Tuileries Palace. A wealthy clientele followed, and during the July Monarchy to the French Third Republic, Le Meurice welcomed the high society of the time, who appreciated the quality of service, the refinement of the rooms and lounges, as well as the exceptional location of the hotel in the heart of Paris, near luxury boutiques. In the latter half of the 19th century, Henri- Joseph Scheurich was its proprietor and, in 1865, he is documented as managing the hotel under the London and Paris Hotel Company. He is mentioned again in 1867, at which time the hotel offered large and small apartments, or single bedrooms; and featured a reading room and smoking room. In 1891, the hotel had electric lights, new plumbing, and accommodated 200 guests; Scheurich was still the proprietor. Early 20th century In the early 20th century, one of the shareholders of the new company was Arthur Millon, owner of Caf√© de la Paix and restaurants Weber and Ledoyen. To compete with the Ritz, which opened in 1902, Millon turned to a great Swiss hotelier, Fr√©d√©ric Schwenter. Under these two men, Le Meurice was enlarged by the addition of the Metropole Hotel, located on Rue de Castiglione. Then, with the exception of the fa√ßade, the hotel was rebuilt under the guidance of the architect Henri Paul N√©not, winner of the Grand Prix de Rome. For interior decoration, especially for rooms on the ground floor, the Louis XVI style prevailed. The rooms were equipped with modern, tiled bathrooms, telephone, and electric butler bells. Public rooms were relocated and reinforced concrete was added for privacy, and the elevator was a copy of the sedan chair used by Marie Antoinette. Other additions included the grand salon Pompadour with white trimmings, a restaurant with marble pilasters and gilded bronzes as a living tribute to the Peace of Versailles, and the wrought iron canopy over the lobby. World War II Between September 1940 and August 1944, the hotel was requisitioned by the German occupation authorities. In August 1944, the Meurice became the headquarters of General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris. von Choltitz famously disobeyed Hitler's commands to level the city of Paris. Hitler's reported question screamed to von Choltitz over a Hotel Meurice telephone, \\"Is Paris burning?\\", later served as the title of a best-selling book about the liberation of Paris, and the 1966 film which was shot partly at the Meurice. Recent history 250px During its long existence, Le Meurice has experienced several transfers of ownership as well as major refurbishments: one from 1905 to 1907, the second in 1947 and most recently in 1998. Each of these renovations included modernization and beautification of the hotel. The Soci√©t√© du Grand H√¥tel, which also owned the nearby Le Grand Hotel and Hotel Prince de Galles, sold the three properties in 1972 to the Italian CIGA Hotels chain. CIGA then sold them in 1978 to Limnico, a subsidiary of Roger Tamraz's First Arabian Corporation. Limnico resold the properties just a year later, in October 1979, to Maxwell Joseph's UK-based Grand Metropolitan Hotels. When Grand Met bought Inter-Continental Hotels a year later, in 1981, they made the Meurice part of that chain. Grand Met sold the Meurice back to CIGA in 1984 for around US$100 million. CIGA was, by this point, controlled by the Aga Khan, the spiritual head of the Ismaili Muslim sect. In 1994, the Aga Khan, faced with extreme financial difficulties, sold the CIGA chain to ITT Sheraton, though he maintained ownership of the Meurice itself until 1997, when he sold the hotel to the Sultan of Brunei's Brunei Investment Agency, who made it part of the company's Dorchester Collection. The Meurice underwent another round of extensive renovation and restoration between 1998 and 2000. In 2007, Le Meurice began renovations under Philippe Starck and Franka Holtmann, General Manager. Its decor is in the style of Louis XVI. The renovations also included a campaign led by Jean-Loup Roubert and the architect Nicolas Papamiltiades, which changed certain areas of the building for technical reasons, with the creation of an underground infrastructure for heating and cooling, and for aesthetic purposes. New reception rooms have been created on the ground floor, while the main entrance was moved to Rue de Rivoli. Decorations, mosaics and moldings were the subject of extensive renovation by skilled craftsmen. The hotel is now owned and managed by the Brunei Investment Agency's Dorchester Collection. Le Meurice joined the collection in 1997 which includes nine other luxury hotels: The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, The Dorchester and 45 Park Lane in London, Coworth Park in Ascot, the H√¥tel Plaza Ath√©n√©e in Paris, the Principe di Savoia in Milan, Hotel Eden in Rome, and Le Richemond in Geneva. The French ministry of economy recognized Le Meurice with palace distinction in 2011 on the first official list of government-approved palaces in France. Restaurants and bars Le Meurice has two main restaurants. Restaurant le Meurice overlooks the Tuileries Garden and was run by 3 Michelin star chef Yannick All√©no until 2013 when he resigned and 3 Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse was named head chef. Restaurant Le Dali is situated under a 145 square metre (1560 square feet) canvas painted by Ara Starck, the daughter of Philippe Starck. It also has the cocktail bar Bar 228 with leather armchairs and dark woodwork furnishings. Notable patrons Salvador Dal√≠, pictured at the H√¥tel Meurice, spent about a month of each year over 30 years in the old Royal Suite Alphonse XIII. The hotel has accommodated numerous kings, sultans, and other eminent guests. Its location near the seat of government was one of the reasons prompting Miss Howard, mistress and patron of the future Napoleon III, to settle at Le Meurice during Napoleon's stay in the capital. The first monarch to have stayed at the new Meurice in Paris was King Alfonso XIII of Spain. When he was ousted in 1931, the fallen monarch sought refuge at the Meurice and set up the seat of his government in exile. Following him, the Prince of Wales, the kings of Italy, Belgium, Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Montenegro, the Shah of Persia, and the Bey of Tunis stayed at the Meurice. Business leaders such as Rockefeller, politicians like French President Gaston Doumergue, who sometimes dined with his wife Jeanne-Marie Graves, President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, Count Ciano, the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, Wilbur Wright, and others were well known guests. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor stayed at Le Meurice on their return from honeymoon in September 1937, and where they announced their intention to tour Nazi Germany later the same year. Salvador Dal√≠ spent about a month of each year over 30 years in the old Royal Suite, (spanning Rooms 106 and 108) which had been used by King Alphonse XIII. Others included Giorgio de Chirico, Rudyard Kipling, Edmond Rostand, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Paul Morand, Walter Lippmann, Yehudi Menuhin, Seiji Ozawa, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Pl√°cido Domingo. Past guests also include film stars and directors such as Franco Zeffirelli, Liza Minnelli, Fernandel, Mike Todd, Eddie Fisher, Ginger Rogers, Yul Brynner, Bette Midler, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The socialite Mata Hari stayed at Le Meurice on several occasions. The manager of the Meurice once even obtained a court order forcing Mata Hari to pay outstanding fees. In December 2006, the President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, after surgery at the military hospital of Val de Grace, continued his recovery at the Meurice. Housed in a presidential suite, the head of the Algerian state gave a television interview from there on 17 December; he left the Meurice on 31 December to return home. In 2011, Jay-Z and Kanye West recorded their hit \\"Niggas in Paris\\" at H√¥tel Meurice for the Watch The Throne album. In the media The hotel has been a setting for several films, including Is Paris Burning? (1966, Ren√© Cl√©ment), Julia (1977, Fred Zinnemann), The Blood of Others (1984, Claude Chabrol), Mata Hari (1985, Curtis Harrington), Angel-A (2006, Luc Besson), Notre univers impitoyable (2007, L√©a Fazer), Les Femmes de l'ombre (2008, Jean-Paul Salom√©), Demain d√®s l'aube (Denis Dercourt) and La folle histoire d‚Äôamour de Simon Eskenazy (Jean-Jacques Zilbermann) in 2009, Midnight in Paris (Woody Allen) and W.E (Madonna) in 2010 and Diplomacy in 2014.

Trained in Czechoslovakia, his films include Red Lotus, which was made in 1988 and is the last feature film made in Laos until more recent productions like Sabaidee Luang Prabang or Chanthaly. Since then, Som Ock has run a bakery in Vientiane to supplement his income while he tries to independently produce films. Biography Som Ock Southiphonh was among six Laotians selected in 1977 by the communist government of Laos to study filmmaking in Prague. Originally wanting to study law, filmmaking was not Southiphonh's first choice, but he agreed because he would get to travel abroad. He was enrolled in the Faculty of Film and Television, Academy of Arts and Music, at Charles University in Prague, where he studied cinematography under Jan Machane of Barrandov Studios. Southiphonh spent nine years studying in Prague, and was the only one of the six Laotian students to complete his training. During his time in Prague, he returned to Laos to film a 16-mm documentary, Country of a Million Elephants, which became has graduation film and was broadcast on Czech television. He returned to Laos for good in 1987 and began working for Lao National Television as a director and cameraman. The work involved producing what he called \\"tourist political\\" pieces about Luang Prabang. \\"It was not what I could call rewarding,\\" Southiphonh said in an interview. \\"After studying at a university, I wanted to use my skills to make something of better quality.\\" He soon changed jobs to work for the Lao State Cinematography Company, which employed several other Lao filmmakers who had studied in Russia, Bulgaria, Hungary, India, and Czechoslovakia. In 1987, Southipohn made two 35-mm films: a color documentary about the Communist Party Conference in Vientiane and a black-and-white docu-drama, Red Lotus or Bua Deng (Bua Daeng, Buadaeng, Bouadeng). Red Lotus is one of only two feature films made in Laos since 1975 (see also History of Laos since 1945). The other feature is the 35-mm color film, Gun Voice from the Plain of Jars, directed by Somchith Pholsena in 1983. The story of soldiers of the Second Battalion of the Lao People's Army, the film was never released due to the concerns of censors. The story of star-cross lovers in 1972, war-time Laos (the lead actress Somchith Vongsam Ang later married Southiphonh), Red Lotus was produced with a budget of US$5,000. \\"Red Lotus was very difficult to make because we had nothing, really nothing. The big problem in making such a film in Laos is that we didn't have money,\\" Southiphonh said. \\"We had to use a World War II-era Soviet camera that had a tendency to speed up at will and a cast that worked for nothing. I must confess that the budget and the 22-day schedule did not allow for much opportunity to shoot everything the way I wanted to.\\" Despite the difficulties, the film was screened in Laos, as well as the Soviet Union, Japan, Thailand and Cambodia, where it won a special jury prize at the First Southeast Asia Film Festival in Phnom Penh in April 1997. However, Southiphonh longed to make films independently, and he left the State Cinematography Company in 1989 with hopes of establishing his own video production company. \\"Money, however, was still a problem, so I did something which may be unique to the history of cinema: I started a bakery. My love of cinema was true, but I needed to earn money if I ever wanted to make films independently,\\" Southipone said. \\"Fortunately, the bakery, which I run with my wife, was successful, so after about five years of hard work, I had raised enough money to buy my first professional video camera.\\" Southiphonh formed Lao-Inter Arts, Inc., the first private production company in Vientiane. For the company's first production, Southiphonh chose to make a documentary film on the Lenetene people in remote Bokeo Province, and submitted his outline for a script-development competition held by Francophonie. He won US$16,000 and used it to complete the 26-minute video documentary, Lenetene's Spinning Tops, in 1993. The video was shown at the 1994 Jeux de la Francophonie, and was awarded a Medal of Merit. The film was also shown at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in 1995. Southiphonh has also completed another short documentary, The Lao Lamvong, about a Laotian traditional dance. Meanwhile, he has tried to complete another feature film, and has written a 120-page script for a drama film about friendship, tentatively titled Given Time (Kala Vela). But the Laotian market for films is too small and there is no funding for film projects available. \\"The only thing we can hope for is that through co-production, meaning 100% foreign financing and 100% Laotian talent, Laotian cinema can keep, at least momentarily, its artisans active until better days arrive,\\" Southiponh said. It is our hope that through our efforts, we can help build a domestic Laotian cinema culture, one that is independent and that captures the essence of Laos as a country, its people, and its deep-rooted culture and arts. Then I dream that when people praise recent Asian cinema, they will include Laos as well.

Its target demographic is the 30-54 age group. Triple M Adelaide is part of Southern Cross Austereo's Triple M Network and broadcasts on the 104.7 MHz frequency. Triple M Adelaide has in the past simply networked the majority of its shows from its Sydney and Melbourne counterpart stations, but since 2011 it has focussed more on local content.  History  5MMM had its origins as an AM radio station, commencing broadcasting as 5KA on 25 March 1927 on the frequency 1200 kHz. In 1941 the station and its repeater 5AU, along with interstate stations 2HD and 4AT, were closed by the Federal Government after allegations of fifth column activities. These stations were associated with the Jehovah's Witnesses, which opposed participation in the War, and had other doctrines seen as un-patriotic. In 1943 5KA was reopened after purchase by the Methodist Church, and became attached to the Central Methodist Mission, largely organised by Reverend Samuel Forsyth. The station changed frequency to 1197 kHz in 1978. In 1982, 5KA adopted a country music format and re-branded itself 12K. The format lasted only 8 months. In 1983, Adelaide's number one breakfast duo 'Bazz & Pilko' defected from rival station 5AD, bringing much of their audience with them and giving 5KA a huge ratings boost. Also in the mid 80's, 5KA converted to AM stereo and adopted a younger music format 'All hits all the time\\", resulting in even greater ratings success. In July 1986, 5KA was sold to Wesgo Limited and in late 1987 the station moved to brand new studios at 103 Currie Street in the Adelaide CBD. On 1 January 1990, 5KA became the first of two commercial AM radio stations in Adelaide to convert to the FM band. The station bid $5.5 million in a priced based allocation process the previous year for the FM licence. 5KA moved to the frequency 104.7 MHz and the AM frequency was relinquished. With the FM conversion, the 5KA call-sign was changed to 5KKA and the station was branded on-air as KAFM. The AM frequency was re-purposed and allocated to a community broadcasting licence, 5RPH. The former transmission equipment which was co-located with competitor 5AD at the time was handed over to the operators contracted to provide transmission facilities to 5RPH, but the infrastructure was effectively abandoned. In August 1993, Hoyts Media which owned the Triple M radio network in the eastern states bought KAFM but could not adopt the Triple M call-sign in Adelaide as a community radio station already had the call-sign 5MMM. Hoyts then paid 5MMM for the right to use the Triple M name. The community station 5MMM then converted to 5DDD, and KAFM was then free to change its call-sign to 5MMM and adopt the Triple M network brand, which was launched on January 1, 1994. With the merger of the Hoyts Triple M network into the Austereo Network, the station became a sister station to SAFM, and relocated to the ground floor of the building that was partly occupied by SAFM at the time. As of 2014, it had reverted to an active rock format comparable to similar formats in the eastern states. Digital radio Since September 27, 2014, Triple M is simulcast on Digital Radio in Adelaide. During AC/DC's 2010 Australian tour, Triple M aired High Voltage Radio, a \\"pop up\\" digital radio station that exclusively played AC/DC.Austereo Adds Fourth Digital Radio Band - Perth Now, 10 February 2010 High Voltage stopped being aired at the conclusion of the tour on 15 March 2010.

Manuscripts and Special Collections contributed 42 catalogues to the national Access 2 Archives programme, which are now searchable via The National Archives' Discovery Catalogue. Over 400 collection level descriptions are also available on the Archives Hub History The collection of manuscripts and local archives in the University Library was encouraged initially by G.E. Flack, the first College Librarian. References in minutes of the University Council from the 1930s refer to the University Library's accession of significant gifts and deposits of archival materials, a process which accelerated after the war. The first archivist was appointed in 1948, and a separate Department of Manuscripts was established within the University Library in 1958 under the management of a newly appointed Keeper of the Manuscripts. Subsequent developments have added conservation facilities. With the move into new library premises in 1973 (the Hallward Library) the Department acquired purpose-built accommodation and facilities which supported a steady expansion in its holdings and activities. Early or rare imprints of printed books formed the basis of Special Collections in the areas of arts and social sciences, science and engineering, medicine, agriculture and food sciences, and law. In addition, several of the subject libraries acquired particular named Special Collections, devoted to particular subjects or preserving the libraries of particular individuals and institutions. The East Midlands Collection was developed to serve both as a reference and loan collection for local studies and a special collection of early and rare imprints concerning the region. In 1989 the Department of Manuscripts became the Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, with a common reading room and staffing. Since then subject collections from the medical and law libraries have moved into Special Collections. The most substantial internal transfer was the acquisition in 1995 of the library of the former Institute of German, Austrian and Swiss Affairs, including both published and archival holdings. In 2006 the department moved to new premises at King's Meadow Campus, the University's new campus at Lenton Lane. This provided a reading Room, Store, Conservation, reprographical digitisation workshops and offices, with space for more expansion. The office has been appointed by the Lord Chancellor as a repository for specified classes of public records (hospital records; British Coal, research report series). It has been approved for the custody of collections of national significance accepted in lieu of tax. It is recognised by the Master of the Rolls as a repository for manorial documents. It is also approved by the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham as a repository for the archive of the former Archdeaconry of Nottingham. In October 2005, the Portland (London), Portland of Welbeck, and Newcastle of Clumber papers won recognition through the Designation Scheme of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), as being of outstanding national and international importance. The D.H. Lawrence Collection was similarly recognized in February 2008.

He established the Fundacion Pablo VI to promote the social doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church and named it in honor of Pope Paul VI who elevated him into the cardinalate in 1965. His cause of canonization has commenced and he is referred to as a Servant of God. Life=Early life and education √Ångel Herrera Oria was born in Spain on 19 November 1886 as the thirteenth of fifteen children to Jos√© Herrera Ariosa and Asunci√≥n Oria; four brothers became Jesuit priests while another joined the missions in China. He completed his secondary studies with the Jesuit Fathers in Valladolid and studied law at the University of Deusto; he also studied for a licentiate in law in 1905 at the University of Salamanca and also attended the University of Fribourg in Switzerland for ecclesiastical studies from 1936 until 1940. Oria entered the State Lawyers Corps in 1908 and was later sent to the Delegation of the Treasury in Burgos where he remained for a year. He returned to Madrid and entered the Marian Congregation of los Luises, directed by Jesuit Father √Ångel Ayala. On 3 December 1909, he was named as the president of the recently founded Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Nacional de J√≥venes Propagandistas. He also served as the director of El Debate from 1 November 1911 to 1933. He was the founder of Editorial Cat√≥lica, of El Debate School of Journalism, of Confederaci√≥n Nacional Cat√≥lica Agraria, and of Centro de Estudios Universitarios e Instituto Social Obrero. Oria also partook in the formation of Pax Romana as well as in the initial steps of the Summer University of Santander. He served as the president of Central Board of Spanish Catholic Action for three years from 1933 to 1936. He co-founded and presided (1908-1935) the Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Nacional de Propagandistas (ACNdP) (Propagandists Catholic National AssociationUnderstand the term 'propaganda' in its etymological meaning.), and the rightist party Acci√≥n Nacional (named after Acci√≥n Popular) (1931), presided Spanish Catholic Action (1933-1935), and edited (1911-1933) the pre- Civil War most important Catholic newspaper, El Debate. He studied Law at the Universities of Salamanca and Deusto, and hold his doctorate at the University of Madrid in 1908. That year, he co-founded, with the jesuit √Ångel Ayala, the ACNdP. On November 1911, he purchased El Debate, a Catholic newspaper established a year before, and he made of it one of the most read newspapers in Spain. In 1912, the ACNdP established the Editorial Cat√≥lica, a leading Catholic publishing house during 20th century Spain. In 1926 he founded the first Journalism School in Spain, associated with El Debate. When the Second Republic was proclaimed, he founded the political party Acci√≥n Nacional (later named Acci√≥n Popular, as government banned the usage of term 'national' by any political party), with very little political success. In 1933, he was elected president of Spanish Catholic Action and left edition of El Debate. That same year, the ACNdP founded the Centro de Estudios Universitarios (CEU). Ordination In 1936 he decided to become priest and began his ecclesiastical studies in the University of Fribourg. He was ordained a priest on 28 July 1940 in the seminary of Saint Charles. He was assigned as coadjutor to a parish in Santander, where he founded several social initiatives. In 1944, he encouraged the establishment by the Editorial Cat√≥lica of the prestigious Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos (BAC). Episcopate and cardinalate In 1947 he was appointed Bishop of M√°laga by Pope Pius XII. He advocated a large number of apostolic and social initiatives in his diocese and his homilies were very often nationwide broadcast. Spanish Catholic Action elected him as its national ecclesiastical counselor from 1949 to 1955. In 1951 he founded the Leo XIII Social Institute, later the Faculty of Arts of the Pontifical University of Salamanca (Madrid campus), and between 1958 and 1967 he presided the Editorial Cat√≥lica. He participated in the Second Vatican Council in all sessions. On 22 February 1965 he was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Paul VI with the titular church of Sacro Cuore di Maria simultaneously inducted into the order of cardinal-priests. He retired as bishop of Malaga in 1966 despite several failed attempts to have the pope accept his resignation. Oria died on 28 July 1968 and was buried in the chapel of San Rafael in the cathedral of M√°laga on 31 July 1968. Beatification The process of his canonization commenced on 15 July 1996 with the declaration of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) and he was proclaimed a Servant of God. The official diocesan process spanned from 20 November 1996 until 14 December 2010; the process was validated by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 22 June 2012.

All these models have the Konica AR bayonet. Konica Auto-Reflex, Autorex, and Revue Auto-Reflex The Konica Auto-Reflex of 1965 was the first focal-plane-shutter auto exposure 35mm SLR; hence the name. This model and its rarer, meterless companion the Konica Auto-Reflex P are the only models where \\"Auto-Reflex\\" is hyphenated. These are also the only two SLRs that ever offered a choice of full- or half-frame exposures, switched by a lever on top of the camera. The frame size can be changed between 24√ó36 landscape and 18√ó24 portrait in mid-roll. Autorex is the name for the domestic Japanese market. In Germany the camera was also sold as Revue Auto-Reflex. For the Auto-Reflex, the meter sensor is mounted on the front, right-hand side of the camera. This is not TTL metering, although it does offer a shutter- preferred, auto-exposure mode. TTL auto exposure appeared in a Konica a few years later, with the Autoreflex T (FTA in Japan). It has the new Konica Bayonet II mount, which is also often called K/AR mount. PX675 type mercury batteries are only needed for the light meter. Shutter speeds run from 1s to 1/1000 and B. See also: 47-100mm f3.5 Hexanon AR-H lens. All versions of this model were available in both matte chrome and all-black finishes. All-black cameras are considerably rarer and tend to be more valuable. Lenses offered with the Auto-Reflex/Autorex are a bit unusual, too. They originally did not have a registration notch on the rear, which was needed with latter TTL metered models but was unnecessary on this model. The notch tells the camera the lens' maximum aperture. At the time the later models were introduced, many Auto-Reflex/FTA lenses were sent in for a service upgrade to modify them for use with the TTL models. For a period of time, factory service facilities performed this service for free. The result is that un-modified original Auto- Reflex/Autorex lenses are somewhat unusual today. Also, normal lenses sold with the Revue version of this camera were often unlabelled, fitted with a plain finish ring that did not have the Hexanon name on it. Konishiroku apparently did not rebrand any of their K/AR mount SLR models for sale through Montgomery Ward in the United States, as they had with the FP in the earlier mount. They did continue to market a number of rebadged rangefinder cameras through Wards, however (EEMatic and Auto S models, for example). Konica Auto-Reflex P, Autorex P, and Revue Auto-Reflex SP Konica Auto-Reflex P w/lens and light meter The Konica Auto-Reflex P is basically a stripped-down Auto-Reflex without light meter and therefore without auto-exposure. In Japan it was sold as Autorex P, in Germany as the Revue Auto-Reflex SP. It is fully mechanical and therefore does not have batteries. The shutter speeds are the same: 1s to 1/1000 and B. As with the Auto-Reflex, the frame size can be switched between 24√ó36mm landscape and 18√ó24mm portrait mid-roll. There is a special accessory light meter offered for use with the P models. It is believed all versions of these models were only offered in matte chrome finish. Autoreflex T, FTA, and Revue TTL FTA The Autoreflex T was the first focal plane shutter 35mm SLRs with auto-exposure and TTL metering combined in one body. In Japan it was sold as FTA, in Germany as Revue Autoreflex TTL. It is fully mechanical with shutter-priority auto exposure. The batteries (two PX 675 type mercury cells) were only needed for the CdS light meter. The shutter speed range was from 1s to 1/1000 and B. There is one rare and special version of this model, known as the Autoreflex W. This is a camera fitted with a special timing back, for use at sporting events. It imprints the time of the exposure on each frame of film. The back is similar in function to the one offered in 1963 on the Konica FS-W, an F/FS mount camera. Autoreflex A The Autoreflex A is a stripped-down Autoreflex T without self-timer, mirror lock-up, depth-of-field preview, on/off-switch, and battery control, and with 1/500 top shutter speed. Autoreflex T\\"2\\" and New FTA The Autoreflex \\"T2\\" is an improved Autoreflex T. The model name on the body still says \\"Autoreflex T\\". In Japan it was sold as \\"New\\" FTA. Both the versions of T and FTA were hugely successful and are still widely found today. These models might be considered the SLRs that truly established Konica's reputation for quality. Many of both versions continue to function well 35 or more years after they were manufactured. The most recognizable differences between the T\\"1\\" and T\\"2\\" (and FTA and \\"New\\" FTA) is that the latter has the on/off switch as a small collar that rotates around the shutter release button. On the earlier camera, the switch was located on the back, left-hand side. Also omitted from the later camera is a small lever under the shutter speed dial labeled \\"Override\\" on the earlier camera. This change shows the improved range of the meter sensitivity, and the override capability was no longer considered necessary. The T\\"2\\"/\\"New\\" FTA also saw a number of small, internal changes in the materials used and methods of assembly. This was largely to make the camera more easily serviced. For example, where some brass screws were used originally, these were replaced with stronger steel screws that were less inclined to strip or snap off when being removed. Although the names T\\"2\\" or \\"New\\" FTA never actually appeared on the outside of the camera, there were references to the model designation in Konishiroku memos and literature at the time. Service bulletins, for example, distinguished the later cameras from the earlier by reference to these model designations. Also, note that the next model offered was known as the Autoreflex T3. One small flaw found in Autoreflex T is the battery compartment. It appears the wrong type of flux was used when soldering the wire connections. This makes the wire and solder more vulnerable to any battery leakage, more prone to corrosion. The fix is simple, though. Perhaps 9 out of 10 times an Autoreflex T with a non-responsive meter can be easily repaired with a little cleaning and soldering. Both the Autoreflex T\\"2\\" and \\"New\\" FTA can be found in both matte chrome and all black finishes. The black versions are rarer and more valuable. There was also an optional split image focus assist screen available on a few of this model. Up to now, the Konica K/AR cameras all had matte focus screens with a micro-diaprism dot in the center to help with focus. The split focus assist feature is not interchangeable by the user (the way some camera's focus screens are), and is pretty rare. (Note: In the earlier F/FS mount, Konica has similar screens with matte field and a central micro-diaprism dot, except for the highly valued and rare Konica F which not only had an interchangeable pentaprism, but also had the split image focus assist feature.) Autoreflex A2 The Autoreflex A2 is an improved Autoreflex A or stripped-down Autoreflex T2 without self-timer, mirror lock-up, depth-of-field preview, on/off-switch, and battery control, and with 1/600 top shutter speed. The engravings still say Autoreflex A. Autoreflex A1000 The Autoreflex A1000 is an improved Autoreflex A2 or stripped-down Autoreflex T2, with a top shutter speed of 1/1000, but without self-timer, on/off switch, depth-of-field preview, and mirror lock-up. It was sold only in the USA. Autoreflex T3 and T3N Autoreflex T3. The Autoreflex T3 is an improved Autoreflex T2, It adds an aperture-stop-down (depth-of-field preview) function to the self-timer lever (push lever towards lens for stop-down, push button on lever-hub and turn lever counter-clockwise to set the self-timer), a Multiple Exposure (M.E.) switch integrated with the shutter-speed dial used in combination with the cocking-indicator (indicator green means shutter is cocked, red means it isn't), as well as a wider range of selectable film-speeds (ISO 12-3200). As with the T2, both the aperture and shutter speed setting are visible in the viewfinder, which has improved brightness compared to earlier models. This model has its serial-number engraved in the top-plate's rear below the wind- lever and a stamped and painted \\"T-3\\" between the rewind-lever and prism-bump on the top (note the dash here vs. no dash on the front of the camera). The Autoreflex T3\\"N\\" or \\"New\\" introduces iterative enhancements by replacing the earlier version's accessory hot-shoe with a fixed hot-shoe, adding a viewfinder-ocular shutter, and an optional split-image focusing-screen (that feature being indicated by a round sticker with a large letter \\"S\\" and the caption \\"split image\\" below the rewind-crank next to the viewfinder ocular on the top back of the camera). The T3N's serial number is painted and moves to the top of the top-plate between the rewind-lever and prism-bump. If the Autoreflex T/FTA and T\\"2\\"/\\"New\\" FTA established Konica SLR as a major and important brand, the T3 and T3\\"N\\" took this to a higher level. It is a completely redesigned camera with a number of improvements. The T3/T3\\"N\\" are described as \\"buttery smooth\\" in operation by many fans. It is also the last of the all-metal, full-size Konica. Highly durable, many remain in use today despite having little or no service attention over 30 or more years use. Both T3 and T3\\"N\\" can be found in either matte chrome and black enamel finish to its top and bottom plates, with the black version being rarer and more valuable. In the final year or two of production, another version of the optional split-image focusing-screen became available, which featured the split image dot in the center and a \\"donut\\" of micro-diaprisms around that, both of which were in the center of the matte focus screen. Models fitted with the special screen feature had a small silver tag stuck on the back with \\"S.I.\\" printed on it. The final version of focus screen became the standard on all subsequent Konica models (TC, T4, FP-1, FT-1, etc.) Autoreflex A3 The \\"Autoreflex A3\\" is a stripped-down Autoreflex T3 without self-timer, depth-of- field preview, mirror lock-up, multi-exposure provision, on/off switch, battery control, M flash synch, and hot shoe. It replaced the A\\"2\\" and A1000 as an entry level model, but now built on a chassis shared with the T3. Autoreflex T4 The Autoreflex T4 looks similar to the simpler Autoreflex TC. Both are smaller than the earlier Autoreflex bodies, use plastic top plate, but retain a metal frame. It is still a full-featured, fully mechanical SLR with a CdS TTL light meter and shutter-priority auto-exposure. The shutter speed range is 1s to 1/1000 and B, and the batteries (two PX625 mercury cells) are only needed for the light meter. Autoreflex TC and Acom-1 The Autoreflex TC is a simpler version of the Autoreflex T4. The shutter speeds run from 1/8 to 1/1000 and B. In Japan it was sold as the Acom-1.

Such debt is referred to as 'subordinate', because the debt providers (the lenders) have subordinate status in relationship to the normal debt. Subordinated debt has a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation during bankruptcy, and ranks below: the liquidator, government tax authorities and senior debt holders in the hierarchy of creditors. Debt instruments with the lowest seniority are known as subordinated debt instruments. Because subordinated debts are only repayable after other debts have been paid, they are more risky for the lender of the money. The debts may be secured or unsecured. Subordinated loans typically have a lower credit rating, and, therefore, a higher yield than senior debt. A typical example for this would be when a promoter of a company invests money in the form of debt rather than in the form of stock. In the case of liquidation (e.g. the company winds up its affairs and dissolves), the promoter would be paid just before stockholders ‚Äî assuming there are assets to distribute after all other liabilities and debts have been paid. While subordinated debt may be issued in a public offering, major shareholders and parent companies are more frequent buyers of subordinated loans. These entities may prefer to inject capital in the form of debt, but, due to the close relationship to the issuing company, they may be more willing to accept a lower rate of return on subordinated debt than general investors would. Examples A particularly important example of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks. Subordinated debt is issued periodically by most large banking corporations in the U.S. Subordinated debt can be expected to be especially risk-sensitive because subordinated debt holders have claims on bank assets only after senior debtholders and they lack the upside gain enjoyed by shareholders. This status of subordinated debt makes it perfect for experimenting with the significance of market discipline, via the signalling effect of secondary market prices of subordinated debt (and, where relevant, the issue price of these bonds initially in the primary markets). From the perspective of policy-makers and regulators, the potential benefit from having banks issue subordinated debt is that the markets and their information-generating capabilities are enrolled in the \\"supervision\\" of the financial condition of the banks. This, hopefully, creates both an early-warning system, like the so-called \\"canary in the mine\\", and, also hopefully, an incentive for bank management to act prudently, thus helping to offset the moral hazard that can otherwise exist, especially in a circumstance where banks have limited equity and deposits are insured. This role of subordinated debt has attracted increasing attention from policy analysts in recent years.See, e.g., \\"Subordinated debt: a capital markets approach to bank regulation.\\" Mark E. Van Der Weide and Satish M. Kini. Boston College Law Review. Volume 41, number 2. March 2000. For a second example of subordinated debt, consider asset-backed securities. These are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first; the subordinated tranches later. A third example is mezzanine debt. Use Subordinated bonds are regularly issued (as mentioned earlier) as part of the securitization of debt, such as in the issue of asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations or collateralized debt obligations. Corporate issuers tend to prefer not to issue subordinated bonds because of the higher interest rate required to compensate for the higher risk, but may be forced to do so if indentures on earlier issues mandate their status as senior bonds. Also, subordinated debt may be combined with preferred stock to create so-called monthly income preferred stock, a hybrid security paying dividends for the lender and funded as interest expense by the issuer.

(Punjabi: ‡®ò‡®Æ‡©Ç‡®∞ ghamur, English: blue panicgrass) is a tall (up to 3 metres), coarse, woody perennial grass throughout the Himalaya and the Upper Gangetic Plain and specifically in various regions of the Indian state of Punjab and the Pakistan province of Punjab and the neighbouring areas of these regions. The plant has strong spreading rhizomes. This grass is also listed by William Coldstream in his Illustrations of Some of the Grasses of the Southern PunjabColdstream, William: Illustrations of Some of the Grasses of the Southern Punjab: Being Photo-lithographs of the Principal Grasses found at Hisar with short Descriptive letterpress W.

Habitat Panicum antidotale is found in rich soils that have often been improved with compost or dung be they originally of sand or clay. According to Coldstream, for some reason it seems to be found in the vicinity of caper bushes. Usage This grass is not considered of much use beyond its early tender stages having a bitter or brackish taste when it matures. It is grown in the southwestern United States as a forage, and can now be found there growing wild as an introduced species.Grass Manual Treatment Jepson Manual Treatment Pests and diseases Panicum antidotale is susceptible to yellow stripe disease which is usually found in sugar-cane. The disease in this grass, in which the virus persists for long periods, is capable not only of infecting sugar-canes in their vicinity, but also serves as new sources of infection when diseased canes have been removed.Ledeboer, F. 1922: Arch.

Early in his career, he worked to expand African-Americans' access to education as chairman of the Georgia State Commission on the Education of Colored Persons. He served as an alderman and was elected Mayor of Savannah, Georgia in the late 1890s. In 1908 he was the chair of the Georgia delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Meldrim was a highly regarded attorney known for his handling of complex cases and oratory who served as a commissioner from Georgia on the Uniform Law Commission which worked to enact uniform state laws nationally. Meldrim also presented addresses on law to various state and national bar associations, served as president of the Georgia State Bar in 1904, and became chairman of the American Bar Association Committee on Jurisprudence and Law Reform. In addition, he also served as the Association's president. His home for many years in later life was the Green-Meldrim House, a US National Historic Landmark. Early Life He was born in Savannah, Georgia on December 4, 1848; his parents were Ralph M. Meldrim and Jane Fawcett Meldrim.

It is, along with the New Mexico Army National Guard, an element of the New Mexico National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the New Mexico Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New Mexico though the office of the New Mexico Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Adjutant General is MG (NM) Kenneth Nava. The New Mexico Air National Guard is headquartered in Albuquerque at Kirtland Air Force Base, and its commander is Brigadier General Robert Reyner.  Overview  Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, New Mexico Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). New Mexico ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the New Mexico Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the New Mexico ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The New Mexico Air National Guard consists of the following major unit: * 150th Special Operations Wing (formerly 150th Fighter Wing) : Established 7 July 1947 (as: 188th Fighter Squadron) : Stationed at: Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque : Gained by: Air Force Special Operations Command : The 150 SOW is currently engaged in assuming part of the mission of the USAF 58th Special Operations Wing at Kirtland AFB. The future mission of the 150 FW will be to train aircrew in the HC-130P and HH-60G search and rescue aircraft, and the MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, and CV-22 Osprey special operations aircraft. The New Mexico Air National Guard owns and uses the Cato/Smitty MOA, southwest of Albuquerque, from 500 feet AGL to 51,000 feet with some supersonic flights conducted above 30,000 feet. The unit also utilizes the very large White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) airspace for both air-to-air and air-to-ground training. In addition to Cato and WSMR, the Tacos make use of the Pecos MOA that is east of Albuquerque and North of Roswell. For air-to-ground training, the NMANG has several options for local flying, including Melrose Bombing Range co-located with the Pecos MOA, Red Rio, Oscura, and Centennial ranges in the WSMR airspace, and Airburst bombing range in southern Colorado. The 150th Fighter Wing scheduled three Military Training Routes (MTR) that are wider than average to help dissipate the environmental effects of overflight. They usually get very few noise complaints. VR-176 is an MTR that accesses the White Sands Missile Range airspace and even though it is very wide, has the most noise avoidance areas. Every attempt is made to brief infrequent or transient users of VR-176 about the noise sensitive areas. VR 1195 and 1107 encompass the majority of eastern New Mexico. New Mexico has some of the greatest flying weather in the country, three large supersonic training areas, five air-to-ground ranges (three manned, all scoreable), and three very large Military Training Routes. History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re- establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 An F-51H Mustang of the 188th Fighter Squadron, 1948 The New Mexico Air National Guard was federally recognized on 7 July 1947 as the 188th Fighter Bomber Squadron. The unit was composed of a utility flight equipped with Douglas B-26 light bombers, a fighter squadron composed of 100 officers and airmen flying 25 F-51D Mustangs and three T-6 Texan trainers, plus a small weather detachment. Pilots were drawn from returning World War II veterans, including David Tallichet, and new local recruits. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the New Mexico Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. The 188th's mission was changed from fighter bomber to interceptor in 1948. Korean War In December 1950, the unit was called to active duty for the Korean War. A total of 54 officers and 400 airmen were assigned to Long Beach Airport, California. Most unit members were then absorbed by other USAF units and dispatched to Japan and Korea. First Lieutenants Robert Lucas and Joseph Murray were killed while flying close air support missions in Korea. Captain Francis Williams and First Lieutenant Robert Sands were each credited with shooting down three Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters. The unit was released from federal active duty in November 1952. Cold War Members of the 188th Fighter Squadron in 1955 In August 1953, the 188th FIS received their first jet aircraft, the F-80C Shooting Star. Between 1953 and 1957, the 188th was one of three squadrons of the 140th Wing, with headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In 1957, the 188th was presented the Spaatz Trophy and the Air Force Association Trophy for being the outstanding tactical unit of the Air National Guard for the period 1 January 1956 through 31 December 1956. In 1957, the unit was re-designated and federally recognized as the 150th Tactical Fighter Group. On 1 July 1961, the 188th Fighter Interceptor Squadron assumed 24-hour Air Defense alert status at Kirtland Air Force Base. In 1958, the 188th became the first squadron in the Air National Guard to receive the F-100 Super Sabre, 12 F-100As and two F-100Fs. This conversion raised unit strength to 956 officers and airmen.http://www.cybermodeler.com/history/nmang/nmang1.shtml In April 1961, an aircraft malfunction caused an AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile to launch and shoot down a B-52B Stratofortress bomber near Grants, New Mexico. The B-52B (AF Ser. No. 53-0380, aircraft nickname \\"Ciudad Juarez\\") from the 95th Bomb Wing took off from Biggs Air Force Base, at El Paso, Texas on a practice mission. During an intercept by two New Mexico ANG F-100As, an AIM-9B shook loose and impacted one of the engine pods on the left wing, taking the B-52's left wing off in the subsequent explosion. Three B-52 crewmembers died; the F-100 pilot was absolved of any blame.http://www.angelfire.com/dc/jinxx1/images/Shootdown.html In the fall of 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis put the 150th on an alert status that lasted for 90 days. Later, the 150th was reassigned from Aerospace Defense Command to Tactical Air Command and equipped with the F-100C fighter-bomber. Vietnam War In January 1968, the group was activated as a result of the Pueblo Crisis, and in June of that year the 188th Tactical Fighter Squadron and approximately 250 maintenance and support personnel were deployed to Tuy Hoa Air Base, Vietnam. Remaining group members were assigned to various bases in South Korea. The unit flew over 6000 combat sorties in the F-100C Super Sabre and amassed over 630 medals and decorations before release from federal active duty in June 1969. Captain Michael Adams was killed in action and Major Bobby Neeld and First Lieutenant Mitchell Lane are listed as missing in action. The unit received the USAF Outstanding Unit Award with a bronze \\"V\\" for valor. 1970s In New Mexico, units of both the Army and Air Guard were ordered to State duty in 1970 to assist local and State police during campus riots at the University of New Mexico. In 1973 the 150th Tactical Fighter Group converted from the F-100C to the A-7D Corsair II. In 1977, the unit participated in the \\"Coronet Ante\\" exercise, which was part of the NATO \\"Coldfire\\" exercise in Europe. The 150th TFG deployed nine A-7Ds to Gilze Rijen Air Base, The Netherlands, from 2 September through 27 September 1977. Close air support missions were flown over The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and the North Sea. During exercise \\"Bright Star '81\\", the 150th TFG set an A-7 and first endurance record of 11 hours flying non-stop from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire to Cairo West Air Base, Egypt. Gulf War 1991 F-16C Fighting Falcons of the 188th Fighter Squadron flying over Kuwaiti oil wells during Operation Southern Watch, 1998 The 150th Fighter Group was partially activated in support of Operation Desert Storm. On 11 December 1990, 44 members of the 150th Security Police Flight and other unit members were deployed to Saudi Arabia. All members returned home by May 1991. In the following year, the 150th was redesignated as the 150th Fighter Wing (150 FW) as part of a redesignation of nearly all Air National Guard flying units previously designated as groups. The 150 FW also transitioned from the A-7 to the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. War on Terror Since the September 11 attacks 2001, the 150th FW supported several deployments connected with Operation Noble Eagle. Within hours of the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C., 150th FW aircrews flew combat air patrol sorties over key resources within the western part of the United States, and continued to do so for many months. To protect the local homeland of New Mexico, 150th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) personnel provided several months of security protection to the Albuquerque International Airport. 2010 Combat Air Force Restructure In 2009, it was decided to assign the 21 F-16C/D aircraft of the New Mexico ANG to other Air National Guard units in the District of Columbia Air National Guard and the Vermont Air National Guard as part of the \\"Fiscal Year 2010 Combat Air Force Restructure\\". The last two F-16s left Kirtland AFB in September 2010. The 150th FW was to take over the mission of Kirtland's 58th Special Operations Wing. An Air Education and Training Command (AETC) unit, the 58 SOW trains about 2,200 military personnel a year in special operations and combat search and rescue utilizing the HC-130P/N King, MC-130H Combat Talon II, MC-130J Commando II, the HC-130J King II, HH-60G Pavehawk, UH-1N Iroquois, and CV-22 Osprey.  2013 to Present Day  Located on Kirtland Air Force Base that borders Albuquerque, New Mexico, on December 1, 2013 due to the Department of the Air Force restructuring and realignment, the 150th Fighter Wing was renamed as the 150th Special Operations Wing through a Total Force Integration with the 58th Special Operations Wing. This historic redesignation hails the activation of a new mission for the 150th from a fighter unit to a special operations training unit. Currently, the 150th SOW has one C-26 Metroliner support aircraft and is highly involved with the 58th Special Operations Wings day‚Äìto-day operations. They have been highly successful in this endeavor and are currently a highly integral part of the operations and maintenance side of the house on the following aircraft; HC-130 P/N, HC-130J, MC-130J, HH-60G, and 6 ‚Äúby-name‚Äù members on the CV-22. The 150 SOW maintains its daily operations with the support of over 335 full-time personnel and approximately another 650 Drill Status Guardsmen. Today, the NM ANG is composed of State Headquarters, the 150th Special Operations Wing, 150th Maintenance Group, 150th Operations Group, 150th Mission Support Group, 150th Medical Group, 250th Intel Squadron, and 210th RED HORSE Squadron. In addition, the wing is assigned one C-26 support aircraft and supports both domestic and world-wide Combatant Commander taskings.

Triple M Sydney is part of Southern Cross Austereo's Triple M network and broadcasts on the 104.9 MHz frequency. History=The Early Days 2MMM, the first \\"Triple M\\" station commenced broadcasting on 2 August 1980. Together with then rival station 2Day FM (now also owned by Southern Cross Austereo) it was one of the first two commercial FM radio stations in Sydney. The Government-owned Triple J began broadcasting on the FM band just one day earlier. The station has always been primarily a rock music station. Triple M was one of the highest-rating radio stations in Sydney, spearheaded by its breakfast show presented by Doug Mulray and featuring the writing of and occasional appearances by Andrew Denton. From 1988 until the early nineties, Club Veg with Mal Lees and Vic Davies hosted the Night show before moving to Perth to host the breakfast show at 96FM/Triple M. For all of this period and into the 1990s, Triple M's promotional campaign featured the character \\"Dr Dan\\", a guitar-playing satyr with wings, and a theme song that was an extended reworking of the Mike Batt track \\"Introduction (The Journey of a Fool)\\", from his 1979 album Tarot Suite. 1990s/Early 2000s After the Departure of Doug Mulray at breakfast, 2MMM tried a variety of breakfast show hosts, including Rob Duckworth and Sammy Power, and the Richard Stubbs Breakfast Show (broadcast from 3MMM in Melbourne). It was not until the late 1990s when Andrew Denton, a previous contributor to Mulray's program took the chair and became the host of 2MMM's breakfast slot, with Amanda Keller joining him as a co-host, that 2MMM once again enjoyed ratings success. Club Veg with Mal Lees and Vic Davies also returned in 1998 and enjoyed instant ratings success in their morning slot of 09:00-12:00 before being moved to the Drive shift 16:00-19:00. This was also the time that Keller would work with Brendan \\"Jonesy\\" Jones who was doing afternoons at the time. Denton called in unwell one day Jones was called in to fill in with Keller, five years later they are working at WSFM. FM Talk was tinkered with via Talkback Host and journalist Brian Carlton, using the on air name of The Spoonman, derived from the Soundgarden song \\"Spoonman\\". This show got axed at the end of the 1990s. Andrew Denton left the M's in the early 2000s, and many breakfast teams were tried out, with the likes of Peter Berner, Mikey Robins, and a return of Amanda Keller also during this period. The Triple M Freq Club was discontinued nationally during 2004. 2006‚Äì2008 A new breakfast program, The Cage emerged on the Triple M network, which included talents such as James Brayshaw, Peter Berner, Fitzy, Brigitte Duclos, these hosts being in various Triple M studios across the network. This went on in Sydney until the end of 2006, with the popular drive show The Shebang taking up the breakfast slot in 2007, to a low degree of success. Brian Carlton Returned in 2005, once again doing nights, using The Spoonman name. In 2007, night show host Paul Murray was added to the Shebang breakfast team in the hope of increasing ratings, to no avail. The show abruptly ended in November 2008. The decision to axe The Shebang breakfast program and Marty Sheargold taking leave from the show, led to Triple M's lowest ratings ever, slipping behind competitor Vega for the first time and leaving the former top-rating station last in the commercial radio station ratings.Sydney Morning Herald - \\"Triple M tactic takes the spoon\\" The Triple M Street Team (aka Street Freq or Rock patrols) were discontinued from visiting locations (such as parks and reserves) regularly - during mid-2006, to focus on a different brand. Though at present, there are Triple M Street Team locations on an occasional basis - visiting businesses only. . \\\\- The Australian, 2 August 2007 During mid-2006, Triple M introduced an interactive survey encouraging Triple M listeners to have a say in the music they play through the Triple M Music Jury. In October 2008, the station had changed the format temporarily (Awesome '80s) to play only 1980s music and use the old promos, news and traffic themes and the old station name Triple M FM 105. The Spoonman Show and drive team Wil and Lehmo were also axed at the end of 2008. Morning DJ [Anthony Maroon] (who moved to Vega 95.3) was removed from the on-air DJs, along with Rob Duckworth who was in the afternoon slot. The re-branding of Vega saw the return of Maroon to Triple M on-air crew. December 2008 ‚Äì present After the \\"Awesome 80s\\" format had wrapped up on 30 November 2008, \\"The All New Triple M\\" was launched, replacing the old slogans of \\"Triple M Rocks\\" and \\"Best of the Old Stuff, Best of the New Stuff\\" with \\"Music That Rocks\\". This launch came with a demographic shift, moving away from the \\"working class\\" mid 30s to 40s to a younger, 25‚Äì39 key demographic, targeting younger listeners. A new Breakfast Team was launched, with Ugly Phil and Sami Lukis, along with new drive programs, Roy and HG (Mondays and Fridays), and Tuesday to Thursdays drive slot being hosted by ex Shebang anchor Byron Cooke, called Live Line. The Peter Berner Experiment returned from Tues to Thursdays at 6 pm. The Paul Murray Night Show returned, with the name \\"The All New Paul Murray Show\\", with the co host Rachel Corbett, playing nothing but recent music, with a slant towards a youth audience. Artists which feature prominently on Triple M include Nickelback, Powderfinger, Kevin Rudolf, Silverchair, Coldplay, The Fray, Snow Patrol, Kings of Leon, Faker, AC/DC, Cold Chisel and Bon Jovi amongst others. During May 2009, Triple M introduced \\"The Music That Made Triple M Famous\\", playing music from the eras of the 1970s and 1980s. During June 2009, Phil O'Neil and Sami Lukis had been axed from the breakfast slot just over six months since they started broadcasting in December 2008. Paul Murray and Rachel Corbett continued in the breakfast slot until mid-August when the new breakfast show would commence broadcasting. \\\\- The Daily Telegraph, 1 July 2009 Paul & Rach moved to the Tuesday-Thursday drivetime slot from 8 September 2009. As of 17 August 2009, Gus Worland, Stuart MacGill and Mark Geyer were named the hosts of the new Triple M's breakfast show called The Grill Team. \\\\- The Daily Telegraph, 10 July 2009The Grill Team - Triple M Sydney They were joined by anchor Byron Cooke, news reader Sami Lukis and contributor Rachel Corbett.

On 2 August 2010, Triple M turned 30 and asked slash to remake the Dr Dan Theme to a 2010 format. Byron Cooke left The Grill Team at the end of 2010 and moved to the Today Network to anchor Fifi and Jules. He was replaced by former Hot30 Countdown host Chris Page. Sami Lukis also left Triple M at the end of 2010, replaced by Rachel Corbett in the breakfast newsreader role. On 28 March 2011 Matthew Johns brother of Andrew Johns joined The Grill Team, while Brian \\"Spoonman\\" Carlton took over the newsreader role and Rachel Corbett became a regular contributor. On 28 September 2011, it was announced that Merrick Watts will join Triple M during drive in 2012. He was joined by Rachel Corbett and Julian Schiller as part of the Merrick and the Highway Patrol drive show. It was cancelled at the end of 2013. On 20 January 2014, Triple M's new national drive show \\"The One Percenters\\" premiered, hosted by ex-Fox FM Breakfast host Matt Tilley and journalist/Studio 10 host Joe Hildebrand. The station changed its slogan to \\"Sydney's Modern Rock\\" around this time, with a playlist focussed on music released since 1990.

The main armament of the Bristol class was two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted.Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55‚Äì57 This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size by the Royal Navy,Lyon, Part 1, p. 53 while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work. The Bristols were considered protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships' vitals. The armoured deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists.Lyon, Part 2, p. 59 As the protective deck was at the waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms.Brown, p. 63 One problem with the armour of the Bristols, which was shared with the other Town-class ships, was the sizable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap and made the guns' crews vulnerable to leg injuries in combat.Lyon, Part 2, p. 57 Construction and career Gloucester was the eighth ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the eponymous port.Colledge, p. 143 The ship was laid down on 15 April 1909 by William Beardmore and Company at their Dalmuir shipyard and launched on 28 October. On being commissioned in October 1910, the ship was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet. In January 1913, Gloucester was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) in the Mediterranean. Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau As tensions rose with Germany in the first few days of August 1914, before Britain declared war, Gloucester was deployed at the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, together with the bulk of the Mediterranean Fleet, by its commander, Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne. Their task was to prevent the German battlecruiser and the light cruiser from linking up with the Austro-Hungarian Fleet. The battlecruisers and were withdrawn from this force on 2 August and found the German ships on the morning of 4 August headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville. But Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina, Sicily, to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but Goeben and Breslau were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10 km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly. Therefore, Milne stationed the battlecruisers and Indefatigable at the northernwestern exit of the Strait of Messina as he still expected the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports. He positioned Gloucester at the southeastern exit and sent Indomitable to recoal at Bizerte where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.Massie, pp. 31, 34‚Äì39 The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards Constantinople, trailed by Gloucester which was radioing the German movements to Milne. Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon ordered Breslau to turn about and pretend to lay mines in an effort to scare off Gloucester. Captain Howard Kelly decided to attack the German ship in an effort to force Goeben to turn around to support her consort as the British ship was more heavily armed than Breslau. Kelly opened fire at a range of with his forward six-inch gun at 13:35 on the 7th and then increased speed when the German ship replied with her guns. When he had closed the range to , he turned to unmask Gloucesters broadside. This caused Souchon to turn and open fire on the British cruiser and Kelly disengaged, having accomplished his goal. Gloucester fired 18 six- and 14 four-inch shells during the brief engagement, but only hit Breslau once to little effect. She was not hit in return. Kelly was forced to break off his pursuit at 16:40 as Milne had strictly forbidden him to pass Cape Matapan, Greece, and his coal was running low.Massie, pp. 44‚Äì45 After the German ships safely reached Turkey, Gloucester was assigned to the squadron blockading the Dardanelles, the strait between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea for the next several months.Massie, pp. 427‚Äì28 In November the ship was ordered into the Indian Ocean to search for German commerce raiders, although she was recalled shortly afterwards to rejoin the 2nd LCS of the Grand Fleet in home waters.Corbett, I, pp. 379, 387; II, pp. 16, fn. 50 Gloucester was detached in late February 1915 to search for the German armed merchant cruiser off the west coast of Africa,Corbett, II, p. 255 departing Scapa Flow on 27 February. By 18 March, she had been reassigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Battle Cruiser Fleet. On 28 March, Gloucester captured the German raider's supply ship, , in the Central AtlanticTranscript of ship's log and Kronprinz Wilhelm was forced to intern herself a few weeks later for lack of supplies.Corbett, II, pp. 256‚Äì57 Gloucester remained on patrol through the end of April, although it is likely that she rejoined her squadron in May. It has been long rumoured that she shelled Galway, Ireland during the Easter Rising in April 1916, but she was probably confused with the sloop , which did shell the outskirts of Galway a day before Gloucester arrived in Galway Bay landing 100 Royal Marines.Hardiman Battle of Jutland alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Almost a year later, Gloucester participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May‚Äì1 June 1916. As the battle began, the 3rd LCS was screening Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers as they searched for the German fleet and moved to support the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron after they had spotted the German ships. This put them out of position when Beatty turned south to pursue the German battlecruisers. After he turned north on encountering the main body of the German High Seas Fleet, the 3rd LCS were the first to encounter the screen of the Grand Fleet at 17:33. As Beatty turned east to rendezvous with them, Gloucester was unable to reach the head of the Grand Fleet's line and was forced to steer for the unengaged side to avoid fouling the range with her funnel smoke. The cruiser briefly engaged the disabled light cruiser about 18:15. By 18:40, the squadron was in position to escort the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet.Campbell, pp. 22, 31‚Äì33, 150, 161 By 20:10, Beatty's ships were in front of the Grand Fleet and the 3rd LCS was screening them when the flagship, , spotted five cruisers of the 4th Scouting Group and the squadron closed to engage at full speed. The British ships were not spotted in return until 20:17 and Falmouth opened fire a minute later at a range of . By 20:38, the British lost sight of the Germans and turned away to assume their position at the head of Beatty's battlecruisers. The cruiser fired a total of 37 shells and was not damaged during the battle.Campbell, pp. 250‚Äì52, 360 Subsequent operations After the battle, the ship was reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron, and had been transferred to the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron in the Adriatic by December. Gloucester was detached to the Indian Ocean in March 1917 to search for the German commerce raider , but was recalled on 23 May.Newbolt, pp. 217‚Äì18 She remained in the Adriatic until the end of the war in November 1918. The ship was placed in reserve the following April, listed for disposal in March 1920 and was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 to Thos W Ward, of Portishead and Briton Ferry.Lyon, Part 3, p. 51 NotesFootnotes Bibliography      * * External links *Ships of the Bristol group *Battle of Jutland Crew Lists Project - HMS Gloucester Crew List Category:Town-class cruisers (1910) of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1909 ships Category:World War I cruisers of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Gloucester (1909)"},{"id":"13306439","text":"The is an established national green party in Japan.

Vendor finance is usually in the form of deferred loans from, or shares subscribed by, the vendor. The vendor often takes shares in the borrowing company. This category of finance is generally used where the vendor's expectation of the value of the business is higher than that of the borrower's bankers, and usually at a higher interest rate than would be offered elsewhere.it is a cheaper option than going to banks. Vendor finance bridges the valuation gap due to the time value of money. If the buyer of a business doesn't have to repay the vendor for the vendor loan for a few years, then the value of that portion of the purchase price is worthless. In some cases there is an interest charge on vendor loan, but in other cases it is simply a deferred payment. Vendor finance is different from an Earnout because it is not contingent on performance. Since there is no contingency, vendor finance is more risky for the buyer than an earn-out. Vendor finance can also be used when the buyer does not have the funds to purchase the entire business. In this case the vendor creates a loan with an interest charge to help the buyer complete the purchase and help the seller complete the sale, usually on better terms for the seller.

The National Map, accessed March 9, 2011 stream in Marin County, California, United States and is the primary tributary of Lagunitas Creek, which flows, in turn, into Tomales Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. The Nicasio Reservoir, formed in 1961 by Seeger Dam, is located on this stream. History Nicasio Creek and the Rancho Nicasio are probably named for a Coast Miwok named \\"Nicasio\\" by the Spanish missionaries. The original diseno for the 1835 and 1844 land grants shows Arroyo de Nicasio, Casa de los Indios de Nicasio, and Roblar de Nicasio for Nicasio Creek, the house of the Nicasio Indians, and the oaks of Nicasio. In the mid-1830s, General Mariano Vallejo promised to the Marin County Coast Miwok Indians and asked them to choose the lands, since their original lands had been co-opted by the Mission San Rafael.Jack Mason, 1971, Early Marin, Petaluma: House of Printing, pp.70-76 In 1835, the land was granted by Mexican Governor Jos√© Figueroa, however the Indians were subsequently swindled out of the land by General Vallejo and Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. By the time the scheme was discovered in 1843, the disputed lands were quietly granted to Pablo de la Guerra, an aristocratic Spaniard, and John B. R. Cooper, an Irishman who already owned the Rancho Punta de Quentin near San Rafael. In 1855, the Miwok claim was rejected by the Public Land Commission.United States. District Court (California : Northern District)Land Case 404 ND Subsequently, de la Guerra sold his land in 1850 to Henry Wager Halleck. Halleck had arrived in California in 1847 as a lieutenant in the United States Engineers, accompanied by his friend, Lt. William Tecumseh Sherman. Halleck was a partner in the San Francisco law firm, Halleck, Peachy & Billings, and in the Civil War was promoted by President Abraham Lincoln to general-in-chief of the armies of the United States. Halleck hunted and fished at Rancho Nicasio, and built a house on the creek near Nicasio, now called Halleck Creek. Watershed and Course The Nicasio Creek watershed drains of coastal area of Marin County, California. This creek is the primary tributary of Lagunitas Creek which enters the Pacific Ocean at the head of Tomales Bay. Originating on Big Rock Ridge west of the city of Novato, Nicasio Creek descends initially to the south. Approaching Lucas Valley Road, it turns and follows the road as it winds westward, passing south of Skywalker Ranch to the town of Nicasio. North of Nicasio, it feeds into Nicasio Reservoir just as Halleck Creek enters from the east. The reservoir drains to the west, through a gap in Bolinas Ridge. Seeger Dam is located approximately upstream from the confluence of Nicasio and Lagunitas Creeks. The dam was constructed in 1960 by the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) to store water for cities in southern Marin County. From the dam, Nicasio Creek parallels Point Reyes-Petaluma Road westward until it empties into Lagunitas Creek. Ecology Before Seeger Dam presented an impassable barrier to anadromous fish passage, Nicasio Creek supported half of the steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) spawning populations in the Lagunitas Creek watershed. By blockage and inundation the dam reduced by 50 percent of the salmon and steelhead populations entering Lagunitas Creek watershed. Author and landscape artist Russell Chatham wrote, \\"One of the most tragic sights I ever beheld was the year after Nicasio Dam blocked that critical watershed. An uncountable number of silvers, between 10,000 and 15,000, crowded into the mile from the gravel company to the base of the dam. They were so thick that many were forced out onto the banks, where they died without spawning.\\" For mitigation the Marin Municipal Water District initialled trapped inbound coho below the dam and transported them above the dam, but by 1991 only 20 pairs of coho returned to spawn and none reached the trapping site below the dam. In addition, because the dam blocks sediment transport, there is a lack of suitable spawning gravel in the lower mile below the dam for spawning. Most spawning in the Lagunitas Creek watershed now takes place in San Geronimo Creek, an unregulated tributary, and the region immediately downstream of its confluence with Lagunitas Creek. A river otter (Lontra canadensis) was collected by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the southwest corner of Nicasio Reservoir in January, 2008. Bridges There are at least two bridges spanning Nicasio Creek. Point Reyes-Petaluma Road crosses the creek in two places: once east of State Route 1 on a concrete continuous tee beam constructed in 1960, and again east of State Route 1 on a concrete tee beam built in 1937.

Born in Wellington, he took over his father's large landholding in the Hawke's Bay at age 18. He was a breeder of sheep and race horses, with his horse Cynisca winning the Wellington Cup three times in a row. Hunter was prominent in local politics, and represented the electorate in the House of Representatives for a total of 22 years. Farming and horse racing Hunter was born in Wellington in 1859. He was a son of George Hunter, and a grandson of George Hunter, the first Mayor of Wellington. He worked on his father's farm in Te Aro, which is now part of the Wellington central business district. The central part of the land is now covered by Upper Dixon Street, Percival Street, and Macdonald Crescent. His father had a further farm in Porangahau in the Hawke's Bay Region, which he took up in circa 1854. Through purchasing neighbouring land, he increased the size to . As his father lived in Wellington, the Porangahau farm was run by his father's brothers David and William. Hunter junior took over the running of the farm from his uncles in 1877, and owned it in partnership with his brother Paul. Hunter lived at Porangahau for most of his life. The brothers bred Thoroughbreds at their farm, which have won many prominent races. One of his most famous horses was Cynisca, which won three consecutive Wellington Cups. Like his father, Hunter was prominent in the administration of horse racing, and he submitted the Gaming Amendment Bill to Parliament. The brothers' partnership ended in 1908, with both taking half the land, George Hunter keeping the portion with the homestead. Political career Hunter was a member of Patangata County for over 30 years. He contested the electorate in the , but was beaten by William Cowper Smith. Smith had previously represented Waipawa from to 1887. In the , Hunter was defeated by Charles Hall of the Liberal Party. In the , Hunter defeated Hall, but lost to him in the subsequent election. Hunter was again defeated by Hall in the and s. Hall retired at the , and Hunter beat Albert Jull of the Liberal Party. Hunter continued to serve in the parliament until his death in 1930, beating Jull in and , John Joshua Langridge in , William Ashton Chambers in , and Ernest Albert Goodger (Independent United) and Douglas Barrington Kent (United Party) in . Hunter's death on 20 August 1930 triggered the in the Waipawa electorate, which was won by Albert Jull. Philanthropy After World War I, Hunter gave land valued at NZ¬£30,000 for the settlement of returned soldiers. Family and death On 23 February 1922, Hunter married for the first time. In a small circle of family and close friends, he married Edith May Munro (n√©e Ford). They had a daughter, Elizabeth Hunter, on 1 May 1923. Hunter was conferred a knighthood in the 1921 New Year Honours, the citation reading: > Has rendered valuable assistance in connection with the settlement of > returned soldiers. He fell ill during the first session of the 23rd Parliament in 1929, and was in indifferent health thereafter. He returned to Wellington for the second session in 1930 and died in Wellington on 20 August 1930, survived by his wife and one daughter. The funeral service was held at St Peter's Church in Wellington. The body was then taken by train to Waipukurau. His daughter died in 1999.

Early life Simaika was born on 12 June 1907 in Alexandria to one of the oldest Coptic families which can trace their ancestry to the middle of the 17th Century. The Simaikas were mostly magistrates and notables who prospered in the service of State and Church. His father, Bassili Bey Simaika, was director of Alexandria customs. Before moving to the United States in the 1920s, Simaika was already a well-known Egyptian diving champion. He also held an Egyptian pilot's license. Diving titles In 1927 and representing the Ambassador Swimming Club of Los Angeles, Simaika won the American Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) low board championship and came in second place to Pete Desjardins in the American national fancy high diving competition. He then went on to win the American national fancy high board diving championships in 1930, 1931 and 1932. In 1931, he represented the Hollywood Athletic Club. Simaika's performance in the 1932 American diving championship so impressed the Japanese that they invited him to compete in the Japanese high diving competition held in Tokyo around the year 1932. He won the Japanese title with ease. Olympic glory Competing for Egypt at the 1928 Summer Olympics Simaika won the silver medal at platform high diving and the bronze medal at the 3-meter springboard. Simaika's silver medal was controversial, as the judges first announced Simaika the winner, with the Desjardins coming second. While the band played the Egyptian national anthem, it was discovered that Desjardins won the contest. The Charleston Gazette gives a more detailed account as to why Simaika had his gold medal withdrawn: ‚ÄúThe finals in the men's diving saw one of the most curious incidents of the Olympiad. Simaika, the California-trained Egyptian plunger, finished with top points at 99.58, and the Egyptian flag was hoisted and the Egyptian national anthem sung for the first time of the meeting. But soon afterwards it was announced that a majority of the Judges by a vote of 5 to 4 had decided that Desjardins of Miami was the winner with the best general average of points for the eight dives‚Äù. Later life Having won two Olympic diving medals in addition to four A.A.U. diving titles, Simaika went on to star in the various world's fair water shows from Chicago's Century of Progress to the Billy Rose's Aquacade in Cleveland and New York. In 1934, Simaika and fellow Olympic and A.A.U. diving champion Harold Smith toured the world giving diving exhibitions. During the same year they also toured the US, exhibiting at various local American water carnivals, as part of a national program ‚Äúto help stimulate interest in swimming and diving‚Äù. Simaika also toured Europe diving with his good friend and Olympic nemesis Desjardins. Simaika's high diving act included a blind-folded tandem done with Smith (which they also performed in a Metro Goldwyn Mayer film entitled ‚ÄúDouble diving‚Äù) and 2-a-day 66-foot tower dives at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto. The year 1935 saw Simaika as a ‚Äúspecial student‚Äù at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) as well as coach of the university's diving team. In fact, The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration lists Simaika's education as ‚Äútwo years of college‚Äù. Simaika appeared in three Hollywood films: he did diving stunts in Seas Beneath (1931) directed by John Ford. He then starred, together with Harold Smith, in Metro Goldwyn Mayer's Double Diving, narrated by Pete Smith (1939). He finally starred in Del Frazier's Water Sports (1941) together with Ruth Nurmi and John Deering. Farid Sumaika (1907‚Äì1944). IMDb Marriages Simaika married Mabel Van Den Akker, Hollywood society girl and daughter of a wealthy Hollywood jeweler in Hollywood on 11 February 1929. They divorced in 1931. In 1935, aged 27, Simaika married Betty J. Wilson. When Simaika and Wilson filed an intention to wed notice, the marriage license bureau initially refused to grant them a marriage license because of doubt of whether Simaika was ‚Äúan Egyptian or a Caucasian‚Äù. Existing California laws at the time prevented Caucasians from marrying ‚Äúthose of another race‚Äù. After consulting experts, the county counsel's office in Los Angeles (California) ruled on 26 April 1935 that ‚Äúan Egyptian is of the Caucasian race‚Äù and that ‚ÄúEgyptians were of the Hamitic and Semitic branch of the Caucasian race‚Äù, thereby removing the racial barrier to their marriage. War service and death In March 1942 Simaika received American citizenship, and on 3 August 1942 enlisted in the U.S. Army. The year 1943 saw Simaika training at Lowry Field in Colorado as an assistant intelligence officer of a bombardment group preparing for overseas action. Later that year, he was second lieutenant attached to a bomber unit in the U.S. air corps. It is believed that in 1943 Simaika's plane was shot down over Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. He was declared dead on 10 December 1945 and listed as missing in action. Simaika was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and was promoted in rank to First lieutenant. In 1982 he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. A major road in Cairo's Heliopolis district is named after him.

It is one of three Orthodox Christian jurisdictions in the Philippines. The Exarchate of the Philippines under the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia and the Philippine Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia are the others. History On November 5, 2007, the congregation of the Missionary Servants and Handmaids of St. Francis of Assisi, Inc. applied to join the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of Australia and New Zealand. On February 28, 2008, the mission was accepted in principle by Metropolitan Archbishop Paul Saliba, Primate of Australia, together with Pentecostal Bishop Jeptah Aniceto, now the Vicar of the Davao Vicariate. From May 19 to 22, 2008 Metropolitan Archbishop Paul visited the Philippines for the second time, where he had a colloquium with twelve candidates for ordination to the diaconate and the priesthood in Cogeo, Antipolo City and visited the Antiochian Orthodox communities in Antipolo City (Cogeo Village with 500 members, Bagong Nayon 2 with 500 members, Pagrai with 500 members and Sirona with 500 members), San Jose Del Monte City (Feliciano Subdivision, Brgy.

It is the sequel to Evochron: Alliance 2.0. Evochron Renegades features a vast and seamless universe that lets the player fly anywhere, without loading screens or choppy environment flipping. The game is especially notable for being the successful product of a one-man development studio. Gameplay Evochron Renegades features three main gameplay modes: training, freeform single player (which includes an integrated story), and multiplayer. In either single player or multiplayer, the player can choose their own path in the game: becoming a pirate, miner, mercenary, trader, racer, smuggler, explorer, provider of cleaning services, virtually anything, without having to preselect a profession, guild or race. Multiplayer was not officially announced as a feature of Renegades, but was later announced through a hunt for an unknown easteregg during the beta testing. Testers quickly unravelled textual clues in the games text files, finally resulting in the common understanding the easteregg was in fact a multiplayer mode. The whole game fits into a 30Mb download - it creates such a large and sophisticated universe through using computer code and mathematical algorithms to instantly build images, meshes and textures in a PC's memory (procedural generation), then the game uses these in the same way a normal game would if it were calling fixed files from the hard-drive. Universe The game universe is three-dimensional and is entirely seamless, meaning one can fly from planet to planet and space station to space station, or simply explore other features - given one has the fuel, resources and time. While occasional secrets may be found on such trips, it can take hours or even days of in-game time to fly from planet to planet. To avoid such journeys, every ship can be outfitted with a Fulcrum Drive which allows the player to instantly 'jump' from point to point within range of the capabilities of the equipped Fulcrum Drive. There are five levels of Fulcrum Drive, and a sixth, secret and experimental drive. Also, throughout the universe are Fulcrum Gates which can transport ships through much larger distances in an instant. These gates have a set destination, and form the main paths throughout the game's universe. The final method of transportation are wormholes, which are typically one-way and can send a player to otherwise unreachable locations. Evochron Renegades is the first StarWraith game to feature a seamless universe. Learning curve Evochron Renegades has a steep learning curve, mainly involving the memorisation of numerous keyboard commands. The lengthy interactive training mode at the start of the game instructs new players on the basics of flying, combat, navigation, inventory management, station docking, planetary descents, and trading. There is a short manual (to be found in the program directory), and a strategy guide at the developer's website. There are also fan-made guides such as the interactive The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Evochron Galaxy, and various printable star- system maps. Availability and updates The free demo mode contains 90 minutes of single player gameplay, after the tutorial. At August 2008, both the shareware and full versions of the game are at version 1.88. The game is only available online. There is also a free construction kit and guide, allowing the game to be modded by fans. Reception As a self-distributed shareware game, and one in a tight niche area of gaming, Evochron Renegades has had few mainstream reviews. The game featured on the cover of Game Creators magazine, October 2007.

Biography Hunter was born in Banffshire, Scotland, in 1821. He was the eldest son of George Hunter, the first Mayor of Wellington. He came to New Zealand with his parents, six sisters, and three brothers. He worked in his father's business as a general merchant and shipping agent. His father died in 1843, his father's business partner Kenneth Bethune died in 1855, and Hunter became sole proprietor of the business. Hunter was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Province of New Munster in 1848. He was first elected to the Wellington Provincial Council on 5 November 1857 for the City of Wellington electorate, and served until the abolition of provincial government in October 1876. He was a member of the Wellington Executive Council in 1858, in 1871, and in 1873. He represented the City of Wellington electorate from 1871 to 1879, when he was defeated by William Hutchison. He also sat on the Wellington City Council until 1879, and was defeated by Hutchison when he stood for the Wellington mayoralty. \\"In the early days of the settlement Geo. Hunter II was the chief proprietor of the Island Bay estate and on his stud farm at the bay bred stock and exhibited successfully ... The Island Bay portion was subdivided by the partners and offered for sale by auction by Messrs. Bethune & Co., in March, 1879 ...\\" Hunter also had a farm in Te Aro, which is now part of the Wellington central business district. The central part of his land is now covered by Upper Dixon Street, Percival Street, and Macdonald Crescent. Hunter had a further farm in Porangahau in the Hawke's Bay Region, which he took up in circa 1854. Through purchasing neighbouring land, he increased the size to . Hunter lived in Wellington, and the Porangahau farm was run by his brothers David and William. Sheep numbers increased rapidly, from an initial flock of 500 to 27,000 by 1875. A new shearing shed was built in 1876, and with 30 stands, it is one of the largest ever built in the North Island. Now known as the woolshed, it is listed as a Category I heritage structure by Heritage New Zealand. A chapel built by Hunter in the 1870s near the homestead is registered as a Category II heritage structure. His son took over the running of the farm from his uncles in 1877. He was later joined by his younger brother Paul. Hunter was married to a sister of Major James Paul, who was later Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives (1877‚Äì1880). His wife died in 1868. Hunter died after a short illness at his home in Wellington's Dixon Street on 6 August 1880. His wife and three daughters had died before him; he was survived by two sons and two daughters. His funeral was attended by nearly 100 members of both Houses of Parliament. He was buried at Bolton Street Cemetery. His son George Hunter was also an MP.

It is set in Washington DC and focuses on private investigators Derek Strange and Terry Quinn. The title refers to dialogue from within the novel where two young drug dealers discuss their lives. It is the third novel to involve Strange and Quinn, following Right as Rain (2001) and Hell to Pay (2002). Plot introduction The novel follows private investigators Derek Strange and Terry Quinn as they work on several cases in Washington DC. Strange's main case is to provide evidence for the defense lawyers of drug lord Granville Oliver. Two secondary cases involve the disappearance of women. Characters Derek Strange is an ex-cop and current private investigator. He is recently married to his secretary Janine and lives with her and her son, Lionel. Strange is working on gathering evidence for the defence of drug trafficker Granville Oliver and is searching for a young woman named Devra Stokes. Dewayne Durham is a notorious drug dealer and controls his own small organization. Durham's right-hand man is Bernard \\"Zulu\\" Walker. The dealers who work for him include Jerome Long (aka Nutjob) and Alante Jones (aka Lil J). Dewayne's older brother Mario commands none of the same respect and is eager to prove himself. Mario is searching for Olivia Elliot who recently stole from him. He associates with Donut, a sometime drug dealer who frequently sells fake narcotics. Horace McKinley has inherited some of Oliver's drug trade and is a rival to Durham. His drug dealing crew includes Michael Montgomery and the volatile young Coates cousins, James and Jeremy. Both McKinley and Durham use the same out- of-town gun dealer for their weapons, retired police officer Ulysses Foreman. Foreman lives with his girlfriend Ashley Swann. Plot summary Strange is working on the defence of Granville Oliver. Oliver has been charged with the murder of his uncle and faces the death penalty. Strange is trying to locate Devra Stokes who can discredit the testimony of the prosecution's witness Phillip Wood. He learns that Stokes is working in a beauty salon paid for by Wood's successor Horace McKinley. She refuses to testify. Quinn is working on a separate case for his girlfriend. He believes a group of young men have the information he needs but is unable to get them to talk to him. Dewayne Durham and Horace McKinley are considering eliminating one another's organizations to cut down on competition. McKinley's enforcers James and Jeremy Coates perform a drive-by shooting on Jerome Long and Alante Jones as they deal drugs for Durham. Durham is forced to respond and instructs Long to kill the Coates brothers. McKinley learns that Stokes talked to Strange and tries to intimidate her by sexually assaulting her. Stokes is enraged by his actions and decides to testify. Strange and Quinn are employed to locate Olivia Elliot by Mario Durham. They find her quickly and pass the information to Durham. Durham rents a gun from Ulysses Foreman and approaches Elliot. They argue and he murders her and conceals her body in the woods. He returns the gun to Foreman and admits to firing it but claims he did not shoot anyone. Foreman rents the gun to Mario's brother Dewayne for Jerome Long. Mario goes into hiding with his friend Donut. Long manages to kill Jeremy Coates but is shot by James immediately afterwards. Jones drives his car at James Coates and kills him but is shot as he does so. The police tie the shooting to the murder of Olivia Elliot by matching the gun. Durham learns of the link between the incidents when the police question him; he puts Mario into hiding and begins to suspect that Foreman is working against him. Strange and Quinn are questioned by the police and give them Durham's identity. They try to track Mario themselves as they feel partly responsible for Elliot's murder but the police beat them to Donut. Donut refuses to give up Mario's whereabouts to either the investigators or the police. Mario begins to follow in Donut's footsteps and sells fake narcotics on the street. One of his customers returns and murders him. Strange finds that his home has been burgled and his files relating to the Oliver case stolen. He has an answerphone message threatening him with obstruction of justice as one of the witnesses he interviewed gave him information that he should have passed to the police. Strange was unaware of the requirement and seeks advice from Oliver's legal team. Strange meets with Devra and agrees to relocate her for safety. He begins to follow McKinley and tracks him to Foreman's home where he sells weapons. Strange has Quinn meet him there and Quinn tails McKinley back to his home but is noticed. Strange tracks an employee of Foreman's to a gun store and observes him buying a weapon under false pretences. He passes the information to a contact in the police. He asks Quinn to watch over Devra. Quinn leaves Devra unwatched to return to question the men about his missing girl but is again unsuccessful. He is increasingly agitated about being intimidated by the men. Strange and Quinn meet at the beauty salon and find that McKinley has abducted Stokes. They ambush him at his home and rescue her. McKinley has had his enforcer Mike Montgomery take her son to a separate location. Quinn takes Stokes home and finds that Montgomery has had a change of heart and returned the boy. Strange cuts McKinley and McKinley threatens him in a way similar to the answerphone message. Strange leaves McKinley injured but alive. McKinley calls Foreman for help when he is unable to get hold of Montgomery and tries to recruit him into attacking Durham. When they confront Durham Foreman shoots McKinley and rants about not taking orders from drug dealers. Despite their success with Stokes Quinn is unable to let go of his failure with the other case. He again visits the group of men, this time taking his gun, he intimidates them into giving him the information he needs which he writes down. As he drives away the men ambush and murder him at a stop sign. Months later Oliver is convicted and faces the death penalty despite Stokes's testimony. Dewayne Durham and Ulysses Foreman have been arrested and are facing trial. Quinn's missing girl is found using the information he wrote down. Angry at his partner's violent death Strange returns to the gun store at night and burns it down. Major themes Reviews note the theme of violence. The novel examines some of the social causes for the violence depicted. The Guardian pointed out the irony that the state is working to execute Granville Oliver against Washingtonians' consensus when so many other African American men die on the street. and called this an original argument against the death penalty. The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions to the work of Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police. Literary significance and reception Reviews have praised the novel's realism, believable characters and dialogue, sense of place and the complexity of the novel. The Guardian picked out Pelecano's ability to provide authentic voices for his characters but criticised instances where the narrative voice was inconsistent with the reality of the character. Other reviewers have commented that the gory detail and social realism may be offputting for some readers. The New York Times commented that the blaming of some of the characters' behaviour on the absence of father figures may be an oversimplification. Allusions and references Strange and Quinn continue their partnership from the 2001 novel Right as Rain. The novel follows directly on from Hell to Pay in terms of Strange gathering evidence for the defence of Granville Oliver. Minor characters from earlier novels in the series that appear include Lieutenant Lydell Blue, Oliver's associate Phillip Wood, Strange's prot√©g√© Lamar Williams, Quinn's girlfriend Sue and Strange's young football player Robert Gray. Continuing plot lines include Quinn's relationship with Sue, Strange's relationship with Janine and Lorenzo, Strange's involvement with orphaned Robert Gray and his coaching of a children's football team. Strange is seen to have become more comfortable with himself since his marriage. Strange's reasons for defending Oliver stem from a past incident where Strange was responsible for the death of Oliver's father. The character justifies his defence of the criminal by stating that he is not defending Oliver but his rights. Nick Stefanos, main character of Pelecanos' first three books, appears in the novel. He assists Strange in the arson of the gun store and helps him with his case. Stefanos now works for Elaine Clay, the wife of Marcus Clay from Pelecanos DC Quartet series. Strange and Stefanos meet at his friend Billy Georgelakos' place - Strange has visited there in each of the books he appears in. A reviewer commented that the interweaving of characters from Pelecanos' other novels gives a sense of place and a story larger than the novels themselves. Pelecanos has commented that he deliberately interweaves characters from his novels to create a sense of a fictional universe that parallels the real world.

History The first public reading room and library of Amsterdam was opened at the Keizersgracht on 8 February 1919. The Central Library was opened at the Prinsengracht in 1977 and moved to the Oosterdokseiland in 2007. The video podcast This Week in Libraries (2010‚Äì2014) was recorded in the Central Library. The OBA was selected as the best library of the Netherlands in 2012. Collections As of 2018, the OBA has a general collection of 1.3 million books, CDs, and DVDs. The library also has a number of special collections with books about the history of Amsterdam, children's books from the 17th‚Äì21st century, and books from the Dutch authors Gerard Reve, Hella Haasse, and Boudewijn B√ºch. Branches The OBA has 26 branches in Amsterdam, Diemen, Duivendrecht, and Ouderkerk aan de Amstel.

On the seventh floor is a V&D; La Place self-service restaurant with a south-facing terrace. The cost of the project was ‚Ç¨80 million. The building was designed by Jo Coenen, the former state architect (Rijksbouwmeester) of the Netherlands, who also designed the nearby KNSM Island, as well as the Central Library of Maastricht, and renovated the distinctive Glaspaleis in Heerlen, which houses its Central Library. Arup were selected to create the lighting design to create \\"a landscape with different zones\\" and a system for distributing fresh air which cools the building through drawing in the cold air outside. Children's book section of the Central Library The Central Library is open 7 days per week from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and the lending and returning of books is fully automated. Not only does the OBA provide a large range of printing and copying facilities, but some other unusual features can be found in the library, such as two radio stations. AmsterdamFM is located on the first floor and OBA Live is on the fourth floor. Both radio stations have live broadcasts where the public is welcome to watch. The Muizenhuis made by Karina Schaapman is located in the youth department. It's a doll house for mice, made almost entirely by hand. This Muizenhuis, or Mouse House, is the decor for the adventures of two curious mice called Sam and Julia.

It was applied to Saint Francis of Assisi (1181/82-1226). Francis had been baptized Giovanni (John); his father was Italian and his mother Proven√ßale (at the time not considered French); his father was on business in France when he was born, and when he returned to Assisi, he began to call his son by the nickname Francesco, in the opinion of G. K. Chesterton possibly because out of a general enthusiasm for all things French, or because of his commercial success in France.Chesterton, Gilbert Keith (1924). \\"St. Francis of Assisi\\" (14 ed.). Garden City, New York: Image Books. p. 158. After the canonization of Saint Francis of Assisi in 1228, the custom of naming children after saints led to the popularization of Franciscus as a given name. In the vernaculars of western Europe, the name diversified into the forms Francesco (Italian), Francisco (Spanish and Portuguese), Francesc (Catalan), Fran√ßois (Old French Franceis, whence English Francis), Franz (German, whence Hungarian Ferenc, Scandinavian and Dutch Frans); besides Frans, the Latin form remains commonly given in Dutch. Franciscus may serve as the latinization of any of these given names; conversely, Francis may serve as the anglicization of anyone called Franciscus.

The Act extends to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Originally it was only designed to give small and medium-sized businesses (with 50 or fewer employees) the right to charge interest to larger businesses and public sector organisations of any size. Statutory interest The right to charge interest applies to overdue accounts relating to a sale of goods, the hiring of goods or to a supply of services. The court can modify or exclude the provisions if the conduct of the supplier has been such as to make the imposition of interest, in whole or in part, against the interests of justice. Interest can accrue from the latest of * 30 days after the goods are supplied or the service is completed, * 30 days after receipt of invoice (or the customer is told the amount due is payable). * the agreed date for payment. The \\"statutory interest\\" rate chargeable, which is simple and not compound, is the Bank of England base rate plus 8%. The increment was set to allow the small business to cover late payments by bank borrowings. Compensation chargeable Once statutory interest begins to run in relation to a qualifying debt, the supplier is also entitled to a fixed sum (a) for a debt less than ¬£1000, the sum of ¬£40; (b) for a debt of ¬£1000 or more, but less than ¬£10,000, the sum of ¬£70; (c) for a debt of ¬£10,000 or more, the sum of ¬£100. Ousting the statutory interest Parties cannot contract out of the Act's provisions. However, it is possible to oust the statutory interest requirements, and hence of the compensation provisions, if the contract provides a substantial remedy for late payment, sufficient either for the purpose of compensating the supplier for late payment or for deterring late payment. The meaning of \\"substantial remedy\\" will depend on circumstances and as developed in case law. Suppliers can be expected in time to delete other remedies (except against non-business buyers) and rely exclusively on the Act's generous provisions.Section 8 Arrangement The Act consists of three parts. *Part I Statutory Interest On Qualifying Debts *Part II Contract terms relating to late payment of qualifying debts *Part III General and supplementary Amendments to the original legislation *Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2002. The original legislation was altered from 1 November 2000 to allow small businesses to claim statutory interest from other small businesses. From 1 November 2002, all businesses, including public sector organisations, have been entitled to claim interest from any other business or organisation, including small businesses. Other legislation The Reporting on Payment Practices and Performance Regulations 2017, came into force on 6th April 2017http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/395/made. Under the rules introduced in April 2017, all large UK companies are required to publish specific information regarding their payment policies, practices and performance ‚Äî including the average time taken to pay supplier invoices ‚Äî twice yearly.

Belgium A special law, or qualified majority law, is a type of legislation in Belgium which requires a qualified majority in both chambers of the bicameral Belgian Federal Parliament to be adopted, amended or repealed. The Belgian Constitution determines which laws require a qualified or special majority. Special laws are primarily used in institutional matters and in matters concerning the competences of the communities and regions of Belgium. One of the best known examples is the Special Law of 8 August 1980 on the Reform of the Institutions. A special law must be adopted by both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate in accordance with Article 4, last paragraph, of the Belgian Constitution, which provides that a special law requires a majority of votes cast in both the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking language group, on the condition that an absolute majority of the members of each language group is present, and the total number of votes in favour in both language groups must constitute a supermajority of two-thirds of the total number of votes cast. Canada In Canada, in the event of strike action(s) and/or lockouts, federal or provincial governments can enact \\"Back- to-work legislation\\", a special law, which blocks the strike action and/or lockout from continuing. It can also impose binding arbitration or a new contract on the disputing parties. Such legislation was enacted during the 2011 Canada Post strike and the 2012 CP Rail strike, thus effectively ending these strikes as legal actions. On the provincial level, similar acts can be passed for other purposes; the National Assembly of Quebec enacted Act 78 in 2012 in order to quell a series of student protests. Spain The concept of organic law is similar to the Belgian case. Sweden The law stating how the Parliament functions can only be changed by a qualified majority.

Attractions included metal towers with high dive platforms and zip-line rides over high. The water park has since been acquired by the City of Chesapeake and is under review for redevelopment as a city park. Facility Club Lake Ahoy was a privately owned facility located in Chesapeake, Virginia. The man-made lake was essentially a gigantic swimming pool. It was built on a concrete base with sand that was trucked in and placed on the bottom. The water was supplied by an artesian well. There was a small sandy beach around 3/4 of the lake. The main building housed a snack bar, pool tables and various video and pinball games. At the front of the property was a playground that consisted of wooden see-saws and huge swing sets. The rear of the property had a bath house and restrooms. Adjacent to the lake was a large ranch-style house where the lake owners lived. After years of running the park, the owner sold the property and the lake was drained. The empty blue concrete shell of what once was remains, and is partially full. Nature has begun to take over along the edges of the water making it difficult to see parts of the lake. Attractions Club Lake Ahoy was built in an artificial lake that was outfitted with activities that were not commonly found in other pools or water parks. There were sliding boards of various heights, with water jets at the top to make them fast. Several cement platforms that rose a foot or so out of the water were also part of the lake. They could be used for resting on or for diving. In addition, a merry-go-round ride was a popular attraction in the park. There was also a huge diving well with blue cement walls and high diving boards. The water was approx. deep in the well. Finally, there was a zip line that ran from the top of a wooden tower down to the water. Controversy In 1995, Nelson Harvey Jr. died at Lake Ahoy. The details of his death are not publicly known.

The My≈çtei Dialogues, one of Fabian's two well-known pieces of writing, was a work of Christian apologetics, framed as a dialogue between the fictional Lady My≈çshu and Y≈´tei.

Fabian's apostasy may be attributable to his belief that the Portuguese Jesuits routinely treated their Japanese counterparts as their inferiors.

It is located north of Perth on the A9 road, the main tourist route through Perthshire, in an area of Scotland marketed as Big Tree Country. The village originated from the Victorian era with the coming of the railway in 1856, although the place and name is well known because William Shakespeare mentioned Birnam Wood in Macbeth: Prior to the construction of the railway, the only substantial building on the site of the present village was the church of Little Dunkeld parish, which still stands in its ancient position within a graveyard within the village. Dunkeld, to whose monastery Kenneth MacAlpin, the first King of Scotland, moved the bones of St. Columba around the middle of the 9th century, and which is notable for its cathedral, lies on the opposite bank of the river. Transport Dunkeld and Birnam Railway Station In 1977 Birnam. along with neighbouring Dunkeld, was bypassed by A9. The village is now approximately one hour from Glasgow and Edinburgh, and two hours from Inverness, by car. There are regular bus and coach services to Birnam and Dunkeld along the A9, with long-distance coaches operated by Scottish Citylink. There is access by rail at Dunkeld & Birnam railway station on the Highland Main Line route between Perth and Inverness. Most services on the route extend to either Edinburgh Waverley or Glasgow Queen Street; on Sundays only a southbound train operated by the East Coast Main Line operator extends to London King's Cross via Edinburgh, although there is no corresponding northbound service from London. A daily (except Saturday) London service is offered by the overnight Caledonian Sleeper trains to and from London Euston. Notable people Glen Birnam by John Everett Millais John Everett Millais, who painted many local landscapes, and Beatrix Potter, with her family, often visited Birnam. Potter drafted her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, at Eastwood House whilst writing a story and picture letter to child friend Noel Moore on 4 September 1893. There is an exhibition and garden dedicated to Potter and her characters in Birnam. Dr George Smyttan FRSE HEIC (1789-1863) was born and raised in Dunkeld, and retained links to Birnam all his life.  Attractions  There is an ancient tree, the Birnam Oak, standing a few hundred metres from the centre of Birnam on Murthly Estate. Traditionally, it was known as \\"The Hangman's Tree\\".Smout, T. C., MacDonald, R. and Watson, Fiona (2007) A History of the Native Woodlands of Scotland 1500-1920. Edinburgh University Press. . p.78. The Birnam Oak is believed to be the only remaining tree from the Birnam Wood of Macbeth. In addition to The Beatrix Potter Exhibition and Garden, Birnam also has a community-run arts and performance centre and library, Birnam Arts and Conference Centre.

He etched and painted the same subject. The signature (bottom left) is reversed. A Young Mother at the Entrance to a Wood (1856) by Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot Clich√© verre, also known as the glass print technique, is a type of \\"semiphotographic\\" printmaking.Mayor, 675 (quoted); Griffiths, 139 An image is created by various means on a transparent surface, such as glass, thin paper or film, and then placed on light sensitive paper in a photographic darkroom, before exposing it to light. This acts as a photographic negative, with the parts of the image allowing light through printing on the paper. Any number of copies of the image can be made,Mayor, 675 and the technique has the unique advantage in printmaking that the design can be reversed (printed as a mirror image) just by turning the plate over. However, the image loses some sharpness when it is printed with the plain side of the glass next to the paper.Schenck, 113 Various methods can be used to make the images such as painting or drawing, but the most common, used by Corot and most of the French Barbizon artists, is inking or painting all over a sheet of glass and then scratching the covering away to leave clear glass where the artist wants black to appear.Griffiths, 139 Almost any opaque material that dries on the glass will do, and varnish, soot from candles and other coverings have been used.Schenck, 112; Peres, 97 Clich√© verre is French for \\"glass plate\\": clich√© in French means a printing plate (from which the usual figurative meaning in both languages comes), while verre means glass. Numerous other names have been used for the technique in English and other languages, but none have stuck.Schenck, 112 The making of clich√© verre prints mostly divides into three phases. Firstly it was used, mainly for landscape images, in France from 1853 to about 1875, with some spread to Germany and other countries. After a hiatus, there was then some use among Modernist artists, mostly in Paris, with Paul Klee in 1902 probably the first. From the 1970s it was again taken up, mostly in America. But the hopes of some pioneers that the process would become taken up for the mass printing of images were never fulfilled, as it turned out to be \\"less predictable and more expensive\\" than the conventional printmaking processes.Schenck, 113 History One of the earliest surviving clich√© verre prints, made by Henry Fox Talbot c. 1839, but drawn by another.Schaaf The process was first invented by the English pioneer photographer Henry Fox Talbot \\"in the autumn of 1834, being then at Geneva\\" as he later wrote, when he was also developing the photogram, a contact negative process for capturing images of flat objects such as leaves.Schaaf; Schenck, 112‚Äì113 He described it to the Royal Society (of which he was a Fellow) in 1839.Schenck, 112‚Äì113; Schaaf. It was in an addendum to his ‚ÄúNote Respecting a New Kind of Sensitive Paper‚Äù. The addendum was never published in full, but a summary was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, v. 4 no. 37, 21 March 1839, p. 134, and his original ms, as read to the RS, is in their archive. He made a few examples, drawn by unknown other hands but printed by himself. As he explained when sending a copy of the windmill (illustrated), his drawing was too poor; in fact it was this that had spurred him to investigate photography.Schaaf Two months after this two Englishmen announced, again to the Royal Society, effectively the same process as their own invention, and there was a dispute, but in the end it was not taken to court. In 1841 it was described in the Art of Engraving by T.H. Fielding, and in another manual on photography by Robert Hunt, but not many people in England seem to have used the process, then or later.Schaaf; Schenck, 113 The more productive French involvement in the 1850s began with a group in Arras consisting of the artist Constant Dutilleux, the photographer Adalbert Cuvelier, and L. Grandguillaume, a teacher of drawing. They devised a technique using printer's ink on the plate, which they coated with white lead powder, giving a white surface to \\"draw\\" on. They placed the plate on black cloth, so that as the \\"ground\\" was removed, the image showed as the same black lines on a white background that it would when printed. They introduced the French landscape painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, a friend of Dutilleux and leader of the Barbizon School of landscape painters, to the process in 1853 (when he was already in his late fifties) and he then produced about 65 images over the following twenty years.Schenck, 113 Other artists from the Barbizon School to use the technique, mostly over the next 20 years, included Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Th√©odore Rousseau and Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, perhaps the most prolific and successful of these in the technique. Their subjects were mostly the mixture of landscape and genre subjects found in their other work. Most were already etchers, at the start of the French etching revival. Unlike Corot and the others, it is thought that Daubigny did much of the printing himself. He was an experienced etcher, who sometimes produced prints of a subject in both techniques. Beginning with 17 plates in 1862, he used etching techniques, such as a roulette to produce dotted areas for a tonal effect, and also brushwork.Schenck, 113‚Äì114; Mayor, 675; Griffiths, 139 Many other artists experimented with the technique, and have left a few examples. These include Eug√®ne Delacroix (1854, the single image illustrated below),Schenck, 114 Paul Klee (1902), Man Ray (1917), Picasso (altering normal photographic negatives taken by others), Max Ernst (1931), and Brassai (1930s). In the 1940s the American photographer Henry Holmes Smith innovated by dripping a thick corn syrup onto the plate, letting it dry and enlarging the images. This gave tonal effects around the edges of the \\"domes\\" of dried syrup. He also used coloured paper for colour effects. By this stage most artists were using the technique for abstract work, often including effects of randomness in the spirit of drip painting.Schenck, 113‚Äì115; Peres, 97; \\"The Clich√©-verre: Hand drawn/Light printed\\", Parker Fine Art There was a slight revival in the 1970s, mostly in America.Schenck, 115‚Äì116; Griffiths, 139 Some contemporary artists have developed techniques for achieving a variety of line, tone, texture and colour by experimenting with film, frosted Mylar, paint and inks and a wide assortment of tools for painting, etching, scratching, rubbing and daubing. Scratching a negative is another form of clich√© verre. Felt-tip pen on photographic film has been used, and drawing in sand poured onto glass. Various ways of making polychrome (multi-coloured) images have been explored, and the basic technique has been combined with other materials in collages and other ways.Schenck, 115‚Äì116 Glass prints An obvious English translation of clich√© verre is \\"glass print\\", but this is usually avoided because the term has another meaning. This is a print that has been glued face down onto glass, the paper then being carefully rubbed off to leave the ink film adhering to the glass. This is then hand-coloured and framed as a decorative piece. This was mostly practiced in the late 17th and 18th centuries, with mezzotints.Griffiths, 142 File:Tijger Tigre en arr√™t, RP-P-1953-503.jpgTrapped tiger, Eug√®ne Delacroix's only glass print work,Schenck, 114 1854\\\\.

Data breaches can be quite costly to organizations with direct costs (remediation, investigation, etc) and indirect costs (reputational damages, providing cyber security to victims of compromised data, etc.) According to the nonprofit consumer organization Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a total of 227,052,199 individual records containing sensitive personal information were involved in security breaches in the United States between January 2005 and May 2008, excluding incidents where sensitive data was apparently not actually exposed. Many jurisdictions have passed data breach notification laws, requiring a company that has been subject to a data breach to inform customers and takes other steps to remediate possible injuries. Definition A data breach may include incidents such as theft or loss of digital media such as computer tapes, hard drives, or laptop computers containing such media upon which such information is stored unencrypted, posting such information on the world wide web or on a computer otherwise accessible from the Internet without proper information security precautions, transfer of such information to a system which is not completely open but is not appropriately or formally accredited for security at the approved level, such as unencrypted e-mail, or transfer of such information to the information systems of a possibly hostile agency, such as a competing corporation or a foreign nation, where it may be exposed to more intensive decryption techniques.When we discuss incidents occurring on NSSs, are we using commonly defined terms?, \\"Frequently Asked Questions on Incidents and Spills\\", National Archives Information Security Oversight Office ISO/IEC 27040 defines a data breach as: compromise of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to protected data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. Trust and privacy The notion of a trusted environment is somewhat fluid. The departure of a trusted staff member with access to sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data after termination of the trust relationship. In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in a web of trust. Data quality is one way of reducing the risk of a data breach,The NHS Must Prioritise Quality To Prevent Further Data Breaches partly because it allows the owner of the data to rate data according to importance and give better protection to more important data. Most such incidents publicized in the media involve private information on individuals, e.g. social security numbers. Loss of corporate information such as trade secrets, sensitive corporate information, and details of contracts, or of government information is frequently unreported, as there is no compelling reason to do so in the absence of potential damage to private citizens, and the publicity around such an event may be more damaging than the loss of the data itself.

While security prevention may deflect a high percentage of attempts, ultimately a motivated attacker will likely find a way into any given network. One of the top 10 quotes from Cisco CEO John Chambers is, \\"There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that don't know they have been hacked.\\" FBI Special Agent for Cyber Special Operations Leo Taddeo warned on Bloomberg television, \\"The notion that you can protect your perimeter is falling by the wayside & detection is now critical.\\" Medical data breach Some celebrities have found themselves to be the victims of inappropriate medical record access breaches, albeit more so on an individual basis, not part of a typically much larger breach. Given the series of medical data breaches and the lack of public trust, some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications. Reportable breaches of medical information are increasingly common in the United States. Average cost of data breaches in Germany Consequences Although such incidents pose the risk of identity theft or other serious consequences, in most cases there is no lasting damage; either the breach in security is remedied before the information is accessed by unscrupulous people, or the thief is only interested in the hardware stolen, not the data it contains. Nevertheless, when such incidents become publicly known, it is customary for the offending party to attempt to mitigate damages by providing to the victim's subscription to a credit reporting agency, for instance, new credit cards, or other instruments. In the case of Target, the 2013 breach cost Target a significant drop in profit, which dove an estimated 40 percent in the 4th quarter of the year. At the end of 2015, Target published a report claiming a total loss of $290 million to data breach related fees. The Yahoo breach disclosed in 2016 may be one of the most expensive today. It may lower the price of its acquisition by Verizon by $1 billion. Verizon later released their renegotiation to Yahoo agreeing to lower the final price from $4.8 to $4.48 billion. Cybercrime cost energy and utilities companies an average of $12.8 million each year in lost business and damaged equipment according to DNV GL, an international certification body and classification society based in Norway. Data breaches cost healthcare organizations $6.2 billion in the last two years (presumably 2014 and 2015), according to a Ponemon study. In health care, more than 25 million people have had their health care stolen, resulting in the identity theft of more than 6 million people, and the out-of-pocket cost of victims is close to $56 billion. It is notoriously difficult to obtain information on direct and indirect value loss resulting from a data breach. A common approach to assess the impact of data breaches is to study the market reaction to such an incident as proxy for the economic consequences. This is typically conducted through the use of event studies, where a measure of the event's economic impact can be constructed by using the security prices observed over a relatively short period of time. Several studies such studies have been published with varying findings, including works by Kannan, Rees, and Sridhar (2007), Cavusoglu, Mishra, and Raghunathan (2004), Campbell, Gordon, Loeb, and Lei (2003) as well as Schatz and Bashroush (2017).

Although it was intended by Parliament that the data was to be published, this was to be in redacted form, with details the individual members considered \\"sensitive\\" blanked out. The newspaper published unredacted scans which showed details of the claims, many of which appeared to be in breach of the rules and suggested widespread abuse of the generous expenses system. The resulting media storm led to the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons and the prosecution and imprisonment of several MPs and Lords for fraud. The expenses system was overhauled and tightened up, being put more on a par with private industry schemes. The Metropolitan Police Service continues to investigate possible frauds, and the Crown Prosecution Service is considering further prosecutions. Several MPs and Lords apologised and made whole, partial or no restitution, and retained their seats. Others who had been shamed in the media did not offer themselves for re-election at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.

Its members were Allan Fraser and Daisy DeBolt (1945 - October 4, 2011). Career Allan Fraser and Daisy DeBolt met at a workshop at the 1968 Mariposa Folk Festival. Their first words to each other were \\"I like your voice.\\" As DeBolt puts it, Fraser \\"knocked on the door and that was it, he never left.\\" Not long after, their budding musical romance found them hitchhiking every day from Toronto to Hamilton, Ontario to work on material. By the summer of 1969, Fraser & DeBolt was officially formed as a duo. In 1970 they travelled to the United States on a coffee house circuit tour. During the second week of February, while in upper New York State, they received a message from Ravi Shankar's manager, Jay K. Hoffman. Hoffman signed them to a management contract, and arranged for Fraser & DeBolt to audition for a recording contract. On April 5, 1970, they opened for Tom Paxton at Fillmore East in New York City. The showcase led to two offers, and the duo were signed to Columbia Records. Work began in Toronto on their debut album. They were accompanied by the violinist Ian Guenther with production by Craig Allen, who was also the art director for the album cover. On its release in January, 1971, one critic, John Gabree of the magazine High Fidelity, writing in the album's liner notes, states that it had \\"moments when the only possible responses are to laugh aloud or to cry, and there are very few aesthetic experiences that genuinely produce those effects.\\" Reviews appeared in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Free Press and other publications. Recording commenced in late 1971 for the follow-up album, With Pleasure, which featured musicians from the Canadian band, Simon Caine. The duo continued to tour and perform across Canada and the United States and, in 1974, they represented North America at the International Song Festival held at Sopot, Poland. Fraser & DeBolt broke up not long after, except for a few reunion appearances. In November 1994, their story was told in an episode of Adrienne Clarkson Presents on CBC-TV. As recently as January, 2004, their first album was still on the playlists at the radio station WFMU in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Canadian Champ was ridden by jockeys David Stevenson and Eugene Rodriguez. When he raced in 1957 at age four, Canadian Champ's best results were a win in the Swynford Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack and three stakes race seconds. Stud record Standing at E. P. Taylor's Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, between 1959 and 1968, Canadian Champ notably sired the 1963 Canadian Triple Crown winner, Canebora, and the 1966 Queen's Plate winner, Titled Hero. In 1969, he was sent to a breeding operation in Japan, where he died in 1978 at the age of twenty-five. In 2007, Canadian Champ was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Joan Baez states in the documentary film No Direction Home that the song was inspired by a hotel clerk who refused to allow Dylan a room due to his \\"unwashed\\" appearance (he was not famous outside of the folk movement at this time). The song then grew into a sprawling epic allegory about vanquishing the oppressive \\"powers that be\\". Another inspiration was the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill song, \\"Pirate Jenny\\". According to biographer Clinton Heylin, \\"When The Ship Comes In\\" was written in August 1963 \\"in a fit of pique, in a hotel room, after his unkempt appearance had led an impertinent hotel clerk to refuse him admission until his companion, Joan Baez, had vouched for his good character\\". Heylin speculates that \\"Jenny's Song\\" from Brecht and Weill's Threepenny Opera was also an inspiration: \\"As Pirate Jenny dreams of the destruction of all her enemies by a mysterious ship, so Dylan envisages the neophobes being swept aside in 'the hour when the ship comes in'.\\" Dylan's former girlfriend Suze Rotolo recalls that her \\"interest in Brecht was certainly an influence on him.

Dylan later performed the song at Carnegie Hall on October 26, 1963; this performance was included on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack (2005).

Along with the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the tales are the basis of various poems and a genre of wayang (shadow puppetry) known in East Java as wayang gedhog (the meaning here is unclear, as \\"gedhog\\" means \\"a thumping sound\\").Holt (1967), p. 124, who says the meaning is unclear. In this book, which is often cited as a reference, the word was misprinted as \\"godeg\\". Panji tales have been the inspiration of Indonesian traditional dances, most notably the topeng (mask) dances of Cirebon and Malang, as well as gambuh dance-drama in Bali. Especially in the environs of Kediri, the suggested homeland of the tales of Panji, local stories grew and were connected with the obscure legendary figure of Totok Kerot.Timoer (1981) Panji tales have spread from East Java to be a fertile source for literature and drama throughout Malaya, a region that includes modern-day Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Characters and names Panji and the other characters in the Panji cycle appear with various names in different versions of the tale, including Raden Panji, Raden Inu, Inu (of) Koripan, Ino (or Hino) Kartapati, Cekel Wanengpati, and Kuda Wanengpati of Janggala. Panji is also found as the name of a prince in a number of kingdoms, such as that of Tabanan, ruled by Shri Arya Kenceng in 1414 (Babad Arya Tabanan.) In Thailand, he is called Inao or Enau () or Enau (of) Kurepan, or Raden Montree. In Myanmar (formerly Burma), he is known as Inaung or Enaung (). Panji is the prince of the Kuripan (Koripan) or Janggala. He is usually depicted in an unadorned helmet-like rounded cap. The mask for Panji has a smooth white or green face; narrow, elongated eyes; a straight and pointed nose; and delicate, half-open lips. Panji is engaged to be married to Candra Kirana (also known as Sekartaji), the princess of Daha (Kediri), when she mysteriously disappears on the eve of the wedding. Later in the story, she is sometimes called Kuda Narawangsa when she appears disguised as a man. Panji's principal adversary is Klono (Kelana Tunjung Seta), a ferocious king who desires Candra Kirana and tries to destroy Daha to get her. Other common characters are Gunung Sari (Candra Kirana's brother), Ragil Kuning or Dewi Onengan (Panji's sister married to Gunung Sari), Wirun, Kartala and Andaga (relatives and companions of Panji). Synopsis Balinese painting of Prince Panji meeting three women in the jungle There are differing versions and episodes of the overall Panji story. In one version,as outlined in Holt (1967), p. 274. Three variations are given on pp. 307‚Äì314. The main story of Panji tells of the romance between Prince Panji and Princess Kirana; and Panji's search for his long lost bride. Smaradhana The kakawin Smaradhana originally was the work of the poet Mpu Dharmaja in early 12th century. However, it was later incorporated as a prelude to the Panji tales. This story tells about the disappearance of Kamajaya and his wife, Kamaratih from svargaloka who were burnt by the fire of Shiva. The spirits of Kamajaya and Kamaratih fell upon the earth and were incarnated several times as mortal human beings.Soekmono (1973), p. 117. The main characters of Panji cyle are Prince Panji and Princess Kirana, the notable incarnations of Kamajaya and Kamaratih on earth. The following are several episodes of the compilation of Panji stories: Chandra Kirana The tale of Chandra Kirana (sometimes called the tales of Dewi Anggraeni) is a tragic love story, the prequel to the main Panji story. The story begins with the arranged marriage of Prince Panji Asmoro Bangun to Princess Chandra Kirana from the twin neighboring kingdoms of Kediri and Janggala. The dynastic marriage was meant as a means of a peace agreement to reunite the two warring factions of the once great kingdom under one dynasty again. During his youth, the prince of Jenggala loved to travel the country, visit ashrams and hermitages and learn from various wise Brahmins and rishis across the kingdom. During his stay in one of the remote hermitages, the prince fell in love with a beautiful commoner girl, Dewi Anggraeni. The prince married Anggraeni and took her home to the palace in the capital city of Jenggala. The marriage of a prince with the commoner girl caused an uproar in the royal courts of both Jenggala and Kediri. The angered Kediri envoys pushed the royalty of Jenggala to keep their promise of the arranged dynastic marriage, and they threatened to wage war if the marriage to Dewi Anggraeni was not annulled. However, the love-struck Prince did not want to fulfill his royal duty and refused to marry Kirana. To avoid war, the elders of royal house plotted the assassination of Dewi Anggraeni. Panji and Anggraeni were separated and tricked by being told to meet each other in different places. Actually Anggraeni was led by the royal troops deep into a forest to be murdered. After she learned that their action was meant to avoid war and bloodshed between two kingdoms, the poor girl willingly sacrificed herself and gave up her life. After Panji learned about the death of Anggraeni, the prince went amok, fell unconscious, and finally lost his mind. The insane prince suffered from amnesia and wreaked havoc across both kingdoms, attacking villages authorities, lords, and bandits alike. Meanwhile, in Kediri Princess Kirana has learned about fate of her future husband, and has decided to go out from the palace to find and help him. Princess Kirana, disguised as a man, is later involved in a battle with Panji and finally manages to cure the Prince from insanity. Surprisingly Princess Kirana looks exactly like the late Anggraeni, as actually they both were incarnated from the same spirit, that of Kamaratih, the goddess of love. Panji and Kirana are then united in marriage and live happily ever after. Panji Semirang The episode of Panji Semirang tells another version of the story. The story begins with the disappearance of Candra Kirana from the palace. After Candra Kirana disappears, a princess who claims to be Candra Kirana, though different in appearance, attempts to console Prince Panji, and alleges that she was carried off by Durga, and will regain her original appearance as soon as they are married. Panji orders preparations for the wedding to resume, not knowing that the consoler is in reality a demon-princess who wants Panji for herself. Meanwhile, the true Candra Kirana, alone in the forest, is advised by the gods that she must return to the palace disguised as a man to be reunited with Panji. She does so, and upon entering the city, discovers the wedding plans to the false Candra Kirana, delivers a letter to Panji revealing the true situation, and vanishes. Upon discovering this, Panji rushes to search for his love while his courtiers kill the demonic impostor. Panji in his search undergoes many adventures, staying in forests with hermits, working as a servant in different palaces, always hoping to find traces of his lost bride. Candra Kirana, meanwhile, continues in her male disguise, undergoes her own set of adventures, and ends up as the king of Bali. In the climax of the story, Panji and Candra Kirana unknowingly oppose each other on the battlefield. There, as witnesses are ordered to leave, she confides to her opponent that she is the bride of Panji, and that the disguise was assumed because of a command of the gods that she could win back her prince only in a face-to-face combat where his blood is made to flow. Still not aware that she is fighting her prince, they continue the fight with swords and arrows, but she is unable to harm him until she resorts to her hairpin. As Panji is wounded, he reveals his identity, and they are happily reunited. Ande Ande Lumut The episode Ande Ande Lumut tells another version of the union between Prince Kusumayuda and Kleting Kuning. She is the youngest of four sisters, all daughters of a widow in a village within the Prince Kusumayuda's father domain. The widow daughters were named according to colors: the eldest is Kleting Abang (Kleting Merah/Red Kleting), next is Kleting Biru (Blue Kleting), then Kleting Ijo (Green Kleting), and the youngest is Kleting Kuning (Yellow Kleting). All of Kleting Kuning's older sisters are jealous because Kleting Kuning is very beautiful. Kleting Kuning actually is an adopted foster daughter, and the missing princess of Janggala kingdom, later known as Dewi Candrakirana. Keleting Kuning was betrothed to Prince Kusumayuda and he never forgot the face of the beautiful young princess meant to be his future consort and the future queen of Banyuarum kingdom. He continued to love her and look for her even after they were separated when the princess became lost as a child. Batik depicting Yuyu Kangkang emerging from the river. After many years of Kleting Kuning living in the village with the widow's family, a rich and handsome eligible bachelor named Ande Ande Lumut declared that he was searching for a bride. Many girls across the kingdom were smitten and interested in becoming his wife, including Kleting Kuning's sisters. Only Kleting Kuning was not interested since she had not forgotten the youthful face and betrothal to Prince Kusumayuda. However a magical crane told Kleting Kuning to participate in this event where her true fate awaited her. All of the girls dressed up beautifully, putting on their make-up and marched together towards Ande Ande Lumut's house. However her stepmother ordered Kleting Kuning not to dress up and even disguised her beauty in ugly and dirty clothes, hoping one of her own daughters, who were Kleting Kuning's elders, would win more favor and the bachelor's heart. She even gave her a sapu lidi (a simple broom made of coconut leaf spines) to carry, in order to make Kleting Kuning looks like a poor servant, however actually it was a magical broom. In their journey, the girls had to cross a large river without any ferry services. The river was guarded by a giant freshwater crab named Yuyu Kangkang. Yuyu Kangkang offered to take the girls across the river, riding upon its back, in return for a kiss. In order to reach Ande Ande Lumut's house as fast as possible, the girls hastily agreed on this arrangement and allowed Yuyu Kangkang to kiss them. Kleting Kuning arrived late at the river bank after he had taken the others across, and again Yuyu Kangkang offered its service for a kiss. Of course Kleting Kuning, who always upheld her modesty and chastity, refused. Yuyu Kangkang, angered with Kleting Kuning refusal, tried to eat her. In defense Kleting Kuning tried to hit the crab but missed and hit the river with her broom and magically all the water in the river dried up, and Kleting Kuning was able to cross the river safely. Yuyu Kangkang was trapped on the dry banks and was very scared and he begged her for her mercy and forgiveness and to return the river to its home as it was before. Kleting Kuning felt sorry for him and again hit the ground with the broom and the water returned washing the relieved Yuyu Kangkang downstream. By then, Kleting Kuning's sisters had reached Ande Ande Lumut's house where they were greeted kindly by Ande Ande Lumut's mother and served refreshments. Although the girls are pretty, and Ande Ande Lumut liked them, he refused all of them because he could detect the smelly pungent fishy kiss of Yuyu Kangkang on them. Finally Kleting Kuning arrived, dirty and simply dressed like a servant, which is how her sisters introduce her to Ande Ande Lumut's mother who asked her to wait outside. However Ande Ande Lumut received her warmly, as he could see the true beauty beneath and invited her in. After he speaks to her, he realizes that Kleting Kuning is the princess, his long lost love. At that moment Kleting Kuning also realizes that Ande Ande Lumut is actually Kusumayuda, her beloved prince. They are reunited, soon are married and live happily ever after. Keong Emas Another episode is the sequel to the main story. The tale of Keong Emas takes place after the union of Panji Asmoro Bangun and Sekartaji in a marriage. There are several versions of the tale, but usually the story begins with Sekartaji being magically transformed into a golden snail. The golden snail is found and kept as a pet by a poor widow fisherwoman named Mbok Rondo. Magically Sekartaji is able to turn back into her human form for some period to pay back the widow's kindness by cooking her delicious dishes and cleaning her house, leaving her snail shell behind. The curious Mbok Rondo hides in waiting and finally discovers that the snail is a young woman and she breaks the snail shell and thus undoes the magic spell. Sekartaji is adopted as the widow's daughter and together they set out to reunite her with her husband, Panji Asmoro Bangun. Origin In these romances, he is said to do deeds traditionally ascribed to mythical ancestors,Wagner (1959), p. 92. and it has also been conjectured that the basis of the story reflects an ancient sun and moon myth. Some details of Panji may also be based on Kame√ßvara, a twelfth-century Javanese king of Kediri.Coomaraswamy (1985), p. 207. While the details of Panji's consort, Chandra Kirana, was based on queen √ári Kirana. The curious thing is, the kingdoms in the tale was switched from the historical kingdoms. In the tale Panji was said to be the prince of Janggala, while the historic Kame√ßvara was the prince of Kediri. Vice versa, in the tale, Chandra Kirana was said to be the princess of Kediri, while the actual historic √ári Kirana was the princess of Janggala. In the Surakarta court poet Rangga Warsita's genealogy Pustaka Radja Mada, the Javanese kings, including Panji, are considered the descendants of the Pandavas of the Mahabharata.Brandon (1970), p. 9. Appearances in art and literature Scenes from the Panji cycles appear in the narrative reliefs of the walls of East Javanese candi from the 13th century, where they are presented gracefully, naturalistically and delicately, in contrast to wayang style. Sunan Giri is credited, along with other innovations in wayang, with the creation of wayang gedog in 1553, to enact the Panji stories.Brandon (1970), p. 6. Wayang kulit performances of the Panji cycle are in general the same as in performances of the wayang purwa (those based on the Indian epics); however, because of their material they are considered less significant. In addition, their headdresses are simpler and the garment worn on the lower body is based on Javanese court dressScott- Kemball (1970), p. 41. Plots based on the Panji cycle are also common in East Javanese wayang klitik (using wooden puppets), in West Javanese wayang golek (using three-dimensional rod puppets), and in wayang beber (stories depicted pictorially on scrolls). It is also the principal basis of the stories used in wayang topeng (masked dance-pantomime). In Bali, where the cycle is known as Malat, the story is performed in the Gambuh plays and in the operatic Arja.

The water of the two canal companies was kept apart by a stop lock in the narrows at the end of the later Macclesfield Canal, but this has long since been de-gated and the two canals run at the same level. History The Peak Forest Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1794, which was designed to access the limestone deposits at Doveholes, near Whaley Bridge. The canal ran from Dukinfield Junction on the Ashton Canal to Bugsworth Basin, from where a tramway ran the final to the quarries, which were over above sea level. There were two level pounds on the canal, separated by a flight of 16 locks which raised the level by . Most of the canal opened in 1800, but the locks were not completed until 1804 and a second tramway was used to bypass the locks until they were ready. Although a route through Macclesfield to connect the Trent and Mersey Canal to Manchester had been suggested as early as 1777, an Act of Parliament was not obtained until 1826, following a survey by Thomas Telford. The canal opened on 9 November 1831, and like the Peak Forest, was built as two level sections, with a flight of locks between them, in this case the twelve Bosley locks, which raise the level by . The junction with the Peak Forest Canal is just above the top lock of the Marple flight. The limestone traffic on the upper Peak Forest Canal ceased in 1922 and the upper section gradually became unusable. The lower canal was also disused by 1939. Following determined efforts by the Peak Forest Canal Society, the Inland Waterways Association, the British Waterways Board and the local authorities (through whose regions the canals ran), both the Peak Forest and Ashton Canals were reopened in 1974; this provided Marple Junction with its connection to the national network. With the reopening, the junction was again operational. Location The top lock of the Marple flight is immediately to the north of the junction. From the bottom of the locks, the canal passes through Hyde Bank Tunnel and Woodley Tunnel to reach Dukinfield Junction, away. To the south-east, the canal is level for to its terminus at Bugsworth Basin, which has been restored by the Inland Waterways Protection Society. The Macclesfield Canal initially heads south-west before turning to the south. A footbridge carries the towpath from the west bank of the Peak Forest Canal to the south bank by the junction, but it very quickly crosses back to the western bank of the Macclesfield Canal at Church Lane Bridge. The canal is level for to the top of the Bosley flight and continues on to reach Hall Green stop lock, its junction with the Trent and Mersey Canal, at . The whole of the canal is a designated conservation area, following action by Macclesfield Borough Council in June 1975, as a response to a policy document entitled Recreational Framework for Britain's Canals.

The area has been designated by Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council as a conservation area. It is adjacent to Portland Basin, and the names are often used as synonyms by boaters, whilst locals refer only to Portland Basin. Strictly speaking, Portland Basin is the wide area on the main line of the canal. The arm under the junction bridge and the aqueduct over the River Tame were built by the Ashton Canal, and the junction with the Peak Forest canal was historically at the southern end of the aqueduct. History The towpath bridge crosses the Peak Forest Canal. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal is ahead, and the Ashton Canal is behind the photographer. The Ashton Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1792, to connect the coal mining area around Oldham and the textile mills of Ashton-under-Lyne to Manchester. It was heavily-locked, with 18 locks in . During construction, the company obtained a second Act to allow them to build the Hollinwood Branch Canal, the Stockport Canal and the Beat Bank Branch Canal. The line to Ashton and the branch to Hollinwood were both opened in December 1796, and the Stockport Branch opened in January 1797, but the Beat Bank Branch was never completed. The Peak Forest Canal was authorised two years after the Ashton Canal, to access limestone reserves at Doveholes, near Whaley Bridge. The final were built as a tramway, as the quarries were too high to make access by canal economic, and the limestone was transhipped to barges at Bugsworth Basin. The canal is on two levels separated by a flight of locks at Marple which had not been completed when most of the canal opened in 1800. A temporary tramway bypassed the locks until they were completed four years later. The Ashton Canal built a short section of canal southwards from the junction, which included an aqueduct over the River Tame, and the Peak Forest Canal officially started at the southern end of the aqueduct. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was also authorised in 1794, and is one of three which cross the Pennines. It was a huge undertaking, with 74 locks and the longest canal tunnel in Britain at Standedge. Sections were opened at both ends as they were completed, with that from Ashton to Greenfield opening in 1798. The canal was not fully opened until 1811, with the completion of the tunnel. It joins the Ashton Canal end-on at the junction. Restoration The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was abandoned in 1944. The Peak Forest Canal had ceased to be used by the start of the Second World War in 1939, and the Ashton Canal was unnavigable by 1962. However, the Peak Forest Canal Society was formed, and working with the British Waterways Board, the local councils through which the canals ran, and the Inland Waterways Association, the Ashton Canal and the lower Peak Forest Canal were reopened in 1974, bringing the junction back into use. A campaign for the restoration of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal began in the same year, but was not completed until 2001, helped by public funding from the Millennium Commission. Ashton Canal Warehouse The restored waterwheel The Ashton Canal Warehouse was built at the Portland Basin in 1834 by the canal company replacing the early warehouse to the east. It is a three-storey warehouse by , brick built in English garden wall bond. The wooden floors are supported by cast iron columns. The southern elevation which opened to the canal was 3 storeys high and it had three shipping holes. The northern elevation which opens to the road is two storeys high, trap doors allowed split loading and unloading between the road and the 3 canal arms. The roof was flat allowing increased storage. The building we see today is the result of a 1998 restoration. Portland Basin water wheel The internal hoist system was powered by an external waterwheel. The head race was taken from the canal, and the tailrace fed down to the River Tame below. The high breastshot waterwheel was constructed in 1841 to a suspension design introduced by Thomas Hewes and William Fairburn and had rim gearing. It cost ¬£1078. It was in diameter and in width and produced . Power was transmitted by a line shaft. Using a suspension system, akin to the spokes on a bicycle, allowed the wheel to be lighter than the wooden one it replaced. Taking the power train off the rim rather than from axle reduces the stress and gears up the line-shaft leading to less power loss. Portland Basin Museum Portland Basin is the location of the Portland Basin Museum, housed within the restored nineteenth century Ashton Canal Warehouse, covering the area's industrial heritage. The warehouse was built in 1834, and interprets aspects of local history, industry and trades. Exhibits include a 1920s period street with shops, period room displays and historic machines. Wooden Canal Boat Society Forget me not (1927), at the basin in September 2010 The Portland Basin hosts the Wooden Canal Boat Society which has restored and works six traditional narrowboats. The Society was formed as a charitable company limited by guarantee in 1996, and took over the assets of the former Wooden Canal Boat Trust in 1997. It became a registered charity in 1998, and the first boat was moved to Portland Basin Museum in 1996. Location The junction is located on the southern edge of Ashton-under-Lyne, and the Ashton Canal approaches it from the south-east. The canal is level for to Fairfield Junction, where the Hollinwood Branch turned north, and the Fairfield locks begin the descent to Manchester. The Peak Forest Canal heads south, and is level for to the first of the sixteen Marple Locks. It passes through two short tunnels at Woodley and Hyde Bank, the second of which is slightly too narrow to allow two boats to pass. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal heads to the north-east, and passes through a tunnel under an Asda supermarket to reach the first of 32 locks that ascend to Standedge Tunnel, from the junction. A slender bridge carries the towpath over the line to the aqueduct and the Peak Forest Canal. It carries the date 1835, and is a grade II listed structure. Nearby is Cavendish Mill, a former cotton spinning mill built in 1884-5, and one of the first to use steel girders and lintel plates to support concrete floors, rather than using brick arches. The construction method was pioneered by Edward Potts, who failed to obtain a patent for the design in 1884. The junction is the location for the Tameside Canals Festival, held in mid-July each year.

It is the only company in India authorised to produce indelible ink, which is used in elections to prevent people from voting multiple times. The company is owned and operated by the Government of Karnataka under the chairmanship of Mr. Anantha, Ex-Mayor Mysore City Corporation. History The company was started as the Mysore Lac and Paints Limited by the Maharaja of Mysore, Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar in 1937 for manufacturing paints and related products. It became a public sector company when India gained independence in 1947. In 1962, it was selected to manufacture indelible ink, which was first used in the third general election in India. The manufacturing process is a closely guarded secret and is based on a chemical formula devised by the National Physical Laboratory of India. Products=Indelible ink Indelible black ink was initially manufactured by the company to meet the needs of the Indian elections. It is usually applied on the finger nail of the voter and leaves an indelible mark which is not easy to erase. The mark stays on the finger for nearly 20 days. This prevents the voter from exercising the franchise again and hence checks fraud. One of the major customers for this ink is the Election Commission of India which places orders based on the number of voters involved in the election. The ink is then supplied to the Chief Electoral Officers who further distribute it to individual voting centres. The indelible ink is supplied in vials having volumes of 5 ml, 7.5 ml, 20 ml, 50 ml and 80 ml. A 5 ml vial can be used for about 300 voters. It is estimated that around 300 million people have had this ink applied over a period of 45 years. The ink is also exported to countries like Thailand, Singapore, Nigeria, Malaysia and South Africa. It has also started manufacturing marker pens containing this ink for easy usage and this has also been used in elections held in Afghanistan. The company also manufactured indelible ink for Cambodian elections in 2008 and 2012. Other products The company also manufactures other products such as chemical-resistant paints, enamels, primers, distempers, sealing wax, postage stamp cancellation, and polishes. The sealing wax manufactured by the MVPL is used by India Post, and the Election Commission to seal Ballot boxes was the first product to be manufactured by them. Business The company's business is highly dependent on the Indian general election (held once in five years) and in a year when the elections are held, significant increase in the revenue is observed. In the financial year 2006‚Äì2007, the company earned profits of 18 million (about $450K). For the general elections held in India in the year 2004, the company supplied orders worth 40 million (about $1 million). It earned 12.8 million (about $320K) when it supplied ink to the general elections held in Cambodia in 2008.

Islamic flags Green was used as the color of the banners of the historical Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimid banner was in use until 1171, and thus during the first century of the crusades, and by this way has taken influence on Christian heraldry, where the tincture vert was very rarely if ever used for the field (background) until the end of the Middle Ages (indeed the term sinople used to signify a reddish color until the 14th century, and only after c. 1400 did it change its meaning to refer to green as a heraldic tincture). Today, green is also used in several national flags as a symbol of Islam. These include: Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Comoros, Iran, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. and Sri Lanka. Some Arab countries also use pan-Arab colors which feature green as its component to represent the aforementioned Fatimid Caliphate, though not to Islam directly. These include: Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Sudan, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several contested states including Palestine, Somaliland, and Western Sahara. Libya formerly also followed this principle, featuring green as its only component color to imitate the Fatimid Caliphate's flag (at the time the only flag in the world to use only one color) until 2011. There are also several flags of Muslim- majority countries featuring green color that does not symbolize Islam. Examples include Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Senegal (in the latter four cases, the green color is a component of the pan-African colors, which are also adopted by even Christian-majority countries such as Malawi and South Sudan).

History As a settlement, Teriberka was first mentioned circa 1523. Eyewitnesses from that time period confirmed the appearance of permanent Russian settlers. However, according to other sources, it was founded in the 1860s‚Äîthe decade when the Murman coast was actively being settled.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 23 By the end of 19th century, it was well-developed: having a church, a lighthouse, and a weather station (the first one on the Murmansk coast). Names of the geographical features of the area, such as Cape Deploranskogo, Zavalishina Lip, and others relate to the Peter's Great expedition. In the beginning of the 20th century, Teriberka had well-developed cod and shark fishing businesses (undertaken mostly by the Norwegians who owned a factory and a store). By the end of the 1920s, the first collective farm was organized in the village; it included a dairy farm and a reindeer herd in addition to the fishing boats. Before World War II, fishermen and dairy farm workers of the collective farm were honored several times for their achievements and were sent to the VDNKh in Moscow. A shipyard construction in the village of Lyudeyny started around the same time. Teriberka developed quickly after the war. In the 1940s‚Äì1960s, there were two fishing farms, two dairy farms, a poultry farm, a 2000-head reindeer herd, an American mink breeding farm, and two fish processing facilities in the village, as well as shops and warehouses of the White Sea base of Goslov (a government-sponsored organization of skilled workers). Repair facilities of the shipyard were working at their full capacity and were being expanded. Active construction of housing and public organizations was underway. The village had a stadium, a community center, workers' clubs of the shipyard, a fish processing facility, a Young Pioneers club, two schools (elementary and secondary), a boarding school for children from the coastal settlements, one inpatient and one outpatient hospital, and an ambulance station. Teriberka became the administrative center of a district and was growing and developing at a very fast rate. The downfall began in the 1960s, when the district was transferred to the jurisdiction of the town of Severomorsk. As ship tonnage increased and fishing fleets were able to travel more easily in the open ocean, the coastal fishing business became less important. A newly constructed fish processing complex in Murmansk put smaller processing facilities in Teriberka out of business. During the process of \\"enlargement\\", the collective farm \\"Murmanets\\" was abolished along with its mink farm. Goslov's White Sea base fell apart, the reindeer herd was transferred to the village of Lovozero, and the fish processing plant was shut down because large fishing vessels were not able to enter the river from the ocean. In the 1980s, a school of salmon was destroyed during the construction of the Teriberka River hydroelectric plants. In the 2000s, the village was again subordinated to the district instead of the town of Severomorsk.

In configuration, it resembles a miniature Times Square, a spatial \\"bow-tie\\" created by the geometry of the street intersections.Bronx Hub It is a primary shopping district for Bronx residents, and many new hip hop trends can be found in the Hub long before they spread to the rest of New York City and the world.

Accessed September 23, 2007. Between 1900 and 1930, the number of Bronx residents increased from 201,000 to 1,265,000. Inhabitants throughout the borough shopped in department stores and boutiques at 149th Street and 3rd Avenue, an area that came to be known in this time as \\"the Hub\\". In the 1930s the Hub had movie palaces and vaudeville theaters.A Brief Look at The Bronx , Bronx Historical Society. Accessed September 23, 2007. These included the Bronx Opera House, which today operates as a boutique hotel, and the former Jackson Theatre. A few decades after it became a national symbol of urban decay, the South Bronx is now home to several new construction projects that are rebuilding neighborhoods that have seen little new construction in half a century. On March 14, 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other elected officials took part in the symbolic groundbreaking ceremony for the new \\"Hub Retail and Office Center\\". After a year and a half of construction, the Hub Retail and Office Center opened in the middle of 2007. Current tenants include Staples, Rite Aid, and Forman Mills, a clothing store opening its first New York store in the Bronx. Upcoming tenants include Nine West and Sleepy's. As a result, the Hub's district is extended to East 156th Street in Melrose. Shopping traffic in the Hub is generated via foot, car, and public transportation. The sidewalks in the Hub are often packed with people. Merchants hawk their wares by calling out to the crowd or passing out small handbills. Music stores offer a wide selection of hip-hop, reggae, gospel, and Latin music. Craft stores have knitting and sewing supplies. Local clothing stores such as Revolution Boutique compete with major chains like Jimmy Jazz and Foot Locker. Triangle Plaza Hub A new complex with mixed-use office and retail space that is slated to open in the fall of 2015. Notable tenants already include Fine Fare Supermarket, Metropolitan College of New York, Vistasite Eye Care and Boston Market.

In 1902 a large Grand Union Station was proposed near the now- closed 138th Street station, half a mile from the Hub, which would have been served by many of the railroads entering Manhattan at the time. However, this was never built. The 149th Street station on the Third Avenue elevated operated from 1887 to 1973. ReferencesExternal links *THE HUB, BUB.

Size The line was not recognized by any statute of the English Parliament but was usually understood as of a barleycorn, which itself was recognized by statute as of an inch but often reckoned as of an inch instead. The line was eventually decimalized as of an inch, without recourse to barleycorns. The button trade used the term, redefined as of an inch. In use Botanists formerly used the units (usually as inch) to measure the size of plant parts. Linnaeus's Philosophia botanica (1751) includes the Linea in its summary of units of measurements, defining it as \\"Linea una Mensurae parisinae\\"; Stearns gives its length as 2.25 mm. Even after metrication, British botanists continued to employ tools with gradations marked as linea (lines); the British line is approx. 2.1 mm and the Paris line approx. 2.3 mm. Gunsmiths and armament companies also employed the -inch line (the \\"decimal line\\"), in part owing to the importance of the German and Russian arms industries. These are now given in terms of millimeters, but the seemingly arbitrary 7.62 mm caliber was originally understood as a 3-line caliber (as with the 1891 Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle).

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on February 14, 1953, and stars Bugs Bunny. Plot The mailman has delivered a letter to \\"B. Bonny\\" (Bertram Bonny), but when the truck pulls out, the exhaust from the tailpipe causes the letter to drift out of the mailbox and accidentally drop into Bugs Bunny's hole. Bugs, in the middle of his morning workout (including a brief workout of his ears), eventually sees the letter and assumes it is for him (regardless of the slightly different surname); his response after reading it is a shocked \\"Holy cats, I've been drafted!\\" Bugs's going through the Army induction center only causes some small reactions: * After asking a guard for directions, the guard assumes \\"so they're inducting rabbits.\\" * Before Bugs has his X-rays taken, a tall, lanky, tiny-headed person behind him looks down at him and in response looks and chuckles at the audience. When the doctor sees Bugs' skeleton, he assumes he (the doctor) has been overworked. * Bugs also passes the eye exam with flying colors from the first letter right down to the microscopic \\"Reg. U.S. Pat. Off.\\" disclaimer at the bottom of the chart. This joke is a reference to Bugs eating a steady diet of carrots, rich in Vitamin A, which promotes good eyesight. Once in the army, though, he quickly causes problems. His shoes are too big, so when his sergeant calls for the men lined up to \\"about face,\\" Bugs accidentally literally knocks the rest of the line over like bowling pins. Bugs reports to the drill sergeant in basic training. The sergeant calls Bugs forward, where Bugs introduces himself as \\"Private Bugs Bunny reporting, your majesty, sir!\\" The sergeant does not believe it is really Bugs, and sarcastically refers to himself as \\"Sergeant Porky Pig.\\" However, his colonel replies \\"And I am Colonel Putty Tat. General Tweety Pie was asking about you, Sergeant.\\" When the Colonel inspects Bugs and orders him to \\"about face,\\" Bugs knocks over the colonel with his large shoes. As punishment, Bugs and the sergeant ‚Äî now noticeably demoted to three stripes (\\"buck\\" sergeant) ‚Äî take a long hike that sees both of them crawling back to their bunk (at \\"Camp Ono\\" ‚Äî Ono, Pennsylvania also happens to be a hamlet near Fort Indiantown Gap, a former Army base) in the middle of the night. Bugs, after peeling back his sweating shoes, finally lies down in his bunk, but is woken by \\"Reveille\\" seconds later. Bugs, intending to moider that bugler,\\" runs out with a baseball bat and a \\"whack\\" is heard off-screen. After Bugs decides to take a bath, it is shown that Bugs really smashed a record player. Later that morning, the colonel is furiously looking for his helmet. The sergeant finds Bugs taking his bath, using the colonel's helmet as his bathtub. After Bugs makes a comment about cleanliness being next to godliness, the sergeant throws Bugs out and runs off with the helmet full of soapy water ‚Äî only to run into the colonel. The colonel then puts his helmet on and gets splashed, blowing out soap bubbles afterwards. Now demoted to corporal, Bugs's drill-master has Bugs \\"clean and dress\\" the camp's chickens for the officer's dinner dance that night ‚Äî though Bugs has them all dressed in tuxedos. Bugs then tries to nail a calendar to the wall above his bunk using a large ammunition shell instead of a hammer, which causes all the neighboring soldiers to flee their quarters in a panic. The corporal runs up just in time to almost get hit with the shell when it goes off ‚Äî but, much to the corporal's shock, the shell pierces clean through the angry colonel's helmet, making him look like the devil. Now reduced in rank to private, Bugs's former drill sergeant asks the now-bandaged Bugs Bunny what he has against him, asking him why he does not listen to orders, assuming Bugs is causing problems on purpose and hoping to reason with him. As he does, he starts to mention his long ears and then his fur and tail, and finally realizes he really is a rabbit, and runs off to inform his superiors. The general apologizes to Bugs for the mix-up, explaining that Congress did not pass any laws saying that rabbits could be inducted into the military. Bugs, however, wants to do his part for the military. The general tells Bugs there is something he can do ‚Äî Bugs is then seen testing ammunition shells by striking the top with a mallet and marking them as DUD when they do not explode. Bugs then tells the audience, \\"And just think!

History  Wohlsdorf was first mentioned as a village east of Bernburg in 986. It later became a municipality in the Salzlandkreis district and, in 2005, the community belonged to the historic collective municipality of Nienburg. When Nienburg was disbanded in 1 January 2010, it was incorporated into Bernburg, along with the communities of Baalberge, Biendorf, Gr√∂na, Pei√üen, Poley, and Preu√ülitz.  Geography  Included in Wohlsdorf is the village of Cr√ºchern, which was also formerly a separate district. Much of the surrounding area is gently rolling farmland, broken up only by about of woods dividing Cr√ºchern from Wholsdorf. The river Ziethe forms a border between the Wholsdorf subdistrict and the village of M√∂lz, a sub-district of Kleinpaschleben. The Ziethe flows first southwest then southeast along the border of the woods that stretch alongside Cr√ºchern, forming a border between farmland and village of Wohlsdorf. It bends again southeasterly and around the western edge of Biendorf, another village-sub- district of Bradenburg on the southern border of Wohlsdorf.  Transportation  north of the village of Cr√ºchern, Landesstra√üe 149 (L149) meets and becomes the continuation of federal road Bundesstra√üe 185 (B185) as it meets Bundesstra√üe 6n (B6n). Both highways run east towards K√∂then, but B185 runs through Kleinpaschleben, Trinum, Gro√üpaschleben, and K√∂then while B6n runs parallel to B185, avoiding cities and towns by cutting through farmland and curving south around the city of K√∂then to merge into north-south B183. West of L149, B185 continues for towards Bernburg, passing the Latdorf/Dr√∂bel landfill between Latdorf and Dr√∂bel until it meets international European route E49 and becomes B6. Much of the traffic in Wohlsdorf is by car, but outside the subdistrict to the south in Biendorf are train and bus stations.

Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the municipality B√∂rdeaue. Geography The Bode River passes through Unseburg but most of the town is located on its western banks with a small trucking business and residential area located on the eastern side. The town is also located at the northern foot of the Harz Mountain Range, known for its history throughout the Middle Ages such as the witch burnings and architecture of the area. The largest city near Unseburg is Magdeburg, which lies about 25 km northwest of the town. It sits in an ancient riverbed and is one of the oldest civilizations in all of Germany, with multiple archaeological expeditions being conducted there by scientists from around the world. On January 1, 2010, the formerly independent communities of Tarthun and Unseburg united to form the municipality of B√∂rdeaue or \\"Fruitful meadow\\" History The first historical documentation of the town of Unseburg occurs in the church records for the foundation of towns of the Archdiocese of Magdeburg on 7 June 939 with the founding of the Unseburg Fortress. The town remained one of the few surviving in the area after the destruction of the Thirty Years' War of 1618-1648. The name Unseburg means \\"our castle\\" in Middle German - the town was once a large fortress and vital trading port due to the enormous amount of salt and brown coal in the area (the region has been known as the \\"Salt Land\\" () since Viking times). Remnants of the fortress still exist, such as the bell tower of the Lutheran church that is the last surviving watchtower belonging to the fortress. The fortress-town was destroyed in the late Middle Ages after the Bishop of the Archdiocese of Magdeburg ordered a raid on the town after it was taken over by Black knights. During World War II, ammunition, rockets and experimental jet engines were manufactured and stored outside of the town - Wernher von Braun lived there at one point. American bombers tried to bomb the factories multiple times during the war but, being located underground, the targets could not be found. Nevertheless, one damaged American B-24 Liberator that had not reached its targets in Bernburg was forced to drop its payload on the town, damaging multiple residential houses through firebombing as well as breaking several very old stained-glass windows located in the Lutheran Church. The cemetery in town contains the graves of several American and British pilots who died in combat over the skies of Egelner Mulde (this region of Germany saw some of the heaviest air-to-air combat in the whole war). Towards the end of the war, Americans of the 83rd Infantry Division (United States) occupied Unseburg. Some of the Hitler Youth of the town desired to resist but were stopped at the last minute by a senior SA Party Member who lived in the town, knowing that resistance would be futile. Fighting in the town would have assured its destruction. Because the town escaped damage, the Americans used the town as a place of respite as well as a field hospital during the battles of Magdeburg and Barby in April 1945. Soon thereafter, Unseburg became part of the British Occupation Zone and finally it was given to the Russians along with the surrounding areas in exchange for the Russian- occupied half of Austria. All of the occupation forces ransacked the manufacturing facilities outside of the town to give them an edge in the upcoming Cold War.Laudan, Dieter, and Heimatstube Club Unseburg e.V. Personal interview. 7 August 2006. Attractions Sights to see in the town include the Bode River, local Park, Kamplake Lake, Frula Juice Factory, Town Museum located in the old elementary school, numerous biking trails in the area, the American Line dance Club, yearly Christmas market, Karnival-Fasching celebrations, and the local Lutheran Church St. Stephen (Stephan) with its 12th century Tower and Building built in 1839. Monuments On an open area at the crossing of Ernst-Th√§lmann-Stra√üe, August-Bebel-Stra√üe and B√§ckergasse, there is a memorial to the Brown Coal mine \\"Johanne-Henriette\\" that was in operation from 1849-1963. Located in the cemetery is a monument to the dozens of soldiers from the town that were killed in World War II. There is currently a motion to restore it as well as build a new monument for the allied pilots that were buried in the area and later taken back to their home countries after the war. Commerce The town is home to the industrial concrete magnet-manufacturing firm FTW, a local shipping truck firm and the fruit juice factory \\"Frula\\".

These conveyors are suitable for light applications up to 50 kg such as cardboard boxes and tote boxes. A single shaft runs below the rollers running the length of the conveyor. On the shaft are a series of spools, one spool for each roller. An elastic polyurethane o-ring belt runs from a spool on the powered shaft to each roller. When the shaft is powered, the o-ring belt acts as a chain between the spool and the roller making the roller rotate. The rotation of the rollers pushes the product along the conveyor. The shaft is usually driven by an electrical motor that is generally controlled by an electronic PLC (programmable logic controller). The PLC electronically controls how specific sections of the conveyor system interact with the products being conveyed. Advantages of this conveyor are quiet operation, easy installation, moderate maintenance and low expense. Line-shaft conveyors are also extremely safe for people to work around because the elastic belts can stretch and not injure fingers should any get caught underneath them. Moreover, the spools will slip and allow the rollers to stop moving if clothing, hands or hair gets caught in them. In addition, since the spools are slightly loose on the shaft, they act like clutches that slip when products are required to accumulate (stop moving and bump up against each other. i.e. queue up). With the exception of soft bottomed containers like cement bags, these conveyors can be utilized for almost all applications. A disadvantage of the roller lineshaft conveyor is that it can only be used to convey products that span at least three rollers, but rollers can be as small as 17mm in diameter and as close together as 18.5mm. For items shorter than 74mm, the conveyor belt system is generally used as an alternative option.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale and was the strongest earthquake to strike Colombia for 16 years.1999: Colombia quake leaves hundreds dead BBC News Cause This area has a well known high seismic risk, due to the triple junction that occurs at the northwest corner of the South American Plate where the Nazca, Cocos, and Pacific plates converge. About 60% of the existent poorly engineered structures in Armenia collapsed, due to the high number of old structures, built without technical requirements and the lack of urban planning and land studies. Damage The earthquake hit Colombia's coffee-growing region, and toppled tower blocks, hotels, and historic churches in Armenia. Most of the buildings that collapsed were old and poorly constructed, or were built on poor soil such as old landfill sites or steep slopes. The newer structures, for the most part, survived intact due to safety measures being established in 1984. The worst hit part of the country were regional capitals of Armenia and Pereira. In Armenia, about south of the epicentre, single-story homes were demolished. The mainshock produced a rough casualty estimate of about 1,000 people. The first (17:40) aftershock produced a still indeterminate number of victims among the people trying to remove their goods from the semi-collapsed structures. The corpses that were retrieved were carried to the local University of Quind√≠o auditorium to be identified by their relatives. Since the forensic services were out, many of them could not be recognized and were buried in common tombs. The structures of many hospitals were damaged, and the resources available for health care were insufficient even before the event. Furthermore, the area had limited reaction plans for disasters and little experience with triage. As a consequence, the attention to the victims was chaotic. About 4,000 people with various degrees of lesions were attended to in the remaining health care centers of the city. An undetermined number of injured victims (many of them unidentified) were carried by airplane to different cities (mainly Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, and Cali), and out of the country. The number of missing people as a result of the earthquake is estimated to be near 3,900. Some factors involved in the disappearance of these people are the security issues due to the riots, the collapse of communications and roads, the lack of coordination of the rescue forces, dispatch of the injured victims and identification of the corpses. Mainly the injuries in the earthquakes were made by collapsing buildings which broke bones, caused concussions, bruises, cuts and many more injuries. Aftershocks A shock occurred at 15:40 (22:40 UTC) with a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale. Other aftershocks that caused panic among the inhabitants were on January 29 at 23:33 (M4.2) and January 31 at 03:03 (M3.5) Response Colombian authorities imposed a dawn-till-dusk curfew to allow rescue workers to work unhindered. Looting was widespread in Armenia after residents, disturbed by the slow movement of the relief effort, broke into food stores and stole supplies. Then Colombian president Andr√©s Pastrana postponed a trip to Germany to attend a World Bank meeting to view the destruction himself. He later had to send soldiers to the afflicted area to restore order. Aftermath The main economic activity of the region, the Colombian coffee industry was heavily affected. About 8,000 coffee farms were completely or partially destroyed, and 13,000 structures of several kinds of enterprises and industries were damaged and went temporarily or permanently out of service. The banks and financial entities could not dispense money for several weeks. In January 2002 the new community of El Cantaro was finished.'From death to life': Three years after earthquake, El Cantaro celebrates new homes Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) by Elizabeth Soto and Frank Albrecht Many of the 125 families that gathered to celebrate the completion of their homes were chosen from among the neediest.

However, the initial settlers were expelled by the Ottoman Empire in 1917; a dilapidated museum building is all that is left of that original settlement. However, the artesian well prompted the Allied forces under General Allenby to select Ruhama as their headquarters from which base \\"the British Army and the Jewish-American Legion conquered Palestine\\". HaShomer used the Ruhama farm as its main forward base along the Gaza- Beersheva line. Two subsequent attempts to re-establish the settlement during the period of the British Mandate were curtailed by the Arab riots in 1929 and 1936. The kibbutz was eventually successfully re-established in 1944, and grew to a population of 399. Ruhama uses land from the depopulated Palestinian village of al-Jammama.

Like many kibbutzim, Ruhama went through a process of privatization in the late 1990s. The kibbutz operated a factory which produced brushes, including toothbrushes, which is closed by July 2019. The new owner of the brush business is a trade company who uses the name Kibbutz Ruhama, but closes down the factory. In 1984, Ruhama established a PCB design company. Ruhama has a full-care center for elderly patients, with about 25 beds, attending to patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, paralysis and stroke. With membership dropping from 350 members to 210, upkeep of the senior care center has meant self-taxation and general belt tightening on the kibbutz.

Created and designed by artist and plotter Steve Ditko with writer and editor Stan Lee, he first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #26, published in July 1965. The character was most notable for having briefly been the partner of the Green Goblin. Both villains aspired to take over the criminal mobs of New York, and they formed an uneasy partnership. They were both aware of each other's secret identities, which kept them from outwardly betraying the other. The Crime- Master only lasted two issues, being killed at the conclusion of The Amazing Spider-Man #27; however, there was a second Crime Master in the 1970s, and new stories were written in the pages of Untold Tales of Spider-Man that featured the original character before his death. Publication history The Crime Master debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #26, his identity unknown. He was killed and revealed as Nicholas \\"Nick\\" \\"Lucky\\" Lewis after his death. His son, Nicholas Lewis Jr. became the second Crime Master in Marvel Team-Up #39 (November 1975) and #40 and teamed up with the second Big Man. This Crime- Master did not know the identity of his partner and betrayed and shot to death the Big Man, who turned out to be his girlfriend Janice Foswell, daughter of Frederick Foswell, the original Big Man, after unmasking. Devastated by the discovery, Lewis Jr. has not appeared as The Crime-Master since. The original Crime Master was also featured in an untold story from before his death in Untold Tales of Spider-Man #23 (August 1997) and again in Untold Tales of Spider-Man #25. That issue is somewhat controversial as it alters the storyline from The Amazing Spider-Man #26-27. This story shows the Crime Master and Green Goblin reveal their identities to each other. The Goblin, however, is wearing a mask of J. Jonah Jameson under his Goblin mask so as to suggest that The Crime Master really believed that Jameson was the Goblin instead of Norman Osborn. This does not make sense in the continuity of The Amazing Spider-Man #26 as thought bubbles reveal that the Goblin is concerned about The Crime-Master revealing his identity. A third Crime Master has recently appeared. starting in the revival of the Venom book. This one is a powerful crime lord, with extensive resources, connections, and henchmen, chief among them the new Jack O'Lantern. It was ultimately revealed that the third Crime Master is Bennett Brant, the brother of Betty Brant. Fictional character biography=Nicholas Lewis Sr. (\\"Lucky Lewis\\") Nick \\"Lucky\\" Lewis was a masked criminal who attempted to organize all non-Maggia New York City crime gangs under his control.The Amazing Spider-Man #26 He was opposed by Spider-Man, Frederick Foswell, and especially his chief rival, the Green Goblin, whose real name, Norman Osborn, he had found out. The Crime-Master's attempt to build a criminal empire failed when Foswell informed the police about a large crime boss gathering he (the Crime-Master) had organized. Seeking revenge on Foswell, he prepared to assassinate Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, and Foswell at the Daily Bugle, but he was instead killed by the police waiting for him there upon Foswell's tip-off.The Amazing Spider-Man #27 Nicholas Lewis Jr. Nick Lewis Jr., the original Crime-Master's son, met Janice Foswell, the daughter of the original Big Man, during his education period in Europe, and they became engaged. After learning that both their fathers died due to alleged involvement by Spider-Man, Lewis decided to take up his father's identity as the Crime-Master to avenge his death. Unknowingly, Janice also had the same idea and disguised herself as the new Big Man. Both met and joined up to battle Spider-Man, the Human Torch and the Sons of the Tiger; but when they got into an argument about who was in charge, Janice was fatally shot by Nick. When their identities were revealed, Nick broke down in tears and was subsequently left to the police.Marvel Team-Up #39-40 Since then, he has apparently remained in prison. Bennett Brant In his early life, Bennett Brant is the brother of Betty Brant. He ended up in a gambling debt with a gangster named Blackie Gaxton to pay for his mother's medical bills. With the help of Doctor Octopus, Blackie Gaxton kidnapped Bennett and Betty as insurance against anyone who wanted to prevent him from leaving the country. Bennett was double-crossed by Blackie Gaxton, who refused to free him of any debts. Blackie was fatally shot during a melee between Blackie Gaxton's gang, Doctor Octopus, and Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man #11 Many years later, a new Crime-Master appeared in the Venom series. He proved to be a shrewd planner, with substantial resources and many henchmen. His paths first crossed with Eugene \\"Flash\\" Thompson, the most recent host of the Venom symbiote, when Flash was sent to stop a mad scientist who had developed powerful Antarctic Vibranium bullets for the Crime-Master.Venom vol. 2, #1 The Crime-Master subsequently organized his own team to destroy Venom, which he called the Savage Six. It consisted of himself, Jack-O-Lantern, Human Fly, Death Adder, Megatak, and Toxin (which now has Eddie Brock as a host after losing the Anti-Venom symbiote back in the Spider-Island storyline).Venom vol. 2, #17 When Betty Brant was brought before the Crime-Master, she was shocked when the Crime-Master revealed himself to be her own brother, Bennett Brant, who invited Betty to join him in killing Venom.Venom vol. 2, #20 After his unmasking, Brant claimed that the Crime-Master identity went back centuries, and that the bearer of it was chosen by an enigmatic criminal empire. After Venom arrived at his hideout, Bennett Brant almost killed him with a sonic pistol and a flamethrower, but he was shot and killed by Betty. When Venom began to make a comment on this, Betty stated that her brother \\"died a long time ago.\\"Venom vol. 2, #21 Imposter Crime Master Venom later came across another Crime Master who was smuggling weapons into the city. Venom fights this Crime Master and notices that he is acting differently. At the same time, The Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) gets a call from Spider-Island 2 about Venom and the Crime Master and proceeds to have a small army assemble outside the building in which they are fighting. The Superior Spider-Man breaks into the building just as the Crime Master takes off his mask. It is revealed that the man under the mask is an unnamed Maggia operative who had just bought the Crime Master identity and gear from the Hobgoblin. The Maggia operative then surrenders.The Superior Spider-Man #22 Crime Master subsequently hires Blood Spider, Death-Shield, and Jagged Bow to help him steal a damaged Rigellian Recorder from Deadpool and the Mercs for Money. After the heist goes awry, Crime Master attempts to buy the Recorder through an auction being held by Deadpool, but is outbid by the Ozarks Kingpin. During the Civil War II storyline, Crime Master joins the Kingpin's organization and is killed by one of Fisk's enemies who defaces the corpse with a sign that reads \\"It's Not Your City\\". Inner Demons version One of Mister Negative's Inner Demons later impersonates the Hobgoblin's Crime Master in order to manipulate Black Cat and the Enforcers into helping him break into Ryker's Island, where he tries to assassinate Hammerhead and Tombstone. The plan is foiled by Spider-Man and the Wraith. Other versions=Marvel Noir A Crime-Master by the name of Sammy exists in the Marvel Noir universe, and serves as one of the primary antagonists in Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face. He has taken over New York since Norman Osborn was put on trial as The Goblin. His personal henchmen include the Enforcers and Sandman. He also helps to sponsor Otto Octavius in his experiments on African- Americans. He is dating Felicia Hardy, but is enraged when he finds out that she sheltered Spider-Man, and slashes her critically. She phones the FBI Agent Jean DeWolff, who then goes to Ellis Island and busts Crime Master.Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face #1-4 Spidey A flashback sequence in the all- ages title Spidey depicts the Nick Lewis, Sr. version of the Crime Master being defeated and webbed-up by Spider-Man who disparagingly refers to the villain as \\"one of the dorks I keep the city safe from\\". In other media=Video games * The Marvel Noir version of Crime-Master is mentioned in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. This version seems to be an enforcer working for Hammerhead as mentioned by Vulture's henchmen. In his orders, he killed Fancy Dan and put him in a garbage can due to him flirting with Hammerhead's girlfriend Janice Foswell.

Cortical deafness is an auditory disorder where the patient is unable to hear sounds but has no apparent damage to the anatomy of the ear (see auditory system), which can be thought of as the combination of auditory verbal agnosia and auditory agnosia. Patients with cortical deafness cannot hear any sounds, that is, they are not aware of sounds including non-speech, voices, and speech sounds. Although patients appear and feel completely deaf, they can still exhibit some reflex responses such as turning their head towards a loud sound. Cause Cortical deafness is caused by bilateral cortical lesions in the primary auditory cortex located in the temporal lobes of the brain. The ascending auditory pathways are damaged, causing a loss of perception of sound. Inner ear functions, however, remains intact. Cortical deafness is most often cause by stroke, but can also result from brain injury or birth defects. More specifically, a common cause is bilateral embolic stroke to the area of Heschl's gyri.citation needed Cortical deafness is extremely rare, with only twelve reported cases. Each case has a distinct context and different rates of recovery. It is thought that cortical deafness could be a part of a spectrum of an overall cortical hearing disorder. In some cases, patients with cortical deafness have had recovery of some hearing function, resulting in partial auditory deficits such as auditory verbal agnosia. This syndrome might be difficult to distinguish from a bilateral temporal lesion such as described above.  Diagnosis  Since cortical deafness and auditory agnosia have many similarities, diagnosing the disorder proves to be difficult. Bilateral lesions near the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are important criteria. Cortical deafness requires demonstration that brainstem auditory responses are normal, but cortical evoked potentials are impaired. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), also referred to as brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) show the neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt. The latency of the responses gives critical information: if cortical deafness is applicable, LLR (long-latency responses) are completely abolished and MLR (middle latency responses) are either abolished or significantly impaired. In auditory agnosia, LLRs and MLRs are preserved. Another important aspect of cortical deafness that is often overlooked is that patients feel deaf. They are aware of their inability to hear environmental sounds, non-speech and speech sounds. Patients with auditory agnosia can be unaware of their deficit, and insist that they are not deaf.Denes, G., and Luigi Pizzamiglio. \\"Comprehension Disorders.\\" Handbook of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. Hove, East Sussex, UK: Psychology, 1999. 210. Print. Verbal deafness and auditory agnosia are disorders of a selective, perceptive and associative nature whereas cortical deafness relies on the anatomic and functional disconnection of the auditory cortex from acoustic impulses.  Case examples  Although cortical deafness has very specific parameters of diagnosis, its causes on the other hand can vary tremendously. The following are three case studies with different reasons for cortical deafness. # A case published in 2001 describes the patient as 20-year-old man referred for cochlear implants because of bilateral deafness following a motorcycle accident two years earlier. His CT shows hemorrhagic lesions involving both internal capsules. He was comatose for several weeks and awoke quadriparetic, cognitively impaired and completely deaf. He exhibited a response towards the occasional sudden, loud sound, however, by turning his head. Reading and writing capabilities were maintained, and he was able to communicate by lip-reading. His own speech was dysarthric, but comprehensible. Normal tympanograms and stapedial reflexes imply that the middle and inner ear remained functioning and the auditory nerve was intact. His auditory nerve was tested by evoking responses with normal auditory nerve potentials at 10 dB bilaterally. The results of the BAER waves were normal, but an abnormal complex IV-V suggested that the pathways were functioning through the brainstem, but there was a lesion present in the mid-brain. With these findings, it was determined the patient had cortical deafness due to bilateral interruption of the ascending auditory pathway associated with hemorrhagic lesions of both internal capsules. Therefore, cochlear implantation was not performed. # Published in 1994, this patient was monitored over the course of almost 20 years after exhibiting signs of hearing impairment as an infant. Audiologic and related test results in concurrence with MRI confirmed bilateral absence of considerable portions of her temporal lobes resulting in cortical deafness. Although physiologic measures demonstrate normal peripheral hearing sensitivity, this patient's speech has the inflection and prosodic characteristics associated with profound peripheral hearing loss, and she is unable to understand spoken communication. Behaviorally obtained pure-tone thresholds were variable, ranging from normal to moderate hearing loss with normal middle ear muscle reflexes and normal ABRs to high- and low-intensity stimuli. Auditory middle latency and cortical evoked potentials were grossly abnormal, consistent with the central nature of cortical deafness. Because of her inability to communicate auditorily, this patient was ultimately taught American Sign Language and educated at the Louisiana School for the Deaf. At the completion of the case study, the patient was married and expecting a child. # A more recent study, published in 2013 the patient described is a 56-year-old woman a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and multiple cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented in March 2009 with a complaint of complete bilateral hearing loss. In March 2009, she experienced an acute right-sided insulotemporal intracerebral hemorrhage. Immediately after this event, the patient complained of hearing loss with the inability to hear all sounds except for severe bilateral tinnitus. Imaging revealed sequelae in the left cerebral cortex from her previous CVA. The new right-sided hemorrhage was centered on the posterior putamen with surrounding edema involving the posterior portion of the posterior limbs of the internal, external, and extreme capsules. Signal abnormalities extended into the right temporal lobe. The patient had no other neurologic deficits and spoke fluently, although with poor internal volume control of her voice. Otoscopic examination revealed normal-appearing external auditory canals, intact tympanic membranes bilaterally, and normal middle ear anatomy. Audiogram at that time showed bilateral profound hearing loss with no responses to pure-tone or speech testing.  Treatment  Auditory perception can improve with time. There seems to be a level of neuroplasticity that allows patients to recover the ability to perceive environmental and certain musical sounds. Patients presenting with cortical hearing loss and no other associated symptoms recover to a variable degree, depending on the size and type of the cerebral lesion. Patients whose symptoms include both motor deficits and aphasias often have larger lesions with an associated poorer prognosis in regard to functional status and recovery. Cochlear or auditory brainstem implantation could also be treatment options. Electrical stimulation of the peripheral auditory system may result in improved sound perception or cortical remapping in patients with cortical deafness. However, hearing aids are an inappropriate answer for cases like these. Any auditory signal, regardless if has been amplified to normal or high intensities, is useless to a system unable to complete its processing. Ideally, patients should be directed toward resources to aid them in lip-reading, learning American Sign Language, as well as speech and occupational therapy. Patients should follow- up regularly to evaluate for any long-term recovery.  History  Early reports, published in the late 19th century, describe patients with acute onset of deafness after experiencing symptoms described as apoplexy. The only means of definitive diagnosis in these reports were postmortem dissections.Brody, Robert M., Brian D. Nicholas, Michael J. Wolf, Paula B. Marcinkevich, and Gregory J. Artz. \\"Cortical Deafness: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.\\" Otology and Neurology 34.7 (2013): 1226‚Äì229. Ovid. Web. Subsequent cases throughout the 20th century reflect advancements in diagnoses of both hearing loss and stroke. With the advent of audiometric and electrophysiologic studies, investigators could diagnose cortical deafness with increasing precision. Advances in imaging techniques, such as MRI, greatly improved the diagnosis and localization of cerebral infarcts that coincide with primary or secondary auditory centers. Neurological and cognitive testing help to distinguish between total cortical deafness and auditory agnosia, resulting in the inability to perceive words, music, or specific environmental sounds.

The film was written and directed by Karl Francis.BFI The drama focuses on screenwriter/director Herbert Biberman and his efforts to make what would become the historic political film, Salt of the Earth in 1954, produced without studio backing after he was blacklisted for belonging to the American Communist Party.TCM.comTV Guide Plot The film opens at the 1937 Academy Awards, where Biberman's wife, Gale Sondergaard (Greta Scacchi), wins the first ever \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" Oscar. Although the anti-Fascist sentiment in her acceptance speech gets her labelled a \\"commie\\" by some observers, she and Biberman (Jeff Goldblum) are placed under contract at Warner Bros. He first comes under scrutiny more for his Jewish background than his political activities. Yet, with Cold War paranoia growing, a group of Hollywood directors and actors ‚Äî Biberman, Sondergaard, Danny Kaye and Dalton Trumbo among them - are labelled Communists and questioned in front of Congress. After refusing to testify against his colleagues, he is imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana for a period of six months. Once released, he discovers his Hollywood career is finished. Sondergaard suggests that her husband should direct a screenplay about the real-life 1950-51 strike waged by Mexican-American miners against the Empire Zinc Company in Bayard, New Mexico written by Michael Wilson, also a victim of the blacklist and Biberman's brother Michael. She feels the lead role of Esperanza Quintero, who rallied the wives of the unemployed miners and urged them to support their husbands, is an ideal way to jump-start her stagnating career. Biberman agrees, but after meeting with the people who participated in the strike and being inspired by their passion, he decides all roles should be played by ethnic actors. Because the film has no studio backing and most Hollywood players fear being associated with Biberman and the project, he eventually casts local residents from Grant County, New Mexico and members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Local 890 to fill most of the roles. Juan Chac√≥n, the Union Local president, is cast as the fiery Ramon Quintero opposite Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas as his wife Esperanza. Will Geer is one of only five Hollywood actors to accept a role in the production. The FBI investigates the film's financing, attempts to steal the film's negatives and, when they can't be located, tells film-processing labs not to work on the film, incites locals who are unhappy with the film crew's presence to set fire to many of the sets and eventually deports Revueltas on bogus charges. Biberman stands his ground and completes the film, using scenes with Revueltas that were shot in her native Mexico and then smuggled into the US.

He became determined to film The Making of Salt of the Earth and worked with fellow-Welshman Nigel Walters, the director of cinematography, for years to make the film.Kodak. Motion Picture Imaging, web site. Last accessed: 22 November 2007. Jack L. Warner, Humphrey Bogart, Edward Dmytryk, Howard Hughes, Dalton Trumbo, and George Jessel are among the real-life personalities depicted in the film. The film was produced and shot in Madrid. Outdoor filming was done primarily in the miner towns of La Uni√≥n and Portm√°n (South- east of Spain) Critical reception The New York Times film critic, Stephen Holden, generally liked the film, especially its message, but found some of the acting and the screenplay problematic. He wrote, \\"One of the Hollywood 10 has a strong performance by Mr. Goldblum and a refreshingly sulfurous view of 1950s Hollywood caving in to fear. As hard-hitting as the movie is, some of its performances are thuddingly overstated, and its screenplay wears its didacticism on its sleeve. One of the Hollywood 10 may be a useful film, but it is far from a great one.\\"Holden, Stephen. The New York Times, \\"Back to an Era of Slurs, Paranoia and Persecution,\\" 11 January 2002. Last accessed: 22 November 2007. Leslie Camhi, writing for The Village Voice, liked the work of director Karl Francis and how he kept close to the true story, and wrote, \\"As Biberman, Jeff Goldblum mutes his considerable charisma; his stilted intellectual is so consumed by ideology that he hardly notices the harm done to his wife, actress Gale Sondergaard (played by firebrand Greta Scacchi), whose Oscar-winning career was cut short by his unflinching idealism. But director Francis shifts skillfully between scenes of glamour and oppression, sticking close to this compelling history.\\"Camhi, Leslie. The Village Voice, \\"Left Out in the Cold,\\" 9 January 2002. Variety magazine film critic David Rooney was critical of the film's direction and believed the film is only worthy of cable television. He wrote, \\"A fascinating chapter in Hollywood history gets unremarkable treatment in One of the Hollywood Ten, which centers on blacklisted director Herbert J. Biberman...[but] the pedestrian approach employed by writer-director Karl Francis gives it the look and feel of a lackluster cable movie, which would appear to be its commercial destination.\\"Rooney, David. Variety, film review, 9 October 2000. Distribution The film was released in Spain by The Walt Disney Company, and debuted at the San Sebasti√°n Film Festival on 29 September 2000. It was featured at the Commonwealth Film Festival, Great Britain; the New York Jewish Film Festival; the San Diego Jewish Film Festival; the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival; the Washington Jewish Film Festival; and other film festivals.

Paleodictyon were first described by Giuseppe Meneghini in 1850. Paleodictyon minimum. Description Paleodictyon consist of thin tunnels or ridges that usually form hexagonal or polygonal-shaped honeycomb-like network.KU Ichnology - Studying the Traces of Life IBGS Research Group Both irregular and regular nets are known throughout the stratigraphic range of Paleodictyon, but it is the striking regular honeycomb pattern of some forms such as P. carpathecum and P. nodosum which make it notable and widely studied. Individual mesh elements may be millimeters to centimeters, usually from 1-1.5 to 2-3 cm, and entire mesh patterns can cover areas up to a square meter. The edges or threads that make up the mesh are usually cylindrical or ellipsoid in cross- section, and some forms have vertical tubes connecting the mesh upwards to the sediment-water interface. Dolf Seilacher proposed in 1977 that it may be a trap for food, a mechanism for farming, or a foraging path.Seilacher, A., 1977: Pattern analysis of Paleodictyon and related trace fossils in Crimes, T. P., Harper, J. C., Trace Fossils 2: Geological Journal, Special Issue 9, 289-334. Alternatively, it has been suggested that it may be a cast of a xenophyophoran protist.Hermann Ehrlich . Paleodictyon Honeycomb Structure in Biological Materials of Marine Origin (Springer Netherlands) 1: 137-141. ISSN 2211-0593. History of study Much modeling work has been done on Paleodictyon. Roy Plotnick, trace fossils researcher at University of Illinois at Chicago, modeled the form as resulting from the iterative modular growth of an unknown organism.Plotnick, R. 2003: Ecological and L-system based simulations of trace fossils. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 192, 45-58. Garlick and Miller modeled it as a burrow with a relatively simple burrow algorithm.Garlick, G. D., and Miller, W., 1993: Simulations of burrowing strategies and construction of Paleodictyon: Journal of Geological Education 41, 159-163. Hypotheses about origin Paleodictyon from Miocene of Fiume Savio The question is whether these patterns are burrows of marine animals such as worms or fossilized remains of ancient organisms (sponges or algae).William J. Broad Diving Deep for a Living Fossil Observations on Paleodictyon using Euler graph theory suggest that it cannot be an excavation trace fossil, and that it must therefore be an imprint, body fossil or be of abiotic origin.Honeycutt, CE, and Plotnick, RE. 2005. Mathematical analysis of Paleodictyon: a graph theory approach. Lethaia 38:345‚Äì350. xenophyophore Occultammina has been suggested as a possible identity for the maker of Paleodictyon, but this remains controversial. It has been suggested that Paleodictyon may represent a body fossil of a xenophyophore, a type of giant foraminifera. The infaunal xenophyophore Occultammina does bear some physical resemblance to Paleodictyon and the abyssal habitat of modern xenophyophores is indeed similar to the inferred paleoenvironment where fossil graphoglyptids are found; however, the large size (up to 0.5m) and regularity of many graphoglyptids as well as the apparent absence of collected sediment particles (known as xenophyae) in their fossils casts doubt on the possibility. Further, modern xenophyophores lack the regular hexagonal symmetry common to Paleodictyon. Modern examples of Paleodictyon have been discovered; however, examination failed to reveal stercomares, a hardened test, protoplasm, or xenophyophore DNA. The trace may alternately represent a burrow or a glass sponge. The search for a living animal The IMAX film Volcanoes of the Deep Sea describes the search for a living animal that produces the Paleodictyon, using the deep-water submersible DSV Alvin near volcanic vents that lie underwater in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. They found and took samples from many of the Paleodictyon nodosum honeycomb burrows. However, no creatures were found in any of them. They theorized that the burrows were being used for cultivating/trapping bacteria by whichever creature created them.Rona, P.

The South Line (open) The line to Port Erin was the second to be opened by the railway company, in 1874 one year after the shorter line to Peel had been opened. This line's construction involved considerably more civil engineering work than the relatively straightforward westerly line, including two major rock cuttings on the climb out of Douglas railway station at \\"The Nunnery\\" and Keristal. The story goes that the work nearly bankrupted the contractors and the second cutting was completed on a much smaller budget, resulting in it being far narrower than the first, something that is apparent when travelling today. On the approach to Santon the line reaches its summit and the remaining outward leg of the journey is spent descending or on the flat. The southern section runs through farmland and is dotted with several farm crossings, some of which were manned. These are denoted by stone structures for crossing keepers which were all made redundant in 2001 with the introduction of automated barriers. There are many smaller crossings also giving local farmers access to fields. The principal stations on the south line which remain open today are as listed to the right; of these, Santon, Ronaldsway Halt, Ballabeg and Colby Level remain as request stops only, whilst all service trains stop at the other stations listed. In the past there have been other request stops at Ballacostain between Port Soderick and Santon, which served the rifle range utilised by pupils at the local King William's College in Castletown. In recent years a new overbridge was installed at Meary Veg in 2001 as part of an island-wide sewerage system. On the climb out of Douglas a farm named Lough Ned operated for a short time in the 1980s as a small wild life park and the railway served this via a ground-level platform The Peel Line (closed) This was the first railway line to be opened on the island in 1873 and was operational continually until September 1968, with the exception of 1966 when the entire network was closed. The line is today retained as a footpath and bridleway and is 11.5 miles long. Since the rails were lifted in 1975, there has often been talk of resurrecting this line, which out of the closed lines would be the most viable. Since closure there have been several service mains buried under the trackbed, including gas and telephone mains, but pains are always taken to ensure that the trackbed is returned in such a way that the railway could be reinstated. There are two notable examples of this, firstly at Quarterbridge where the railway ran parallel to the T.T. course where an access road was built on the trackbed in 1991, and secondly at the station of St John's where a primary school and housing complex have been developed since 2001. Both of these developments have been built in such a way to ensure the line could be reinstated, albeit that any station at St John's would have to be significantly relocated. During the First World War there was a branch extending from a mid-way point between Peel and St John's stations to the farm of Knockaloe in connection with prisoners of war who were interned there. The stations are listed to the right. At the terminus of Peel a large heritage centre has been built, partly using the old goods shed and station building. The brickworks office and water tower remain in place at the mouth of the yard and are occupied by the Manx Transport Museum Group, and the station site itself is now a car park for the heritage centre. It would not be unfeasible however to reinstate some form of station here in the future as needs required. The North Line (closed) The line from Ramsey to St John's was opened by the Manx Northern Railway in 1879 and operated until 1968 when passenger operations ceased on the same day as those on the Peel line. By far the most scenic and spectacular route operated by the railway, it featured two viaducts at Glen Wyllin and Glen Mooar and was nearly 17 miles in length. The railway ran independently until 1905 when the Isle of Man Railway took over operations, together with the operation of the Foxdale Railway, thereby controlling the entire network on the island. Sections of this line along the Irish Sea coast suffered some cruel weather and a turntable was installed at St John's to turn coaching stock to ensure even weathering on the most exposed section at the \\"Donkey Bank\\" which caused trouble to the operators throughout its lifetime. Trains were often dispatched with wagonloads of ash to deposit over the side to shore up the line, and it has dropped considerably since the departure of the railway. Further along the line at Glen Wyllin were pleasure gardens owned and operated by the railway company and these became a popular destination for Sunday School picnics in the railway's heyday, this providing a large source of income for the railway. The nearest station at Kirk Michael was the drop off point for holidaymakers who walked along a track to the side of the line. At Ballavolley a halt was created in 1967 to serve the newly opened Wildlife Park, which remains in place today. The line also boasted a wayside halt for the exclusive use of the Bishop of Sodor and Mann at Bishopscourt, which comprised a simple bench seat and hand-operated signal for the stopping of the passing train. The station at Ramsey was on the site of today's Ramsey Bakery on the outskirts of the town, a disadvantage when compared with the station of the Manx Electric Railway which is in the heart of the town. The station did however boast an extension along the quayside for a time, ideally situated to load and unload goods to and from the vessels in this busy port. Also, as part of an initiative to encourage the railway's use for freight and cargo, a small sharply curved siding was laid to Milntown Power Station in 1968 and three wagons converted to oil carrying wagons for this purpose. The venture was however short-lived, but trains serving this siding were some of the very last recorded trains to travel over the line, in 1969 as part of a rolling stock collection. Today, it is difficult to visualise the station as the site has been modernised and developed beyond recognition. The Foxdale Line (closed) Opened in 1886 this was the shortest branch of the Isle of Man Railway and the shortest-lived, closing as early as 1940 to all traffic. It was originally a separate affair to the other railways, but was taken over as part of the merger in 1905 together with the Manx Northern Railway to Ramsey. The tracks remained in situ for many years and reports that trains, or light engines, travelled along its length as late as 1974 (just prior to lifting) are known. The line was only 3 miles in length but was on a steady climb of 1 in 49 for its entirety and it served the small mining community with limited passenger services (only one passenger coach was ever acquired and this remains in service on the preserved south line today, as F.39). The station at Foxdale itself was also the site of the iron ore \\"deads\\" which gave rise to the station acquiring the nickname \\"the back of the moon\\" owing to its lunar appearance. Today the station building remains in place in private ownership but the removal of two vital bridges in the 1970s has rendered it extremely unlikely that any proposal to restore the line would ever be successful. There is evidence to suggest (in the form of images) however that Foxdale Station may well retain some of its track to the present day - albeit buried under heaps of spoil. Until recently (within the last ten years) there was still trackwork visible in the road beyond the station which would have run up onto the spoil heaps for working the deads.

A traditional weaving and trading centre it serves as a gateway to Birbhum district. History Ilambazar developed as a trade mart because of its location at the junction of thoroughfares and the river front. It also had the advantage of being near to weaving centres.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, The Economic Life of a Bengal District: Birbhum 1770 - 1857, p. 14, The University of Burdwan, 1984. The English assumed the direct administration of the district in 1786 and the British East India Company had a factory at Ilambazar. At that time the French East India Company also made a foray in the Ilambazar area. It helped in the weavers securing higher prices.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 152 Birbhum was one of the worst sufferers of the Great Bengal famine of 1770. Many hundreds of villages were entirely depopulated and in the towns not a fourth of the population survived.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 257 In the late 18th century, Birbhum and surrounding areas were affected by famines followed by a peasants‚Äô insurrection. Although the insurrection was against zamindars and the government, trade marts were also plundered. In June 1789, Ilambazar, the chief manufacturing and trade centre in the area was sacked in open dylight.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, pp. 44, 47 Ilambazar survived the sack of 1789 and re-emerged as a busy manufacturing and trade centre since the opening of the 19th century. At the time of Shewill's survey operations it contained a population of 2,235 souls.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 260 Cotton goods were not the only items of trade. In the mid 19th century, John Erskine of Ilambazar was one of the leading sugar manufacturers and exporters in the area.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 188 The Erskine family also had indigo factories.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 191 Ilambazar was once an area for indigo cultivation, traces of which can still be found.Sarkar, Joydeep, Paryatan Boichitre Birbhum Jela, Paschim Banga, Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , p. 199, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal.

The forests around Ilambazar was on the verge of extinction in the nineties of the previous century but it has got back much of its flora and fauna. The villagers, living in 32 villages located inside the forest, have realised that they can make a living by selling plates (thalis) made of sal leaves and mushrooms (locally called toshor ghuti) both abundantly available in the forest. The forest department formed 12 ‚ÄòBonosamrakshan committees‚Äô (forest preservation committees) comprising the villagers and made them understand how their survival was linked with that of the forest.

Culture=Temples The Gouranga temple at Ilambazar, and the Shiva temple at Ghurisha are amongst the state protected temples in the area. Rameswara Shiva temple is one of the three temples at Ilambazar with exquisite terracotta work. During the late 1940s Ilambazar terracotta temples were photo-documented by artist Mukul Dey of Santiniketan. David J. McCutchion mentions several temples in the Ilambazar area: (1) the Shiva temple at Ilambazar as a standard (small) 19th century ‚ÄòBirbhum- Bradhaman‚Äô type brick built rekha deul with rich terracotta fa√ßade, (2) the four Shiva temples at Uchkaron as standard (small) char chalas, built in 1769, with rich terracotta facades, (3) the 19th century Lakshmi-Janardana temple at Ilambazar, as a standard West Bengal type pancharatna with ridged rekha turrets and porch on triple archway, (4) the 17-18th century Radha Vinode temple at Jaydev Kenduli as a low storied West Bengal navaratna with ridged turrets, (5) the 19th century Lakshmi Janardana temple at Ghurisha is a straight corniced navaratna with very large upper tower and tiny clustering corner towers with rich terracotta, and (6) the 19th century temple in the market place at Ilambazar as an octagonal ridged rekha with rich terracotta on all sides.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 23, 30, 47, 53, 54, 59 . The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, According to Binoy Ghosh, there are three temples at Ilambazar with beautiful terracotta designs: the hexagonal temple at hattala, the Shiva temple in the village and the pancharatna Narayan temple. There are pictures of British people amongst the terracotta desigs. Ghurisa, about 4 miles west of Ilambazar, has rich temple traditions but many of them are in a state of decay. There is a char chala temple, which was constructed in 1555. It is said that there was a golden idol of Rama in the temple, but the Bargis took it away around 1742-48. Moukhira, a village about 3 miles south of Ilambazar, has many early 19th century temples. Benoy Ghosh notes that the portrayal of Europeans in the temple carvings in Birbhum district are more than in other places, perhaps because of the activities of the early European merchants in the area.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 267-271, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata Temple picture gallery File:Raghunathjee Temple with Shiva as deity at Ghurisha.jpgRaghunathji Temple with Shiva deity at Ghurisha File:Gouranga alias Mahaprabhu Temple at Ilambazar.jpgGouranga temple at Ilambazar File:Four Shiva Temples at Uchkaran.jpgFour Shiva temples at Uchkaron Craft John Erskine and John Cheap took an important part in the development of the shellac industry. Erskine constructed a large shellac and lac dye factory at Ilambazar and as Cheap retired from the field, virtually monopolized it. The lac was collected from the forests and lac dye and shellac manufactured in the factory at Ilambazar. Lac artisans, locally called nuris, worked out a variety of lacquered items namely, cups, inkpots, bracelets and toys ‚Äòof excellent design and craftsmanship‚Äô. Some of the ornamental items were sent to the Great Paris Exhibition of 1855. However, Sherwill noted that ornamental items were manufactured at Ilambazar by only two men.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 196 Healthcare Ilambazar Rural Hospital at Ilambazar has 30 beds.

A historian, university professor, author, journalist and peace activist, he was a graduate of the University of Geneva and a lecturer for the World Peace Foundation.The Tech. TOL. XXXIII. NO. 17 BOSTON, MASS., FRIDAY, APRIL 2,; D1913. \\"Mr. E. Privat Tells How American Students Can Help Peace Movement\\". MIT Archives. Online. October 15, 2007. His collective works consist of original dramas, poems, stories, textbooks and books about the Esperanto movement.  Esperanto activity  Having already learned Esperanto in childhood, Privat and fellow student Hector Hodler founded in 1903 the journal Juna Esperantisto (The Young Esperantist). Though still an adolescent in 1905, he walked 600 kilometres to participate in the first World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, where he spoke with mature eloquence.Ferencz Szil√°gyi, Enciklopedio de Esperanto, 1934 At the 1907 International Socialist Congress, Privat advocated the use of Esperanto by the International Socialist Bureau in Brussels.Weekly Worker 409 Thursday November 22 2001 Socialism and Esperanto . Privat served as a committee member of the World Esperanto Association (in Esperanto \\"UEA: Universala Esperanto- Asocio\\") beginning in 1912. From 1920 until 1934, he was editor-in-chief of Esperanto's eponymous official magazine. From 1924 until 1938 he was president of the UEAForster, Peter Glover. The Esperanto Movement. p 172. 1982. . and at the same time president of the International Central Committee. He resigned after a scandal. Privat advanced the international Esperanto organization inside and outside UEA. His works History of the Esperanto language (in two volumes) and The Life of Zamenhof made him one of the most important historians of Esperanto. As the first historian of Esperanto and Zamenhof's first biographer, he used his connections within Swiss academia to further Esperanto. He authored a linguistic study Esprimo de sentoj en Esperanto (Expression of feelings in Esperanto), is the author of the lyrical Ginevra and of the poem anthology Tra l'silento (Through the Silence).Janton, Pierre. Esperanto- Language, Literature, and Community. pp 97-98. Editor, Humphrey Tonkin. Translators, Tonkin et al. State University of New York Press. Albany. 1993. Also, he wrote books teaching Esperanto, Karlo and Course Reader. During the years 1923‚Äì1926, Privat was a vice-delegate of Iran at the League of Nations.List of Assembly Delegates and Substitutes - (P). University of Indiana. Online. October 16, 2007. He presented Esperanto at the League of Nations, at the International Labour Organization (ILO) and at the Universal Telegraph Union. He was a brilliant organizer, and arranged many international conferences about Esperanto instruction in Geneva (1922). He became a Quaker in 1936. He was a very spiritual person with a wide open heart to the Unity of Religions, as we can see in one of his best books \\"Sagesse de l'Orient au dela des Religions\\", published around 1945, where we take us in a tour around the different religions and spiritual movements, ending with his appreciation of Gandhi.

Before conversion to provisional status, the 1st Space Control Squadron' was a space situational awareness unit last located at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The squadron commanded the United States Space Surveillance Network to detect, track, identify and catalog positional data for all man-made objects in Earth orbit. The squadron was established in 1989 as the 1st Command and Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base, Colorado. It was inactivated in 2008 and its personnel and equipment were integrated into the 614th Air and Space Operations Center. History=Background The roots of the squadron can be traced to 1961, when the Space Detection and Tracking System Center at opened at Ent Air Force Base, Colorado. The center brought together Air Force and Navy systems designed to track objects in space in all directions, not merely Soviet missiles launched over the North Pole. The center came under the operational control of North American Air Defense Command.Sloan p. 98 There were several subsequent moves, name changes, and changes in personnel, experience, and equipment. Activation The Air Force activated the 1st Command and Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, Colorado in December 1989 to operate the system. The 1st Command and Control Squadron provided collision avoidance support during each shuttle mission as well as maintaining an extensive satellite catalog (the \\"SATCAT\\" or \\"Box score\\"). This catalog is used by U.S. civilian and military agencies when launching new satellites into space, as well as by U.S. allies. The 1 SPCS tracked and compiled positional data on thousands of man-made objects in space partly to prevent collisions between newly launched satellites and other objects already orbiting the earth. Additionally, the unit had the mission to task 30 space sensors within Space Surveillance Network to track satellites for US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) to maintain an accurate satellite catalog (SATCAT) of over 9000 object orbiting the earth., To support manned space flight, 1 SPCS constructs a theoretical box around the space shuttle, MIR or ISS, and projects flight path intersections for 36 to 72 hours. If any objects intersects the theoretical box, the unit forwarded the analysis to NASA, allowing them to determine whether to change the spacecraft/space station's flight path. Based on 1 SPCS mission analysis, and its predecessor units, NASA has moved the space shuttle 12 times and the International Space Station five times since 1981. In June 1995, the unit tracked the U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis during its historic rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir. The unit also compiled a catalog of space objects. The 1 SPCS also contained international personnel, such as Canadian military, since SSA was not just a U.S. problem. Move In 2006, Admiral Timothy Keating, commander of NORAD directed a study on the continued use of the hardened command post at Cheyenne Mountain in view of what was perceived as diminished threats. The decision to close Cheyenne Moungain required a unit move. The unit moved to Vandenberg Air Force Base, California in 2007 to better coordinate activities with the Joint Space Operations Center, it lost over 150 years of expert civilian experience.(archive returns only an error message) Inactivation The unit was inactivated on 9 Jun 2008, and its mission and members integrated into the 614th Air and Space Operations Center / Joint Space Operations Center. Unconfirmed sources state that Cheyenne Mountain may retain some capability to cover the 1 SPCS mission, if required.

Vega in the Philippines and Spark Re in Thailand) is a series of underbone motorcycle produced by Yamaha for the Southeast Asian market. It was introduced for the 2000 model year replacing the SRX 100. A more performance-oriented version of the Lagenda is marketed as ZR. Model history The Yamaha Lagenda series consists 5 generation from 2000 until now. 5 models has been introduced to market since then.  2000-2003  SR Lagenda 100cc - (2000-2003) The SR Lagenda is the first model of the Lagenda series. Launched by a Japanese motorcycle racer Norifumi Abe, it was built as the successor of the SRX 100. The new model is equipped with a re-engineered air-cooled four stroke engine to ensure better reliability and performance. It also has a high rigidly frame to ensure precise handling performance and stability. In addition, the Lagenda had a sporty and aerodynamic body with multi-reflector combination of headlight and tail-light. The moped is sold at RM5,451 for the kick-start version and RM5,778 for the electric version. The motorcycle comes in three colours : orange, blue and red.  2003-2005  Lagenda 110cc - (2003-2005) The Lagenda 110cc was simply the SR Lagenda with increased engine displacement. However, a few changes have been to the model, such as a more rigid chassis with slightly longer wheelbase and a more straight inlet tract from the carburetor to the inlet manifold, reducing the \\"puddling\\" effect. The moped is sold at RM4,388 for the kick-start version and RM4,688 for the electric version. In motor sports, the Lagenda 110 has gained a very good reputation as a racing machine because the bike had won almost all podium position for every rounds during the Malaysian Cub Prix.  2005-2010  Lagenda Z 110cc - (2005-2010) The Lagenda Z is the facelifted version of the Lagenda 110cc and started production since 2005. The model is facelifted in January 2008, returning the former \\"Lagenda\\" logo from the Lagenda 110. The 2008 model is equipped with a key slot cover for better protection against theft. The moped is sold at RM4,686.35 for the kick-start version and RM4,999.25 for the electric version. Lagenda ZR 110cc - (2005-2010) A modified version of the Lagenda Z for those who prefer more sporty features. Prominent features include sport rims, electric starter, and the rear absorbers have extra oil canisters for a smoother ride on uneven roads. This model is only available in blue and has exactly the same engine specification as the Lagenda Z.  2010-2013  Lagenda 115Z - (2010-2013) The Lagenda 115Z uses a completely redesigned engine with larger 62 mm journal bearings that limits the engine speed, resulting in slightly lower power output.Yamaha Lagenda 115Z Specifications - from the official Yamaha Lagenda 115Z microsite by Hong Leong Yamaha. Lagenda 115ZR - (2010-2013)  2013-present  Yamaha Lagenda 115Z Fuel Injection - (2013-present) The 2013 Yamaha Lagenda 115Z Fuel Injection uses a completely new 113.7 cc fuel-injected engine that offers 20% improvement over the older engine in terms of power and fuel economy.Official Yamaha Lagenda 115Z Fuel Injection brochure - Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia.

Vehicle titles in the U.S. are commonly issued by the Secretary of State in the state the vehicle was purchased by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Each state in the US has its own distinct process for the Certificate of Title. When filling out the title during a vehicle transaction, the rules in one state do not always apply to a different state. For example, most states do not require a notary when filling out the title, while other states in the U.S.A. make this mandatory for most parties when buying or selling a vehicle. Some states have different versions of the same title. The certificate of title normally specifies (in most states & versions): #Identifying information about the vehicle, normally at minimum its vehicle identification number, make, and year of manufacture. #The license plate number. #Technical information about the vehicle to define its taxation regime, e.g., its gross vehicle weight, motive power, and purchase price when new. #The name and address of the purchaser or \\"registered owner\\" who would normally possess and use it. #If money is owed on the vehicle, the name of the lienholder or \\"legal owner\\" to whom this money is owed. When a vehicle is financed, the certificate of title is normally held by the lender, who must release it to the purchaser once the balance is paid off. In some states, such as New York and Maryland, the transferred title is sent directly to that individual, but the name of the lender or lienholder appears on the title as well. In order to release the lien upon full payment, the lender sends a notarized release or other complementary document to the individual. When a car is sold from one owner to another, the title must be transferred to the new owner. This is achieved by requesting approval by the state DMV. When the vehicle title is lost, the owner on record may replace the lost title by completing an application with the state that issued the current title. Online lost title applications are available for several states including Maine, Wisconsin, Virginia, Michigan, New York, Indiana, Maryland, South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Washington DC. The name \\"pink slip\\" is a reference to California certificates of ownership before 1988, when they were pink; current California titles have broad vertical stripes of teal, yellow, and pink with a green border; while Illinois titles are blue, pink, and blue with a purple border; Pennsylvania and Nevada titles are blue with a blue border. Many illegal street races of the 1950s, glorified in movies, featured racing for vehicle titles, henceforth the popularity of the term \\"racing for pink slips,\\" and the 2005-08 Speed series Pinks was developed from it. Also, in The Price Is Right, the pricing game Gas Money features contestants trying to avoid the actual retail price of the car; that price is marked with a pink slip. In the United Kingdom, there is not an equivalent of a vehicle title. Instead, there is a document known as the 'vehicle registration document', and is issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The current version has the reference number V5C. Prior to computerisation, the title document was the 'log book', and this term is sometimes still used to describe the V5C. The V5 document records who the Registered Keeper of the vehicle is; it does not establish legal ownership of the vehicle. These documents used to be blue on the front. However, they were changed to red in 2010/11 after approximately 2.2 million blank blue V5 documents were stolen, allowing thieves to clone stolen vehicles much more easily. Car title loans Vehicle titles are also used for car title loans, in which a car owner gives the vehicle lender their vehicle title as collateral in exchange for a loan. In addition to the vehicle title, lenders often also require the borrower to provide a set of keys for the car and/or purchase a roadside service plan. Car title loans frequently involve high interest rates, a short time to repay the loan (often 30 days), and a loan amount less than the car's monetary worth. The borrower also risks losing the car to the lender if the loan is not paid back. These type of loans are marketed as small emergency loans.

It was formerly included in the long-billed pipit (Anthus similis) but is now frequently treated as a separate species. It is a bird of miombo woodland in south-central Africa, unlike the long-billed pipit which inhabits open grassland. It perches in trees when flushed but forages on the ground for invertebrates. Description It is 16-18 centimetres long. The upperparts are warm brown with dark streaks while the underparts are pale with some streaking on the breast. The bird has a dark eyestripe, white supercilium and pale outer tail-feathers. Juveniles have dark spots above and have more streaking below than the adults. The bird's song is high-pitched and monotonous. The long-billed pipit is very similar but has a slightly longer bill and tail, a smaller pale area in the outer tail-feathers and a slightly lower voice. Range The range of the wood pipit extends from south-east Gabon eastwards to southern and western Tanzania and southwards as far as north-east Namibia, northern Botswana, Zimbabwe and north-west Mozambique. At least three subspecies are recognized: A. n. nyassae, A. n. frondicolus and A. n. schoutedeni. Some authors recognize a fourth subspecies, A. n. chersophilus.

There are two parks of this name in Hong Kong. The other one is in Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong Island. History The park was built in 1940. As the governor was ill, administrator Norman Lockhart Smith hosted the park's opening ceremony on 11 June 1941. The park was centred on a statue of King George V. This first iteration of the park was laid out by Palmer and Turner, a Hong Kong architecture firm, while the main contractor was the Lai Kee Company. During the Japanese occupation, some facilities were destroyed and the park was used as a rubbish dump. Following the war, the Urban Council endeavored to rebuild the derelict park to a new layout. Three Chinese styled kiosks were built. The northern end of the park was designed to cater for the comfort of the elderly. The redesigned park was reopened on 21 March 1954 by the Hon. K. M. A. Barnett, chairman of the Urban Council. The immediate vicinity of the park was once a major centre for commerce and transport in Yau Ma Tei, home to the Jordan Road Ferry Pier, the bustling Kwun Chung Market, and the Canton Road Government Offices (all since demolished, although the market has been reprovisioned in the Kwun Chung Municipal Services Building). As part of the Airport Core Programme the adjacent sea was reclaimed in the early 1990s and the park is no longer next to Victoria Harbour. In 1957, the Urban Council agreed to a proposal to house small libraries at selected playgrounds, to be managed by the Boys' and Girls' Club Association. On 13 December 1967 a children's playground and library were opened at the park by Urban Councillor Elsie Elliott. In 1980, in light of the 1971 opening of the better-equipped Yau Ma Tei Public Library nearby, the council considered closing the smaller library at King George V Memorial Park. The library was finally demolished with the 1990s redesign of the park (see below). After the adjacent Canton Road was realigned in the 1970s to meet Ferry Street, King George V Memorial Park was significantly expanded to the west. The extension incorporates an earthen berm to help shield the park from the noise of the roadway. The Urban Council Kwun Chung Complex (now the Kwun Chung Municipal Services Building) was completed in September 1990 and opened on 1 January 1991 on the site of the former football pitch. A new football pitch and basketball courts were built on the site of the old Kwun Chung Market, and the market was moved into the new Urban Council complex. The complex also houses a cooked food centre and an indoor games hall. It was the first Urban Council Complex in the district and cost $410 million. Other changes made to the park at this time included the demolition and reprovisioning of the public toilet, the demolition of the children's library, construction of a new children's playground, and general improvements and redesign to other areas of the park.

Boasting occurs when someone feels a sense of satisfaction or when someone feels that whatever occurred proves their superiority and is recounting accomplishments so that others will feel admiration or envy. Individuals construct an image of themselves, a personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image. Theodore Millon theorized that in self-presentation, individuals seek to balance boasting against discrediting themselves with excessive self- promotion or being caught blatantly misrepresenting themselves. Studies show that people often have a limited ability to perceive how their efforts at self-presentation are actually impacting their acceptance and likeability by others.  Forms of bragging  Although a brag can be as straightforward as a simple claim to riches or greatness, it often assumes a variety of more subtle forms in order to shield the speaker from any opprobrium they might otherwise receive for transgressing the social norms of humility. The most popular of these forms is the humblebrag, a term coined by comedian Harris Wittels, whereby the brag is masked in a complaint. For example: ‚ÄúDating websites are so much work. Every time I log in, I have like 100 new messages.‚Äù Religious teachings Christian bible: Thus says the Lord: ‚ÄúLet not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches (Jeremiah 9:23 ESV). Quran: Verily, All√¢h does not like such as are proud and boastful; Those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other men and hide what All√¢h has bestowed upon them of His Bounties (The Noble Qur'an 4:36‚Äì37). Hindu wisdom: Whereas, in our Occident, the most dry and sterile minds brag in front of Nature (La Bible de l'Humanite in Oeuvres). Society and culture The Ancient Greek book The Characters of Theophrastus devotes a chapter to \\"The Boastful Man\\". Bƒìot is Old English for a ritualized boast, vow, threat or promise, which was usually made by an Anglo-Saxon warrior on the eve of or during battle. Bƒìots can be found in the epic poem Beowulf, including by the hero himself. A gab (Old Occitan [Àà…°ap] for \\"boast\\") is a troubadour boasting song.

In her hand she holds a silver rattle with bells, a status symbol. Catharina Pietersdr. Hooft (28 December 1618 - 30 September 1691) was a woman of the Dutch Golden Age. She became famous at a very early age, when she was painted by Frans Hals. At the age of sixteen she married Cornelis de Graeff, nineteen years her senior and the most powerful regent and mayor of Amsterdam. Thus she became first lady of Soestdijk, one of the family's country houses. Catharina Hooft was also a Lady of the High and free Fief of Purmerland and Ilpendam. Life The 18-year-old Catharina Hooft, second wife of Cornelis de Graeff, by Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy in the Gem√§ldegalerie Berlin Catharina Hooft was born in Amsterdam. Her father, Pieter Jansz Hooft, was a nephew of the Amsterdam mayor Cornelis Pietersz. Hooft and related to the renowned P. C. Hooft of the Muiderslot ‚Äì a wealthy citizen. Her mother, Geertruid Overlander (sister of Volkert Overlander), was forty-one and she and her husband had given up hope of having children when Catharina was born. On 14 August 1635 Catharina married Cornelis de Graeff, an older widower, whose first wife had been Catharina's cousin (her father's sister's child). The couple had themselves painted in princely fashion, in black with golden chains. Catharina bore two sons: Pieter and Jacob. When stadholder William II died in 1650, ten years later followed by his wife, Cornelis de Graeff was made one of the guardians of the ten-year-old William, the \\"Child of the State\\", who played with Catharina's sons. By the Act of Seclusion William was not allowed to accede and power remained in the regent's hands. Opposite the De Graeffs' house lived the powerful anti-Orangist Bicker family, consisting of Catharina‚Äôs brother-in-law and sister-in-law and their four daughters, one of whom married Catharina‚Äôs nephew, raadspensionaris Jan de Witt. Catharina was widowed in 1664 and when, in 1672, William stepped out of the shadows to become general and stadholder, she changed political tack and ‚Äì with her sons ‚Äì became a supporter of the House of Orange. William bought the de Graeff hunting lodge and its surrounding fields, now the Soestdijk Palace, for only 18,755 guilder. Catharina outlived her husband for thirty years. She died in Ilpendam and was buried in Amsterdam on October 6, 1691.

The squadron protects critical satellite communication links to detect, characterize, geolocate and report sources of electromagnetic interference on US military and commercial satellites. The squadron also provides combat-ready crews to deploy and employ defensive space control capabilities for theater combatant commanders. The squadron is Air Force Space Command's first defensive counterspace unit. From 1967 through 1994, the squadron, originally the 16th Surveillance Squadron, operated the Cobra Dane space detection system at Eareckson Air Force Base, Alaska.  Mission  The 16th Space Control Squadron operates space control capabilities to achieve space superiority in support of theater campaigns and United States Strategic Command's space superiority mission. To achieve this, 16th operates the Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System (RAIDRS) central operating location and up to six RAIDRS fixed ground stations and three deployable ground segments. The unit detects, characterizes, geolocation and electromagnetic interference for satellite communications systems, supporting combatant commanders. 16th SPCS operators can remotely control and task the fixed and deployable antenna suites from Peterson Air Force Base. Additionally, the three deployable systems are capable of sustained autonomous operations if connectivity is lost.  History =Cobra Dane operation The squadron was first organized at Shemya Air Force Station, Alaska as the 16th Surveillance Squadron and assigned to the 73d Aerospace Surveillance Wing of Air Defense Command. The unit's mission was to operate the Cobra Dane long- range early warning radar system, used to track Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile launches. In April 1967, the 73d Wing was inactivated and the 16th was assigned directly to Fourteenth Aerospace Force. The 16th continued its mission under Air (later Aerospace) Defense Command until the command was disestablished in December 1979. Strategic Air Command assumed responsibility for strategic space defense assets and assigned the squadron to its 47th Air Division. The unit was again reassigned in 1983, when the Air Force brought its space defense and communications units under Air Force Space Command, which assigned the squadron to the 1st Space Wing. In 1991, it was reassigned to the 73rd Space Surveillance Group. In 1992, the unit was designated the 16th Space Surveillance Squadron. It was inactivated in 1994. Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System The unit was reactivated at Peterson Air Force Base., Colorado in May 2007 under the 21st Space Wing to operate the Air Force's Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System (RAIDRS). The RAIDRS prototype, designated the \\"Satellite Interference Response System\\" (SIRS), was initially deployed to United States Central Command (USCENTCOM)'s area of responsibility for a 120-day proof of concept. When the proof of concept proved to be a success, SIRS was redesignated RAIDRS Deployable Ground Segment-0 and has been continually deployed to USCENTCOM since then.

It is thus an equine venereal disease of the genital tract of horses, brought on by the Taylorella equigenitalis bacteria and spread through sexual contact. The disease was first reported in 1977, and has since been reported worldwide.  Signs  Signs in mares appear ten to fourteen days after breeding to an infected or carrier stallion. A gray to creamy vulvar discharge mats the hair of the buttocks and tail, although in many cases, the discharge is absent and the infection is not apparent. Most mares recover spontaneously, although many become carriers. Infected mares are usually infertile during the acute illness. However, the infertility only lasts a few weeks, after which pregnancy is possible. Stallions do not show signs of infection. The first indication of the carrier state is lack of pregnancy in the mares covered by the stallion. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by taking samples for bacterial culture from all accessible sites. In mares, this includes the endometrium, cervix, clitoral fossa and sinuses. In stallions, samples are taken from the skin folds of the prepuce, urethral fossa, urethra, and the pre-ejaculatory fluid. Samples are refrigerated and transported to an approved testing laboratory within 48 hours of collection. Blood tests for mares are available for detecting antibodies to Taylorella equigenitalis. Blood tests are not possible for stallions. These tests become positive 10 or more days after infection. If positive, they only indicate that the mare has had the disease in the past, and do not indicate whether the mare is a carrier now. Treatment Taylorella equigenitalis is susceptible to most antibiotics, although the carrier state in mares is difficult to eliminate. Most mares with acute endometritis recover spontaneously. Recommended therapy is to infuse the uterus with an antibiotic such as penicillin, cleansing the clitoral area with 2% chlorhexidine solution and then applying chlorhexidine or nitrofurazone ointment to the clitoral fossa and sinuses. The entire treatment is repeated daily for five days. It is relatively easy to eliminate the carrier state in stallions using local disinfectant. With the stallion's penis dropped and the glans extended from the foreskin, the shaft of the penis, including the folds of the prepuce and the urethral fossa, should be cleansed daily for five days with a 2% chlorhexidine solution. After drying, nitrofurazone cream is applied to these areas. History The disease was first reported in 1977 on horse breeding farms in England, when an unusually high proportion of mares were not becoming pregnant. CEM was also officially confirmed in Ireland and Australia in 1977. It was found in United States in 1978 in horses imported to Kentucky from Europe. A second American outbreak occurred a year later in Missouri but in both cases, the diseases were quickly eradicated. In 2008, a Quarter Horse stallion standing at stud in Kentucky was found to be carrying Taylorella equigenitalis; an investigation of this case revealed infections in eight other US states, in eleven different breeds of horse.

He stands as the club's third-highest goalscorer in their history with 170 goals. Nicknamed 'Artillery' after a stint serving as a bombardier in the Royal Horse Artillery after leaving school, Hartill joined then-Second Division Wolves as a semi-professional in August 1928, making his league debut on 24 November 1928 at Bradford City. The following year, his first full season as a professional, he scored 33 goals in 36 games to finish as the club's top goalscorer. He repeated this feat in the next three successive seasons (five times in total), helping the club regain their top flight status as Second Division champions in 1931‚Äì32. He remained at Molineux until summer 1935, when he was sold to Everton. His overall tally of 170 goals made him the club's all-time leading goalscorer at the time, a record which stood until April 1980 when broken by John Richards. He twice scored 5 goals in a single match, a record never bettered by a Wolves player, and scored a then club record 16 hat-tricks (later beaten by Steve Bull). After a brief stay at Everton, he moved across Stanley Park to rivals Liverpool in January 1936, but again his spell with the club was to be short- lived. He managed just 4 games for the Reds during January‚ÄìFebruary 1936, before moving to Bristol Rovers as part of the deal that saw Phil Taylor move in the opposite direction. He retired from the game in 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, due to a leg injury suffered two years earlier. He died in August 1980 at the age of 75.

It consists of enhanced remakes of the first two Ys games developed and published by Nihon Falcom for the PC-8801 home computer in Japan. It was released as Ys Book I & II for the TurboGrafx- CD in North America in 1990, and was a pack-in title for the TurboDuo in 1992. Ys I & II was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on October 2007, and worldwide the following year. Overview Ys I & II consists of enhanced remakes of the first two games released in the Ys series, Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished and Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished ‚Äì The Final Chapter. It was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhanced graphics, animated cut scenes, (cf. ) a Red Book CD audio soundtrack, (cf. ) and voice acting. The game's English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. The game uses over 500 megabytes of CD-ROM storage, including 43 music tracks, 24 minutes of character voice acting, and 20 minutes of animated cutscene sequences. In both games the player controls a red-haired swordsman named Adol Christin. In the first game he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient, vanished land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces currently sweeping the land of Esteria. In Ys II Adol is transported to the floating civilization of Ys, and begins a quest to unravel the secrets of the land, and finally rid it and Esteria of evil. All English translations of Ys II were part of a compilation; no standalone version has been localized (except for iOS and Android ports). Plot=Ys I Ys I begins with a cutscene showing the main character, Adol Christin, gazing out to sea at the Stormwall which appeared around the island Esteria six months ago. Determined to investigate the situation, Adol sets off towards Esteria on a small boat; however, it is sunk by the storm and Adol washes up on the shore of Esteria. He is saved by a villager named Slaff from the port town of Barbado. Adol recuperates in the home of Barbado's doctor and learns that Slaff is both the doctor's son and the head of the town's militia. The militia was formed when demons and monsters appeared on the island, at the same time as when the Stormwall formed. The Stormwall cut Esteria off from the rest of the world and completely halted the trade of silver, which is mined on the island. Adol sets out to find out more about the island's situation in the largest town of Minea. There, he encounters a female troubadour named Reah. Reah is searching for her Silver Harmonica, which had been stolen, part of a rash of silver thefts that have occurred in the town. Linked with the thefts are sightings of a man in a dark cape. Adol then encounters the fortune-teller Sara, who tells him that she had a vision that a fiery-headed swordsman who would play a key role in Esteria's fate. She tells Adol of the six Books of Ys, named after the ancient kingdom that existed on the island seven hundred years ago. The Books of Ys contain the complete history of the rise and fall of Ys and will be instrumental in saving Esteria. Sara informs Adol that one book is in the Shrine of Solomon and sends him to the town of Zepik to speak with her aunt Jeba to learn more. In Zepik, Jeba gives Adol the Key to the Shrine. Adol also meets the mayor of Zepik, and learns that the town's treasured Silver Bells have been stolen. The Silver Bells gave off a sound that drove evil away, and without it, Zepik is vulnerable to demon attack. Adol assumes a mission from the mayor to negotiate the return of the bells from a bandit group in the area. When Adol meets with the bandit leader Goban however, Goban protests that his group only steals from the corrupt to give to the poor, and that in fact all of the bandits' silver possessions have been stolen from them. Adol leaves them and enters the Shrine of Solomon. Adol fights through demons through the Shrine of Solomon. In the lower levels, he rescues a young girl with long blue hair locked in a cell. The girl reveals that her name is Feena, and that a man with a dark cape imprisoned her there, but otherwise she has no memories about her past. Adol takes Feena to be looked after by Jeba, before returning to the Shrine, where he discovers the first Book of Ys on the lowest level. Returning to Minea, he finds that Sara has been murdered during his absence, with the culprit being a man in a dark cape. Sara had however already given her most important possession to a friend to present to Adol- the second Book of Ys. It is revealed that Reah was the one who has Sara's Book of Ys, and she returns it to Adol in exchange for her Silver Harmonica. He is then directed to the mine of the ruined village of Rastin for the third book. Adol sets off to the mine and recovers that third Book from its depths, and returns to Zepik. There, he finds Feena recovering under Jeba's care. Jeba and her family are descendants of the Ys priest Tovah, and thus Jeba is able to read the ancient text in the Books of Ys to Adol. The three books narrate the story of the creation of Cleria in ancient Ys, which brought great prosperity to the land. However, one day great hordes of demons suddenly appeared and attacked. An evil leader with six greater demons led the evil forces. The people of Ys retreated to the Temple of Solomon where they were besieged. During the siege the twin Goddesses of Ys suddenly disappeared from the Temple, and soon after the evil hordes also disappeared. The six Priests of Ys created the Books of Ys and imbued with magical power so that one day they might guide a hero to save the land of Ys. The people of Ys then reasoned that Cleria had been what attracted the evil and so buried it deep in the ground. Following this, Jeba tells Adol that the remaining books of Ys must be located in the great Tower of Darm, a towering structure which rises up to the clouds. The tower is nicknamed 'The Devil's Tower' and it stands in front of a giant crater named Bagyu Ba'dead. The bandit leader Goban is revealed to be Jeba's son, and the bandits' lair was set up in at the entrance of the Tower of Darm to protect the island after the demons appeared. Goban opens the entrance for Adol, noting that his lieutenant Dogi was also somewhere in the tower, having previously entered with other bandits in a successful attempt to destroy the monsters in the tower. Adol climbs the tower, but is soon caught by a magic trap which teleports him into a prison cell. The cell is occupied by Luta Gemma, a sleepwalking poet from Zepik who was captured by the monsters. They are soon rescued by Dogi, who is able to punch through walls with his bare hands. Dogi sends Adol to seek man named Raba on the upper floors. Raba was a scholar visiting Esteria who was inside the Tower of Darm, studying its history, when the demons suddenly appeared. Raba gives Adol a magical amulet which allows Adol to bypass the traps of the tower. In addition, Luta is a descendant of the ancient Ys priest Gemma, and Adol is given another amulet with the power to dispel magic seals. Adol climbs further, finding two more books along the way. Near the top of the tower, Adol discovers that Reah is also in the tower, having let herself be captured and brought there so she could give Adol a magic monocle which would allow him to read the language of the Books of Ys. After reaching the top of the tower, Adol finally confronts the final antagonist ‚Äì Dark Fact, a descendant of the ancient Priest Fact. Dark Fact boasts that Adol's efforts to collect the books have only helped his plan, and that once he took Adol's five books and combined them with his own, a great power would be revealed. The two fight, and Adol is victorious. In the folds of Dark Fact's cloak, Adol finds the final Book of Ys. As Adol uses the Monocle to read the entire set of books, a powerful white light fills his vision, and a feeling of serenity overcomes him. The monsters in the land dissolve into air, leaving it at peace. The words in the books begin to disappear and the forms of the Goddesses begin to materialize before him (it is noted that Adol does not recognize the Goddesses' faces). Adol rests and decides to tell Feena all that he has seen as soon as he returns to Zepik. Slowly, the white light envelopes his entire body. Ys II The story of Ys II continues off immediately from the end of Ys I. The game begins with an animated cutscene showing a figures in a dark room talking to a glowing orb about Adol. They are impressed by his having conquered the Tower of Darm, and decide to continue to observe him. The view then shifts to the final moments of Ys I, with light emanating from the Books of Ys and surrounding Adol. Adol then suddenly is flown high into the sky by the magic from the books, as Feena and Reah watch from a cliff outside the tower. The magic energy deposits Adol and the Books of Ys in a flash of light in a field, where he is discovered by a girl. The view pulls back to show that Adol has landed on an island floating in the air. A flashback to 700 years ago is shown: the two Goddesses of Ys are standing around a large glowing orb with their eyes closed, deep in concentration. Outside, a horde of demons lays siege to their location. A flying island is created, and soars high up into the sky, leaving a great crater behind. In the modern day, this island floats far above the Tower of Darm. When Adol wakes up, he weakly asks the girl where he is. She tells him that her name is Lilia and that he is in Ys. Adol is brought to Lance Village and recuperates in Lilia's home. When he wakes up, Lilia's mother tells him about Ys and the surrounding area. Lilia's mother also asks Adol to deliver a letter to the town doctor, Dr. Flair, discussing Lilia's illness. Speaking to villagers of Lance, he learns that demons appeared on the island six months ago, which forced the villagers to abandon the nearby Rasteenie mines. In addition, most of the villagers are unaware that there is a world outside of Ys. Adol goes to the town clinic to look for the doctor, but the doctor is not present. Suddenly, a flying pigeon arrives at the clinic bearing a message from the doctor, which states that he has been trapped in the Rasteenie mines by a cave in as he was picking herbs. Adol is asked to rescue the doctor from the mines, as only Adol could fight the demons inside. Adol agrees, and meets with the elder of the village to gain permission to enter the mines. The elder consents, but also mentions that he briefly saw two girls that resembled the Goddesses while walking in the ruins surrounding the mines. The elder also tells Adol that his having possession of the Books of Ys shows that he was guided by the spirits of the Priests of Ys to the island. The elder reveals to Adol that there is a place called the Sanctuary of Toal, connected to the Rasteenie mines, which houses statues of all six Priests, and that Adol should return the proper book to each statue in order to learn his purpose on the island. Adol sets off towards the mines with these three goals. In the ruins outside the mines, Adol discovers a staff that grants him the potential to use magic after he touches it to a statue of the Goddesses. An elderly villager who witnesses this tells Adol that the six magics of the Priests of Ys are still scattered around the island and will be of great use in Adol's quest. Inside the mine, Adol quickly finds Dr. Flair and digs him out, delivering the letter from Lilia's mother at the same time. Dr. Flair reads it and tells Adol that he was searching the mine for the ingredients to cure Lilia's illness. In the rest of the mine Adol finds the herbs the doctor needs, as well as several magical spells. He returns to Dr. Flair with the herbs, and Dr. Flair creates a medicine for Lilia. When Lilia finds out that Adol risked his life to get the ingredients for the medicine, she is eternally grateful and swears a life debt to him. When Adol returns the Books of Ys to the statues of the Priests of Ys, the spirits in the statues reveal that demons appeared on Ys at the same time as they appeared down below on the island of Esteria. They also revealed more about the history of Ys, stating that unknowingly, the source of demons was brought with them when they created the floating island 700 years ago around the Shrine of Solomon. Demons were created as a by-product of magic. The demons‚Äô master resides in the Shrine of Solomon, the former home of the Goddesses and Priests of Ys. Adol must find the Goddesses and defeat the evil in the Shrine of Solomon in order to destroy all the demons forever. Adol travels out of Lance towards the shrine at the center of the island, passing through the Glacier of Noltia and the lava filled Moat of Burnedbless, two geographical features created by the Goddesses 700 years ago as an attempted deterrent to demons attacking the shrine. In the moat, Adol discovers the Colony of Lava, whose inhabitants are all initially very hostile to him. Adol is barred from passing the bridge out of the village, but, by using the spells he has learned, he discovers that the bridgekeeper's son's Tarf was kidnapped by demons in order to force the villagers to stop Adol at Lava. Adol rescues the boy with the help of a friendly and intelligent demon named Keith, and is allowed to proceed onward from Lava. Adol finally arrives at the village of Ramia, which stands right outside of the Shrine of Solomon. The past few months, the demons have been kidnapping villagers for use as human sacrifices. Adol meets with an elderly villager, Hadat, whose son, Sada, had recently entered the shrine in an attempt to save his kidnapped fianc√©e, Maria. Hadat gives Adol advice about the shrine and asks him to attempt to save Sada and Maria. Adol infiltrates the demon filled Shrine of Solomon with the aid of a disguise spell. However, in the middle of the shrine, he is discovered by a dark-cloaked magician named Dalles (recognizable as the dark figure from the introduction cutscene). Dalles is able to see through Adol's disguise and curses Adol with a permanent demonic appearance. Returning to Ramia village to seek help, Adol is able to undo the curse with a help of a Sacred Cup that once belonged to the Priest Hadal. Any water put into it instantly becomes Holy Water, which allows Adol to escape Dalles' curse. Continuing his infiltration of the shrine, Adol discovers the hideout of some kidnapped villagers who had escaped from captivity. Lilia is surprisingly among them, having left Lance Village due to dreams of needing to help Adol in his quest. However, Dalles once again makes an appearance, thanking Adol for leading him to the escapees, and turns everyone into stone, leaving only Adol unharmed so he would suffer mentally. Undaunted, Adol keeps exploring the rest of the Shrine of Solomon, and again encounters the friendly demon Keith, who tells him that Maria is being held for sacrifice in a nearby bell tower called the Campanile of Lane. Adol enters the bell tower, fighting toward the top, defeating the demon sorceress Zava and seeing Maria along the way. At the top of the tower, Adol attempts to stop the ritual, but Dalles appears again and ensures the sacrifice is not disrupted. Adol then discovers the Dreaming Stone Idol, an artifact that is able to reverse magical petrification. He also notices that Maria has disappeared from where he had just seen her. With the artifact, Adol is able to return the stone villagers (including Sada) to normal before setting off to the innermost core of the shrine. Dalles appears once more to block Adol's way, and the two engage in a fight to the death, with Adol emerging victorious. As Adol heads into the core, he finds that many villagers, all of them descendants of the Priests of Ys, have come to aid him. He also discovers that Maria had survived the sacrificial ritual, thanks to a magical bracelet passed down through her family. Lilia also appears, and provides Adol with a ring that can break the magic barriers barring his way. Right outside the final room, Adol discovers the two Goddesses imprisoned by magic energy. He is taunted by the voice of the master of the demons, who reveals that after 700 years, it has finally broken free of the imprisonment thrust upon it by the Goddesses and the Priests of Ys, and now demons would finally rule the world. Suddenly, Goban Tovah and Luta Gemma from Ys I appear in the room. They had climbed the Tower of Darm after having a dream in which the Goddesses told them Ys was returning to the surface and they were needed. Goban provides Adol with Reah's Silver Harmonica, the sound of which dispels the energy binding the Goddesses. Adol is finally able to meet the Goddesses, who are confirmed to be Feena and Reah. Reah explains the events that had led to this point: 700 years ago, after the demons had been defeated, the Goddesses sealed away the power of the Black Pearl, a great orb that was the source of magic in the society of Ancient Ys, as they had discovered the magic from the Black Pearl had caused the creation of demons as a side effect. The Goddesses also chose to stay behind on the surface of Esteria, and sealed away the magic-enhancing metal Cleria deep in the ground, after which they went into a long slumber. Centuries passed and all was peaceful, but some Cleria was accidentally mined by the inhabitants of Esteria while they were mining silver. This released enough magic to enable Dark Fact to break the seal on the Black Pearl, leading to the events of Ys I. The Goddesses do not have the strength to seal the demons again, and must now rely on Adol to be their champion. With the descendants of the Priests of Ys and the Goddesses present, Adol is lent their power before he faces his final opponent: the sentient form of the Black Pearl, Darm. After a long battle, Adol is able to destroy it, wiping out all the demons in Ys. Adol reappears in the sanctuary of the Goddesses, along with Feena, Reah, and all the descendants of the Priests. They all congratulate him and note that with the Black Pearl destroyed, the floating island of Ys was slowly sinking back to its original position, in the giant crater on Esteria. Tearfully, Feena says goodbye to Adol, as the Goddesses will once again enter a magic sleep to watch over Esteria and make sure the magic from the Black Pearl does not return, and she wished to confess her feelings for him before then, asking him to always remember her. They slowly part ways, as the inhabitants of Ys prepare for a new era, rejoined with the rest of the world.

One of the best known and intensively studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian‚ÄìEmperor seamount chain, a mostly undersea volcanic mountain range. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant; more than 123 are extinct, most now preserved as atolls or seamounts. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii to the edge of the Aleutian Trench, near the eastern coast of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60¬∞ bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's. Ancient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880‚Äì1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory was founded in 1912 by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor. The hotspot has since been tomographically imaged, showing it to be wide and up to deep, and olivine and garnet-based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately . In its at least 85 million years of activity the hotspot has produced an estimated of rock. The chain's rate of drift has slowly increased over time, causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease, from 18 million years for the 76-million-year-old Detroit Seamount, to just under 900,000 for the one-million-year-old Kohala; on the other hand, eruptive volume has increased from per year to about . Overall, this has caused a trend towards more active but quickly-silenced, closely spaced volcanoes‚Äîwhereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other (forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the ancient Maui Nui), the oldest of the Emperor seamounts are spaced as far as apart. Theories Tectonic plates generally focus deformation and volcanism at plate boundaries. However, the Hawaii hotspot is more than from the nearest plate boundary; while studying it in 1963, Canadian geophysicist J. Tuzo Wilson proposed the hotspot theory to explain these zones of volcanism so far from regular conditions, a theory that has since come into wide acceptance. Wilson's stationary hotspot theory Map, color-coded from red to blue to indicate the age of crust built by alt=Global map labeled Crustal Age with callouts for specific areas of interest. There is an overall pattern of younger crust in the East Pacific and younger in the West. Wilson proposed that mantle convection produces small, hot buoyant upwellings under the Earth's surface; these thermally active mantle plumes supply magma which in turn sustains long-lasting volcanic activity. This \\"mid-plate\\" volcanism builds peaks that rise from relatively featureless sea floor, initially as seamounts and later as fully-fledged volcanic islands. The local tectonic plate (in the case of the Hawaii hotspot, the Pacific Plate) slowly slides over the hotspot, carrying its volcanoes with it without affecting the plume. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the magma supply for the volcano is slowly cut off, eventually going extinct. No longer active enough to overpower erosion, the volcano slowly sinks beneath the waves, becoming a seamount once again. As the cycle continues, a new volcanic center manifests, and a volcanic island arises anew. The process continues until the mantle plume itself collapses. This cycle of growth and dormancy strings together volcanoes over millions of years, leaving a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor. According to Wilson's theory, the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot, and this is easily observable; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands, that of Kauai, is about 5.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock on Hawaii island is a comparatively young 0.7 million years of age or less, with new lava constantly erupting at Kƒ´lauea, the hotspot's present center. Another consequence of his theory is that the chain's length and orientation serves to record the direction and speed of the Pacific Plate's movement. A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60¬∞ bend at a 40- to 50-million-year-old section of its length, and according to Wilson's theory, this is evidence of a major change in plate direction, one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate's western boundary. This part of the theory has recently been challenged, and the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself. Geophysicists believe that hotspots originate at one of two major boundaries deep in the Earth, either a shallow interface in the lower mantle between an upper mantle convecting layer and a lower non-convecting layer, or a deeper D (\\"D double-prime\\") layer, approximately thick and immediately above the core-mantle boundary. A mantle plume would initiate at the interface when the warmer lower layer heats a portion of the cooler upper layer. This heated, buoyant, and less-viscous portion of the upper layer would become less dense due to thermal expansion, and rise towards the surface as a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. When the mantle plume reaches the base of the lithosphere, the plume heats it and produces melt. This magma then makes its way to the surface, where it is erupted as lava. Arguments for the validity of the hotspot theory generally center on the steady age progression of the Hawaiian islands and nearby features: a similar bend in the trail of the Macdonald hotspot, the Austral‚ÄìMarshall Islands seamount chain, located just south; other Pacific hotspots following the same age-progressed trend from southeast to northwest in fixed relative positions; and seismologic studies of Hawaii which show increased temperatures at the core‚Äìmantle boundary, evidencing a mantle plume. Shallow hotspot hypothesis internal structure Another hypothesis is that melting anomalies form as a result of lithospheric extension, which allows pre-existing melt to rise to the surface. These melting anomalies are normally called \\"hotspots\\", but under the shallow- source hypothesis the mantle underlying them is not anomalously hot. In the case of the Emperor-Hawaiian seamount chain, the Pacific plate boundary system was very different at ~ 80 Ma, when the Emperor seamount chain began to form. There is evidence that the chain started on a spreading ridge (the Pacific- Kula Ridge) that has now been subducted at the Aleutian trench. The locus of melt extraction may have migrated off the ridge and into the plate interior, leaving a trail of volcanism behind it. This migration may have occurred because this part of the plate was extending in order to accommodate intraplate stress. Thus, a long-lived region of melt escape could have been sustained. Supporters of this hypothesis argue that the wavespeed anomalies seen in seismic tomographic studies cannot be reliably interpreted as hot upwellings originating in the lower mantle. Moving hotspot theory The most heavily challenged element of Wilson's theory is whether hotspots are indeed fixed relative to the overlying tectonic plates. Drill samples, collected by scientists as far back as 1963, suggest that the hotspot may have drifted over time, at the relatively rapid pace of about per year during the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene eras (81-47 Mya); in comparison, the Mid- Atlantic Ridge spreads at a rate of per year. In 1987, a study published by Peter Molnar and Joann Stock found that the hotspot does move relative to the Atlantic Ocean; however, they interpreted this as the result of the relative motions of the North American and Pacific plates rather than that of the hotspot itself. In 2001 the Ocean Drilling Program (since merged into the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), an international research effort to study the world's seafloors, funded a two-month expedition aboard the research vessel JOIDES Resolution to collect lava samples from four submerged Emperor seamounts. The project drilled Detroit, Nintoku, and Koko seamounts, all of which are in the far northwest end of the chain, the oldest section. These lava samples were then tested in 2003, suggested a mobile Hawaiian hotspot and a shift in its motion as the cause of the bend. Lead scientist John Tarduno told National Geographic: > The Hawaii bend was used as a classic example of how a large plate can > change motion quickly. You can find a diagram of the Hawaii ‚Äì Emperor bend > entered into just about every introductory geological textbook out there. It > really is something that catches your eye.\\" Despite the large shift, the change in direction was never recorded by magnetic declinations, fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test whether the bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely. History of study=Ancient Hawaiian The possibility that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes. Pele was born to the female spirit Haumea, or Hina, who, like all Hawaiian gods and goddesses, descended from the supreme beings, Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, or Sky Father. According to the myth, Pele originally lived on Kauai, when her older sister NƒÅmaka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by NƒÅmaka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she still lives in Halema ªuma ªu at the summit of Kƒ´lauea. There she was safe, because the slopes of the volcano are so high that even NƒÅmaka's mighty waves could not reach her. Pele's mythical flight, which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves, is consistent with geologic evidence about the ages of the islands decreasing to the southeast. Modern studies The Loa and Kea volcanic trends follow meandering parallel paths for thousands of miles. Three of the earliest recorded observers of the volcanoes were the Scottish scientists Archibald Menzies in 1794, James Macrae in 1825, and David Douglas in 1834. Just reaching the summits proved daunting: Menzies took three attempts to ascend Mauna Loa, and Douglas died on the slopes of Mauna Kea. The United States Exploring Expedition spent several months studying the islands in 1840‚Äì1841. American geologist James Dwight Dana was on that expedition, as was Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, who spent most of the time leading a team of hundreds that hauled a pendulum to the summit of Mauna Loa to measure gravity. Dana stayed with missionary Titus Coan, who would provide decades of first-hand observations. Dana published a short paper in 1852. Dana remained interested in the origin of the Hawaiian Islands, and directed a more in-depth study in 1880 and 1881. He confirmed that the islands' age increased with their distance from the southeasternmost island by observing differences in their degree of erosion. He also suggested that many other island chains in the Pacific showed a similar general increase in age from southeast to northwest. Dana concluded that the Hawaiian chain consisted of two volcanic strands, located along distinct but parallel curving pathways. He coined the terms \\"Loa\\" and \\"Kea\\" for the two prominent trends. The Kea trend includes the volcanoes of Kƒ´lauea, Mauna Kea, Kohala, HaleakalƒÅ, and West Maui. The Loa trend includes L≈çihi, Mauna Loa, HualƒÅlai, Kahoolawe, LƒÅnai, and West Molokai. Dana proposed that the alignment of the Hawaiian Islands reflected localized volcanic activity along a major fissure zone. Dana's \\"great fissure\\" theory served as the working hypothesis for subsequent studies until the mid-20th century. Dana's work was followed up by geologist C. E. Dutton's 1884 expedition, who refined and expanded Dana's ideas. Most notably, Dutton established that the island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes, whereas Dana counted three. This is because Dana had originally regarded Kƒ´lauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa, and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea. Dutton also refined others of Dana's observations, and is credited with the naming of 'a'ƒÅ and pƒÅhoehoe-type lavas, although Dana had noted a distinction. Stimulated by Dutton's expedition, Dana returned in 1887, and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science. In 1890 he published the most detailed manuscript of its day, and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades. 1909 saw the publication of two large volumes which extensively quoted from earlier works now out of circulation. In 1912 geologist Thomas Jaggar founded the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility was taken over in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century was a period of thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages). In the 1970s, the Hawaiian seafloor was mapped using ship- based sonar. Computed SYNBAPS (Synthetic Bathymetric Profiling System) data filled holes between the ship-based sonar bathymetric measurements. From 1994 to 1998 the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) mapped Hawaii in detail and studied its ocean floor, making it one of the world's best-studied marine features. The JAMSTEC project, a collaboration with USGS and other agencies, utilized manned submersibles, remotely operated underwater vehicles, dredge samples, and core samples. The Simrad EM300 multibeam side-scanning sonar system collected bathymetry and backscatter data. Characteristics=Position The Hawaii hotspot has been imaged through seismic tomography, and is estimated to be wide. Tomographic images show a thin low-velocity zone extending to a depth of , connecting with a large low-velocity zone extending from a depth of to the core-mantle boundary. These low seismic velocity zones often indicate hotter and more buoyant mantle material, consistent with a plume originating in the lower mantle and a pond of plume material in the upper mantle. The low-velocity zone associated with the source of the plume is north of Hawaii, showing that the plume is tilted to a certain degree, deflected toward the south by mantle flow. Uranium decay- series disequilibria data has shown that the actively flowing region of the melt zone is km wide at its base and at the upper mantle upwelling, consistent with tomographic measurements.  Temperature  Indirect studies found that the magma chamber is located about underground, which matches the estimated depth of the Cretaceous Period rock in the oceanic lithosphere; this may indicate that the lithosphere acts as a lid on melting by arresting the magma's ascent. The magma's original temperature was found in two ways, by testing garnet's melting point in lava and by adjusting the lava for olivine deterioration. Both USGS tests seem to confirm the temperature at about ; in comparison, the estimated temperature for mid-ocean ridge basalt is about . The surface heat flow anomaly around the Hawaiian Swell is only of the order of 10 mW/m2, far less than the continental United States range of 25 to 150 mW/m2. This is unexpected for the classic model of a hot, buoyant plume in the mantle. However, it has been shown that other plumes display highly variable surface heat fluxes and that this variability may be due to variable hydrothermal fluid flow in the Earth's crust above the hotspots. This fluid flow advectively removes heat from the crust, and the measured conductive heat flow is therefore lower than the true total surface heat flux. The low heat across the Hawaiian Swell indicates that it is not supported by a buoyant crust or upper lithosphere, but is rather propped up by the upwelling hot (and therefore less-dense) mantle plume that causes the surface to rise through a mechanism known as \\"dynamic topography\\". Movement Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest from the hotspot at a rate of about a year. The hotspot has migrated south by about relative to the Emperor chain. Paleomagnetic studies support this conclusion based on changes in Earth's magnetic field, a picture of which was engrained in the rocks at the time of their solidification, showing that these seamounts formed at higher latitudes than present-day Hawaii. Prior to the bend, the hotspot migrated an estimated per year; the rate of movement changed at the time of the bend to about per year. The Ocean Drilling Program provided most of the current knowledge about the drift. The 2001 expedition drilled six seamounts and tested the samples to determine their original latitude, and thus the characteristics and speed of the hotspot's drift pattern in total. Each successive volcano spends less time actively attached to the plume. The large difference between the youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 years ago, a period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million or more years of volcanic activity. The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, perched on the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the seamount will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated. Magma A lava fountain at Pu'u 'O'o, a volcanic cone on the flank of Kilauea. Pu'u 'O'o is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and erupted nearly continuously from 3 January 1983 to April 2018. The composition of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly according to analysis of the strontium‚Äìniobium‚Äìpalladium elemental ratios. The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years, with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period, followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment of the chain, totaling 85 million years. Data demonstrate vertical variability in the amount of strontium present in both the alkalic (early stages) and tholeiitic (later stages) lavas. The systematic increase slows drastically at the time of the bend. Almost all magma created by the hotspot is igneous basalt; the volcanoes are constructed almost entirely of this or the similar in composition but coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Other igneous rocks such as nephelinite are present in small quantities; these occur often on the older volcanoes, most prominently Detroit Seamount. Most eruptions are runny because basaltic magma is less viscous than magmas characteristic of more explosive eruptions such as the andesitic magmas that produce spectacular and dangerous eruptions around Pacific Basin margins. Volcanoes fall into several eruptive categories. Hawaiian volcanoes are called \\"Hawaiian-type\\". Hawaiian lava spills out of craters and forms long streams of glowing molten rock, flowing down the slope, covering acres of land and replacing ocean with new land. Eruptive frequency and scale Bathymetry and topography of the southeastern Hawaiian Islands, with historic lava flows shown in red There is significant evidence that lava flow rates have been increasing. Over the last six million years they have been far higher than ever before, at over per year. The average for the last million years is even higher, at about . In comparison, the average production rate at a mid-ocean ridge is about for every of ridge. The rate along the Emperor seamount chain averaged about per year. The rate was almost zero for the initial five million or so years in the hotspot's life. The average lava production rate along the Hawaiian chain has been greater, at per year. In total, the hotspot has produced an estimated of lava, enough to cover California with a layer about thick.D. A. Clauge and G. B. Dalrymple (1987). \\"The Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic chain: Part 1. Geologic Evolution\\". United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 1350. p. 23. The distance between individual volcanoes has shrunk. Although volcanoes have been drifting north faster and spending less time active, the far greater modern eruptive volume of the hotspot has generated more closely spaced volcanoes, and many of them overlap, forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the ancient Maui Nui. Meanwhile, many of the volcanoes in the Emperor seamounts are separated by or even as much as . Topography and geoid A detailed topographic analysis of the Hawaiian ‚Äì Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot as the center of a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time. In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and his colleagues first identified the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which the motion of the hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth. Seismicity The Hawaii hotspot is a highly active seismic zone with thousands of earthquakes occurring on and near Hawaii island every year. Most are too small to be felt by people but some are large enough to result in minor to moderate devastation. The most destructive recorded earthquake was the 2 April 1868 earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa, north of Pahala, killing 31 people. A tsunami claimed 46 more lives. The villages of Punalu ªu, Nƒ´nole, Kawaa, Honuapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged. The tsunami reportedly rolled over the tops of the coconut trees up to high and it reached inland a distance of a quarter of a mile (400 meters) in some places. Volcanoes Over its 85 million year history, the Hawaii hotspot has created at least 129 volcanoes, more than 123 of which are extinct volcanoes, seamounts, and atolls, four of which are active volcanoes, and two of which are dormant volcanoes. They can be organized into three general categories: the Hawaiian archipelago, which comprises most of the U.S. state of Hawaii and is the location of all modern volcanic activity; the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which consist of coral atolls, extinct islands, and atoll islands; and the Emperor Seamounts, all of which have since eroded and subsided to the sea and become seamounts and guyots (flat-topped seamounts).  Volcanic characteristics  Kƒ´lauea's eastern rift zone Hawaiian volcanoes are characterized by frequent rift eruptions, their large size (thousands of cubic kilometers in volume), and their rough, decentralized shape. Rift zones are a prominent feature on these volcanoes, and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure. The tallest mountain in the Hawaii chain, Mauna Kea, rises above mean sea level. Measured from its base on the seafloor, it is the world's tallest mountain, at ; Mount Everest rises above sea level. Hawaii is surrounded by a myriad of seamounts; however, they were found to be unconnected to the hotspot and its volcanism. Kƒ´lauea has erupted continuously since 1983 through Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç, a minor volcanic cone, which has become an attraction for volcanologists and tourists alike. Landslides The Hawaiian islands are carpeted by a large number of landslides sourced from volcanic collapse. Bathymetric mapping has revealed at least 70 large landslides on the island flanks over in length, and the longest are long and over in volume. These debris flows can be sorted into two broad categories: slumps, mass movement over slopes which slowly flatten their originators, and more catastrophic debris avalanches, which fragment volcanic slopes and scatter volcanic debris past their slopes. These slides have caused massive tsunamis and earthquakes, fractured volcanic massifs, and scattered debris hundreds of miles away from their source. Slumps tend to be deeply rooted in their originators, moving rock up to deep inside the volcano. Forced forward by the mass of newly ejected volcanic material, slumps may creep forward slowly, or surge forward in spasms that have caused the largest of Hawaii's historical earthquakes, in 1868 and 1975. Debris avalanches, meanwhile, are thinner and longer, and are defined by volcanic amphitheaters at their head and hummocky terrain at their base. Rapidly moving avalanches carried blocks tens of kilometers away, disturbing the local water column and causing a tsunami. Evidence of these events exists in the form of marine deposits high on the slopes of many Hawaiian volcanoes, and has marred the slopes of several Emperor seamounts, such as Daikakuji Guyot and Detroit Seamount. Evolution and construction alt=Animation showing an intact volcano that gradually shrinks in size with some of the lava around its perimeter replaced by coral Hawaiian volcanoes follow a well-established life cycle of growth and erosion. After a new volcano forms, its lava output gradually increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount. This life cycle consists of several stages. The first stage is the submarine preshield stage, currently represented solely by L≈ç ªihi Seamount. During this stage, the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions. The sea's pressure prevents explosive eruptions. The cold water quickly solidifies the lava, producing the pillow lava that is typical of underwater volcanic activity. As the seamount slowly grows, it goes through the shield stages. It forms many mature features, such as a caldera, while submerged. The summit eventually breaches the surface, and the lava and ocean water \\"battle\\" for control as the volcano enters the explosive subphase. This stage of development is exemplified by explosive steam vents. This stage produces mostly volcanic ash, a result of the waves dampening the lava. This conflict between lava and sea influences Hawaiian mythology. The volcano enters the subaerial subphase once it is tall enough to escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava released in this stage often includes both pƒÅhoehoe and  ªa ªƒÅ, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kƒ´lauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it is most likely to run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava. After the subaerial phase the volcano enters a series of postshield stages involving subsidence and erosion, becoming an atoll and eventually a seamount. Once the Pacific Plate moves it out of the tropics, the reef mostly dies away, and the extinct volcano becomes one of an estimated 10,000 barren seamounts worldwide. Every Emperor seamount is a dead volcano.

It includes the industrial area known as Porto Marghera or Venezia Porto Marghera. Etymology The name \\"Marghera\\", stems from the fact that the area where the present city was built, was once a marine swamp. In the Venetian language, \\"Mar gh' era\\" means \\"There was the sea\\". History At the beginning of the 20th century Venice's existing port at Bacino San Marco was incapable of servicing large modern ships.Madden. Page 403. A new port was constructed at the western end of Venice at Stazione Marittima, but it became clear that if industry was developed in its immediate vicinity it would negatively impact on the historical city and tourism. As a result, by 1917 ‚Äì during the First World War ‚Äì the Italian government decided to develop an industrial zone and state-of-the-art port at Marghera on the mainland, opposite Venice and near the town of Mestre. A major backer of the scheme was Count Giuseppe Volpi.Madden. Page 404. Development commenced in 1920, and for 10 years shipping channels were dredged, excavations and land reclamation took place. A residential area was constructed for the zone's workers. In 1923, the first chemical factory commenced production. The number of workers employed in the zone rose to 6000 by 1930, 16,000 by 1950 and 35,000 by 1970. In 1926 Marghera and Mestre were made a frazione under the control of the municipal government of Venice. By 1940, more than 60 factories were established at Marghera, and as a result during World War II Allied bombers targeted Porto Marghera. On May 15, 2020, a fire in a chemical plant producing cosmetics, including nail varnish remover, forced Venetians to stay indoors.

Schlesinger Jr., is a book published in 1973 by Houghton Mifflin. This book details the history of the Presidency of the United States from its conception by the Founding Fathers through the latter half of the 20th century. Schlesinger wrote the book out of two concerns: first, that the US Presidency was out of control and second, that the Presidency had exceeded its constitutional limits.Schlesinger, p. x A presidency becomes imperial when it relies on powers beyond those allowed by the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution established three separate branches of government, not for efficiency but to avoid the arbitrary exercise of power. The government outlined by the Constitution was to replace and improve upon the imperial executive government of King George III of Britain.Schlesinger, p. vii The book links the president's accumulation of foreign powers during wartimes to the accretion of domestic powers. The Constitution and its authors determined that the power to initiate a war belonged to the Congress. The president had the responsibilities to conduct ongoing wars and ongoing foreign relations, and to respond to sudden attacks if Congress were not in session.Schlesinger, p. 35 As the United States became a great world power and then a superpower, the presidency acquired more war powers despite the Constitution. That reduced Congress' powers and the separation of powers, which is necessary to avoid the arbitrary use of power.Schlesinger, p. vii Through various means, presidents subsequently acquired powers beyond the limits of the constitution. The daily accountability of the president to the Congress, the courts, the press, and the people has been replaced by an accountability of only once each four years, during an election. The changes have occurred slowly over the centuries so that what appears normal differs greatly from what was the original state of America.Schlesinger, Book dust jacket  Synopsis = 1793‚Äì1896  In 1793, President George Washington unilaterally determined that the new American Republic was neutral in the war between Britain and France during the French Revolutionary Wars. Alexander Hamilton supported the action while Thomas Jefferson and James Madison objected. The proclamation prohibited American citizens from assisting either Britain or France. However, grand juries refused to enforce the proclamation.Schlesinger, p. 18 In 1846, to annex Texas, President James K. Polk sent troops between Texas and Mexico, which provoked a war. Polk then manipulated Congress into recognizing a state of war. Representative Abraham Lincoln stated if it was allowed, a president could arbitrarily make war just as monarchs do and that the Constitutional Convention recognized that declaring war must not be in the hands of one man.Schlesinger, pp. 42‚Äì43 During the American Civil War, Lincoln assumed war powers as commander-in-chief of the military but made no claim that the constitution allowed him these powers. Without congressional authorization, Lincoln unilaterally expanded the military, suspended habeas corpus, arrested citizens, proclaimed martial law, seized property, censored newspapers, and emancipated slaves. Lincoln justified the actions as necessary to preserve the country rather than by the constitution.Schlesinger, pp. 58‚Äì60 However, he stated that the presidential war powers would cease to exist once the national emergency, the Civil War, ended.Schlesinger, p. 66 After the Civil War, the Supreme Court, in 1866, asserted that the constitution was the law of the land in war and peace and that government powers can not exceed those granted by the constitution.Schlesinger, p. 69 In 1867, the Supreme Court stated that the President must carry out the law and may not break the law. Presidential power was deflated following the Civil War.Schlesinger, p. 70 With the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the United States became a great power, and presidential power expanded.Schlesinger, p. 82 In 1900, President William McKinley sent 5,000 troops to China (see Boxer Rebellion) for political purposes without congressional approval.  1900‚Äì1949  President Theodore Roosevelt sent troops into many Caribbean countries and established new governments in several without congressional approval,Schlesinger, pp. 88‚Äì89 including actions in Colombia, Panama, Honduras, Dominican Republic, and Cuba. (See List of United States military history events.) In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge sent 5,000 troops to Nicaragua without congressional approval. He was considered a strict constructionist in other matters.Schlesinger, p. 94 In 1939, after the start of World War II in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a limited national emergency. The concept of limited national emergency seems to rest on implied and assumed powers of the president and the assertion of it by him. On May 27, 1941, Roosevelt determined that the nation was in a state of unlimited national emergency. Congress ended the national emergency in 1947, two years after the end of World War II. National emergency powers are defined as \\"the President may seize property, organize and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens.\\" In 1942, Roosevelt threatened Congress that if a provision of the Emergency Price Control Act was not repealed within three weeks, he would block its implementation. World War II was used to justify this threat. Like Lincoln, he added that when the war ended, the war powers would return to the people. Congress repealed the provision, and the threat was not acted upon.Schlesinger, pp. 115‚Äì116 Throughout the history of the presidency, a pattern emerged that the president assumed greater powers during the emergency. After the emergency had passed, Congress would assert itself. That occurred after the Civil War and World War I, but after World War II, Congress did not assert itself as much because of the Cold War. In 1946, Democratic President Harry S. Truman wanted the Republican Congress to approve aid to Greece and Turkey. He found that by turning a reasonable program into the Truman Doctrine and exaggerating the issue, he got the appropriation.Schlesinger, pp. 127‚Äì128  1950‚Äì1964  In 1950, Truman had sent troops to the Korean War without Congressional approval.Schlesinger, pp. 131‚Äì132 In 1952, Truman feared a national strike by the steel industry would impair the military's ability to fight the Korean War. He ordered the Secretary of Commerce to seize and operate the steel mills without Congressional approval.Schlesinger, p. 141 The Supreme Court found the actions unconstitutional. The majority of justices stated that the Commander-in-Chief clause of the constitution did not apply to domestic matters and that the president must comply with existing laws on this matter.Schlesinger, pp. 143‚Äì144, 147 By 1952, Truman increased the Armed Services to 3.6 million, and that by itself resulted in an increase in presidential power. Before then, only Lincoln had increased the Army without Congressional approval. The addition of 50 treaties increased presidential responsibilities and power in the 1950s.Schlesinger, p. 165 The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), under the direction of the president, overthrew the governments of Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954). The CIA attempted but failed to overthrow the government of Indonesia. Schlesinger claims the CIA installed new governments in Egypt (1954) and Laos (1959). Also, the CIA helped organize Cuban refugees to overthrow the Cuban government (1960‚Äì1961).Schlesinger, p. 167 The presidency's control of foreign policy vastly increased while constitutional separation of powers decreased.Schlesinger, p. 168 In the decade after the Korean War, most liberal and conservative members of Congress agreed on presidential control of foreign policy.Schlesinger, p. 169 The Cuban Missile Crisis showed that independent and unilateral presidential action in extreme circumstances is, at times, required. However, it was a unique situation of threat and secrecy in the nuclear age and should not have been used to justify the imperial presidency.Schlesinger, p. 176 1965‚Äì1969 In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent 22,000 troops to the Dominican Republic without congressional approval. The same year, he sent combat troops for the first time into Vietnam. The war lasted the longest in US history and resulted in the fourth largest number of US casualties after the Civil War and the two world wars. The Tonkin Gulf resolution authorized the president to use the military, as he required. That was transfer of war powers from Congress to the president.Schlesinger, pp. 178‚Äì181 Lincoln believed that if the president could bring the country to war, he held the power of a king. In 1970, President Richard Nixon ordered an intervention into Cambodia without Congressional approval. By 1971, the Tonkin Gulf resolution was revoked by Congress. However, the Vietnam War continued, solely from Nixon's authority.Schlesinger, p. 187 Nixon claimed war powers as Commander-in-Chief of the military. Before Lincoln, that title indicated only the topmost officer of the armed forces. Lincoln used it for greater authority and so could future presidents in the event of a civil war. Nixon justified his authority to order the invasion of Cambodia only by his title of Commander-in-Chief.Schlesinger, pp. 188‚Äì189  1969‚Äì1973  Cambodia and Laos were both purportedly neutral countries, but were being used as a base of operations by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong.Cf. Ho Chi Minh trail Laos was bombed from 1964 to 1973. This was kept secret from Congress.Schlesinger, pp. 192‚Äì3 In 1971, Congress passed an amendment to the defense-spending bill to terminate all military operations in Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam) and Nixon signed it but he continued to fight in Vietnam.Schlesinger, p. 194 Under Nixon Congress had no war powers.Schlesinger, p. 198 By 1971, Congress discovered seven secret bases, and 32,000 troops in Thailand. Nixon had made defense agreements with Thailand and the federal government was secretly funding the Ethiopian Army, all without Congress‚Äô knowledge or approval. The Constitution requires 2/3 Senate approval of treaties before they become law.Schlesinger, p. 203 The imperial Presidency was created in response to foreign policy issues. This resulted in the exclusion of the Congress, the press, the public and the Constitution in foreign policy decisions. Once established, the imperial Presidency then expanded into domestic issues.Schlesinger, p. 208 Starting in 1947, Presidential power over the federal budget with slight modifications by Congress gave the President important controls over the economy and social priorities.Schlesinger, p. 211 Strong Presidents should have strong-minded advisors.Schlesinger, p. 219 Schlesinger claims Nixon dismissed the opinions of the public, the press, and foreign nations and used price controls, tax relief, and subsidies, tariffs, import quotas and fiscal policy to manage the economy. These economic powers were used to reward economic sectors that supported his actions and punish those sectors that opposed his actions. Rather than veto Congressional legislation that he opposed, he would impound the funds.Schlesinger, pp. 232‚Äì235 The only option the Constitution allows if President opposes a law is the veto. The Constitution empowers the Congress to determine the level of spending, not the President. The President is not allowed to selectively enforce laws, which Nixon did.Schlesinger, pp. 240‚Äì241 Nixon's Presidential model resembled the plebiscitary Presidency. Plebiscitary democracy is defined as where a leader is elected but once elected has almost all of the power. Another explanation of the Nixon model would be a personal dictatorship or an elective kingship under the Constitution where the President represents the democratic majority and any opposition is considered antidemocratic. Public responses are limited to voting during elections.Schlesinger, pp. 254‚Äì255 In 1970, Nixon authorized investigating peaceful protesters but found nothing. Agents of the Treasury Department went to public libraries to examine the book borrowing records of citizens. Breaking and entering was authorized by Nixon to investigate suspects. The National Security Agency was authorized to monitor conversations of citizens making international phone calls. Citizens‚Äô letters were opened and copied.Schlesinger, pp. 258‚Äì259 Nixon authorized his own private outfit, which burglarized, wiretapped, bugged, and used secret agents and political blackmail contrary to the laws and Constitution.Schlesinger, p. 265 The Watergate scandal was the most public part of these activities.Schlesinger, p. 266 Nixon claimed that the President was not required to obey certain laws. He nearly succeeded but for the actions of hardline opponents.Schlesinger, p. 275 The courts, the press, executive agencies, and Congress cannot take credit for blocking the imperial presidency however they benefited from less powerful Presidency.Schlesinger, Arthur M., Jr., The Imperial Presidency, page 277, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1973. Blocking the imperial presidency did not change the conditions that made it possible.Schlesinger, p. 278  Problems and solutions  Foreign policy challenges the separation of powers. The presidency reigns supreme in foreign policy.Schlesinger, p. 279 That one person should neither commit the nation to war nor continue a war is valid and constitutional.Schlesinger, p. 284 However, those raising constitutional questions do so for usually political reasons.Schlesinger, p. 287 Schlesinger writes: Congress and the president should reduce US interests abroad and lower military spending, which would lower the pressure on the national government and allow Congress to act.Schlesinger, p. 300 Only two requirements would be needed to resolve the situation: # First, the president must both report to Congress immediately, with all information and justification, when troops were sent into battle and continue to report during the conflict. # Second, a joint declaration by Congress at any time can terminate the conflict.Schlesinger, p. 306 Another option during peacetimes is allowing Congress to control troops overseas.Schlesinger, p. 307 The history of U.S. war-making in the 20th century suggested that it was a shared power between the president and the Congress.Schlesinger, p. 309 The CIA is exempt from Congressional oversight and spending rules and regulations.Schlesinger, p. 316 If Congress wished to bring the CIA under control, it could prohibit covert operations except during wartime.Schlesinger, p. 319 National emergency powers allow the president unilaterally to control any business activity or person within the country. Once a national emergency is proclaimed, it should get Congressional approval within 30 days if it is to remain in effect. A joint resolution of Congress should be able to cancel a national emergency.Schlesinger, pp. 320‚Äì321 The national emergency power should be used only when the nation is at risk of being lost. Only the Civil War, World War II, and possibly the Cuban Missile Crisis qualify as true national emergencies. The national emergencies claimed by Jefferson, Truman, and Nixon do not meet this standard.Schlesinger, pp. 323‚Äì324 Foreign policy conducted by the President only is self-defeating if the people do not support it. If the Congress does not understand the foreign policy, the people will not either.Schlesinger, p. 325 Presidential secrecy can be justified with either claims of national security or executive privilege. The claims do not rely on statues but depend on unchecked executive judgment. National security claims were developed from the classification of documents. Executive privilege claims were originally used by the president to protect personal communications from Congress.Schlesinger, p. 331 As early as 1795, the following pattern recurred. The president kept some facts secret when he faced difficult foreign policy decisions. A citizen discovered these facts and felt it was a duty to make these facts public. A member of the free press would disclose then the facts.Schlesinger, p. 333 By the 1950s, Congress was at odds with the military over secrecy. Reports on bows and arrows, shark repellent, and monkeys in outer space were classified secrets.Schlesinger, p. 342 In 1966, a secret CIA memo complained that the publication of classified secrets could be successfully defended with the \\"public had a right to know\\" argument.Schlesinger, p. 347 By 1972 some newspaper clippings were deemed to be secret.Schlesinger, p. 344 Secrecy appeals to leaders of nation that value openness and accountability. The power to withhold, leak, and lie about information seems fleeting when the information is publicly revealed. \\"If you only know what we know\\" remarks are tempting for officials.Schlesinger, p. 354 The power to withhold and leak leads to the power to lie. Examples of this were found in President Eisenhower's CIA actions, President Kennedy's Bay of Pigs and Vietnam actions, President Johnson's Vietnam operations, and President Nixon's Cambodia bombing.Schlesinger, pp. 356‚Äì357 Between 1965 and 1975, the number of US citizens who believed their government was lying had greatly increased because of the government's secrecy system.Schlesinger, pp. 358‚Äì359 Perhaps the United States would have benefited from leaks about the CIA in the 1950s, the Bay of Pigs operation, war crimes in Vietnam, and wars in Laos and Cambodia by avoiding those disasters.Schlesinger, p. 362 Congressional members often prefer to be poorly informed to avoid responsibility and accountability for foreign policies.Schlesinger, p. 373 Although many are shocked when secret foreign policy documents are revealed, the information was often previously published. Congress could be better informed if it wished.Schlesinger, pp. 374‚Äì375 The revolutionary transformation to the plebiscitary presidency is a presidency accountable only during elections or impeachment rather than daily to the Congress, the press and the public. Plebiscitary democracy is defined as a leader, once elected, having almost all power. (See Bush's Plebiscitary Presidency.) The plebiscitary president would govern by decrees such as executive orders.Schlesinger, p. 377 The Nixon administration was unique in the extent of probable criminal offenses it committed,: burglary, forgery, illegal wiretapping and electronic surveillance, perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, tampering with witnesses, giving and taking bribes, and conspiracy to involve government agencies in illegal actions. Nixon denied knowledge about the actions. Nevertheless, he was found officially responsible for them.Schlesinger, p. 379 In an effort to rein in the imperial presidency, North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin proposed for Congress to have the ability to veto executive agreements within 60 days. Executive agreements are used by presidents to make international arrangements without involving Congress. If enacted, the proposal would change the balance of power between the presidency and the Congress and affect foreign policy decisions.Schlesinger, p. 393 A balance of power can be achieved when all great decisions are shared decisions. Although shared decisions may often be wise, they are always democratic.Schlesinger, pp. 406‚Äì407 Great presidents understood that their rule required the consent of the Congress, the press, and the public.Schlesinger, p. 410 President Nixon's errors resulted in the expansion and abuse of presidential power. If future presidents govern by decree, impeachment will be necessary to rein in the presidency and support the constitution. With a constitutional presidency, any illegal or unconstitutional actions by a president's administration must be exposed and punished: \\"A constitutional Presidency, as the great Presidents had shown, could be very strong Presidency indeed. But what kept a strong President constitutional, in addition to checks and balances incorporated within his own breast, was the vigilance of the nation. Neither impeachment nor repentance would make much difference if the people themselves had come to an unconscious acceptance of the imperial Presidency. The Constitution could not hold the nation to ideals it was determined to betray.\\"Schlesinger, pp. 417‚Äì418  See also  * Arthur M.

At the time of his death he was Crossett Professor Emeritus of Humanistic Studies at Stanford University. His father, Raymond D. Jameson, professor of Western literature at the University of Peking, and mother, Rose Perel Jameson, were visiting London at the time of his birth.Biographical details for this article are drawn from the biographical memoir by Martin Ostwald (References) He spent his childhood in Beijing and with his mother in London, received his A.B. in Greek at the University of Chicago in 1942, aged seventeen, served in the U.S. Navy as a Japanese translator, 1943‚Äì46, then married Virginia Broyles. He received his Ph.D. at Chicago in 1949, with a dissertation on \\"The Offering at Meals: Its Place in Greek Sacrifice\\". A Fulbright Fellowship in 1949 supported him at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he hiked the Peloponnesos with his new wife and gained an intimate knowledge of inscriptions. After a brief stint at the University of Minnesota, he accepted a Ford Fellowship at the Institute for Social Anthropology at Oxford University. On his return to the United States, be began his long association with the University of Pennsylvania (1954‚Äì76). Though a spirit of perfectionism inhibited his production of an overarching book, in some sixty articles he explored the setting of Greek religion in its specific locality and time, thus focusing on unravelling the details of cult and ritual sacrifice; he did a great deal of work on epigraphyHe published new inscriptions from Halieis, Mases, Zarax, Epidaurus Limera, Carpathos, Hermione, Hydra, Kasos, Anthedon, and Tiryns, Ostwald notes, mostly in Hesperia, and contributed to the third edition of Inscriptiones Atticae Euclidis Anno Anteriores (David Lewis, editor, 1981). and its relations with literature and history, and he explored Greek sites, especially at the partly drowned port city of Halieis (Porto Cheli), which he began excavating in 1962, and in the Argolid, where he galvanized a broad ecological study, 1979‚Äì83, that was the first examination of the paleoecology of ancient Greece, resulting in the publication of M. H. Jameson, Tjeerd Van Andel and C. N. Runnels, A Greek Countryside: The Southern Argolid from Prehistory to the Present Day (Stanford University Press) 1994. His single most dramatic discovery was the copy of the Decree of Themistocles, mobilizing early preparations for the Battle of Salamis (470 BCE), which he recognized in a kapheneion (a Greek caf√©) in Troezen and copied in a squeeze.A squeeze is a cast of an inscription. The discovery, which adjusted the historian's view drawn from Thucydides, elicited an extensive literature, including four articles by Jameson, setting the text in its historical context. He received numerous awards and visiting fellowships, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966‚Äì67, and inspired a generation of scholars through his teaching. He died of cancer.

It was released by Allied Artists on March 18, 1960. Plot Bernice Lee (Sonya Wilde) is a young woman of mixed African and European ancestry, living in Chicago with her family, and she is mistaken for a purely white woman by a white man, who tries to hit on her repeatedly. Her brother, more obviously of mixed heritage, fights off the man. Bernice's grandmother consoles her when she confides her troubles.

The project includes vocalist and DJ Boy George and dance producer Kinky Roland, who helped George write and produce many of his most recent tracks, either as a solo singer for his albums, and as an independent DJ for his numerous mix compilations. Both George and Roland explain what is The Twin. The former, on his MySpace page, defines The Twin as his \\"alter ago, after all I am a Gemini, and I always joke that you‚Äôre never alone with a Gemini, not even when you‚Äôre on your own\\". The latter, in an interview for The Devil in Sister George Homepage, when asked \\"if The Twin is George and Kinky Roland or is the Twin: George and his alter Ego featuring the Replicant or is The Twin George and Leigh Bowery or what?\\", answers instead that \\"The Twin is Boy George's project I'm doing writing and producing for his new alter ego\\". George points to David Bowie, along with Gene Pitney, as the most important early influences for The Twin project. As regards The Twin, actually, the new character was first born, as it seems, after George played the role of the Australian performance artist and designer Leigh Bowery, in the musical Taboo, co-written by Boy George himself, who also composed both soundtrack albums for the London and Broadway shows. The singer, turned into an actor, has revealed that it was easier for him to play someone else's role instead of his own (who was also in the show among the main characters), and that he is not new to working under the guise of some pseudonym, as he already did, most notably, with the band Jesus Loves You or under the pseudonym Angela Dust as producer and composer =: not being exposed as Boy George, too famous a name to dangerously depart from the established path, allowed him much more experimentation (the same happened when leaving his former group, Culture Club, who obliged him to always stick to the same vocal style), at the same time permitting him to possibly hide under some other label, in case of commercial and critical failure (which never happened, by the way, on such a huge scale as not to come out in the open). As concerns The Twin's extreme image (Bowery was famous for creating gravity-defying dresses, as well as outrageous make-up and exaggeratedly gorgeous looks), Boy George admits that he had been almost dressing down, following his personal standards, of course, for a few years, when he suddenly found himself thrown into Leigh's extraordinary looks and make-up, one of the most famous of which consisted in latex drips over his head, a green tutu and a specially designed corset so as to make him look as he had a prosperous real breast: it was this experience that reminded him that he was ultimately a freak, pushing him to create The Twin project, where the extreme looks are matched by a hard pumping music, mostly consisting in electronica beats, strong dance rhythms and outrageous lyrics. Though The Twin never attained commercial success, even because most of the singles and the one album, Yum Yum, released so far, didn't get airplay, and were only available for a short time and only in limited editions, his personal MySpace page and YouTube offer a whole lot of possibilities to listen and watch the project in live shows, made unique by the acid house sound and the gorgeous look.

The Science of Spying opened at the Science Museum on 10 February 2007 and a duplicate exhibition opened in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis on 16 March 2007. The exhibition is scheduled to tour venues around the world for 5 years. Exhibition content The Science of Spying, designed by Jump Studios, looks at spying today and in the future. It is interactive and aimed at a family audience. The interactivity includes various individual exhibits and a 'Spy ID card' which visitors are issued with when they enter the exhibition. A storyline involving the organisations 'Spymaker' and 'Osteck' runs throughout the exhibition. Themes include the basic skills of spies, new spy gadgets and the use of new technologies by spies. The exhibition also hints at the effects of new security and surveillance technologies on the rest of society. Exhibition sections Visitors begin in the Spymaker Training Base where they find out about basic spy skills in a number of interactive exhibits. These include spotting a liar, cracking a code and breaking into a safe. The second section of the exhibition is the Spymaker Technology Centre where visitors find out how technology can enhance a spies basic skills and also provide new challenges. Visitors take a biometric face scan, search through digital databases for clues and visit the gadget van. Next visitors go on a 'mission' into Osteck's headquarters. They must tackle interactive exhibits which are not necessarily quite what they seem. Their goal is to find a secret password to help thwart the Osteck threat. Visitors tap phone lines, break into computer systems and track things on surveillance cameras. In the final section, visitors explore Osteck's Future lab with various innocent and not so innocent spying and surveillance products are on display. After foiling Osteck's plans, visitors must escape by fooling an artificial intelligence TV monitoring system. Development and opening The development team consulted with many experts during development, including former MI6 officer, Harry Ferguson, as well as scientists and engineers.

It runs through the Bemis Park neighborhood west-east from Mercer Boulevard to its end at North 29 Street; it then reemerges immediately north of Dodge Street, where it intersects with Turner Boulevard. History When the Bemis Land Company platted the Bemis Park subdivision in 1889 it donated tract to the Omaha Board of Park Commissioners. As part of the city's boulevard and parks plan designed by Horace Cleveland that same year, Mayor George Bemis was convinced to create a strolling boulevard that started at his park and meandered east towards Creighton University. The boulevard was developed to Cleveland's plans, which preserved the natural features of the area's undulating hillsides. Many homes along Lincoln Boulevard were demolished by the Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913. Striking the boulevard at about North 35 Street, it uprooted trees and obliterated houses littered the roadway, damage from which much of the area never recovered.Russell, T.

Funded by the Government of Western Australia, the channel was managed and operated by the Department of Regional Development and broadcast a range of community-based content, particularly training and educational programs, using an open- narrowcast licence. The channel was received in over 150 remote locations such as telecentres, schools and colleges. The channel was quietly shut down on 16 December 2017 following the live broadcast of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra's \\"Symphony in the City\\" concert. Programming The channel was primarily used for educational and talk-back style programs, including video conferences, corporate training videos, and health and educational focused training segments. Many of the programs were viewed in group situations, such as telecentres and TAFE colleges. Some bodies that used Westlink were; * Department of Health * Rural Health Education Foundation * Telethon Institute * Office of Shared Services * Diocesan Pastoral Formation Centre The now defunct community television channel Access 31 from Perth was once simulcast on weekends. This simulcast ended when Access 31 closed down on 6 August 2008. On 13 November 2009, community broadcaster Indigenous Community Television entered into an agreement with Westlink to allow them access to the then-Optus Aurora channel on weekends. The agreement ceased on 18 April 2013, when ICTV officially launched their own dedicated channel on the VAST service. Availability Westlink was formerly available on the Viewer Access Satellite Television service on virtual channel 602, and could be accessed by all viewers nationally. The channel was previously available on the Optus Aurora satellite service, but was migrated to VAST in April 2013. Analogue terrestrial transmissions were also broadcast in Albany and Bunbury. Approximately 25% of all free-to-view satellite users in Western Australia watched Westlink. The Goldfields-Esperance region had the most viewers, with approximately 6.1% out of a total 11.8% satellite households report viewing the service. Identity Westlink often played a loop of still scenic photographs and information slides in between scheduled programs throughout the day due to the large gaps between programming.

Life and career Born in Carshalton, Surrey, Okin has lived in Notting Hill since he was six years old. He holds a degree in Philosophy from the University of Kent at Canterbury (1968) and worked as a schoolmaster for 11 years before going full-time...when invited on tour to open for Paul McCartney & Wings. By that time, he'd reached the level of deputy-headmaster. Okin recorded his first single at Abbey Road in 1967.BASCA Directory. \\"Early bloomer Earl Okin reveals 1967 single 'Yellow Petals'\\", London Is Funny, 13 September 2012. Some of his songs were covered during the 1960s by Cilla Black, Georgie Fame and Helen Shapiro, the latter recording now popular within the world of Northern Soul. During the 1970s, Okin started to perform as a support act in large venues. Beginning with folk acts such as Ralph McTell and Fairport Convention, he progressed to open for such varied performers as Jean- Luc Ponty and Van Morrison. However, it was the 1979 tour with Paul McCartney and Wings which prompted him to pursue his musical career full-time. He also began to perform at jazz festivals. In 1981, he appeared on Parkinson and was invited by Nigel Planer to perform at the Comic Strip. This led to his second career on the \\"alternative comedy\\" circuit where he remains a headline act. However, his act continues to be primarily musical. He has never performed stand-up. Fans' favourite comedy songs of his are \\"Mango\\", \\"Bessie\\" and \\"My Room\\". In 1983, he began to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe where he performed over 500 shows. However, hating what had become of the Fringe, he ceased performing there in 2000. Okin continues to work as a songwriter and jazz singer/musician, with a particular interest in Bossa Nova. He gives concerts in Brazil from time to time, as well as touring his one-man show, a mixture of music and comedy, worldwide. He has performed in New York at Birdland, The Apollo and other jazz venues, but, not forgetting his comedy side, also at Caroline's. In addition he toured India, Singapore, and other nearby countries. He has also performed at most major venues in London, including the Royal Albert Hall\\"Late Night Jazz ‚Äì Earl Okin\\", Royal Albert Hall, 29 October 2015. and Royal Festival Hall, The Palladium and Wembley Arena.\\"Earl Okin ‚Äì Sex Symbol and Musical Genius\\" , Comedy Carnival. Okin has performed on TV in several countries, including Brazil, Australia and Germany. Apart from self- published LPs, he has had CDs issued by the Bertelsmann Music Group in Germany and Austria and Sony in the UK. He has completed two CDs, one of Jazz and Bossa Nova, Bossa Britanica, and more recently a CD of his songs in various genres called, after the recording studio, Songs From A Garden Shed and a similarly named follow-up album. He is also a part of the recent rebirth of interest in the modern take on variety shows. In 2012‚Äì13, Okin completed his autobiography, Earl's Caught, and a musical (in conjunction with the late Jackie Skarvellis), called A Harlem Story. He has also written a six-movement symphony.

Purpose  The purpose of the Archive is to document the history of women's involvement in architecture by acquiring, preserving, storing, and making available to researchers the professional papers of women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural historians and critics, urban planners, and the records of women's architectural organizations.  Collections  The IAWA collects the papers of women who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field (i.e., before the 1950s) and to fill serious gaps in the availability of primary research materials for architectural, women's, and social history research. As of October 2006 there were over of materials in the 298 collections in the IAWA, which are housed in Virginia Tech's University Libraries' Special Collections. As part of its mission to act as a clearinghouse of information about all women architects, past and present, the IAWA also collects and catalogs books, monographs and other publications written by or about women architects, designers, planners, etc. These publications are accessible through the Virginia Tech library's online catalog, Addison. The IAWA began with a collecting focus on the papers of pioneering women in architecture, individuals who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field. Today, the IAWA includes materials that document multiple generations of women in architecture, providing vital primary source materials for architectural, women's, and social history research. The collections includes material of relevant women architects as L. Jane Hastings, Anna Keichline, Yasmeen Lari, Doina Marilena CiocƒÉnea, Eleanore Pettersen, Sigrid Lorenzen Rupp, Beverly Willis, Diana Balmori, Han Schr√∂der, Mary Colter, Zelma Wilson, Liane Zimbler, Trudy Rosen, Pamela Webb, Berta Rahm, and Olive Chadeayne. The IAWA also compiles biographical information. There is information about more than 650 women representing 48 countries and 42 states/territories in the United States available in the IAWA Biographical Database. Some of the IAWA's resources, approximately 1200 images from 28 collections, have been scanned and are available through the VT ImageBase.  Board  The IAWA is overseen by a board of advisors that includes architects, city planners, industrial and interior designers, librarians, archivists, and faculty from around the world and the U.S. The head of Special Collections or her designee serves as the Archivist for the IAWA and sits on the Board of Advisors and the Executive Board. She prepares a report for presentation to the annual meeting held in the fall of each year at Virginia Tech's Newman Library in the President's Board Room.  Milka Bliznakov Research Prize  The Milka Bliznakov Research Prize was established in 2001 to honor IAWA founder and advisor emerita, Dr. Milka Bliznakov (1927-2010). The IAWA Center invites architects, scholars, professionals, students, and researchers to contribute research on women in architecture and related design fields. This research, in concert with the preservation efforts of the IAWA, will help fill the current void in historical knowledge about the achievements and work of women who shaped the built environment.

The name was a reference to the car's fiscal horsepower, a function of the surface area of the pistons. This system quickly became obsolete as an estimate of the power produced by the engine, but it continued to be relevant as a way to classify cars for tax purposes. Like other manufacturers, Standard continued to use the name to define the approximate size of their 'Ten' model long after the origins of the name had, in Britain, become inapplicable. An experimental two-cylinder \\"10\\" was made in 1906, after which Standard's next car in that category was a four-cylinder 9.5 hp built between 1914 and 1919. They returned to the market in 1934; this model was replaced in 1937 by a \\"Flying Ten\\" that lasted until the outbreak of World War II. Standard again returned to the market in 1954 with another Ten, which was supplemented in 1957 by an up-market version called the Pennant. The Ten and the Pennant were replaced by the Triumph Herald in 1961. Edwardian 10 hp cars The name was first used in 1906 on an experimental two-cylinder car. The side-valve engine had a 70 mm bore and an 82 mm stroke, giving a capacity of 631 cc. A four- cylinder car was introduced in 1914 and built until 1915. A version of this car, with increases in wheelbase and engine stroke, was offered in 1919. 10 hp (1934‚Äì1936)Flying Ten The Flying Ten was a replacement for the earlier Ten with the semi-streamlined look of the Standard Flying range. The side-valve 1267 cc long stroke (100 mm) engine had a single Zenith carburettor and could produce at 4000 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed synchromesh gearbox. The suspension was conventional at first with a solid front axle but this was upgraded to an independent set-up at the front with a transverse leaf spring in 1939. A top speed of around was attainable. Brakes were cable operated using the Bendix system. In early 1941, 150 four-doors were built for the military, after civilian production had ceased. A sportier version, the Light Flying Ten was also made. Post-war models In 1954 the Ten was introduced as a more powerful, better-appointed version of the Standard Eight, with the Eight's Standard SC engine increased in size to 948 cc and sharing a similar frame and transmission. Overdrive (from March 1957) or a temperamental semi-automatic were available as options. An estate (station wagon) version, the Companion, was launched in June 1955. It was among the first small British estate cars to have rear-passenger doors (like the saloon, and unlike its rivals such as the Ford Squire and Hillman Husky which used the two-door \\"van\\" arrangement). A small number of left-hand-drive Tens were exported to the US and sold as the Triumph TR-10. On these, the two- tone colour arrangement normally reserved for the Pennant was available (though this export model was not tailfinned). A Ten saloon tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 38.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£580 including taxes. In 1955, supported by an inscrutable handicapping r√©gime favouring small cars, a factory-prepared Standard Ten, driven by Jimmy Ray and Brian Horrocks, won the UK's RAC Rally. For the United States export market the car was badged as the Triumph 10 and in Scandinavia it was sold as the Standard Vanguard Junior. In Australia the Ten was known as the Cadet.

Career  Chantrell was born in Newington, Southwark, London. He was a pupil in the office of Sir John Soane from 1807 to 1814, and in 1819 he started a practice in Leeds. At the beginning of his career he designed a string of classical buildings. After a few years, he reinvented himself as a pioneering Gothic specialist to meet the huge demand of the times for additional church accommodation. He became one of the most accomplished specialists in this area of practice and numerous remaining buildings testify his original skills. The crowning of his career was the building of Leeds Parish Church (1837‚Äì1841), the biggest church in England since Christopher Wren's St Paul's and, on a national level, the most important church of the age. After he moved to London, Chantrell started a second career as surveyor of church constructions. He also became a respected antiquary, writer, lecturer and member of several prestigious London committees. Architectural work Surviving buildings by Chantrell include: *alterations to the Leeds Library, including galleries (1821‚Äì36) *completion of Rudding Park House (c.1824) *alterations to St Mary-the-Virgin, Hunslet (1826) *St Stephen, Kirkstall (1828‚Äì9) *Emmanuel Church, Lockwood (1828‚Äì29) *All Saints, Netherthong (1828‚Äì9) *St Peter, Morley (1829‚Äì30) *St Matthew, Holbeck (1829‚Äì32) *partial reconstruction of All Saints, Pontefract (1832‚Äì33) *St Peter, Leeds (Leeds Parish Church) (1837‚Äì41) *Christ Church, Skipton (1837‚Äì39) *Christ Church, Lothersdale (1838) *St Wilfred, Pool-in-Wharfedale (1839) *the steeple of Holy Trinity, Boar Lane, Leeds (1839) *the neo-roman tower of the St. Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges, (Belgium) (1839) *the neo-Norman bellcote of St John the Baptist, Adel (1839) *St David, Holmbridge (1839‚Äì40) *St Lucius, Farnley Tyas (1840) *Holy Trinity, Batley Carr (1841‚Äì42) *St Paul, Shadwell (1841‚Äì42) *St Mary, Honley (1843) *Holy Trinity, Leven (1843) *St Paul, Denholme Gate (1843‚Äì46, with Thomas Shaw) *All Saints, Roberttown (1844‚Äì46, with Thomas Shaw) *Holy Trinity, Cowling (1845) *St Mary the Virgin's Church, Middleton, Leeds (1846‚Äì52) *the tower of St Paul, Halifax (1847) *St Andrew, Keighley (1847‚Äì48) *St Paul, Armitage Bridge (1848) *St George's, New Mills (1829-30) Surviving buildings restored by Chantrell include: *St Catherine, Barmby Moor, East Yorkshire (1852)Yorkshire Gazette, Saturday 17 April 1852 p7 col.2: \\"The re-opening of St Catherine's Church, Barmby Moor\\" Note: restoration mistakenly attributed to J.B.

Most Umayyad \\"desert castles\\" are scattered over the semi-arid regions of north-eastern Jordan, with several more in Syria, Israel and the West Bank (Palestine). Brief description The Umayyads erected a number of characteristic palaces, known in Arabic as qu·π£ur (pl.)/qa·π£r (sing.), some in the cities, but mostly in the semi-arid regions, and some along important trading routes. The castles were built roughly between 660 and 750 under the Umayyad Caliphate, which had made Damascus, now in Syria, their new capital in 661. After the Abbasid Revolution of 750, the capital moved to the newly-built Baghdad and some of the buildings were never completed.Khouri, R.G., The Desert Castles: A Brief Guide to the Antiquities, Al Kutba, 1988. pp 4-5 Archaeologists have investigated the role of these desert castles, with the traditional view that they served as country estates or hunting lodges for the use of aristocratic families during the winter season. However, recent scholarship has suggested a much greater diversity of roles, including as agricultural estates or military forts. The complex at Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi (Syria), for example, sits within a vast agricultural estate and the buildings include structures associated with the production of olive oil.Shaw, I. and Jameson, E. (eds), A Dictionary of Archaeology, John Wiley, 2008, p. 487 The generic term \\"desert castle\\" is not ideal, since it artificially separates similar qu·π£ur according to their location. Jordan possesses at least one urban Umayyad qa·π£r: the Amman Citadel. While the majority of qu·π£ur are located in Jordan, examples can also be found in Syria, the West Bank and Israel, either in cities (Jerusalem, Ramla), in relatively green areas (al-Sinnabra, Khirbat al-Minya), or indeed in the desert (Qasr al- Hayr al-Gharbi and Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, Jabal Sais, Hisham's Palace). The more isolated \\"desert castles\\" built in arid regions, are chiefly located on the ancient trade routes connecting Damascus with Medina and Kufa or adjacent to a natural oasis.Teller, M., Jordan,Rough Guides, 2002 p. 200 Types and purpose With a few exceptions, the desert castles conform to a common template consisting of a square palace similar to Roman forts (\\"castra\\"), a bath house, water reservoir or dam, and often an agricultural enclosure. Some of the desert castles, for example Qasr Hallabat or Qasr Burqu', are rebuilt from remains of earlier Roman or Ghassanid structures; others are new constructions. The function and use of the buildings are today not entirely clear, and scholarship has suggested that they might have served a variety of defensive, agricultural, residential, recreational and commercial purposes.\\"Nomad Politics and the Residences of Abulmalik and Walid I, in Fred M. Donner (ed), The Articulation of Early Islamic State Structures, Oxon, Routledge, 2017 Given the variety observed in the archaeological record, it is unlikely that one single theory can explain the range of purposes of all the buildings. These functions include fortresses, meeting places for Bedouins (between themselves or with the Umayyad governor), (retreats for the nobles) or caravanserais. A proliferation of desert castles appeared around the same time as the number of caravans increased substantially.Jordan: Annual, Volume 36, DƒÅ ºirat al-ƒÄthƒÅr al- ªƒÄmmah, 1992, p. 317 (translated from French) Many seem to have been surrounded by natural or man-made oases and to have served as country estates or hunting lodges, given that hunting was a favoured pastime for the aristocracy.Petersen, A, Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, Routledge, 2002, p. 239; Meyers, E.M. (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 241 Their location along major routes and next to the very scarce water sources seems to indicate that they enabled the Umayyads to control the roads militarily, monitor and tax the seasonal movement of people and their livestock, and not least, impress travellers and local tribes with lavish displays of monumental architecture, baths and ponds in the middle of an arid landscape.The spatial analysis of a historical phenomenon: using GIS to demonstrate the strategic placement of the Umayyad \\"desert palaces\\".

Concordia Pharmaceuticals. http://www.donnatal.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/Donnatal-Tablets-PI-0315-v3.pdfDonnatal Elixir Package Insert. Concordia Pharmaceuticals. http://www.donnatal.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/Donnatal-Elixir-PI-0415-v1.pdf Donnatal is manufactured for Concordia Pharmaceuticals by IriSys, LLC. It is available as tablets and 5 mL elixir. Active ingredients are listed as: phenobarbital (16.2 mg), hyoscyamine sulfate (0.1037 mg), atropine sulfate (0.0194 mg), and scopolamine hydrobromide (0.0065 mg). The latter two ingredients are found in plants of the family Solanaceae, such as Belladonna. Indication Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences‚ÄìNational Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the indications as follows: \\"possibly\\" effective: For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis. May also be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. History= Clinical Research with Combinations of Belladonna Alkaloids and Phenobarbital Clinical studies have been performed on different combinations of belladonna alkaloids and phenobarbital over the last 70 years. For example, Steigmann et al. evaluated a combination of 0.25 mg belladonna alkaloids and 50 mg phenobarbital on gastrointestinal symptoms in 93 patients. The population included 33 IBS patients. Eighteen out of 33 patients reported complete relief of symptoms and 13 reported fair response with partial relief within 24 hours. Only 2 IBS patients reported no response. A small assessment of sustained release of 0.4 mg belladonna alkaloids and ~60 mg phenobarbital (1 grain) was performed in patients with functional GI disorders (i.e., gastric hyperacidity, dyspepsia, pyrosis, gas pains and epigastric distress. Overall, 23 of 25 patients reported complete or significant relief of symptoms. Hock also examined the effect of 0.25 mg belladonna alkaloids and 50 mg phenobarbital sustained release formulation in 82 clinical practice patients with various gastrointestinal disturbances including ‚Äúfunctional distress‚Äù over 27 months. Of the 82 total patients, 33 patients reported a 50-75% and 20 reported a 75-100% improvement. There were specific reports of improvements in pain and bowel habits in over half of the patients. One of the earliest randomized double-blind clinical trials of belladonna alkaloids + phenobarbital was in 1959 by Lichstein et al. The study involved 75 patients with unstable bowel (whose symptoms are typical or similar to a current diagnosis of IBS) to investigate the combination therapy of an anticholinergic with the addition of phenobarbital against placebo over 15 months. Of these patients, 20 were treated with placebo, 43 were treated with 50 mg phenobarbital in combination with 0.25 mg Belladonna alkaloids, and 12 received both therapies (patients who lacked a response were switched therapy). Of those receiving the belladonna alkaloids / phenobarbital only, 75.6% reported a mean improvement (2+ or better) in all categories. Among the placebo patients only, only 29.8% reported mean improvement in symptoms. When improvement was clinically assessed, 69% of belladonna alkaloids/phenobarbital patients were reported to improve compared to 24% of placebo patients. For the 12 patients who were switched therapies, it was found that they originally were given placebo and switched to treatment therapy. While on placebo, 11.1% of patients reported a mean improvement, whereas 55.5% reported mean improvement on treatment therapy. The authors noted that the response for patients on placebo was rather quick with immediate effects. Further, they noted that among patients with diarrhea, 100% reported an improvement while 53.2% of those with constipation reported an improvement. In several patients with constipation, fiber and laxatives also were provided. In patients where constipation was the chief complaint, the authors noted that they failed to respond. Several office-belladonna alkaloids ed case series also presented positive outcomes for almost 1,000 patients on the effect of belladonna alkaloids and phenobarbital formulations in irritable colon, other functional disorders, and gastric/duodenal. Donnatal clinical research A. H. Robins developed and began marketing Donnatal¬Æ in the 1940s. Two studies have been performed over the years specifically with the Donnatal¬Æ formulation. Steigmann and Kaminski examined the antisecretory effect of 0.1296 mg belladonna alkaloids + 16.2 mg phenobarbital (Donnatal¬Æ) in peptic ulcer patients, motility in a subgroup of patients and clinical effects in all patients (N =176). Of the IBS patients (n =66), a reported good response with complete relief was found in 53% of male patients and 58% of female patients. Fair response with partial improvement was noted in 37% of male patients and 34% of female patients. No response was reported in 10% of male and 8% of female IBS patients. There were few side effects noted with 8% reporting dry mouth. Dosages were reduced in patients who reported drowsiness (10%) as well as 1 patient who reported visual disturbance. Otherwise, the formulation was well tolerated. Donnatal also is a common component of a GI cocktail used in emergency rooms. In 1976, Donnatal was one of the 25 most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S. It has since been displaced by H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, which are more effective and lack many of the adverse effects of phenobarbital.Hardman JG, Limbird LE, Gilman, AG, Ed., Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th edition(2001) A four-week multicenter, randomized placebo- controlled trial by Turner et al. compared Donnatal¬Æ tablets (hyoscyamine sulfate - 0.1037 mg; atropine sulfate - 0.0194 mg; scopolamine hydrobromide - 0.0065 mg and phenobarbital - 16.2 mg) to belladonna alkaloids alone (hyoscyamine sulfate - 0.1037 mg; atropine sulfate - 0.0194 mg; scopolamine hydrobromide - 0.0065 mg), phenobarbital alone (16.2 mg) and placebo. The intent-to-treat population of 204 IBS patients was evaluated for pain (cramping), nighttime and daytime pain severity, bowel movement frequency, and with a clinician global evaluation of improvement in response to treatment. The response for improvement of pain was mixed for all groups after 1 day. After 1 day, patients exhibited significant improvement in day and night pain as well as clinician global evaluation when taking Donnatal¬Æ tablets and belladonna alkaloids, but the phenobarbital group also was statistically better for day and night pain, and the placebo group for day pain. Females taking Donnatal¬Æ tablets were 4 times more likely to experience weeks free of daytime pain compared to phenobarbital alone and twice as likely to experience weeks free of nighttime pain compared to belladonna alkaloids. Only the phenobarbital group demonstrated a significant change in pain type compared to belladonna alkaloids at the end of the study with an approximate 48% response rate. Patients on Donnatal¬Æ tablets, belladonna alkaloids, and placebo all had non-significant (p > 0.149) shifts to dull pain, 39.5%, 52.3%, and 40.4%, respectively compared to belladonna alkaloids eline. Males also showed a greater response for pain free-weeks on phenobarbital in comparison to Donnatal¬Æ tablets. All groups demonstrated an improvement in bowel movement frequency.  FDA status  Donnatal¬Æ is considered part of the DESI drug category and currently is listed as one of 14 drugs still under evaluation by the FDA. In response to FDA questions about Donnatal¬Æ efficacy, A. H. Robins Co. filed abbreviated new drug applications for Donnatal¬Æ tablets (ANDA 86-676), capsules (ANDA 86-677), and Elixir (ANDA 86-661). These ANDAs, with the exception of the capsule formulation, are still in force today and the FDA has not changed the review status of Donnatal¬Æ as being conditionally approved for its indication. On September 29, 2011, the FDA issued new guidance with regard to the DESI category. This effectively disallowed any new DESI formulations to enter the market. The FDA also has stated that DESI drugs do not have any therapeutic equivalent drugs listed in the ‚ÄúOrange Book‚Äù. In their description of therapeutic equivalence, the FDA specifically cites Donnatal¬Æ. Therefore, any so-called generic drugs on the market with similar formulation to DESI drugs, are considered illegal drugs as the FDA has not reviewed their composition or therapeutic equivalence. Donnatal, although containing phenobarbital, is exempt from the Controlled Substances Act due to the belladonna alkaloids present in the formulation.

A longtime member of the Brazilian national team, for whom she debuted in 1991, she played for clubs in Brazil, the United States and Japan before moving to South Korea in 2009. With the Brazilian national team, Pretinha has participated in four World Cups; in China (1991), Sweden (1995), United States (1999), and China (2007). She has also played in four Olympic Games; in Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and Beijing (2008). She won silver medals from the 2004 and 2008 Olympic tournaments. Club career As a child, Pretinha had played football with her brothers on the streets of Rio. She joined her first club Mendanha Futebol Clube at the age of 14. After being elevated to the Brazilian national team, she was signed by the female section of CR Vasco da Gama. At the time of the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, Pretinha was earning around $3,400 per month from her contract with Vasco. When the American professional Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) started in 2001, Pretinha and compatriot Roseli were assigned to Washington Freedom in the inaugural draft. Pretinha scored the only goal in the league's first ever match; a second half penalty kick at the Bay Area CyberRays. With four goals in her first five games Pretinha led the early season scoring charts, she finished the campaign with five goals having played in all 21 league games. At the end of the inaugural season Washington traded Pretinha to the CyberRays. During her first season with her new club in 2002, coach Ian Sawyers handed Pretinha a deeper midfield role. In June 2003 she scored twice at Washington Freedom to salvage a draw for the CyberRays against her old club. The team's top‚Äìgoalscorer, Pretinha missed the culmination of the CyberRays' 2003 campaign after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee during an international friendly between Brazil and the United States in July 2003. With the collapse of WUSA and the lack of structure in Brazilian women's football, Pretinha was without a club while recuperating from her injury. She played in the Athens Olympics as a free agent, then joined Japanese L. League team INAC Kobe Leonessa in 2005. International career When the Brazil women's national football team were preparing for the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, they played a training match against a Liga Desportiva de Nova Igua√ßu (LDNI) select team containing a 16‚Äìyear‚Äìold Pretinha. Brazil won easily but Pretinha excelled to the extent that she was added to the national team panel for the World Cup. The aeroplane journey to Guangdong in China was the first time that the young Pretinha had travelled outside the state of Rio. The knee injury sustained by Pretinha in July 2003 ruled her out of Brazil's squad for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup.

His first book, written in his spare time, was a psychic thriller titled For Satan's Sake (1904). From this time onward, he worked as a writer. He wrote several popular novels, including an occult fantasy, The Sorcery Club (1912) but specialised in what were claimed as true stories of ghosts and hauntings. These were immensely popular, but his flamboyant style and amazing stories suggest that he combined fact with fiction. O'Donnell wrote for numerous magazines, including Hutchinson Story Magazine, The Novel Magazine, The Idler, Weekly Tale-Teller, Hutchinson's Mystery-Story Magazine, Pearson's Magazine, LilliputFoster, p. 29. and Weird Tales (the last during 1930).

Greenberg, Barnes and Noble, 1994. As he became known as an authority on supernatural affairs, he was asked to solve alleged ghost problems. He also lectured and broadcast (radio and television) about paranormal matters in Britain and the United States. In addition to his more than 50 books, he wrote scores of articles and stories for national newspapers and magazines. He claimed \\"I have investigated, sometimes alone, and sometimes with other people and the press, many cases of reputed hauntings. I believe in ghosts but am not a spiritualist.\\" Many of O'Donnell's books possess autobiographical sections in which he reveals a desperate struggle to escape early poverty (such as the plight of the three protagonists at the beginning of 'The Sorcery Club'). These revelations, coupled with both his employment of actors such as C. Aubrey Smith to help stage hauntings, and the fact that he did not leave any notes relating to his studies after his death, suggest that he embellished or perhaps even invented many of his supposed experiences. He was never worked with the Society for Psychical Research. However, O'Donnell once spent a night at St. Nicholas Church, Brockley Combe with Everard Feilding, an investigator from the Society for Psychical Research.Underwood, Peter. (1985).

Overview US Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace used the term in relation to the Farm Act of 1933 in a radio address broadcast on May 13 of that year, and apparently used the phrase again in 1936 in relation to \\"interdependence among nations and cultures.\\" Later that year the phrase was quoted in Walter P. Taylor's essay \\"What is Ecology and What Good is it?\\" in the journal Ecology Vol. 17 (July 1936). This was the first use of the phrase in an ecological context. A copy of the Durant's Declaration of INTERdependence On April 8, 1944 American philosopher and historian Will Durant was approached by two leaders of the Jewish and Christian faiths, Meyer David and Dr. Christian Richard about starting \\"a movement, to raise moral standards.\\" He suggested instead that they start a movement against racial intolerance and outlined his ideas for a \\"Declaration of Interdependence\\". The movement for the declaration, Declaration of INTERdependence, Inc., was launched at a gala dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on March 22, 1945 attended by over 400 people including Thomas Mann and Bette Davis.Will Durant Online: The Gentle Philosopher The Declaration was read into the Congressional Record on October 1, 1945 by Ellis E. Patterson. other sources say it was in 1949 In 1969 Cliff Humphrey, founder of Ecology Action, drafted a \\"Unanimous Declaration of Interdependence\\" and published it in Whole Earth Catalogue Supplement September 1969. In 1976 two \\"Declarations of Interdependence\\" were presented to the public. One was the \\"Greenpeace Declaration of Interdependence\\" published by Greenpeace in the Greenpeace Chronicles (Winter 1976-77). This declaration was a condensation of a number of ecological manifestos Bob Hunter had written over the years. The ‚ÄúThree basic Laws of Ecology,‚Äù mentioned in the text were developed by Patrick Moore, with inspiration from the writings of Barry Commoner. Another Declaration of Interdependence was drafted by Henry Steele Commager and presented to the World Affairs Councils of Philadelphia on October 24, 1975. It was signed in a ceremonial signing on January 30, 1976 at Congress Hall, Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia by several members of Congress. It was also \\"endorsed\\" by a number of non-governmental organizations and United Nations specialized agencies.

History The site upon which Yattendon castle stood was originally occupied by a moated manor house. This house was held by Sir Richard Merbrook by the early 15th century. His daughter, Alice, married Sir John Norreys of Ockwells (d. 1 September 1466), a Knight of the Shire for Berkshire, and keeper of the wardrobe for King Henry VI. The castle was then in the ownership of the Norreys family for over 200 years. Sir John bought many neighbouring estates and received a Royal licence to crenellate the manor house on 20 January 1448 and to empark some . John and Alice's son, Sir William Norreys (1433‚Äì4 January 1507) later inherited the castle. He was among the army King Henry VII brought from Brittany in 1485 and was present at the Battle of Bosworth. The castle was probably the residence of William's eldest son Sir Edward Norreys (d. 1487) during his father's lifetime. Edward Norreys was the father of two sons: Sir John Norreys (1481‚Äì21 October 1564), who inherited the castle, but died without legitimate issue, and Sir Henry Norreys, who was beheaded in 1536 for his supposed affair with Queen Anne Boleyn. The castle then passed to Edward's grandson, Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys (1525‚Äì1601), the son of the above- mentioned Sir Henry Norreys. Henry Norreys was a lifelong friend of Queen Elizabeth and was the father of six sons, who included Sir John Norreys, a famous English soldier. The castle was largely destroyed by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War. A new manor house was built on the site in 1785. Traces of the moat can still be seen today. Royal visitors *Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon were visitors at Yattendon Castle in 1520. While there, it is said that the Queen's lady-in-waiting, Anne Boleyn, of whom the King was already enamoured, dropped her handkerchief during a dance. It was retrieved by Sir Henry Norreys. This incident, later referred to as \\"Queen Anne's Dance\\", would be used as evidence, during Anne and Norreys trials, to support rumours of their affair. *Princess Elizabeth stayed at Yattendon Castle on her way to imprisonment at Woodstock.

During the American Civil War Nightingale served as a supply ship and collier supporting Union Navy ships blockading the Confederate States of America. After the war the Navy sold Nightingale, which went on to a long career in Arctic exploration and merchant trading before foundering in the North Atlantic in 1893. History=Construction Nightingale was designed and built at the Hanscom Shipyard in Eliot, Maine in 1851 by Samuel Hanscomb, Jr., receiving final fitting out in nearby Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Tea racesPassenger trade to Australia center As a slaverSeizure About midnight on 20‚Äì21 April 1861, two boats from sloop of war pulled silently toward a darkened ship anchored near the mouth of the Congo River at Cabinda, Angola. After clambering aboard Nightingale, a suspected slaver from Boston, Massachusetts, the American sailors and marines found 961 men, women, and children chained between decks. 160 would die en route to Liberia. At the point of capture, the prize was preparing to load more slaves before getting under way for America. As a prize Saratogas skipper ‚Äî Commander Alfred Taylor ‚Äì placed a prize crew on Nightingale, commanded by the leader of the boarding party, Lieutenant James J. Guthrie. The captured clipper got under way on the 23rd for Liberia, a nation founded in 1822 by the American Colonization Society as a refuge for freed slaves. En route, a fever raged through the ship killing 160 of the passengers and one member of the crew. After arriving Monrovia on 7 May, Nightingale landed her passengers, fumigated living quarters, and sailed for home on 13 May. During the first part of the passage, fever seriously weakened the crew, at one point leaving only 7 of her 34-man crew fit for duty. Two more sailors died before the scourge began to subside, enabling the ship to reach New York on 15 June. Purchase by US Navy Nightingale was condemned by the New York prize court; purchased by the US Navy which was then expanding to blockade the Confederate coast, and commissioned on 18 August 1861, Brevet Master David B. Horne in command. As a store ship Fitted out as a collier and store ship, Nightingale got underway south laden with coal the same day, stopped at Hampton Roads on the 21st, and pushed on toward Key West, Florida the following morning. But for occasional voyages north for coal and supplies, she served on the U.S. Gulf Coast through the first years of the American Civil War. She was with Union ships , , , and in the Mississippi River near Head of Passes when the Confederate ironclad ram Manassas ‚Äî accompanied by steamers and ‚Äî attacked on 12 October. During the action she ran aground, but the Southern ships did not press their advantage. Nightingale was refloated a few days later, and she sailed to New York with prisoners of war and booty. Nightingale returned to the Gulf late in the year with a cargo of coal and supplies for the Union Blockaders. During most of 1862, she served the East Gulf Blockading Squadron operating out of Key West. Early in 1863, she became an ordnance ship at Pensacola, Florida, and continued this duty until returning to Boston, Massachusetts on 9 June 1864. Nightingale was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 20 June 1864 and sold at public auction there to D.E. Mayo on 11 February 1865. Arctic exploration Nightingale served as the flagship of the 1865‚Äì1867 Western Union Telegraph Expedition exploring British Columbia, Alaska, and Siberia toward the aim of laying telegraph cable across the Bering Strait. Loss After the arctic expedition, Nightingale remained in merchant service until she foundered in the North Atlantic Ocean on 17 April 1893.

The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1996-26; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #51, in October 1997. Plot Scrooge McDuck has bought land in India's Punjab region, and arrives on the scene together with Donald and his nephews to inspect what he has bought. He meets with the local maharaja to seek his help in enlisting a work force, but the maharaja openly admits to being thoroughly corrupt, diverting the millions of dollars in foreign aid sent to his province; he declines to help, since it's his people's abject poverty that keeps that aid flowing into his coffers. Left on their own, the Ducks begin their quest, when they accidentally discover a stone pillar, dating back to 326 BC, and tells the tale of Alexander the Great's attempt to conquer Punjab. However, the conquest failed, with Alexander's men fleeing India in utter terror. The tale also tells that Alexander was seeking Shambala, an ancient Indian city containing untold riches. When Scrooge hears of this, he sets out to find the city for himself. The maharaja overhears this and follows the Ducks in secret. The Ducks eventually find Shambala in ruins, but the city is still booby-trapped with mortal dangers. Near the main temple they find some sort of control panel with ten buttons, each based on one of the ten avatars of Vishnu. The boys stay at the control panel while Scrooge and Donald venture deeper, maintaining radio contact with the boys. All sorts of Indiana Jones-like trap situations occur when Scrooge and Donald progress on their way, with the boys saving them every time by telling them what to do and pressing the right button at the right time. Scrooge and Donald eventually find the treasure, but it's protected with one last booby-trap. The boys are about to clear this trap too, but the maharaja has caught up with them, and prevents the boys from pushing the button, causing the treasure to be flushed into a nearby river. The maharaja pushes another button, which sets off Shambala's self-destruct mechanism. The Ducks and the maharaja flee the city post-haste. When arriving back in the maharaja's village, the Ducks find that the river has carried the treasure there, but the villagers have already shared it among themselves, finally having enough money to abandon the village and start new lives elsewhere. Scrooge, taking the loss of the treasure philosophically, offers to discuss employing the villagers in his future enterprises in India, and they are happy to agree. The Maharaja is left in despair. With no treasure and now the ruler of an empty village, he has no remaining pretext to collect \\"aid\\" from unsuspecting foreign nations. As the Ducks depart, Scrooge cheerfully reminds him that he still has an unlimited supply of one legacy from his ancestors: the number zero.

Orenthal James Simpson, et al.) was a criminal case prosecuted in 2007‚Äì2008 in the U.S. state of Nevada, primarily involving the retired American football player Simpson. On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia dealer, testified that the group broke into his hotel room and stole memorabilia at gunpoint. Three days later, on September 16, 2007, Simpson was arrested and held without bail. He admitted taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the room. Simpson also denied the allegation that he or the people with him carried weapons. On October 3, 2008‚Äîexactly 13 years after he was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman‚ÄîSimpson was found guilty of all 12 charges. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in nine years (in October 2017). On July 20, 2017, Simpson was granted parole, and was freed three months later.  Robbery  Palace Station, Las Vegas, where the robbery took place Alfred Beardsley, a memorabilia dealer, contacted Tom Riccio, another memorabilia dealer, regarding a trove of Simpson items Beardsley had in Las Vegas. Riccio then informed Simpson of the items. Claiming that the memorabilia were stolen from him, Simpson, along with Riccio, devised a plan to confront the dealers and get them back. Simpson, who was already planning on going to Las Vegas for a wedding, recruited some wedding guests for the operation. The robbery was planned at Palms Casino Resort. Bruce Fromong, another memorabilia dealer and a friend of Simpson's, met with Beardsley and Riccio in room 1203 at the Palace Station, a room Riccio had rented. Beardsley had contacted Fromong about a client hoping to buy a large amount of Simpson memorabilia; Fromong was unaware the client was Simpson.Herzog, Kenny. Bruce Fromong, the Man Was Convicted Of Robbing at Gunpoint, on That Crazy Night In Vegas. Vulture.com. 18 June 2016. Retrieved 29 June 2016. Riccio had Beardsley and Fromong move the items into the room and spread the memorabilia on the bed to create a display. After a pre-wedding dinner, Simpson and five accomplices drove to the Palace Station, where they met Riccio in the lobby.

Simpson's attorneys Yale Galanter was an attorney who had represented Simpson in Florida prior to this incident. According to Simpson, Galanter encouraged Simpson to retrieve his personal items. Galanter was with Simpson in Las Vegas prior to the robbery. The former star athlete said Galanter told him during a dinner discussion in Las Vegas, \\"you have the right to get your stuff\\", but cautioned he could not trespass on private property. Simpson said he told Galanter that if the suit he wore during his sensational 1990s murder trial was included among the memorabilia, he planned to burn it, and Galanter responded: \\"You're not going to burn it, you're going to bring it to me.\\" In his testimony, Simpson stated that he gave the property stolen in Las Vegas to Galanter. Simpson testified that he paid Galanter $125,000 to make a video montage for the appeal, but no video montage was ever made. Simpson's attempt to secure a new trial centered around his claim that Galanter was incompetent and had a conflict of interest but this argument was rejected by the trial court and the state Supreme Court. Gabriel L. Grasso, Galanter's former friend and co-counsel, said the lawyer complained during the case that he did not have money to hire investigators or an expert to analyze a critical audio recording from the night of the heist.  Investigation and trial  Investigators initially named Simpson a suspect, but questioned him the next day and released him soon after. On September 15, one of the accomplices, Walter Alexander, was arrested and charged with two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of burglary with a deadly weapon. Alexander was on his way to McCarran International Airport when he was approached by the police. Earlier in the day, two guns were recovered when the police executed a warrant at one of the men's homes. On September 16, Simpson was arrested by Clark County, Nevada, authorities. The celebrity gossip website TMZ.com published an audio recording of the incident which indicated Simpson and others shouted at the occupants of the room and demanded the return of various items. On the audiotape, recorded by Thomas Riccio, Simpson is heard saying: \\"Don't let nobody out of this room. ... Motherfucker, you think you can steal my shit and sell it?\\"CNN.com, \\"Simpson could be charged 'in next few days'\\", September 17, 2007. An FBI expert witness claimed that the tapes had \\"over-recordings\\" and \\"might\\" have been altered. Riccio reportedly said he tipped off Simpson to go to the hotel to look for his goods, and he reportedly said he deliberately planted the recording device to prove to Simpson that Beardsley and Fromong were fencing his stuff. Riccio considers Simpson a friend, and brought Simpson to the room and escorted him and the memorabilia out. On the day after the incident, in a 20-minute interview with the L.A. Times, Simpson brushed off the allegations saying, \\"I'm Simpson. How am I going to think that I'm going to rob somebody and get away with it? Besides, I thought what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas... You've got to understand, this ain't somebody going to steal somebody's drugs or something like that. This is somebody going to get his private [belongings] back. That's it. That's not robbery.\\" In an interview, Walter Alexander said he thought the whole incident was a setup to get Simpson. He does not \\"understand what the big deal is\\", or why Riccio would set this whole operation up, tape it and then sell the tape to the media. Alexander's ex-wife gave an interview to the New York Times in which she said many people carry tape recorders with them around Simpson to try and catch him slipping so they can profit from it. During police questioning, Alexander said Simpson asked for guns to be carried to look tough but that the guns would not be used. He also added that McClinton impersonated a police officer and acted too rough to the surprise of the others, including Simpson. He claims Simpson repeatedly told McClinton to \\"calm down, calm down.\\" Simpson appeared in court on September 19, 2007. Represented by attorneys from Florida and Nevada, Simpson was granted a bail of $125,000. Presiding Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, Jr., stated that Simpson was not allowed to have any contact with any of the co-defendants, and must surrender his passport. Simpson did not enter a plea. Both Clarence Stewart and Simpson were charged with: * Count 1: Conspiracy to commit a crime * Count 2: Conspiracy to commit kidnapping * Count 3: Conspiracy to commit robbery * Count 4: Burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon * Count 5: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong) * Count 6: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley) * Count 7: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong) * Count 8: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley) * Count 9: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong) * Count 10: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley) * Count 11: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong as an alternative to count 5) * Count 12: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley as an alternative to count 6) Simpson's order to not allow anybody to leave the room was the reason for the kidnapping charges. Simpson found guilty of all charges in Nevada. Associated Press. 4 October 2008. Retrieved 26 June 2016. After posting bail on September 20, Simpson returned to his home in Miami. Later on, Simpson breached bail conditions by having contact with another defendant. Simpson was arrested in Miami, extradited to Nevada, and faced another hearing. On January 16, 2008, a new hearing for bail was set. At the hearing, Simpson was given bail. However, his bail was raised to $250,000. He returned home to Miami the next day. The trial began on September 8, 2008, in the court of Nevada District Court Judge Jackie Glass, before an all-white jury,All-white jury seated in OJ Simpson's Las Vegas trial - NY Daily News, September 11, 2008 in stark contrast to Simpson's earlier murder trial. On October 3, 2008, Simpson was found guilty of all charges and was immediately remanded to the Clark County Detention Center pending sentencing. On October 10, 2008, Simpson's attorneys, Yale Galanter and Gabriel Grasso, PC, moved for new trial (trial de novo) on grounds of judicial errors (two jurors of the same race as Simpson were dismissed) and insufficient evidence. Clarence \\"\\" Stewart's attorney, E. Brent Bryson, also petitioned for new trial, alleging Stewart should have been tried separately, and cited perceived misconduct by the jury foreman. Galanter and Stewart later appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court after Judge Glass denied their motions, and the defendants were found guilty. In October 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Simpson's convictions, while Stewart's appeal was accepted. Stewart was released in January 2011 after entering an Alford plea and being sentenced to 9 months house arrest and 3 years probation. Galanter motioned for a rehearing of the Simpson appeal in November 2010, which was denied by the Nevada Supreme Court in February 2011. Simpson was sentenced on 5 December 2008. The judge ordered eight of the ten counts to run concurrently, with a maximum sentence of 33 years (until 2041) with parole possible after nine years in 2017 when Simpson became eligible at age 70. The judge rejected Simpson's plea to remain free on bail while he appealed his convictions.

FBI audio examiner Kenneth Marr testified that he was not able to determine whether or not the files were altered.

Simpson alleged his counsel Yale Galanter did not tell him about alleged plea-bargain offers that would have resulted in substantially shorter sentences. Grasso testified that it was Galanter's decision not to have Simpson testify. On May 17, 2013, Yale Galanter testified. He stated that Simpson had confided to him that guns were brought to the hotel room, and admitted to Galanter that he messed up in doing that. Galanter made this statement after he was reminded that Simpson had waived attorney-client privilege, enabling his former attorney to testify. Galanter was photographed by the Associated Press laughing about Simpson's arguments on the witness stand. Galanter confirmed that the night before the robbery he was dining at a restaurant with Simpson and a group of people. Galanter testified that Simpson casually mentioned his intent to retrieve \\"his stuff,\\" in what Simpson called a \\"sting.\\" Galanter testified that he asked Simpson, \\"What are you doing?\\" and advised against it, telling Simpson \\"to call the police.\\" Galanter testified: \\"Mr. Simpson never told me he was going to go to the Palace (Station) hotel with a bunch of thugs, kidnap people and take property by force. To insinuate I, as a lawyer and officer of the court, would have blessed it is insane.\\" Galanter did accept that Simpson's conviction was Galanter's responsibility. In regard to plea offers, Galanter testified his practice is to always communicate plea offers to the client. He denied that Simpson did not know about plea offers. Galanter testified that during the trial he informed Simpson that prosecutors were offering a plea with 2‚Äì5 years of prison time. Simpson instructed Galanter to go back to the DA with a counter-offer of one year, which the DA immediately refused; the trial proceeded with no further offers or counters.

He was active in Bakumatsu and early Meiji period Japan. Biography Waters was born in Birr, County Offaly, in Ireland in 1842, as the eldest son of the local surgeon. In 1864, while in his early 20s, he appears to have become involved in the building of the Royal Mint in Hong Kong. Through his uncle, Albert Robinson, he came into contact with representatives of Thomas Blake Glover, a noted British merchant resident in Nagasaki. Glover arranged for Waters to be employed by Satsuma Domain to construct steam-powered sugar mills on the island of Amami-Oshima, and he then moved to Kagoshima to design western-style buildings in 1867. After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Waters was hired by the new Meiji government and commissioned to build the new Imperial Japanese Mint in Osaka, which was commenced in 1868 and completed in 1870. After successfully completing this commission, he was invited to Tokyo and officially accepted as foreign advisor by the government, where his title was \\"Surveyor-General\\". He helped design a branch of the Japanese Mint in the Ginza area of Tokyo, designed and built the headquarters building for the Imperial Japanese Army and a bridge in the Tokyo Imperial Palace grounds, Tokyo. However, his largest commission came after a devastating by fire in 1872 destroyed the Ginza district. Tom Waters, his brother Albert Waters, and English colleague A N Shillingford, supervised the rebuilding of the Ginza area with a broad central thoroughfare, lined with a series of one- and two-story Georgian brick buildings there.Ginza Travel Guide The district was henceforth known as Bricktown (Rengagai), and came to be regarded as a symbol of modernity and westernization in Japan.The American School in Japan: Tokyo 1902 However, Waters soon faced increasing competition from foreign architects and newly trained Japanese architects and engineers. He ended ties with Japan around 1878. He worked briefly in Shanghai, China before working as a mining engineer in the South Island of New Zealand. He then joined his brothers, Ernest and Albert in the United States where they became involved in silver and gold mining in Colorado. He died on 5 February 1898 at the age of 55, and his grave is located at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. Further reading Dr Meg Vivers has published articles and a book about Thomas Waters.

It has a Designated Collection of national importance. Origins The Shipley Art Gallery opened to the public in 1917. This was made possible by a bequest from wealthy local solicitor and art collector, Joseph Ainsley Davidson Shipley (1822‚Äì1909). Shipley was a rather enigmatic person about whom little is known. He was born in Gateshead, near High Street. He was a solicitor in the Newcastle firm of Hoyle, Shipley and Hoyle. From 1884 until his death, he leased Saltwell Park House, now known as Saltwell Towers. Shipley's main passion was art and collecting paintings. He bought his first painting when he was sixteen and by the time he died he had amassed a collection of some 2,500 paintings. On his death, Shipley left ¬£30,000 and all his pictures to the City of Newcastle, which was to build a new gallery to house the collection. This was to be known as \\"The Shipley Bequest\\". His will specifically excluded the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle from benefiting from the bequest, and this clause became the subject of much public discussion, and eventually led to Newcastle's rejection of the bequest. It was only following this that Gateshead Municipal Council was offered the collection. As it was impossible to house all of the paintings, 359 of the pictures recommended by the executors of Shipley's will were selected. A further group was then added by the Gateshead Committee, bringing the total to 504. In 1914, after the sale of the remaining paintings, work began on the new art gallery. The building, which was designed by Arthur Stockwell, M.S.A. of Newcastle, opened on 29 November 1917. The stone entrance portico is distyle in antis ‚Äì four Corinthian-style stone columns flanked by solid pilasters. These are surmounted by two sculptured figures, one representing the Arts and the other Industry and Learning, by W. Birnie Rhind, RSA. of Edinburgh. Pevsner described the art gallery as a \\"bold arrangement of a brick central block and lower wings containing galleries\\". The building was designated as Grade II listed in 1982. Present gallery The original 504 paintings represented all the main European schools from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Since 1917, the collection has been added to, and now comprises some 10,000 items. William C. Irving's painting, \\"Blaydon Races\\" captures the spirit of the traditional Blaydon Races, and takes pride of place at the gallery. The gallery also holds a strong collection of 16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish paintings, as well as 19th century British works, watercolours, prints, drawings and sculpture. Since 1977 the gallery has become established as a national centre for contemporary craftwork. It has built up one of the best collections outside London, which includes ceramics, wood, metal, glass, textiles and furniture. In 2008, the Shipley opened its Designs for Life gallery which showcases the gallery's collections of contemporary craft and design. The Gallery also hosts a varied programme of temporary exhibitions and has a strong partnership with the V&A; Museum in London. The Shipley Art Gallery is managed by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums on behalf of Gateshead Council.

Traditionally this is achieved by carbonising wood in a charcoal pile or kiln. As an occupation it has almost died out in developed countries. Charcoal burning is one of the oldest human crafts. The knowledge gained from this industry still contributes to the solution of energy problems today. Due to its historical and cultural importance, charcoal burning and tar distilling were incorporated in December 2014 into the register of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Germany by the Kultusministerkonferenz.  History and technique =Medieval charcoal burners Since the Iron Age, high temperatures have had to be produced for iron smelting, for glassmaking and for the working of precious metals. Charcoal has been used to do this for centuries and, in order to produce it, entire forests were felled. With the increasing use of stone coal from the 18th century, the charcoal burning industry declined. Charcoal burning in modern iron retorts, Otryt, Poland Even in ancient times, charcoal was manufactured in kilns. Logs were arranged in a conical heap (a charcoal kiln or pile) around posts, a fire shaft was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the fire shaft and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350 ¬∞C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the kiln, the charcoal burner could assess the state of the carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization. In earlier times, charcoal burners led an austere, lonely life.Tim Sandles, \\"Charcoal Burners\\", Legendary Dartmoor, March 20, 2016. Retrieved June 29, 2018. They had to live near the kiln, usually in a charcoal burner's hut (K√∂hlerh√ºtte or K√∂te in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). During the Middle Ages, charcoal burners were ostracised. Their profession was considered dishonourable and they were frequently accused of evil practices. Even today there is a certain denigration of this former occupation. In the German language to have a charcoal burner's faith (K√∂hlerglauben) is to have blind faith in something. That aside, the continuing requirement to keep the kiln at the right temperature in all weathers meant that the job must have been arduous, lonely and, at times, dangerous. Modern Charcoal burning is still carried out commercially in parts of the world.Smokey Mountain in Manila , retrieved 15 February 2012. It is rare in Europe, but still practised in Romania,The last charcoal burners in Romania, GEO Report dated 2 March 2013 Poland, the UK,The Dorset Charcoal Company dated 12 April 2020 Slovenia, and Switzerland.Jonathan Lynn, \\"Swiss farmers keep tradition of charcoal-burning\\", Reuters, Sept. 2, 2008.

Flynt was a strength coach by trade and was a strength coach at Nebraska, Oregon, and Texas A&M.; He is the inventor of the Powerbase Fitness exercise equipment. Clients for the Powerbase system include school systems and the military. Part of his life story includes being the son of a Battle of the Bulge survivor and having invented and marketed fitness equipment. Early career In 1965, he was on the first state championship team at Odessa Permian, the high school featured in Friday Night Lights. Flynt, as an All-District player for Permian High School, was offered several full football scholarships at places like the University of Houston and Sul Ross State University. However, he initially attended Ranger Junior College for one semester instead. He later attended Sul Ross State in 1969, which was a member of the NAIA. The Sul Ross State Lobos were in the Lone Star Conference with East Texas State, a school that featured future NFL stars Harvey Martin and Dwight White. Another rival at the time was Texas A&I;, which was starting a two-year run as national champions. The Lone Star Conference was one of the premier conferences in the nation, at that time, because the Lone Star Conference was integrated and had many great black athletes playing in the conference. The athletic highlight of Flynt's two years at Sul Ross was participating in a victory against A&I;, which went on to win a National Title, with its only loss in '69 being to Sul Ross. Flynt had been a team captain, All-Conference Linebacker and the leading tackler on the Sul Ross team as a junior. Starting his senior year in 1971, Flynt was involved in a fist fight with a freshman on the football team that was breaking team rules. School officials decided that due to his history with fights on campus, he would be expelled. He only needed 6 hours to graduate and he earned his degree from Sul Ross State by taking his remaining classes elsewhere. At a reunion of former Sul Ross students from the 1960s and '70s, and while speaking to a former college roommate, Stan Williamson, Flynt mentioned how losing his senior year at Sul Ross had become the greatest regret in his life. Stan suggested he make a comeback. He told Flynt, \\"if that is the greatest regret in your life, if you think you can take the hits and run with those guys, then you need to check it out, it's a D-3 school now and a whole new set of rules. Mike accepted the challenge and ended up walking on at Sul Ross, as a linebacker, making the team and becoming the oldest college linebacker in NCAA history. Division III football His motivation to return to football occurred while he was swapping stories with some old football buddies. He brought up the biggest regret of his life: Getting kicked off the college team before his senior year. Flynt found out he was eligible to return to Sul Ross State. Flynt, who was living in Franklin, Tennessee, at the time, told his wife about the idea. They sold their home in Franklin and moved, temporarily to Alpine, Texas (Home of Sul Ross State University) a town of about 6,000 residents near the Big Bend National Park, a three-hour drive from the nearest major airport. Mike is a grandfather and is active as a motivational/inspirational speaker at various organizations throughout the nation. When Flynt went back to play, his youngest child was a freshman at the University of Tennessee. Two of his children were older than any of his teammates. Flynt was eight years older than his own coach, Steve Wright. He played his last collegiate game for the Sul Ross State Lobos in 1970. In 1971, he was thrown out of the university.Sports Illustrated, September 24, 2007, p. 34 One of his original college coaches was Jerry Larned, and he has counselled him at the start of his comeback. Despite the fact that he is over 35 years older than his teammates, Flynt, a career strength and conditioning coach, told the publication Sports Illustrated that he can still do some things in the weight room that the other players cannot. Flynt says he can still do 25 consecutive pull-ups and he won a bench press competition with a 45 lb plate, at the beginning of the 2007 season. He missed the first two games of the 2007 season with a pinched nerve which turned out to be 2 bulging discs in his neck. (Stated in a testimony session in Panama City, FL.) In a game on September 15 versus rival Mary Hardin-Baylor, the Lobos were down by a score of 55-14. Flynt's fan club, known as the \\"Sul Ross Baby Boomers\\", along with Mary Hardin-Baylor's \\"Couch Cru\\" student section chanted for number 49 to come into the game. Once he plays, he will become the oldest college linebacker in NCAA history. Neither the NCAA or NAIA keeps age as a statistic, but research in 2007 had not turned up anyone older than his mid-40s playing linebacker in NCAA football.

A soundbite such as Oppapƒ´, or something similarly random, is commonly used by Japanese comedians as an easy to remember and easy to repeat hook that can help popularise them and their comedy.

In 1903, he began to study law in Munich, but soon changed to Oriental languages. After receiving his doctorate at Berlin in 1909 with a dissertation on the Arab grammarian Ibn Jinni, he moved to Istanbul to work in the libraries there. During World War I, he served in the German Army as censor for Arabic prisoner of war correspondence. After the war, he moved to Breslau and received his Habilitation and venia legendi (the right to hold lectures at a German university) from the University of Breslau. In 1925 he began teaching as professor (without full chair) at Breslau, but in 1928 he took a long-term leave and returned to Turkey. He left Breslau \\"for reasons that can no longer be determined but he evidently did so with resentment\\" (Berthold Spuler). Rescher also relinquished his membership in the Deutsche Morgenl√§ndische Gesellschaft (DMG), the society of Oriental scholars in Germany. In due course he acculturated to the Turkish locale, changing the spelling of his name, and converting to Islam. For many years he was a staff member of the Islamic Institute of the University of Istanbul. There he spent the rest of his life, producing numerous scholarly studies and translating many texts into German, as well as writing Oriental-style poetry in German himself. Apart from keeping in close contact with his Turkish colleagues and with Helmut Ritter, who was between 1926 and 1949 a semi-official representative of the DMG in Istanbul, Rescher lived a solitary life in his Istanbul house overlooking the Bosphorus, accompanied by many cats. In 1933, the German Nazi government revoked his venia legendi, and in 1937, he became a Turkish citizen. Most of his work appeared in small editions in Turkey, but gradually made its way into the mainstream of European Oriental scholarship. He devoted much effort over many years to build up a large collection of Arabic and Persian manuscripts. These now form the Rescher Manuscript Collection of the Berlin Staatsbibilothek, as well as a collection at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. His extensive library of printed books in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, as well as the secondary literature in European languages, has been bought by the Ruhr Universit√§t in Bochum (Germany) and forms the nucleus of the library of its Seminar f√ºr Orientalistik und Islamwissenschaften. Oskar Rescher is related to Nicholas Rescher, a well-known German-American philosopher who is also a scholar of Arabic, and who has made various contributions to the study of Arabic logics. Oskar Rescher's publications include some valuable indices for works of classical Arabic literature like al-Bukhari's hadith-collection and Yaqut's Mu'jam al-buldan. He produced an Abriss der arabischen Literaturgeschichte, 2 vols. (Konstantinopel-Pera: Abajoli, 1925 and 1933, Reprint Osnabr√ºck: Biblio-Verlag, 1983), as well as an extensive series of Beitr√§ge zur arabischen Poesie, 8 vols.

He was one of the many slaves from British South Carolina that escaped to Spanish Florida looking for freedom since 1687, or at least more bearable slavery conditions. Francisco served as a soldier and as a captain in the black militia of Florida, a military body created by black citizens of Spanish Florida and former Carolina slaves to help protect Spanish Florida against British military advancements. He was the leader of the garrison established in 1738 at Fort Mose, the first all-black community in North America, and was recognized by the Spanish crown for his loyalty and courage through the difficult sieges that followed.Landers, Jane, Black Society in Spanish Florida. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999. Francisco is recognized in Spain as one of the best soldiers that served the crown in America, and the founder of San Agust√≠n de la Nueva Florida (Cuba). Fort Mose has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, as it was the first legal free black community in what is now the United States. Early life Men√©ndez was born in the Gambia region along the Gambia River in Africa; he was of Mandinga descent. He was captured and sold by slave traders, and probably was shipped to Carolina sometime between 1709 and 1711, during a period of significantly increased importation of African slaves. Like many other black slaves, Men√©ndez escaped his bondage and sought refuge in Spanish Florida. He was the epitome of what historian Ira Berlin called the Atlantic creoles, peoples shipped from the slave ports in Africa who acquired \\"linguistic dexterity, cultural plasticity, and social agility\\". Since 1693, the official Spanish policy was that any and all slaves that touched Spanish soil and asked for refuge would be made free. They were expected to learn the Catholic faith and accept baptism. They were required as well to be ready to protect the territory as part of the militia for four years.Riordan, Patrick: \\"Finding Freedom in Florida: Native Peoples, African Americans, and Colonists, 1670-1816\\", Florida Historical Quarterly 75(1), 1996, pp. 25-44. In Florida he aided in the defense of St. Augustine in 1727, earning his freedom and establishing his reputation for leadership. He was recognized as a subject of the King of Spain and baptized in the Catholic Church as Francisco Men√©ndez.Berlin, Ira. Many Thousands Gone, Belknap Press, 1998, p. 74 Despite his conversion and military service, Men√©ndez and many of his fellow militia were still slaves. When Manuel de Montiano became governor in 1737, Men√©ndez petitioned for his freedom. On March 15, 1738, he was granted unconditional freedom. Years later, he was appointed head of the black militia based at Fort Mose, built in 1738, and the overall leader of its resident community. From this base, Men√©ndez led several raids against the colony of South Carolina, and inspired further rebellion among slaves there. In 1740, the British army marched into Florida and overran Fort Mos√© during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Days later Spanish and Fort Mose militia members defeated the British and prevented further invasion. Fort Mose was destroyed during this bloody battle. Men√©ndez took to the seas on a Spanish ship to raid English vessels. In 1741 Men√©ndez was captured by corsairs aboard the English vessel Revenge. When they discovered that Men√©ndez had been captain of the free black militia at Fort Mose, they tied him to one of the ship's guns, gave him two hundred lashes and salted his wounds. The English captain then sold him into slavery in the Bahamas. Whether he escaped or was ransomed by the Spanish is not known, but by 1759 he was once more the leader of the free black community at Mose. Evacuation to Cuba They continued at Fort Mose until the British took control of East Florida in 1763, following their defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. In that settlement, the British traded territory with Spain, taking over East Florida. Together with most of the Spanish colonists from St. Augustine and the Fort Mose community, Men√©ndez was evacuated by the Spanish crown to Cuba. There he established a similar community called San Agust√≠n de la Nueva Florida\\"\\" (St. Augustine of the New Florida). Legacy and honors The site of Fort Mose, where Men√©ndez led the militia, is now designated by the United States as a National Historic Landmark. The original site was rediscovered in an archeological dig in the 1990s, and has been protected as a park. The Fort Mose Historic State Park is owned by the Florida Park Service. It is widely known as the first legally sanctioned free community of freedmen and a destination for African-American refugees from slavery. It served as a precursor to the Underground Railroad that developed during the antebellum years.

It is situated west of Northfield at 4695 Millersburg Blvd. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior in 1995 because of its historical significance and its ties to the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery by the James-Younger Gang on September 7, 1876. Early Swedish Settlers Christdala congregation was formed in 1877 by Swedish immigrants who settled in Rice County. The church was built in Late Gothic Revival style during 1878. Worship services were discontinued in 1966. Dating from 1994, several members of the former Christdala congregation formed the Christdala Church Preservation and Cemetery. Christdala Church and Cemetery are both well preserved. Today the church serves as a memorial to the contributions made by a small group of Swedish-American settlers in Rice County in the latter half of the 19th century. They prospered, built a simple church and made lasting contributions to their community. Chronology 1856 ‚Äì George Miller homesteaded and platted a village recorded as \\"Millersburg.\\" Miller erected a mill and a hotel and a partner started a general store, attracting \\"Yankee\\" settlers from the east. Later a post office and blacksmith shop were established. 1870 ‚Äì First Swedish immigrants settled in the Millersburg area from the Red Wing-Vasa area and initially held services in their homes. 1871 ‚Äì Lester post office established by John W. Thompson one mile (1.6 km) west of Christdala. Thompson's business card read: Notary Public, Justice of the Peace, Real Estate Developer, Minnesota State Legislature, Postmaster.\\" More than half a dozen Swedish families now lived in the vicinity. 1873 ‚Äì Economic depression in the U.S. 1876 ‚Äì Nicolaus Gustafson, a recent immigrant from Sweden, was killed in Northfield, Minnesota on September 7, 1876 during the notorious James-Younger Gang's robbery of the Northfield bank on September 7. Gustafson was buried in the Northfield Cemetery because the Millersburg Swedish community had no church or cemetery. The Millersburg Swedes immediately started planning for the construction of their own church and cemetery.

A Masterfile record is created and ME number assigned when entering medical school or through the ECFMG. For medical students, there are two primary methods to create the initial record - the Student Outreach Program and the annual freshman matriculation file received from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The Physician Masterfile spans from undergraduate medical education through practice and comprise databases of * 125 LCME-accredited medical schools * 7,900 ACGME- accredited graduate medical education programs * 1,600 teaching institutions; 820,000 physicians; and 19,000 medical group practices. Physician records are never removed from the AMA Physician Masterfile, even in the case of a physician's death. Student outreach: steps for record creation The Student Outreach Program creates affiliate student records in a database specifically designed to support AMA membership recruitment activities. The record includes: # student membership application is received # information is entered into the Student Outreach Database using the student supplied SSN as the initial unique identifier # SOD data loaded into the AMA Masterfile with status of \\"unverified\\" ## student affiliate membership status is assigned ## payment is processed ## record with corresponding ME number is created. # primary source notification of enrollment in an LCME-accredited (Liaison Committee on Medical Education) program received through the AAMC freshman matriculation file. # student affiliate records stored in the Masterfile are matched to AAMC records. # matched record now contains both an ME number and SSN and has been verified by the primary source. # affiliate status is removed and a permanent unique record on the Masterfile is established. \\"Unverified\\" affiliate student records are considered and use of the data is limited to providing membership benefits and membership payment processing. The AMA Masterfile has been in use since 1906. Uses The data are shared with other organizations and agencies who credential physicians and are used to identify individuals who attempt to fraudulently assume the credentials of deceased physicians. The AMA also charges data mining companies such as IQVIA a fee for access to the Physician Masterfile, which they then use to identify physicians within prescription data purchased from pharmacies. This enriched, prescriber- identified prescription data is then sold to pharmaceutical companies that use it to monitor marketing effectiveness. United States medical students and physicians An AMA Physician Masterfile record is established when individuals enter medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), or in the case of international medical graduates (IMG), upon entry into ACGME-accredited programs. When creating a record, the database is first checked to see if the person has a record using legal last name, legal first name, date of birth, school code, and state of residence to identify unique student entities when creating Masterfile records. Each AMA Physician Masterfile record includes * physician's name * medical school * year of graduation * gender * birthplace * birthdate * Medical Education (ME) Number (unique identifying id) * Additional data added from primary data sources or from surveying the physicians directly as the physicians' training and career develop ** residency training ** state licensure ** board certification ** geographical location ** address ** type of practice ** present employment, ** practice specialty  International medical graduates  Data on international medical graduates (IMGs) are included in the AMA Physician Masterfile when IMGs enter residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The AMA Physician Masterfile also includes data on IMGs who are licensed to practice medicine but who have not entered ACGME-accredited programs and on physicians licensed to practice medicine in the United States but who are temporarily located abroad. ME Number The ME Number is created after a student record is created. Social Security number was used for ME Number and is widely used by internal AMA processing systems. The ME number is assigned by the AMA Finance Department. Controversy In July 2007, it was publicized that the AMA discloses Masterfile Physician Data to pharmaceutical companies. In 2000, the AMA earned $20 million from the sale of data from the MasterFile. Currently, the AMA brings in over $40 million a year licensing the database.

The population was 13,267 as of the Canada 2011 Census within a land surface area of about 70 square kilometres, with the majority of the territory being used for agricultural activities. . History The origins of Lavaltrie go back to the 17th century. Jean Talon, the intendant of New France, gave parcels of land (known as manors) to various lords. The land where Lavaltrie is now situated was given to a lieutenant, Sieur la Valtrie, by Talon in 1672. In the 18th century, land occupants built a new roadway along the Saint Lawrence River linking Montreal and Quebec City, named the Chemin Du Roy and now known as Quebec Route 138. For many decades, Lavaltrie was located in the centre of a large series of manors owned by lords intended to develop the agricultural sector. Mostly a rural area until the second half of the 20th century, Lavaltrie has developed steadily due to the growing suburbs of Montreal. Transportation Lavaltrie's location near Autoroute 40 and Route 138 gives easy access to Montreal, Laval and the northern crown area of the Greater Montreal area. A-40 also gives Lavaltrie direct links to Trois-Rivi√®res and Quebec City to the east and Ottawa to the west. Autoroute 31 and Route 131 which ends at the junction of the A-40 in Lavaltrie gives the area easy access to more remote and rural regions of the Lanaudi√®re region. However, even though located beside the Saint Lawrence River on its north, the city does not have a direct access to the south with the closest links being Autoroute 25 via the Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Tunnel in Montreal to the west or the Berthierville-Sorel ferry to the east (Autoroute 55 in Trois-Rivi√®res via the Laviolette Bridge being the closest roadway link to its east).

In 1998 the dam was classified as a high-hazard dam by state officials.

In 2005 during heavy storms, there was great concern for its stability as the area directly below the dam severely flooded. In July 2008, despite the evident and urgent need for repair or replacement the Massachusetts Governor denied funding for the dam's repair. Many local residents, particularly in Leverett and Montague, were frustrated with the Governor's decision. However, with so many dams in Massachusetts in need of repair, others question if the state should be spending millions to rehab old dams. Despite the gubernatorial veto, funding was eventually obtained and construction began at the dam in the fall of 2008. The repairs were completed in May 2009.

Albertina Rasch on the cover of Player magazine, January 17, 1913. Early life Rasch was born in 1891 (although she would later shave five years off her age), in Vienna (in what was then Austria-Hungary), to a family of Polish Jewish descent. She grew up studying in an imperial dancing school, the Vienna State Opera House, and \\"worked her way up to the position of ballerina through that institution.\\" Career Rasch began performing before the age of fourteen. During the American ‚Äúdance craze‚Äù of the 1910s, she left Vienna for the United States, appearing in shows at the New York Hippodrome, also known as ‚Äúthe National Amusement Institution of America‚Äù and the Winter Garden. She also ‚Äúappeared with opera companies, including the metropolitan, Los Angeles, and Chicago operas‚Äù before becoming premi√®re danseuse for the Century Opera Company. In 1915, Rasch stated in an article in Musical America that ‚Äúshe wished to take a company of girls on tour, ‚Äújust as Pavlowa has done with her Russians.‚Äù‚Äù During 1916 and 1917, Rasch toured with Sarah Bernhardt before returning to New York as a concert performer with a supporting ballet troupe. That troupe marked the beginning of the Albertina Rasch Dancers, ‚Äúa troupe of highly disciplined and balletically trained girls who performed in many revues, musicals, and recitals during the 1920s and 1930s.‚Äù The dancers often ‚Äúwore skimpy costumes and performed in chorus-girl formations.\\" Rasch later signed a ‚Äúcontract with the Keith-Albee circuit for the seasons 1919-1922.\\" On those vaudeville tours, ‚Äúshe often performed alongside ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù jazz bands as they were referred to at the time.\\" In 1923, Rasch opened her first dance studio in Manhattan (where Bill Robinson taught tap). She would later open a second studio in Los Angeles. Throughout the 1920s, Rasch‚Äôs school transformed \\"from a dance school offering a range of dance styles, including a Pavlova-esque free-form ballet, to an enterprise focused on turning out her ‚ÄúAlbertina Rasch Girls.\\" Rasch felt that the precision of the dancers would ‚Äúmake ballet dancing acceptable to American tastes.‚Äù She and her school would later further focus on dance as a ‚Äúway to develop grace, charm, slenderness, and attractiveness.‚Äù In 1925, the Albertina Rasch Dancers performed her Rhapsody in Blue (1925), one of her ‚Äúfirst experiments combining ballet moves with American Jazz dance.‚Äù She starred in a number of Ziegfeld productions, appeared at the Moulin Rouge and performed with Josephine Baker before adapting her classical training and techniques for the Broadway theatre and films.Albertina Rasch at BuckinghamHotel.com Rasch's early stage work for such projects as George White's Scandals evoked the Black Crook tradition of inserting fantasy dance sequences that had little to do with the plot between book scenes. In 1930 she created the dances for the revue, Three's A Crowd. The New York Times said \\"... Mme. Rasch, director of the dances, who has made a pleasant departure from music show routine . . .\\"The New York Times, Thursday, October 156, 1930, p. 33 She soon established herself as a creative force with a routine she devised for Tilly Losch in the 1931 revue, The Band Wagon. Wearing gloves covered with blacklight paint, Losch stood in front of a mirror on a darkened stage and performed a \\"ballet\\" in which only her hands could be seen to the Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz song \\"Dancing in the Dark\\". Rasch also helped establish Cole Porter's \\"Begin the Beguine\\" as a popular standard by choreographing it to an ethnic dance in Jubilee (1935).The Rise and Fall of the Broadway Musical by Mark N. Grant, published by the University Press of New England (2005), pp 252-54 Additional Broadway credits include The Three Musketeers, Rio Rita (1927), Show Girl (1929), The Bohemian Girl, The Great Waltz (1934), Lady in the Dark (1941), and Marinka (1945). At Metro-Goldman-Mayer (MGM), Rasch specialized in ‚Äúballetic spectacles and operettas‚Äù in Hollywood. She ‚Äúsupervised and directed almost all of the camera work on her dances‚Äù and ‚Äúwas the only established female dance director in Hollywood.\\" Some of her credits include: Rogue Song (1930),The Merry Widow (1934) with Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier, Broadway Melody of 1936 (1936) with Jack Benny and Eleanor Powell, Firefly (1937), Rosalie (1937) with Powell and Nelson Eddy, Sweet-hearts (1938), The Great Waltz (1938),The Girl of the Golden West (1938) with MacDonald and Eddy, Marie Antoinette (1938) with Norma Shearer, and Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940) with Fred Astaire. Footage of Rasch filmed for the unfinished Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical The March of Time (1930) was used in the MGM film Broadway to Hollywood (1933) with Frank Morgan and Alice Brady. MGM also reused her \\"Chinese Ballet\\" from Lord Byron of Broadway (1930) in the short film Roast Beef and Movies (1934). Personal life Rasch married composer Dimitri Tiomkin in 1927; they remained married until her death on October 2, 1967 at age 76 in Woodland Hills, California following a prolonged illness.

December 21, 2016) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Background Owned and bred by Corbin Robertson, he was sired by 1989 United States Racing Hall of Fame inductee Alydar out of the Table Play mare, Taba, who was the Champion 2 year old Filly in Argentina. Raced under Corbin Robertson's Saron Stable banner, Turkoman was trained by Gary Jones. Racing career Turkoman was lightly raced at two, winning only a six-furlong maiden race at Hollywood Park. At three, he won the Grade III Affirmed Handicap, placed second in the Grade I Travers Stakes, was second in the Grade I Swaps Stakes, finished second in the California Derby, and was third in the Breeders' Cup Classic behind winner Proud Truth and Gate Dancer. At four, he started the season with a win in the Tallahassee Handicap in 1:08 1/5 for six furlongs. He beat Preakness Stakes winner Gate Dancer in both the Widener Handicap, which he set a track record in 1:58 3/5, and the Oaklawn Handicap with Chris McCarron aloft. In perhaps his best race, Turkoman outdueled Precisionist down the stretch for a win in the Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap. He then finished second to Cr√®me Fraiche in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In the Breeders Cup Classic with jockey Pat Day substitute riding for the injured Chris McCarron, coming from far back his late rally fell short of catching front-runner Skywalker though he once again finished ahead of Precisionist. These performances saw him clinch the 1986 U.S. Champion Older Male Horse. He earned 2 known 120+ Beyer Speed figures in his career, which includes his 128 in The Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap. Retirement Upon retirement in 1987, Turkoman was initially sent to Circle H Ranch in California and then relocated in 2004 to Mira Loma Thoroughbred Farm in Riverside County where he stood at stud until the farm closed in 2006. He is pensioned at E. A. Ranches in Santa Ysabel. He is a successful sire with graded stakes race winners Turk Passer, Man From Wicklow, Peruvian 3 year old Champion Captain Garfio, Personal Merit, and Miss Turkana.http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/stallion- directory/search_results.aspx?sf1=Turkoman TB Times Stallion Directory Turkoman As a broodmare sire, he has sired Turko's Turn, dam of 2001 United States Horse of the Year Point Given, and Turkish Tryst, dam of Hard Spun, second in the 2007 Kentucky Derby. Turkoman is also the broodmare sire of Colonel John, a Grade I winner of the Santa Anita Derby Turkoman lived out his days at E.A. Ranches in Ramona, California. A portion of his boarding fee was paid by Our Mims Retirement Haven in Paris Kyourmims.org through a grant funded by his racing owners. He was euthanized in December 2016 due to chronic instability in his hindquarters and will be cremated and buried back in Kentucky next to his dam, Taba, and his half sister.

Settlement  The first Baymen settled in the Belize City area in the 1630s. They were buccaneers and pirates trying to outrun the Spanish rulers in Mexico and Central America. They found that they could make a living cutting and selling logwood to the home country. Many of the first Baymen settled on what is now the Northside of Belize City. They controlled all affairs of municipal and national government through the Public Meeting. The Baymen established the system of slavery in Belize, in order to have servants to cut logwood. Some slaves were allowed their own plantations, while others had to depend on their owner's rations. The Baymen reluctantly allowed slaves to participate in the Battle of St. George's Caye against the Spanish and their slaves. In some cases they faced former slaves who had run away or been taken in by the Spaniards. Great Britain ended slavery in the colony in 1838. Initially the planters refused to sell land to freedmen. But Belizean slaveowners received the highest compensation, of more than 50 pounds, for selling plots of emancipated territories. The British and Spanish engaged in frequent dispute over the territory even after the 1763 Treaty of Paris. This had ended the Seven Years War conflict between the British and French. The British and Spanish also made arrangements under this treaty, including establishing British rights to cut logwood in the area of Belize. The Spanish, who controlled the neighboring colonies, chased out the Baymen four times between 1717 and 1780. Treaties in 1783 and 1786 gave them more security. But it was only after the Battle of St. George's Caye in 1798 did the Baymen gain full control of the settlement. It was admitted to colonial status in 1863 in the United Kingdom.  Conflict with the Maya  The Maya peoples of Belize had suffered from extended conflict over the centuries with the Spanish. Some had retreated to or already occupied the depths of the dense forests of central and western Belize. Buccaneers had frequently raided most of the coastal settlements, stealing crops, and taking men and women as slaves. Some Mayan slaves were sold in the British colony of Jamaica, and shipped for sale to their colonies of Virginia and the Carolinas. When the supply of logwood began to diminish, and prices fell in Europe because other dyestuffs became available, the Baymen began to cut tropical cedar and mahogany. They had to go deeper into the forests for this wood, where they began to have hostile encounters with Maya villages. The Baymen reported attacks in 1788 and 1802. But the main thrust of the Baymen clash with the Maya came in Corozal and Orange Walk districts as part of the Caste War. Mexican and Belizean Maya challenged British lumber encampments, with limited success. Maya resistance continued until the 1870s, representing the last stand of these indigenous independent people. By the late 19th century, the fighting had ended. But logging companies continued to displace Maya villages and destroy their habitats.  Conflict with the Garifuna  The Garinagu people had an ambivalent relationship with the Baymen. While the Baymen valued the Garinagu's agricultural skills, they wanted them to submit to European control and help capture refugee slaves. The Baymen began a campaign of misinformation, saying the Garinagu had practices of \\"devil worshipping\\" and \\"baby eating.\\" This poisoned relationships between the Creoles and \\"Kerobs\\", as they were derogatorily called.

Bilingual and stereo sound television programs started being broadcast in Japan in October 1978 using a \\"FM-FM\\" system originally developed by NHK Technical Research Labs during 1962‚Äì1969. This system was modified and standardised by the EIAJ in January 1979. Television stations in Japan with capability for bilingual and stereo sound transmissions used the callsign JO**-TAM, where \\"TAM\\" denotes their audio FM multiplex sub-carrier designation, until digital switchover to ISDB-T in 2010‚Äì2012 which eventually rendered EIAJ MTS obsolete. The original version M TV standard has a monaural FM transmission at 4.5 MHz. For Japanese multichannel television sound a second channel, or sub-channel, is added to the original signal by using an FM sub-carrier at twice the line frequency (Fh, or 15374 Hz). In order to identify the different modes (mono, stereo, or dual sound) a pilot tone is also added on an AM carrier at 3.5 times the line frequency. The pilot tone frequencies are 982.5 Hz for stereo and 922.5 Hz for dual sound. Contrary to Zweikanalton these pilot tones are not coupled to the line frequency but were instead chosen to allow use of filters already employed in the Pocket Bell pager system.

A stock horse is a horse of a type that is well suited for working with livestock, particularly cattle. The related cow pony or cow horse is a historic phrase, still used colloquially today, referring to a particularly small agile cattle-herding horse; the term dates to 1874. The word \\"pony\\" in this context has little to do with the animal's size, though the traditional cow pony could be as small as and less than high. Such horses are characterized by agility, quickness, and powerful hindquarters. They are usually noted for intelligence and \\"cow sense,\\" having an instinctive understanding of how to respond to the movement of cattle so as to move livestock in a desired manner with minimal or no guidance from their rider. Such horses are used both as working animals on livestock ranches or stations, and are also seen in competition where horses are evaluated on their ability to work cattle. The term may refer to any of the following: *A horse used for ranch work or for competition based on the movements of a working ranch horse, including: **campdrafting **cutting (sport) **ranch sorting **reining **rodeo, particularly calf roping and team roping **team penning **working cow horse **An outdated term for reining or working cow horse competition. *Any breed used for ranch or cattle work in the United States, or work on cattle stations in Australia, including: **Australian Stock Horse **American Quarter Horse **American Paint Horse **Appaloosa **Banker horse **Carolina Marsh Tacky **Florida Cracker Horse *Any other horse used for western riding, ranch work or for stock horse types of competition. *Any breed or type of light riding horse of a phenotype that includes a powerful build with heavily muscled hindquarters that appears suitable for work as a stock horse.

It is a popular mountain climatic resort and a home to a medieval fortress.  Location  Surami is located on the southern slopes of the Likhi Range (alternatively known as the Surami Range) which divides Georgia into its eastern and western parts, four km from the town Khashuri, to which Surami is connected through a railway spur.  History  Ruins of the Surami Fortress The north-western corner of Surami and the Kviratskhoveli Church The first human settlement on Surami's territory dates back to the early Bronze Age. It is probably the Surium of Classical authors, specifically Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), who place it in the eastern part of Colchis, towards Iberia. Strategically located at the entrance into the Borjomi Gorge and guarding the road from eastern to western Georgia, Surami became a heavily fortified town in the 12th century. From the 1170s to the latter part of the 14th century, the fortress of Surami was a hereditary fief of the dynasty of the eristavs (\\"dukes\\") of Kartli (central Georgia), who assumed the surname of Surameli (·É°·É£·É†·Éê·Éõ·Éî·Éö·Éò; literally, \\"[lord] of Surami\\"). Subsequently, Surami declined but retained its lively trading post as well as the fortress which was reconstructed in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the mid-18th century, according to Prince Vakhushti, Surami had 200 households of Georgians, Armenians and Jews. In the 1740s, Surami was used by Prince Givi Amilakhvari as his base against King Teimuraz II and Persians. After the prince‚Äôs surrender in 1745, the fortress was demolished, but later restored and exploited by the Russo-Georgian troops in anti-Ottoman operations during the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774). After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Surami housed a military post and was later popularized as a mountain climatic resort. In 1926, it acquired the status of \\"urban-type settlement\\" (Georgian: daba).  Monuments and attractions  View of Surami's south- western part and The Mother of God Church from the Surami Fortress Surami is adjacent to the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park, noted for its diverse landscapes and abundance of historical monuments. The town itself houses The Mother of God Church complex constructed in the 16th-17th century, the 17th-19th century St. George‚Äôs Church and the Kviratskhoveli Church built in 1998. The exact date when the Surami Fortress was built remains obscure. Its earliest structures possibly date to the 12th century, but it has been reconstructed several times since then. A local legend associated with the fortress was brought into classical Georgian literature by the writer Daniel Chonkadze (1830‚Äì1860) and further famed by the Armenian filmmaker Sergei Parajanov in his award-winning feature film The Legend of Suram Fortress in 1985. The Museum of Lesya Ukrainka is dedicated to the memory of the notable Ukrainian poet Lesya Ukrainka (1873‚Äì1913) who spent her last months in Surami. The Museum consists of the house where the poet died, a library and Ukrainka's monument authored by the Georgian sculptor Tamar Abakelia (1952).

The attacks are called the Ramadan Offensive because they were conducted during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The number of insurgent attacks increased during this period mainly because of the belief among the insurgent forces that fighting a foreign occupation force during Islam's holy month puts a believer especially close to God. The Offensive=Offensive starts and the al-Rashid Hotel attack On the morning of October 26, 2003, the first day of Ramadan, suicide bombers drove 5 carloads of explosives into 5 buildings, the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross and four Iraqi police stations, as the insurgent offensive began. That morning in the early hours in Baghdad insurgents fired an improvised multiple-tube launcher mounted in a trailer that was made up to look like a mobile generator, about 400 meters from the al-Rashid Hotel. Where, at the time, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was staying. Eight to ten rockets hit the hotel killing one U.S. soldier and wounding 15 people, including seven American civilians and four soldiers. Several more rockets were fired but missed their target. Wolfowitz was on the 12th floor of the hotel, which houses U.S. and coalition officials in Baghdad, and on the side of the hotel that came under attack. The rockets reached only as high as the 11th floor. Baghdad bombings At the start of the offensive on October 27, 2003 insurgents staged a coordinated suicide attack targeting the Red Cross compound, and four Iraqi police stations in Baghdad. The bombings all occurred within about 45 minutes of each other. Four suicide bombers died but the fifth, a Syrian, who attempted to blow up the fourth police station failed after the man's car apparently failed to explode. He was shot and wounded by the Iraqi police and arrested. The attacks killed 35 people, as well as injuring 244. Among the dead were also 2 U.S. soldiers. Italian military police headquarters destroyed On November 12, 2003 a suicide bomber in a tanker truck attacked the Italian military police headquarters in Nasiriyah destroying it and killing 28 people, including 17 Italian soldiers and 2 Italian civilians. The attack was the worst incident involving Italian soldiers since Operation Restore Hope in Somalia and the highest loss of Italian soldiers since World War II. The attack thus shocked Italy and plunged it into a three-day mourning period. The soldiers were given a state funeral. Helicopter downings During this time, a number of U.S. military helicopters were shot down resulting in a large number of casualties inflicted on the U.S. forces. Three UH-60 Black Hawks and one CH-47D Chinook were downed, killing 39 soldiers and wounding 31. Two of the helicopters were downed using Strela missile launchers that most likely ended up in the hands of the insurgents via the black market. A day before the start of the offensive, on 25 October 2003 another UH-60 Black Hawk was shot down, wounding 5 soldiers. Aftermath Many people compared the Ramadan Offensive with the Tet Offensive of 1968 in the Vietnam war. Some also said that the similarities to Tet were chilling. In 1968, the attacks came at the onset of the Vietnamese New Year, a holiday that American command believed would herald a temporary quieting of the violence. In Iraq, these attacks came at the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The American command in Baghdad believed the holiday would bring a slacking of the attacks that had been plaguing American forces. This assumption ran so strong that the Baghdad curfew was partially lifted by American forces. The most pointed similarity was clear: These attacks were meant to cause a political reaction.

As of 2009 it houses the Departments of Romance Studies, Russian Literature, and Linguistics. The building is named in honor of Justin Smith Morrill, who as Senator from Vermont was the primary proponent of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 which greatly assisted the founding of Cornell University. Morrill Hall was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and  History  The eastern face of Morrill HallMorrill Hall was the University's first newly constructed building, built at a cost of $70,111 and opening on October 7, 1868 as South University Building, or less formally, as South Hall. It is the southernmost of the three buildings which comprise the \\"Stone Row\\" which forms the west side of Cornell's Arts Quadrangle, all constructed of Ithaca bluestone quarried from the base of Libe Slope. An early Cornell professor, Goldwin Smith, said dismissively of these three buildings that \\"nothing can redeem them but dynamite.\\" While all three of these historic buildings remain standing, each has undergone periods of extensive renovation to overcome the limitations of their original structural designs. While the building primarily provides a home for language-related departments such as Romance Studies, Russian Literature, and Linguistics, Morrill Hall has previously served as the headquarters for a much broader variety of departments. Notably, the fourth floor of the building housed the Cornell Law School in its entirety when it first opened in 1887. Also, the Psychology Department was located in Morrill Hall until its current headquarters were established in Uris Hall, and the \\"university Co-Operative store, familiarly the 'Co-Op'\\" was located in the basement of Morrill during the early 20th century.  Architecture  The exterior architectural style of Morrill Hall has been alternatively described as Second Empire and Italian Renaissance. The structure was originally divided into three distinct sections: a southern wing containing student residential suites with room for sixty students; a central academic wing for classrooms, the library, and an auditorium; and a northern wing containing offices. Originally, the sections were not interconnected, and moving from one to the other required exiting and re-entering the building. This segmented structure was designed as a safety feature, as a fire in one wing of the building would be less likely to spread to the other two sections of the structure. The partitions between the three segments of the building were demolished in 1897 as part of a large-scale renovation. The western face of Morrill Hall, which presently serves as the back of the buildingThe buildings comprising the Stone Row- Morrill Hall, McGraw Hall, and White Hall- all face westward toward Libe Slope, as the university originally intended to develop the slope area with further construction projects. Later construction efforts, however, focused on the area east of the three historical buildings, leaving them facing the \\"wrong way.\\" Morrill Hall's current interior layout, following a 1973 remodeling, thus runs counter to the original exterior orientation. The structure's three primary entrances and main reception area all open to the eastern face of the building on the Arts Quadrangle, with only one of the original western entrances still in use. Thus, the exterior \\"front\\" of the building now serves functionally as the back of the building.

The fort at Baton Rouge was built on the Watt's and Flower's plantations and was completed during the six weeks preceding hostilities in the area during the American Revolutionary War.

Biography  Antonio Le√≥n Ortega was born in Ayamonte, in the county of Huelva, on December 7, 1907. When he was a teenager, he showed a restless passion and an innate ability for sculpture, producing his first self-taught works. When, years later, they were shown to the master Mariano Benlliure, they appeared to be typical of a mature sculptor. He carried on his studies in Madrid from 1927 to 1934. He attended the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied sculpture and design teaching under excellent teachers such as Mariano Benlliure, Jos√© Capuz, Manuel Benedito and Juan Adsuara, with whom he worked during a stage of his production. In those years he approached Castilian imagery: he studied it in Valladolid, where he found his mentor in Gregorio Fern√°ndez. Since 1938 he worked in his first workshop in San Cristobal Street in Huelva, sharing it with the painter Pedro G√≥mez. Soon the workshop became not only an informal school of artists, but also an atheneum of arts and humanities, frequented by all the artists who lived or passed through Huelva such as poets, journalists, doctors and writers. The workshop was known in the artistic world as the ‚ÄúSan Cristobal‚Äôs Academy‚Äù. In the same years, he studied the Sevillana imagery through the works of the master Mart√≠nez Mounta√±√©s. In 1964 he moved to a new workshop in Medico Lu√≠s Buend√≠a Street and he worked there until 1985, year in which illness moved him away from all the activities. In these 50 years of hard work, he produced more than four hundred works, including small and great size works, made of different materials such as wood, mud, stone, brass, and others. He elaborated on the religious works from a previous sketch drawn on mud and he sculpted them directly onto the wood with the help of the gouge and the mallet. In this way, he followed the traditional Spanish imagery way learned in Madrid from Jos√© Capuz and Juan Adsuara. He produced lots of the images for the Holy Week of Huelva and Ayamonte and of many other towns in the counties of Huelva and Badajoz. He created other important religious and civil works in Seville, Cadiz, Malaga, Caceres, Salamanca, Pontevedra, Madrid, Belgium, United States, etc., as well as many others in smaller sizes, belonging to private collections in America and in Spain. He created a modernist style of sculpture in Madrid, according to the twenties style: we can easily find it in works like the Retrato de Luna, in Manuel Bendito Museum, and the Retrato de Trinidad Navarro in Ayamonte. Descendimiento of Huelva Le√≥n Ortega is the author of one of the most serious, rigorous and personal sculptures in Spain in the 20th century, creating an easily distinguishable personal style. He got the best of his production in the sculptural groups, preferring the sculpture to the imagery, -- The Descendimiento of Huelva, in which he combined the expressive force of Berruguete with the Andalusian sweetness of his style, -- it represents a real masterpiece. In the Crucificados, --the Cristo de la Sangre de los Estudiantes is rich in such a unique elegance and beauty --. He also produced many Madonnas with faces full of suppressed pain (he didn't like the candlestick images, he preferred the full size). The Virgen del amor of Huelva represents its maximum example. His outstanding productions include: the Yacente, the Cristo del Perd√≤n, the Angel de la oraci√≤n, the Cristo de la Borriquita, the Jes√πs de las tres Caidas, the Cristo de la Victoria, the Cristo de la Conception, the San Cristobal, the Virgen de las Angustias and the Virgen de los Angeles in Huelva, the Pasi√≥n, the Yacente de las Angustias, the Cautivo, the Cristo de las Aguas and the Virgen de la paz in Ayamonte, the Nazareno of Beas and the Nazareno of Moguer. At the same time he was an educator; he taught drawing and modelling classes in his workshop, in the Diocesan seminary and where today is the Le√≥n Ortega School of Arts. As sculptor, he mostly gave himself up to creating images, not only because this artistic field had always attracted him, but also because he was motivated by intimate religious convictions, that, connected to his social sensibility, place him into the area of the most involved Christianity. His first religious works had a baroque touch, but then he found a very personal style: he chose a lighter form of lines and decorations and he tried to find a fusion between the Castillian and Andalucian imagery to get the essence of the sculpture only in its minimalism. In the last five-year period -- he worked until he was eighty -- his production lost part of its sculptorical power. He created only small size works because they needed just a little physical effort as, for example, his last masterpiece, the Busto de Madame Cazenave.

It first appeared in English in 1799 as Goetz of Berlichingen of the Iron Hand in a rather free version by Walter Scott.Title page of Goetz of Berlichingen, with the Iron Hand, translated by Walter Scott, London 1799 Goethe's plot treats events freely: while the historical G√∂tz died an octogenarian, Goethe's hero is a free spirit, a maverick, intended to be a pillar of national integrity against a deceitful and over-refined society, and the way in which he tragically succumbs to the abstract concepts of law and justice shows the submission of the individual in that society. ' was one of Goethe's early successes but its large cast size, frequent quick scene changes, and long running time caused the original version to eventually fall out of favour. The play has been re-arranged and cut many times, including two versions by Goethe that were published posthumously. A 1925 silent film Goetz von Berlichingen of the Iron Hand was directed by Hubert Moest, while a 1955 Austrian production Goetz von Berlichingen starred Ewald Balser in the title role. In 1979 Wolfgang Liebeneiner directed Raimund Harmstorf in a film version, Goetz von Berlichingen of the Iron Hand. Famous quote The first version of the drama included a quote that gained fame fast. In the third act, G√∂tz is under siege by the Imperial Army in his castle at Jagsthausen. The captain of the army asked him to surrender; from a window, he gives his answer: It can be translated as: Goethe based this passage on the autobiography of the historical G√∂tz, who records himself as saying (in a different context) \\"\\" (\\"He can lick me on the behind\\").The Autobiography of G√∂tz von Berlichingen (ed.

NADK camps shown in red. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK) was a Cambodian guerrilla force. NADK were the armed forces of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (also known as 'Khmer Rouge'), operating between 1979 and the late 1990s. History NADK was formed in December 1979 in order to replace the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea.Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, . NADK forces consisted mainly of former RAK troops - large numbers of whom had escaped the 1978 to 1979 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. It included as well as conscripts coerced into submission during the RAK retreat and new volunteers or recruits either pressed into service during in-country raids or drawn from among refugee groups. The New York Times reported in June 1987 that \\"the Khmer Rouge army is believed to be having some success in its recruitment, not only among the refugees in its camps but within the Vietnamese controlled People's Republic of Kampuchea.\\" The NADK did not make personnel figures public, but estimates by military observers and by journalists generally ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 combatants in the 1980s. In 1987 the opinion that the NADK was \\"the only effective fighting force\\" opposing the Vietnamese was more often expressed by Western observers. In an interview published in the United States in May 1987, Norodom Sihanouk reportedly said, \\"without the Khmer Rouge, we have no credibility on the battlefield... [they are]... the only credible military force.\\" During the 1980s, the Khmer Rouge leadership, composed of party cadres who doubled as military commanders, remained fairly constant. Pol Pot retained an ambiguous but presumably prominent position in the hierarchy, although he was nominally replaced as commander in chief of the NADK by Son Sen, who like Pol Pot had also been a student in Paris and who had gone underground with him in 1963. There were reports of factions in the NADK, such as one loyal to Khieu Samphan, prime minister of the defunct regime of Democratic Kampuchea, and his deputy Ieng Sary, and another identified with Pol Pot and Ta Mok (the Southwestern Zone commander who conducted extensive purges of party ranks in Cambodia in 1977 to 1978). Although led by party and military veterans, the NADK combatants in 1987 were reportedly \\"less experienced, less motivated, and younger\\" than those the Vietnamese had faced in previous encounters. Nevertheless, the new Khmer Rouge recruits still were \\"hardy and lower class,\\" and tougher than the non-communist combatants. During forays into Cambodia, NADK units employed terror tactics against Khmer civilians, including murder and destruction of economic resources. Such success as they achieved in recruiting was apparently owed to traditional Cambodian hatred of the Vietnamese invader, although there were reports that some of the peasantry would have preferred to endure a continued Vietnamese occupation rather than to suffer a return to Khmer Rouge rule. During this time the Khmer Rouge divided the country into four military zones that functioned virtually autonomously under their respective commanders. Within these four zones, three areas‚Äîthe provinces around the Tonle Sap, the western border of Cambodia, and the remainder of the country‚Äîwere sites of NADK tactical operations. It was the first area, the heartland of Cambodia, that the NADK viewed as the \\"Achilles' heel of the Vietnamese enemy,\\" where NADK military efforts were concentrated. NADK units managed to keep the main routes linking Phnom Penh to western Cambodia \\"in a permanent state of insecurity,\\" according to a senior Vietnamese military observer; traffic to and from the seaport of Kampong Saom was obliged to move in convoys. Both highways and railroads from the capital were interdicted intermittently because of guerrilla activity. Officials in Phnom Penh told a Western correspondent in 1987 that the Khmer Rouge were then operating in small insurgent groups inside Cambodia in a battle for the villages, rather than fighting from the Thai border area, as had been the case prior to the 1984 to 1985 Vietnamese dry- season offensive. In carrying the war to the countryside, the NADK demonstrated that it had gone on the strategic defensive, that is, that it would adhere to a doctrine of guerrilla warfare until the balance of forces was about equal. If this parity were to be achieved, NADK strategists presumably would then switch to offensive operations. In carrying on its protracted insurgency, the NADK received the bulk of its military equipment and financing from China, which had supported the previous regime of Democratic Kampuchea. One pro-Beijing source put the level of Chinese aid to the NADK at US$1 million a month. Another source, although it did not give a breakdown, set the total level of Chinese assistance, to all the resistance factions, at somewhere between US$60 million and US$100 million a year. The Chinese weaponry observed in the possession of NADK combatants included AK-47 assault rifles, RPD light machine guns, RPG launchers, recoilless rifles, and anti-personnel mines. NADK guerrillas usually were seen garbed in dark green Chinese fatigues and soft \\"Mao caps\\" without insignia. No markings or patches were evident on guerrilla uniforms, although the NADK had promulgated a hierarchy of ranks with distinctive insignias in 1981. To keep troops and supplies moving into the combat zone, the NADK, according to Vietnamese sources, followed two infiltration routes. One of them ran south from Thailand through the Dangrek Escarpment into Cambodia. The second ran north from Trat, a minor Thai seaport that may have been an unloading point for Chinese supplies for the Khmer Rouge. In spite of substantial Chinese material assistance, however, the NADK could not maintain the logistical supply line needed to conduct a sustained military campaign.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kh0168) NADK continued fighting Cambodian government forces into the late 1990s.http://www2.amnesty.se/ar98.nsf/0/28a761249ed0fe57c125661f00486edb?OpenDocument See also *Phnom Malai References Category:Factions of the Third Indochina War Category:Khmer Rouge Category:Military wings of political parties Category:Rebel groups in Cambodia ","title":"National Army of Democratic Kampuchea"},{"id":"13311505","title":"Diamond Cut (Bonnie Tyler album)"},{"id":"13311565","text":"American Standoff is a 2002 American documentary film by Kristi Jacobson which documents much of a strike by the Teamsters against a package delivery company, Overnite Transportation (now a subsidiary of United Parcel Service). The film follows the strike from early 2000 to mid-2001. Synopsis The Teamsters' strike against Overnite began on October 24, 1999. James P. Hoffa had been elected president of the Teamsters in the fall of 1998, and had campaigned on a promise to unionize Overnite and securing a contract for its 13,000 workers. The Teamsters represented only a fraction of Overnite's workers, but believed they could use other means to win company recognition of the union. Initially, about 2,000 workers walked the picket line in 12 states. The strike turned violent, however, and both sides accused the other of bribery, spying, intimidation and more. By August 2002, only 300 to 600 workers remained on strike. The Teamsters called the strike off without securing a contract or union recognition.Greenhouse, \\"Teamsters End 3-Year Strike Against Trucker Without Contract,\\" New York Times, October 26, 2002. American Standoff focuses primarily on two Teamster members and a staff organizer and how they are affected by the strike. However, the film roves over the entire United States, visiting Memphis, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Las Vegas. The strike is placed in the context of Hoffa's struggle to secure his political base within the Teamsters' union. Hoffa not only faced political attacks from union reformers but also from other union leaders who believed they could unseat the newly elected president in the 2002 election.Greenhouse, \\"Bitter 6-Month Strike at Overnite Poses a Test for Teamsters' Chief,\\" New York Times, May 7, 2000. The internecine struggle for power in the Teamsters limits the effectiveness of the union's response, although Hoffa appears to emerge strengthened.Ross, \\"INTERVIEW: Behind The Strike Lines: 'American Standoff' Director Kristi Jacobson Chronicles the Teamsters,\\" IndieWire, June 7, 2002. The film concludes in mid-2001, with the strike still lingering, workers increasingly disenchanted, and the union struggling to find an acceptable exit strategy. Critical reception American Standoff was financed in part by HBO. The cable network aired the documentary on June 10, 2002, on its \\"America Undercover\\" series. Sheila Nevins of HBO took an executive producer credit on the film.Pinsker, \\"Cash, With Strings, for Documentaries,\\" New York Times, January 14, 2002.Scheib, \\"American Standoff (movie review),\\" Variety, May 21, 2002. The documentary also screened at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Critical reviews of the film were qualified, but generally strong. Variety's review was typical: :\\"Standoff,\\" produced by two- time Academy Award winner Barbara Kopple and directed by protegee Kristi Jacobson, lacks the extraordinary clarity of Kopple's 1991 \\"American Dream.\\" But pic still packs an emotional wallop, dwelling effectively on the pain and confusion of strike organizers as they run out of options.

His other nonfiction books include In the Womb: Animals (2009), Apollo‚Äôs Fire (2007), Adam's Navel (2003), and Darwin's Orchestra (1997). He is also an acclaimed anthologist, editor of several volumes of Victorian and Edwardian fiction and poetry. Sims's nonfiction books have received critical acclaim in every English-speaking country as well as in translation in Europe and Asia. Early life Born in rural eastern Tennessee, near the small town of Crossville, Sims has described in interviews how he grew up in a household without a telephone, an automobile, or, at times, indoor plumbing. He spent his teenage years in a wheelchair because of rheumatic arthritis following an attack of rheumatic fever. Although Robert Macfarlane in the Sunday Times (London) said that Sims ‚Äúis clearly the beneficiary of a wide-ranging American liberal-arts education,‚Äù actually Sims did not attend university. But he developed in childhood a preoccupation with literature, art, and nature, themes that dominate his adult work.

Published simultaneously in the U.S. and England, it was chosen as a Library Journal Best Science Book and a New York Times Notable Book.

W. J. Bartrip, ‚ÄòHastings, Sir Charles (1794‚Äì1866)‚Äô, accessed 28 Feb 2007.BMA Website: a brief history He was also a notable lifelong philanthropist, investing his own money in new housing designed to improve public health and founding a natural history museum.  Birth and early life  Charles Hastings was born at Ludlow in Shropshire, the ninth of 15 children born into the family of Rev. James Hastings (1756-1856), a clergyman who was rector of the church in Bitterley near Ludlow, but about to take up the position of incumbent at Martley in Worcestershire. It was in Worcestershire that he was educated and spent his formative childhood, attending Royal Grammar School Worcester. He was a younger brother of Admiral Sir Thomas Hastings. Charles was interested in natural history as a young boy and as he matured he was drawn towards the study of medicine, especially after his father suffered an incapacitating accident. In fact it would seem he was a precocious student, becoming an apprentice to an apothecary initially then attending anatomy school in London at age 16 and becoming house surgeon at Worcester Infirmary at 18 years of age. He entered the University of Edinburgh aged 21, where he was elected President of the Royal Medical Society, returning after completing his studies and gaining his medical degree in 1818, immediately to Worcester Infirmary again. He declined a lectureship at Edinburgh in order to do so.  Campaigning work in Worcester  Hastings in 1864 Hastings had a close relationship with his home city, Worcester, and although he could have developed an interesting, challenging and rewarding medical career anywhere including London or Edinburgh, he started his career in the locality where he had grown up. In 1854 he was looking for ways of investing his own money in innovative, purpose-designed living and working accommodation for Worcester's artisans. These 'modern dwellings', as he called them, were well-designed and well-built houses of varied construction types that replaced often cramped, old, crowded, medieval buildings and later cheaply built terraces and town houses which were little more than slums by Hastings' time and places where diseases such as typhus would break out in the right conditions, an all too regular development. Cholera had broken out in Worcester many times. It spread throughout the city in 1832, claiming many lives and recurred in 1849 and 1853 taking children and workers of all ages. It is said that Hastings attended to people in every outbreak, personally seeing every single case and ministering to the sick and dying with no regard for his own health. The new housing he had helped to introduce, for example in Copenhagen Street ‚Äì now demolished in turn ‚Äì was having a dramatic effect on health with the death rate dropping by 45% in a decade. However, he faced reluctance on the part of Worcester City Council to introduce measures such as introducing clean water into houses, pumps and streets. In fact, it was 1872 before legislation was on the statute books for clean water to be piped into most metropolitan areas, Worcester included. Hastings was also a forthright critic of hydropathy. (see pp. 192‚Äì193 & footnote #105) He was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1850 for his pioneering work, resolve and social conscience. He also founded the Worcester Museum of Natural History, hoping that it might inspire the younger generations following him to have at their disposal a valuable facility in which they could further their studies and gain an insight into the wonders of the world around them and a greater understanding of how to improve it for the greater good. In the last years of his life, Hastings was the first chairman of the ill-fated Worcester, Bromyard and Leominster Railway, and during his tenure the operating company had spent ¬£20,000 on line without purchasing the necessary land or signing a contract with the construction company.The Worcester, Bromyard & Leominster Railway . herefordshire.gov.uk  Death and legacy  His grave lies in Worcester's Astwood Cemetery, alongside his wife Hannah, who predeceased him by just three months. They had two daughters, and a son, George Woodyatt Hastings, who became a local MP. He had lived out his final years at his home, Barnards Green House, in Malvern and died at age 72 on 30 July 1866. When the new Worcestershire Royal Hospital was opened on land just outside the city of Worcester in 2002, the road for the new hospital was called Charles Hastings Way.

It is endemic to the island of Mindoro. The Mindoro stripe-faced fruit bat ranked sixth in the top ten species of 2008, selected by the International Institute for Species Exploration. Aboriginal rock art dating back some 20,000 years, from near Kalumburu in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, depicts several bats similar to Styloctenium mindorensis hanging from a branch or vine. The paintings belong to a category of sophisticated rock art known as Bradshaws. The facial markings on the paintings are particularly clear and have led researchers to conclude that the subjects were either S. mindorensis or a closely related species. Description S. mindorensis is a typical fruit bat, possessing modified forearms for flight, short clawed hind legs and large ears. The bat shares many anatomical features with the rest of its genus, which was originally described from just one species. These include an overall orange pelage, a white stripe down the middle of the bat's rostrum and white spots above its eyes. S. mindorensis can be distinguished from the other member of its genus by its possession of multicusped lower and upper canine teeth. Taxonomy Because of its distinct morphological features, it was placed in the genus Styloctenium. Prior to this, the genus was only described from one species, the Indonesian Styloctenium wallacei. The second species in the genus to be discovered, it was formally described by Jacob Esselstyn in the August 2007 issue of the Journal of Mammalogy. Esselstyn first heard rumours of the bat's existence from locals in barangay Batong Buhay in the municipality of Sablayan in the province of Occidental Mindoro. The researchers remained skeptical of the species' existence until a live specimen was unexpectedly found in February 2006. The bat was unintentionally caught in one of their nets used for surveying the local fauna. S. mindorensis is the 74th chiropteran species to be found in the Philippines and the country's 26th endemic one. Conservation While no population studies has been done so far on the species, it has been suggested that it may be threatened by hunting and habitat loss due to the general deforestation of forests on Mindoro. Along with other large pteropodids on the island, the bat is hunted by the locals for food. The describer went so far as to state that because of these threats, the species may be at risk of extinction. It is assessed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

He appeared in 88 films between 1909 and 1936. He also directed 53 films between 1914 and 1926. Biography O'Brien was born in Roanoke, Virginia. He attended St. John's College in Brooklyn, New York, and was planning on becoming a lawyer. However, Daniel Frohman persuaded him to change his mind and try a stage career instead. He performed as a juvenile lead for the Augustus Thomas Company, beginning with the play Alabama, and later for Essanay Studios. He also worked as a cameraman for Broncho Billy Anderson and wrote scenarios for Essanay. According to two sources, in July 1911, O'Brien was lured away from Essanay to direct the film The Life of Buffalo Bill, featuring Buffalo Bill himself. According to one of these sources, the book Buffalo Bill on the Silver Screen: The Films of William F. Cody, O'Brien had to shoot the film while the Wild West show was on tour. It was supposedly the first or one of the first five-reel feature movies. However, the opening credits of the film itself state that it is only three reels long. (To confuse the issue even further, there is another 1912 film with exactly the same title, directed by Paul Panzer.) Some sources state he worked on D. W. Griffith's ground-breaking epic The Birth of a Nation. He directed for Famous Players and later Metro Pictures. He died in Hollywood, California. He was survived by his wife.

Today it houses the Napoleonmuseum. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Arenenberg castle Arenenberg was built in the early 16th century by the mayor of Constance (1546‚Äì48) Sebastian Geissberg. The name of the farm that had been located there before was Narrenberg (\\"fools' mountain\\"), perhaps not a suitable name to hold on to, but also the hill towards the lake was named \\"Arnhalde\\". By the 19th century the current name was used. The estate saw a number of owners. In 1817, Johann Baptist von Streng sold it to the exiled Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of ex-Empress Jos√©phine, for 30,000 guilders. As arranged by Napoleon, Hortense had to marry his brother Louis Bonaparte, and the couple were named King and Queen of Holland (1806‚Äì10). The royal couple not only suffered with the demise of the rule of Napoleon, but also had an unhappy marriage leading to a separation. Hortense initiated reconstructions and renovations in an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of Malmaison. The surrounding park was possibly designed by Louis-Martin Berthault. In 1818 she moved in. Her brother, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, bought the nearby Schloss Sandegg and built a villa close by. Arenenberg While Hortense initially spent time at her house in Augsburg, Arenenberg soon became her main domicile. At her Parisian-styled salon she entertained many luminaries. Her son Louis Napol√©on, the future emperor Napol√©on III, who had attended school in Augsburg, visited Arenenberg as a teenager; there he was further educated and then attended the Swiss military academy at Thun, receiving Swiss citizenship. In 1837, while he was exiled and living in New York City, Louis Napoleon received notice of his mother's deteriorating health and returned to Arenenberg. Hortense died on 5 October 1837. After mourning, Louis Napoleon had to leave Switzerland, due to French pressure, and moved to London. In 1843, in need of money to finance his aspirations, he sold the property to Heinrich Keller. Once he was emperor, his empress Eug√©nie bought it back in 1855. Further renovations were made between 1855 and 1874. After Napoleon III's death, Eug√©nie visited Arenenberg several times before she donated it in 1906 to the Canton Thurgau. Today the ch√¢teau is home to the Napoleon Museum. The Napoleon Park is being restored. References # Literature * Johannes Meyer, Die fr√ºheren Besitzer von Arenenberg. Frauenfeld 1920 * Jakob Hugentobler, Die Familie Bonaparte auf Arenenberg.

An eighteenth century document written by Pedro Murillo Velarde, a Jesuit historian describing their order's missionary labors in the Philippines, records the presence of such settlers in Manila as early as 1618.http://merlot.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=philamer;cc=philamer;q1=morenos;rgn=full%20text;idno=afk2830.0001.044;didno=AFK2830.0001.044;view=image;seq=31;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; Around the beginning of the 20th century, Greek sailors settled in Manila however one group came to Legazpi, Albay on the island of Luzon. Their descendants in Legazpi, Albay now number no more than 10 families, who have kept their Greek family names and have become distinguished public figures and intellectuals, including serving in the Greek consulate in Manila. One of the first Orthodox Christian faithful to arrive in the province of Albay was Al√©xandros √Åth≈çs Adam√≥poulos (later anglicized to Alexander A. Adamson), who came to Legaspi City in 1928. Together with his brother and cousin he co- founded Adamson University in 1932, which is now owned by the Vincentian Fathers of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1989, Adamopoulos saw the need to establish the first Greek Orthodox church in the Philippines and thus established the Hellenic Orthodox Foundation, Inc., but he died in 1993 before the church was completed. The Annunciation Orthodox Cathedral in Sucat, Para√±aque City, Metro Manila, was finished in 1996 and was consecrated by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 2000. Since then, other autocephalous Orthodox churches have established their presence in the Philippines. Churches There are three autocephalous Orthodox churches with a presence in the country, the jurisdictions of which overlap with each other. These are: * the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Mission in the Philippines, under the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East; * the Exarchate of the Philippines, under the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople; and * the Patriarchate of Moscow, the jurisdiction of which is divided into: **the Diocese of the Philippines and Vietnam, under the Patriarchal Exarchate in Southeast Asia; and ** the Philippine Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church outside Russia, under the semiautonomous Russian Orthodox Church outside Russia. There are also groups in the country which use the term orthodox in their names but which are not in communion with any of the fourteen to sixteen recognized autocephalous Orthodox churches.

Peek graduated from Oregon High School in Oregon, Illinois. He attended Northwestern University from 1891 to 1892, but did not graduate. He joined the Deere & Webber Company of Minneapolis in 1893, and was named Vice President of the John Deere Plow manufacturing division in Omaha, Nebraska in 1901. In 1911, he was named President of the Deere & Co. subsidiary in Moline, Illinois.\\"Republicans: Back to Beginning.\\" Time. October 12, 1936. In 1919, he left Deere & Co. and became President of the Moline Plow Company, where he earned the relatively large salary of $100,000 a year. He immediately hired retired Brigadier General Hugh S. Johnson as the company's general counsel.Hamby, Alonzo L. For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2004. Peek and Johnson were deeply interested in farm economics, especially since the post-World War I recession.Leffingwell, Randy. American Farm Tractor. St. Paul, Minn.: MBI Publishing Company, 2002. ; Nelson, Daniel. Farm and Factory: Workers in the Midwest, 1880-1990. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1995. Peek and Johnson became strong advocates of the McNary‚ÄìHaugen Farm Relief Bill, proposed federal legislation which would have established the first national system of price supports for agriculture. Peek was a member of the War Industries Board during World War I,Cuff, Robert D. \\"A 'Dollar-a-Year Man' in Government: George N. Peek and the War Industries Board.\\" Business History Review. 41:4 (Winter 1967). and after the war was a member of the Industrial Board advising the United States Department of Commerce on post-war reconversion. New Deal When the Republican Party refused to support the legislation, Peek became a Democrat. His support for the McNary-Haugen bill led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to appoint him Administrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) in 1933. Peek had sought the US Secretary of Agriculture position, but it had gone to Henry A. Wallace.Culver, John C. and Hyde, John. American Dreamer: The Life and Times of Henry A. Wallace. Reprint ed. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001. Instead, Bernard Baruch, who knew Peek from their service on the War Industries Board, convinced Roosevelt to put Peek in charge of the AAA. Peek fought with Wallace over the administration of the agency. Peek asked Roosevelt to make the AAA an independent agency, rather than part of the United States Department of Agriculture; Wallace convinced Roosevelt to deny the request. Peek demanded full authority to run the AAA; Wallace withheld it. Wallace installed Jerome Frank, a liberal young lawyer whom Peek loathed, as the AAA's general counsel.Peek referred to Frank and his like-minded colleagues as \\"Lenin baby chicks\\" for what Peek saw as their support of communism. See Culver and Hyde, American Dreamer: The Life and Times of Henry A. Wallace, 2001, p. 125. Peek also disagreed with one of the three fundamental programs created by the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which created three programs designed to boost farm prices. It established marketing programs designed to increase the purchase of American agricultural products overseas. It established a system of price supports. It established a system of incentives to discourage overproduction.Cochrane, Willard Wesley. The Development of American Agriculture: A Historical Analysis. 2d ed. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. For farmers to participate in the price support program, they had to agree to cut production. Peek was adamantly opposed to the production quotas, which he saw as a form of socialism. Instead, Peek preferred to promote informal cartels of large producers and large food processing companies, which would collude to boost prices, but Wallace repeatedly denied Peek the authority to institute such cartels. When the Commodity Credit Corporation was established in the early fall of 1933, Roosevelt refused to make it part of the AAA out of concern for Peek's attitudes. On November 15 and again on November 25, Peek demanded fot Wallace fire to Frank for insubordination; Wallace refused and threatened to have one of Peek's most trusted aides fired instead. In early December 1933, while Wallace was out of town, Peek announced a marketing program designed to sell American butter in Europe at rates below the national domestic price. Rexford Tugwell, Acting Secretary of Agriculture in Wallace's absence, rescinded the program. Wallace quickly convinced many of Roosevelt's top advisors to ask for Peek's resignation. Tugwell himself threatened to resign if Peek were not fired. Faced with a united front, Peek resigned from the AAA on December 11, 1933. One reporter called the forced resignation \\"the coolest political murder that has been committed since Roosevelt came into office.\\"\\"The New Dealers.\\" Pittsburgh Press. May 9, 1934. The same day, President Roosevelt named Peek his Special Advisor on Foreign Trade. Roosevelt created the Export-Import Bank of Washington by executive order on February 2, 1934 and named Peek president of the bank.Becker, William H. and McLenahan, William M.

Roosevelt created a Second Export-Import Bank of Washington by executive order on March 9 and named Peek president of the second bank as well. Peek's tenure at the Export- Import Bank was also short-lived. He clashed repeatedly with US Secretary of State Cordell Hull over a series of reciprocal trade agreements in 1935,Butler, Michael A. Cautious Visionary: Cordell Hull and Trade Reform, 1933-1937.

Retirement and death Peek retired to Rancho Santa Fe, California, in 1937 with his wife, Georgia. He rejoined the Republican Party, and supported Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election. Peek died at his home in Rancho Santa Fe on December 17, 1943. He was survived by his wife.

This is the standard keyboard for 12 Indian scripts including Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu, among others. The InScript layout is built into most of the major operating systems including Windows (2000 and later), and most Linux and Mac OS systems. It is also available in some mobile phones and (in the case of Tamil and Hindi) in Apple's iOS 5 and higher. It is available in Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and higher but removed from latest Google Keyboard application (Gboard) and Google Indic Keyboard.

Most Indic scripts have the same phonetic character order. A person who knows InScript typing in one script can type in any other Indic script using dictation even without knowledge of that script. History The first InScript keyboard was standardised in 1986 under the auspices of the DOE (Department of Electronics at the Ministry of Communications & Information Technology). It was subsequently revised in 1988 by a DOE committee and modifications were made to accommodate nuqta extended keys as well as to add certain matras. The last revision to the BIS document was made in 1992, after which the document has not undergone any revision. This was partly because very few new characters were added to the ISCII code-set and these if at all were handled by extending and generating the character by the use of the nuqta. The BIS document specifically mentions such characters. Hence the InScript keyboards were felt to be self-sufficient. With the advent of Unicode, a few new characters were added to each code-page; characters for which the BIS document had not made any provision. In addition Unicode introduced the concept of ZWJ and ZWNJ, as well as that of normalisation. These new features had marked repercussions on storage as well as inputting and an urgent need was felt for a revision whereby each new character introduced in Unicode would be accommodated on the keyboard and a uniform manner of entering data as well as storing data would be devised. With this urgent requirement in mind, CDAC GIST involved in the initiative all major players: IBM, Microsoft and Red Hat Linux and hence in 2008, a joint meeting was organised between CDAC GIST and senior representatives of these multi-nationals to devise a common and uniform strategy for inputting and equally important for storage. This would enable the creation of one single keyboard and more importantly one single storage, essential for all high-end NLP. A task-force was created with two major briefs: # Evolve a design policy which would retain the major features of the existing Inscript keyboard. # Accommodate on the keyboard every character proposed in Unicode 5.1 and also ensure that the design could accommodate all future additions. This resulted in a document by the joint deliberations of all these companies described as proposal for ‚ÄúEnhanced InScript keyboard layout 5.1‚Äù. See also *Clip font *Tamil 99 keyboard for Tamil.

A lifelong resident of Michigan, Frostic is known for her naturalist, Linocut block print artwork, created using Original Heidelberg Platten presses. Early life and education Gwen Frostic was born April 26, 1906 in Sandusky, Michigan to Sara (n√©e Anderson) and Fred W. Frostic. Her parents had both been trained as teachers in Ypsilanti, Michigan. At the time of Frostic's birth, Fred was serving as school principal. One of seven children, Frostic had an older brother, Bill, and five younger siblings. Although precocious and already walking, at 8 months old, Frostic suffered a high fever from an unknown illness which then left her with lifelong symptoms similar to cerebral palsy. Despite physical difficulties including a limp and weak hands, Frostic showed an early interest in and aptitude for art. Her mother was a strong advocate for her involvement in diverse activities despite her disabilities. Gwen lived with her family in Croswell, then St. Charles, before the family moved to Ann Arbor in 1917 while Fred earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan. In 1918, the family settled in Wyandotte when Fred became the Superintendent of Wyandotte Public Schools. In June 1924 Frostic graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Wyandotte, where she had completed several courses in mechanical drawing and was known for using a band saw to create event posters for her school.  Career  Frostic went on to study art education at Eastern Michigan University, where she joined the Alpha Sigma TauThe Anchor of Alpha Sigma Tau, June 1926, p. 19. sorority and earned her teacher's certificate. In 1926, she transferred to Western Michigan University where, in an art class, she carved her first linoleum block artwork. Frostic left Western Michigan University, just short of completing her degree, in 1927. greeting cards by artist Gwen Frostic Frostic set up a metals studio in the family home and started a business, Metalcraft, where she produced objects and was commissioned to make two copper vases for Mrs. Henry Ford. In 1929, Frostic worked as a summer camp counselor at Osoha of the Dunes, in Frankfort, Michigan. She continued her artistic endeavors in metal and plastic, while teaching in Dearborn and offering metals courses at the YMCA in Detroit. As the supplies of metal began to dry up due to World War II, Frostic turned to more readily available materials and began printmaking, using the Linocut technique of carving linoleum blocks. Due to her exploration with plastic, she was also commissioned to make a piece for the 1939 New York World's Fair. During World War II, Frostic worked full-time, six days a week, as a tool and die draftsperson in the Willow Run bomber plant of Ford Motor Company where she became skilled in production. After the war, Frostic started her own production printing company in Wyandotte, known as Presscraft Papers, by turning her linoleum block carvings into stationery goods and prints through the use of Heidelberg printing presses. In the early 1950s, she shifted her attention farther North and opened up a summer shop selling her prints, books, and other items in the historic tourist town of Frankfort on Lake Michigan. Her Frankfort shop, located directly in the town, was quite successful and three years later she moved there permanently to operate her business year round. In 1960 she bought of land in Benzonia with the intention of moving herself and her shop further inland into the forest. Her new property was located in a rural wooded riparian area on the Betsie River, initially accessed only by dirt roads. Frostic oversaw the construction of the print shop and dwelling, building it in relation to the woodlands. She conceived of a number of naturalistic and artistic elements including large stone boulders and a natural spring flowing inside the structure and an area with a green sod roof. On April 26, 1964, her new shop opened for business in the completed building of her own design. From an area of the shop, the Heidelberg presses could be observed from above, rhythmically printing away on the various paper products. Her artwork frequently depicted the natural world surrounding her shop: trees, plants, birds, mushrooms, flowers, berries, and animals. She incrementally grew her property into a 285-acre wildlife sanctuary. Her business grew and prospered steadily over the years. Frostic was recognized as a successful entrepreneur at a time when few women were celebrated for this. The Detroit Free Press reported that she had 34 employees working in her printing business in 1985. Several of Frostic's prints are in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts. She was a long time member of the Northwest Michigan Artists and Craftsmen. Frostic remained actively involved creating art and working in her business well into her nineties. She lived at the Benzonia property until her death in 2001 a day before her 95th birthday. Much earlier, in 1960, Frostic was rumored to be a millionaire from her business, but as she lived a simple, modest life, this was unconfirmed until the public announcement that she had left $13 million to her alma mater, Western Michigan University. Heidelberg press similar to those used at the Gwen Frostic studio Frostic's shop, Presscraft Papers, remains open in the original building (under new ownership) and continues to produce prints from her original linoleum block cuts. As of 2018, her nephew, Bill Frostic, was listed as the printing supervisor and has been running the presses for over 50 years. All 12 of the original Heidelberg presses remain in operation at the studio, and visitors can watch them in action during the week. Frostic carved over 2,300 blocks, which can be seen on the shelves of the studio. The current owners of Presscraft Papers raised funds and replaced a section of the roof structure that was in need of repairs. An award-winning picture book biography about Frostic entitled ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs Friend: The Gwen Frostic Story‚Äù by Lindsey McDivitt was published by Sleeping Bear Press in 2018. It was named a 2019 Michigan Notable Book by the Library of Michigan. Awards Frostic was granted several honorary doctorates from Alma College, Eastern Michigan University, Western Michigan University, Michigan State University, and Ferris State University. In 1978, Governor William Milliken declared May 23 as Gwen Frostic Day in Michigan. In 1986 she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame. The Michigan Reading Association presents the Gwen Frostic Award to notable authors and illustrators who have impacted fostering literacy. In 1998, the Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Parkin Grand Rapids, Michigan named an area of the park, with many indigenous plants and animals, the Gwen Frostic Woodland Shade Garden in her honor. The Gwen Frostic Woodland Shade Garden at the Meijer Sculpture Park, 2014 The Gwen Frostic School of Art at Western Michigan University was named in her honor in 2007, after her $13 million bequest to the University in 2001, the largest single gift in the school's history. While given as an unrestricted bequest, the funds have primarily been used for scholarships for students, and for the benefit of the arts and creative writing departments in particular, in respect of her lifelong pursuits.

The stage is successively spun, fired, yo- yo de-spun and jettisoned. A yo-yo de-spin mechanism is a device used to reduce the spin of satellites, typically soon after launch. It consists of two lengths of cable with weights on the ends. The cables are wrapped around the final stage and/or satellite, in the manner of a double yo-yo. When the weights are released, the spin of the rocket flings them away from the spin axis. This transfers enough angular momentum to the weights to reduce the spin of the satellite to the desired value. Subsequently, the weights are often released. De-spin is needed since some final stages are spin-stabilized, and require fairly rapid rotation (around 50 rpm. Some, such as Pioneer, rotated at over 600 rpm) to remain stable during firing. (See, for example, the Star 48, a solid fuel rocket motor.) After firing, the satellite cannot be simply released, since such a spin rate is beyond the capability of the satellite's attitude control. Therefore, after rocket firing but before satellite release, the yo-yo weights are used to reduce the spin rates to something the satellite can endure (often 2-5 RPM). Yo-yo de-spin systems are commonly used on NASA sub-orbital sounding rocket flights, as the vehicles are spin stabilized through ascent and have minimal flight time for roll cancellation using the payload's attitude control system. As an example of yo-yo de-spin, on the Dawn Mission, roughly 3 kg of weights, and 12 meter cables, reduced the initial spin rate of the 1420 kg spacecraft from 46 RPM to 3 RPM in the opposite direction.Dawn Journal, 12 September 2007 The relatively small weights have a large effect since they are far from the spin axis, and their effect increases as the square of the length of the cables. Yo-yo de-spin was invented, built, and tested at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Pilkington, W. C., Jr., McDonald, W. S., and Wells, W. H., Satellite Spin Control, April 1962 Yo-yo hardware can contribute to the space debris problem on orbital missions, but this is not a problem when used on the upper stages of earth escape missions such as Dawn, as the cables and weights are also on an escape trajectory. \\"Yo-weight\\" Sometimes only a single weight and cable is used. Such an arrangement is colloquially named a \\"yo-weight.\\" When the final stage is a solid rocket, the stage may continue to thrust slightly even after spacecraft release. This is from residual fuel and insulation in the motor casing outgassing, even without significant combustion. In a few cases, the spent stage has rammed the payload.Nobuaki Ishii, Separation Motion Analysis of Sounding Rockets using Unbalanced YoYo Mechanism, The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. From this article: 'In sounding rocket experiments and a final stage of satellite insertion, when the payload section or the satellite is separated from the lower motor, collision of the motor due to the residual thrust should be avoided. Conventionally, a tumble motor (small solid rocket propellant) or Yo tumbler is utilized for the collision avoidance.' By using one weight without a matching counterpart, the stage eventually tumbles. The tumbling motion prevents residual thrust from accumulating in a single direction. Instead, the stage's exhaust averages out to a much lower value over a wide range of directions. In March 2009, a leftover yo-weight caused a scare when it came too close to the International Space Station.Space station crew has close call with space junk  See also  *Attitude dynamics and control *Space debris  References  Cornille, H.
