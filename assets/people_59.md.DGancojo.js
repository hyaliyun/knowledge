Automated inspection (AXI) is a technology based on the same principles as automated optical inspection (AOI). It uses as its source, instead of visible light, to automatically inspect features, which are typically hidden from view. Automated X-ray inspection is used in a wide range of industries and applications, predominantly with two major goals: # Process optimization, i.e. the results of the inspection are used to optimize following processing steps, # Anomaly detection, i.e. the result of the inspection serve as a criterion to reject a part (for scrap or re-work). Whilst AOI is mainly associated with electronics manufacturing (due to widespread use in PCB manufacturing), AXI has a much wider range of applications. It ranges from the quality check of alloy wheels\\"Automated Radioscopic Inspection of Aluminum Die Castings\\", Domingo Mery, Departamento de Ciencia de la Computaci√≥n Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile Av.

Wherever large numbers of very similar items are produced according to a defined standard, automatic inspection using advanced image processing and pattern recognition software (Computer vision) has become a useful tool to ensure quality and improve yield in processing and manufacturing.  Principle of Operation  While optical inspection produces full color images of the surface of the object, x-ray inspection transmits x-rays through the object and records gray scale images of the shadows cast. The image is then processed by image processing software that detects the position and size/ shape of expected features (for process optimization) or presence/ absence of unexpected/ unintended objects or features (for anomaly detection). X-rays are generated by an x-ray tube, usually located directly above or below the object under inspection. A detector located the opposite side of the object records an image of the x-rays transmitted through the object. The detector either converts the x-rays first into visible light which is imaged by an optical camera, or detects directly using an x-ray sensor array. The object under inspection may be imaged at higher magnification by moving the object closer to the x-ray tube, or at lower magnification closer to the detector. Since the image is produced due to the different absorption of x-rays when passing through the object, it can reveal structures inside the object that are hidden from outside view.  Applications  With the advancement of image processing software the number applications for automated x-ray inspection is huge and constantly growing. The first applications started off in industries where the safety aspect of components demanded a careful inspection of each part produced (e.g. welding seams for metal parts in nuclear power stations) because the technology was expectedly very expensive in the beginning. But with wider adoption of the technology, prices came down significantly and opened automated x-ray inspection up to a much wider field- partially fueled again by safety aspects (e.g. detection of metal, glass or other materials in processed food) or to increase yield and optimize processing (e.g. detection of size and location of holes in cheese to optimize slicing patterns). In mass production of complex items (e.g. in electronics manufacturing), an early detection of defects can drastically reduce overall cost, because it prevents defective parts from being used in subsequent manufacturing steps. This results in three major benefits: a) it provides feedback at the earliest possible state that materials are defective or process parameters got out of control, b) it prevents adding value to components that are already defective and therefore reduces the overall cost of a defect, and c) it increases the likelihood of field defects of the final product, because the defect may not be detected at later stages in quality inspection or during functional testing due to the limited set of test patterns.  Use of AXI in the Food Industry  Foreign body detection, fill level control, and process control are the three main areas for the use of AXI in the food industry. Especially in packaged goods at the end of the filling and packaging line the use of X-ray scanners has become the norm, rather than the exception. It is often used in combination with other QA measures, especially inline check weighers. Most of it is limited to a good/ bad check, i.e. it produces rejects after the AXI station, but in some applications it is directly used for process control where the data from the AXI are fed to the process and can control other variables. An often cited example is the control of the thickness of cheese slices after an AXI determined the distribution and position of 'holes' inside the cheese block. (to ensure consistent total package weight). Recently, automated methods have been developed for X-ray inspection of food passing by on a conveyor belt.  Use of AXI in electronics manufacturing  The increasing usage of ICs (integrated circuits) with packages such as BGAs (ball grid array) where the connections are underneath the chip and not visible, means that ordinary optical inspection is impossible. Because the connections are underneath the chip package there is a greater need to ensure that the manufacturing process is able to accommodate these chips correctly. Additionally the chips that use BGA packages tend to be the larger ones with many connections. Therefore, it is essential that all the connections are made correctly.X-Ray Inspection for PCB and BGA AXI is often paired with the testing provided by boundary scan test, in-circuit test, and functional test.  Process  As BGA connections are not visible the only alternative is to use a low level inspection. AXI is able to find faults such as opens, shorts, insufficient solder, excessive solder, missing electrical parts, and mis-aligned components. Defects are detected and repaired within short debug time. These inspection systems are more costly than ordinary optical systems, but they are able to check all the connections, even those underneath the chip package.

Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. London W. Bowyer and J. Nichols, 1774; ‚Äî. Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Vol. 2. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1775; ‚Äî. Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1777. There are several different editions of these volumes, each important. Airs While working as a companion for Lord Shelburne, Priestley had a great deal of free time to engage in scientific investigations. The Earl even set up a laboratory for him. Priestley's experiments during his years in Calne were almost entirely confined to \\"airs\\" and from this work emerged his most important scientific texts: the six volumes of Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.See Gibbs 67‚Äì83 for a description of all of his experiments during this time; Thorpe, 170ff. These experiments helped repudiate the last vestiges of the theory of four elements; as one early biographer writes: \\"taken collectively, [Priestley] did more than those of any one of his contemporaries to uproot and destroy the only generalisation by which his immediate predecessors had sought to group and connect the phenomena of chemistry\\", however \\"he was wholly unable to perceive this fact.\\"Thorpe, 167‚Äì68. Priestley's work on \\"airs\\" is not easily classified. As historian of science Simon Schaffer points out, it \\"has been seen as a branch of physics, or chemistry, or natural philosopholy poption.\\"Schaffer, 152. Also, the volumes were both a scientific and a political enterprise for Priestley; he argued in them that science could destroy \\"undue and usurped authority,\\" writing that the government has \\"reason to tremble even at an air pump or an electrical machine.\\"Qtd. in Kramnick, 11‚Äì12; see also Schofield, Vol. 2, 121‚Äì124. Pneumatic trough, glass collecting cylinders and other equipment used by Priestley in his experiments on gases. The right-hand cylinder exhibits a sprig of mint which showed that plants generated oxygen from carbon dioxide Priestley's first volume of Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air outlined several important discoveries: experiments that would eventually lead to the discovery of photosynthesis and the discovery of several airs: \\"nitrous air\\" (nitric oxide, NO), \\"vapor of spirit of salt\\" (later called \\"acid air\\" or \\"marine acid air\\"; anhydrous hydrochloric acid, HCl), \\"alkaline air\\" (ammonia, NH3), \\"diminished\\" or \\"dephlogisticated nitrous air\\" (nitrous oxide, N2O), and \\"dephlogisticated air\\" (oxygen, O2). Priestley also developed the \\"nitrous air test\\", which tested for the \\"goodness of air\\": using a \\"pneumatic trough\\", he would mix nitrous air with a test sample, over water or mercury, and measure the decrease in volume‚Äîthe principle of eudiometry.Fruton, 20; 29 After a small history of the study of airs, he explained his own experiments in an open and sincere style: \\"whatever he knows or thinks he tells: doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the most refreshing candour.\\"Schofield, Vol. 2, 98; quotation from Thorpe, 171. He also invented and described cheap and easy-to-assemble experimental apparatus. His colleagues therefore believed that they could easily reproduce Priestley's experiments to verify them or to answer the questions that had puzzled him.Schofield, Vol. 1, 259‚Äì69; Jackson, 110‚Äì14; Thorpe, 76‚Äì77; 178‚Äì79; Uglow, 229‚Äì39. Although many of his results puzzled him, Priestley used phlogiston theory to resolve the difficulties. This theory, however, led him to conclude that there were only three types of \\"air\\": \\"fixed\\", \\"alkaline\\", and \\"acid\\". Priestley ignored the burgeoning chemistry of his day, indeed dismissing it in these volumes. Instead, he focused on gases and the \\"changes in their sensible properties\\", as had natural philosophers before him. He isolated carbon monoxide (CO) but seems not to have realised that it was a separate \\"air\\" from the others that he had discovered.Schofield, Vol. 2, 103; 93‚Äì105; Uglow, 240‚Äì41; see Gibbs 105‚Äì116 for a description of these experiments. Discovery of oxygen After the publication of the first volume of Experiments and Observations, Priestley undertook another set of experiments. In August 1774 he isolated an \\"air\\" that appeared to be completely new, but he did not have an opportunity to pursue the matter because he was about to tour Europe with Shelburne. While in Paris, however, Priestley managed to replicate the experiment for others, including Antoine Lavoisier. After returning to Britain in January 1775, he continued his experiments and discovered vitriolic acid air (sulphur dioxide, SO2). In March he wrote to several people regarding the new \\"air\\" that he had discovered several months earlier. One of these letters was read aloud to the Royal Society, and he published a paper in Philosophical Transactions titled \\"An Account of further Discoveries in Air.\\" Priestley called the new substance \\"dephlogisticated air\\" and described it as \\"five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air.\\"Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 2, 107. He had discovered oxygen gas (O2). As revised for Experiments and Observations, his paper begins: > The contents of this section will furnish a very striking illustration of > the truth of a remark which I have more than once made in my [natural] > philosophical writings ‚Ä¶ that more is owing to what we call chance‚Äîthat is, > philosophically speaking, to the observations of events rising from unknown > causes than to any proper design or preconceived theory in this business. ‚Ä¶ > For my own part, I will frankly acknowledge that at the commencement of my > experiments recited in this section I was so far from having formed any > hypothesis that led to the discoveries I made in pursuing them that they > would have appeared very improbable to me had I been told of them; and when > the decisive facts did at length obtrude themselves upon my notice it was > very slowly, and with great hesitation, that I yielded to the evidence of my > senses. [emphasis Priestley's]Qtd. in Thorpe, 192. Priestley assembled his oxygen paper and several others into a second volume of Experiments and Observations on Air and published it in 1776. He does not emphasise his discovery of \\"dephlogisticated air\\" (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argues in the preface how important such discoveries are to rational religion. His paper narrates the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements. Thus, it is difficult to determine when exactly Priestley \\"discovered\\" oxygen.Schofield, Vol. 2, 105‚Äì119; see also Jackson, 126‚Äì27; 163‚Äì64; 166‚Äì174; Gibbs, 118‚Äì123; Uglow, 229‚Äì231; 241. Such dating is significant as Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele both have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been first to describe it as purified \\"air itself entire without alteration\\" (not \\"dephlogisticated air\\").Kuhn, 53‚Äì55.

D. Imagiste. \\"Oread\\", one of her earliest and best-known poems, which was first published in the founding issue of BLAST on 20 June 1914, serves to illustrate this early style well.Ezra Pound, 'Vortex', BLAST, no. 1 (20 June 1914), pp. 153-4, p. 154 The title Oread (cf. Oread) was added after the poem was first written, to suggest that a nymph was ordering up the sea.  Text  :Whirl up, sea-- :Whirl your pointed pines, :Splash your great pines :On our rocks, :Hurl your green over us-- :Cover us with your pools of fir.  \\"Oread\\" as Imagist Poem  \\"Oread\\" may serve to illustrate some prominent features of Imagist poetry. Rejecting the rhetorics of Late Romanticism and Victorianism, the Imagists aimed at a renewal of language through extreme reduction. This reduction is what Ezra Pound had in mind, when he wrote, counseling future poets: \\"use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something\\". In this poem, the reduction is brought to such an extreme that two images are superimposed on each other, depriving the reader of the possibility to determine, which is the \\"primary\\" one. The two image domains relevant here are the sea and the forest. The Oread, apparently the speaker of the poem, expresses her wish that the sea unite with the land. But while from the first line it seems clear that the sea is addressed, the second line counters this impression with the \\"pointed pines\\" of a forest. The anaphoric link between the first two lines and the use of epistrophe in the second and third lines enhance the connection between the two domains and much the same might be said about the expression \\"pools of fir\\" in the last line. Another way of putting this is to grasp the poem as one single metaphor. A metaphor usually consists of three elements: the \\"tenor\\" (target), a \\"vehicle\\" (source) and the \\"tertium comparationis\\" (some common ground that exists between target and source domain). Here, however, it is not possible to identify target and source beyond individual words. Both forest and sea might represent each of these two elements, and the green color of either forest and sea might be one plausible \\"tertium comparationis\\" for the metaphor. In fusing the images of forest and sea in such a way, the poem seems to accomplish the speaker's wish of unison between sea and land. In doing so, it is however in danger of abolishing the specificity of each of them. Neither is the sea a forest, nor the other way around, as metaphor would seem to suggest. While presenting a forceful image, in the sense of Pound's definition (\\"an ‚ÄúImage‚Äù is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time\\" ), the poem seems to be shrewdly aware that linguistic representation will always distort and refract its referent.

The young couple had spent a normal Saturday night drinking beer and listening to heavy metal music at Midnight Pub, which was the center of the city's metal scene, but never returned home. Both Tollis and Marino were stabbed to death by their friends Andrea Volpe, Nicola Sapone and Mario Maccione. Fabio Tollis, a sturdy young man (6 feet and 2 inches tall, 220 pounds) desperately tried to defend himself and his girlfriend Marino but was overpowered by the larger group. Maccione, Sapone and Volpe later buried the corpses in a large grave in the woods and danced on the graves, laughing and screaming \\"Now you're both zombies! Try to get out of this hole, if you dare!\\". The conclusion initially drawn by the authorities at the time was that they had run away together for a love affair, as their friend suggested, but this explanation was not accepted by Tollis' father, Michele Tollis, who began his own investigation. Just a few hours before the murder, Nicola Sapone forced Fabio Tollis to call home and tell his father he did not intend to come back home that evening because he preferred sleeping with his girlfriend. Michele Tollis, realizing something was not right with the call he received, immediately reached back out to his son at the Midnight to have a word with him. Unfortunately, it was too late: Fabio and Chiara had already left with their presumed friend for Somma Lombardo and never came back again. Michele Tollis discovered just how deeply they had become involved in satanism and the occult, both common themes of the black metal and death metal genres that his son and friends were interested in. Becoming convinced of a connection between satanism and their disappearance, Michele Tollis spent the next six years steadily constructing a file on their activities and the bands in which they had played. When the third murder occurred, Tollis took his findings to the police, who used them to link all three murders to Andrea Volpe and the wider satanic sect. Third murder and revelations The third murder was committed in January 2004. Mariangela Pezzotta, 27-year-old shop assistant, prior girlfriend of group member Andrea Volpe was first shot in the throat, mutilated and later buried while she was still alive in a greenhouse in the nearby town of Golasecca not far from Somma Lombardo. Andrea Volpe was arrested shortly after with his young fianc√©e, an 18-year-old high school student named Elisabetta Ballarin, the daughter of an upper-class family who had run away from home with Volpe when she was just a teenager. Both Volpe and Ballarin were upset because of alcohol and drug addiction. Volpe confessed he invited Pezzotta for a friendly dinner but had already decided to kill her because she knew too many details about the sect and Tollis and Marino's murder. Volpe shot her after a violent fight, then rang Sapone up for help and they realized that, though in agony, Pezzotta was still alive. Volpe recalled that Sapone accused him \\"You can't even kill a person!\\" and threatened him; they tried hard to hide the dying girl's body in the greenhouse of Ballarin's parents' home and hit her several times with a heavy spade before burying her still alive. After that, Sapone came back home and pretended nothing had happened. Hours later Volpe and Ballarin took a heavy dose of cocaine and heroin and decided to get rid of Pezzotta's car by driving it into a nearby river but they had a car crash and were arrested. After the Pezzotta murder, Volpe was arrested and confessed to the earlier killings, leading police to the bodies of Tollis and Marino. Police investigation used the information previously provided which revealed for the first time the sect's existence. As the investigation continued, Mario Maccione, who presented himself as \\"the medium\\" of the group and had been regarded by Tollis as his best friend, confessed to having beaten Fabio to death with a hammer, after Volpe and Sapone had stabbed him and Chiara Marino. Additionally sect members were accused of pushing their drummer, Andrea Bontade, to commit suicide because he refused to join Volpe and Sapone at Somma Lombardo and help them kill Marino and Tollis. In September 1998, Andrea Bontade drank heavily, then killed himself by crashing his car. Authorities also investigated whether the group had any links to a possible wider network of Satanists in Italy. Other alleged murders Involvement of the \\"Beasts of Satan\\" has been suspected for up to fourteen other unsolved cases in the same area and timeframe, including alleged suicides, disappearances and violent deaths of people allegedly tied to members of the group.http://www.repubblica.it/2007/05/sezioni/cronaca/bestie-satana/la- storia/la- storia.htmlhttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/articoli/articolo418779.shtmlhttps://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2004/07_Luglio/15/satanisti.shtmlhttp://www.ilgiornale.it/news/quattro- omicidi-abbiamo- ucciso-18-persone.htmlhttps://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/06/22/bestie- di-satana-diciotto-gli-omicidi.htmlhttps://www.varesenews.it/2008/04/bestie- di-satana-ritrovata-una-sacca-con-effetti-personali-di-christian- frigerio/217750/https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/06/07/quella- scia-di-follia-di-sangue- da.htmlhttps://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/05/24/alberto- bruciato-18-anni.htmlhttps://www.ilgiorno.it/legnano/cronaca/2013/11/24/986929-luca- colombo-bestie-satana.shtml Among these: * 23-year-old construction worker Christian Frigerio, from Brugherio, allegedly a former member of the group, who disappeared on 14 November 1996; * 20-year-old Stefano Longone, from Somma Lombardo, a friend of Volpe, run over by a vehicle while cycling on 19 May 1998; * 21-year-old Andrea Ballarin, a childhood friend of Volpe, found hanged in the school he had attended on 7 May 1999; * 28-year-old Angelo Lombardo, caretaker of the cemetery of Legnano and an acquaintance of some members of the group, burned alive in the cemetery on 14 December 1999; * 26-year-old Doriano Molla, found hanged in the woods near Cavaria con Premezzo on 27 December 2000; * 21-year-old Luca Colombo, a flower seller and friend of Nicola Sapone, found hanged in Legnano on 5 May 2004; * 18-year-old carpenter Alberto Scaramuzzino, from Dairago, found burned in his car in the woods near Arconate on 23 May 2004. Involvement of the group's members in these cases, however, has never been proven. Mario Maccione accused other group members (Sapone, Volpe, Leoni, Zampollo and Monterosso) of being responsible of these crimes, but these accusations have been denied by them and have never been proven.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/AttiMonza.pdfhttps://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/07/14/bestie- di-satana-sesta-vittima-sospetta- si.html?refresh_cehttps://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2004/06_Giugno/12/satanisti.shtml Trials On February 22, 2005 Andrea Volpe and Pietro Guerrieri were sentenced in the northern city of Busto Arsizio to 30 and 16 years imprisonment respectively. Volpe, in addition to the 1998 murders, was also found guilty of the 2004 slaying of Pezzotta. In Volpe's case the sentence was a decade longer than requested by prosecutors. A third suspect, Mario Maccione, had also confessed to the murders, but was cleared due to his secondary role in the crimes. The reactions of the victims' families to the sentencing were mixed. Michele Tollis, the father of Fabio, said \\"Today justice rewarded me.\\" Lina Marino, mother of the slain Chiara, was outraged at the relatively light sentences Volpe and Guerrieri had received, due to their cooperation with prosecutors. She stated \\"They are murderers. It's not fair.\\"Italian 'Beasts of Satan' jailed BBC News February 22, 2005 Five more members of the group went to trial in June 2005 and were sentenced to long prison terms in early 2006. Nicola Sapone, leader of the group and the suspected mastermind behind the killings, received a life sentence. The other four - Paolo Leoni, Marco Zampollo, Eros Monterosso and Elisabetta Ballarin - were sentenced to between 24 and 26 years for their roles in all three murders.Italy jails five Satanic killers BBC News February 1st, 2006 On 2007 the Court of Appeal confirmed the life sentence for Sapone and lengthened the convictions of three other members of the group: Paolo Leoni's 26 years became a life sentence, Marco Zampollo went from 26 years to 29 years and 2 months, and Eros Monterosso was increased from 24 years to 27 years and 3 months (the same increase as Zampollo). Elisabetta Ballarin's sentence was reduced from 24 years and 3 months to 23 years. On May 2008 the final court, Court of Cassazione, confirmed all the Appeal's decisions. Reaction The crimes occurred against a background of growing concern in Italy that Satanism and the occult were becoming increasingly attractive to Italian youth. In February 2005, a Roman Catholic university connected to the Vatican began offering a two-month course on diabolical possession and exorcism for priests and seminarians. In reaction to the crimes, priest Don Aldo Buonaito called for death metal to be banned, saying \\"If music makes itself an instrument of nefarious deeds and death, it should be stopped.\\" In light of revelations from the Beasts of Satan investigation and trial, as well as growing public concern, Italian police stated their intention to create a special unit focusing on new religious sects, particularly Satanists and other violent ritualistic groups. It would coordinate nationwide investigations into potentially dangerous new religious movements, and planned to include psychologists and a priest who is an expert on the occult.Italy police seek 'Satan squad' Mark Duff BBC News December 11, 2006 During the annual National Carabinieri Day celebrated in Verese on 8 June 2005, the first instance public prosecutors Antonio Pizzi e Tiziano Masini as well as the police officials Enzo Molinari, Quaranta Attilio, Giuseppe Notaro and Paul Marcolli were awarded by the head of the Italia Arma dei Carabinieri's body for the investigations on the Beast of Satan's murderers.

Jules Joubert proposed importing the goods from the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1878 as a basis of the exhibition. On December 31, 1878, the Royal Commission for the Sydney International Exhibition was established headed by Lord Augustus Loftus. Architecture The International Exhibition Building, Sydney. 1879 A site of 35 acres on the high ground of the Inner Domain along Macquarie Street was chosen for the exhibition. James Johnston Barnet designed a massive building called the Garden Palace. The nave of the building measured 800 x 60 feet and the transept ran for 500 feet. A large dome 100 feet in diameter rose 90 feet above the building. The builder, John Young, finished the building in just eight months at a cost of ¬£191,800. International response grew so rapidly that in June 1879, construction began on two large machinery halls and an art gallery. International Participation The Victorian Court The New South Wales Court & New Zealand Court There were 23 nations represented at the Exhibition. Africa: Cape Colony; America: Canada, United States; Asia: Ceylon, India, Japan, Malaya, Singapore, Straits Settlement; Europe: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland; Oceania: Fiji, New Caledonia, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria. There were 9,345 exhibitors providing about 14,000 exhibits. After being granted self-governance during the 1850s the Australian colonies, Victoria and New South Wales, saw a steady economic growth as result of the discovery and exploitation of gold reserves. After 20 years proposals were made for organizing an exhibition modelled on the great exhibitions of Europe, with an aim to promote commerce and industry, along with art, science and education. In 1879 Melbourne filed a plan to the Parliament. However, Sydney wanted to be the first and managed to organize an exhibition in record time. The Sydney International Exhibition opened in the autumn of 1879, but it wasn't really universal and therefore not officially recognized by the Bureau of International Expositions. Melbourne decided to start their exhibition shortly after the one in Sydney, so the participants could transport their exhibits during the winter of 1880. After the exhibitions many of the exhibits were selected to be at display in the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum (now the Powerhouse Museum). The Garden Palace itself was used by the government until a fire destroyed the building on September 22, 1882.

Paul v. Clinton was a civil lawsuit filed by Peter F. Paul, the plaintiff, against the defendants, former President Bill Clinton, and his wife, former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clintons were accused of alleged swindling of Paul's money and interference in his business dealings on June 19, 2001 in Los Angeles. James Levin, a Democratic Party fundraiser close to the Mr. Clinton and a Chicago business man, as well as two producers of the star-studded fundraiser, Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton, Aaron Tonken, a protege of Paul, and Gary Smith, were also named defendants in the suit. Paul alleged that he spent more than $1.9 million of his own personal funds to organize and sponsor the event held on August 12, 2000. The fundraiser was held on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, during Hillary Clinton's first Senate race. The fundraiser attracted many stars, such as Cher, Brad Pitt, John Travolta, Diana Ross, Muhammad Ali and many others. He claimed that the reason he financed the fundraiser and other events for Hillary Clinton was that her husband allegedly agreed to join the board of the company Paul co-founded with Stan Lee, Stan Lee Media, after he left the Oval Office in January 2001. However, Paul said that these promises were never fulfilled. Although he contended the event cost close to $2 million, the campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission at the time estimated at about $500,000.  Background  Peter Paul helped organize the Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton fundraiser for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's 2000 New York Senate campaign, which raised more than $1 million for her campaign. In addition to Paul's promise to help with her campaign, court filings state that in return for working for one year at Stan Lee Media, he offered Mr. Clinton $10 million in SLM stock, $5 million in cash and $1 million for the Clinton Library. Two days after the dinner and concert, a columnist at the Washington Post, Lloyd Grove, reported about Paul's felony record, revealing that he had three separate criminal convictions on fraud and drug charges from the 1970s and 1980s at the time. In the late 1970s, Paul was convicted of cocaine possession with intentions to distribute and of attempting to defraud Fidel Castro's Cuban Government of $8.75 million by selling it a non-existent shipload of coffee beans. Paul was sentenced to approximately 40 months in prison. In the 1980s, he violated his terms of parole by lying to a Customs officer, which resulted in him serving time again. When Paul was arrested for all of these crimes, he claimed that he was part of a secret government operation. Since Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's spokesperson, said that her campaign would not accept any contributions from Paul, they returned the $2000 check they directly received from him and his wife, but ignored Paul's alleged $1.9 million contribution. Following the collapse and declaration of bankruptcy of Stan Lee Media in early February 2001, Paul departed for Brazil to avoid prosecution of stock fraud charges, more specifically he manipulated the price of the Stan Lee Media's stock price. He was indicted with criminal charges and spent more than two years in a Brazilian prison, before being extradited back to the United States.  2005-2009 = The Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton  In late 2005, one of Hillary Clinton's fundraising committees agreed to pay a $35,000 fine for underreporting gifts spent on the Hollywood gala by $721,895 to boost her campaign for the Senate. Even though the committee had corrected its filings, Paul continuously said that the campaign was still refusing to acknowledge his alleged near $2 million contribution.  Senator Clinton Dropped from Lawsuit  California's Second District Court of Appeal On April 10, 2006 at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Judge Aurelio Munoz dismissed Senator Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the Paul v. Clinton lawsuit. Judge Munoz Brough criticized Peter Paul's legal team for \\"inundat[ing] this court\\" with photos of Paul with the Clintons, President Ronald Reaganand his wife, Nancy, and others, which provided no evidence that the Clintons made any promises to him. The judge stated, \\"there is nothing to indicate Hillary Clinton was aware that the promises were not made in good faith.\\" She sought out dismissal under a California law aimed at reducing lawsuits and protecting people's First Amendment rights. Before Hillary was dismissed, the attorneys representing Paul, the United States Justice Foundation, asked that they have permission to take her deposition, but Judge Munoz declined. Although Senator Clinton was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit continued with Bill Clinton, James Levin, Aaron Tonken and Gary Smith as defendants, and their trial date was set for March 27, 2007. Later, Peter Paul then filed an appeal of the decision. Two hearings were held on September 7, 2007, and October 16, 2007, where California's Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion to reinstate Senator Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the lawsuit that claims she, her husband and other associates swindled money from Paul to fund the 2000 fundraising event. The appellate court upheld the lower court's, Los Angeles County Superior Court, decision to remove the New York senator and Democratic presidential candidate, while it also said that Clinton would be able to regain her legal costs. After the ruling, Paul said he would consider a further appeal to the Supreme Court of California. Most, but not all of the causes of action against President Clinton had been dismissed on procedural grounds. Paul's attorneys, mainly Colette Wilson, pleaded that Clinton violated federal code, which would in turn make her not covered the anti-SLAPP statute. A lawyer of Paul, Lucianne Goldberg, then released a video claiming that Clinton was aware of Paul's illegal campaign activities. However, the evidence he provided did not make his statement clear at all. It only showed Hillary Clinton thanking the fundraiser organizers, without proving anything on Clinton's knowledge of Paul's alleged actions. In early March 2005, Paul pleaded guilty to one felony of stock fraud. Four years later on June 25, 2009, Judge Leonard Wexler sentenced him to ten years in prison. This was said to have pretty much been the end to the story, mainly because the Washington Post had then become aware that Peter Paul was a three- time convicted felon, making his appeals less interesting. As of early 2009, Hillary and Bill Clinton have both been dismissed from the case, Paul v. Clinton, as defendants, and she won an award of $130,000 in legal fees against Paul. The civil suit was still on-going against Gary Smith, a producer of the 2000 fundraiser.

The band often played at Elitch Gardens and once opened for Benny Goodman there. The band had twelve players. During the 1950s, bookings for the orchestra were handled by the Omaha office of National Orchestra Service. At Danceland and at the Pagosa Springs Lions Club, the band was billed \\"Verne Byers and His CBS Orchestra ‚Äì The Most Danceable Band in the Land\\".Advertisement, Iowa City Press Citizen, p. 8, Col 5, April 22, 1955Pagosa Sun, Aug 29, 1952, Pagosa Springs, Colorado Byers worked with Ted Fio Rito for a year and then toured with Herb Miller, Glenn's brother.

The Commando Corps was formed from existing Infantry battalions. The program was established in early 2007 with the intent of taking one conventional infantry kandak (battalion) from each of the regional ANA corps, giving them special training and equipment, and reorganizing based on the United States Army Rangers. Each battalion is assigned to one of the six regional corps. The commandos comprise 7% of the Afghan National Security Forces but conduct 70% to 80% of the fighting. In August 2017, General John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of the Resolute Support Mission, said: \\"The [commandos] have never lost a battle...The Taliban have never won against the commandos...They never will.\\" Selection and training The training is conducted at the Morehead Commando Training Center, a former Taliban training compound located six miles south of Kabul, Afghanistan. The training center is named after United States Army 5th Special Forces Group soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Morehead, who was killed in Iraq in September 2003.US Department of Defense, Gates Visits New Afghan Commando Training Site The training of supply, logistics and operations has been conducted by mentors from Combined Security Transition Command- Afghanistan, United States Special Operations Forces, French Special Forces, and ANA Commando cadre.USA Today, France to withdraw 200 special forces from AfghanistanMilitary Photos, Afghan Special Force The 12-week program has three concurrent training sections for the entire course. The primary and bulk of the training is geared for the infantry toli (company) with a focus on individual skills and small unit tactics. To support the line companies, the Headquarters and Headquarters Toli receives special training in specific skills such as mortars, medical care, and communications. The third section focuses on the kandak staff, their core areas of responsibility and function as the Command and Control (C2). Upon graduation, each Commando Kandak returns to its designated Corps area along with an embedded U.S. Army Special Forces A-Team and begins using an 18-week training cycle that breaks down to six weeks each of train-up, missions and recovery. Of the five active duty United States Special Forces Groups, 3rd Group and 7th Group have been rotating responsibility as the main effort for continued training and advising in the Afghanistan theater. The future ISAF reports that while the original plan was for one Brigade with six Kandaks (Battalions), the ANA wanted a full division with three Brigades and 15 Kandaks. As of April 2012, the reported strength of the ANA Commandos was 8,500 men organized into 8 kandaks, as well as one group of 500 Special Operations troops. In August 2017, the New York Times reported that the strength of the Afghan Commandos was 21,000, with an increase to 30,000 as a goal.

In the exercise, the commandos successfully discovered and apprehended a person of interest, recovered weapons and intelligence.\\" In March 2013, U.S. special operations forces handed over their strategic base in Wardak Province to local Afghan commandos. Afghan commandos gradually began taking over the lead from NATO forces the fight against insurgents. In April 2013, Afghan commandos killed 22 insurgents in Nangarhar Province and captured another 10 insurgents. On September 20, 2014, local officials in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan reported that Taliban insurgents from different regions of the country led by camouflaged men wearing black masks and captured several villages, set at least 60 homes on fire, killed more than 100 people and beheaded fifteen family members of local police officers. The masked insurgents reportedly carried the black flag of ISIL, openly called themselves soldiers of Daesh, and did not speak any local languages. Deputy Police Chief General Asadullah Ensafi reported that Taliban ambushes stopped reinforcements from the Afghan National Army and provincial police from reaching the area. Afghan commandos inserted by helicopter were able to reinforce units already defending the area and Ensafi reported that the \\"immediate threat to district's center had been nullified.\\" For further information see 2014 ISIL beheading incidents.

Astronomical knowledge in India reached an early peak in the 5th century CE, with the ƒÄryabha·π≠ƒ´ya. Its author, Aryabhata, uses astronomical calculations to determine the date of the Battle of Kurukshetra as 18 February 3102 BCE. This date has become traditional and is still widely cited in Hindu literature. Modern authors attempted to date the Vedic period based on archaeoastronomical calculations. In the 18th century William Jones who tried to show, based on information gathered from Varaha Mihira, that Parashara muni lived at 1181 BCE.Bryant 2001:251 Hermann Jacobi has argued that in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda the sun was in Phalguni, and in the Sankhayana and Gobhila Grhyasutra the Full moon was in Bhadrapada during the summer solstice, which would have occurred at 4500-2500 BCE.Bryant 2001:254; Jacobi 1909 Jacobi and Tilak have both noted that the names of the nak·π£atras: M≈´la (root), Vi≈õ·πõtau (two dividers) and Jye·π£·π≠ha (oldest) suggest that these names originated from a time when Mula marked the beginning of the year, i.e. about 4500-2500 BCE.Bryant 2001:255 Tilak has also noted that the two week long pitrs period after the full moon in Bhadrapada occurred at the beginning of the pitryana, which would have been true at about 4500-2500 BCE.  Samhitas  In RV 5.40.5-9, a solar eclipse is referred to: Surya is obscured by an Asura called Svarbhanu (\\"self-luminous\\"), but recovered by the Atris. \\"The One\\" referred to in the Nasadiya Sukta and other hymns has been suggested to have originally referred to the axis mundi, and \\"The One who dwells beyond the seven sages\\" as the polar star, at the time referring to Thuban (Œ± Draconis).Bjorn Merker, Rig Veda Riddles In Nomad Perspective , Mongolian Studies, Journal of the Mongolian Society XI, 1988.

In the Maitrayana Brahmana Upanishad (6.14), the year is said to be into two portions, with the part from Magha to half of ≈öravi·π£·π≠ha associated with Agni, and the part from SƒÅrpa to half of ≈öravi·π£·π≠ha associated with Varuna and Saumya (the moon). Aiyar has arguedparaphrased and cited by Bryant 2001:257-8 that Agni suggests the warm half and similarly Varuna the cool half of the year, suggesting the summer solstice at the beginning of MaghƒÅ and thus implying the vernal equinox in K·πõttikƒÅ.

Down You Go is one of only six series ‚Äî along with The Arthur Murray Party, Pantomime Quiz, Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, The Ernie Kovacs Show, and The Original Amateur Hour ‚Äî shown on all four major television networks of the Golden Age of Television (ABC, NBC, CBS, and DuMont).Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (1964). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows (3rd ed.) p 1045. New York: Ballantine. . Gameplay Down You Go was similar to \\"Hangman\\", with a group of four celebrity panelists who were asked to guess a word or phrase submitted by a home viewer. The host would give a wordplay-laden clue to the panel, who could then ask a question of any sort about the phrase, for which the host would have to ad lib an answer. After two questions, the second panelist would begin calling out a letter. Guessing a letter in the puzzle kept the panelist alive; if the panelist guessed a letter not in the puzzle, they would be eliminated and would pull down a lever on their lectern replacing their name with the phrase \\"DOWN YOU GO.\\" Once two of the four panelists went down, the remaining panelists could ask another clue. At any time, a panelist could solve the puzzle and, if correct, end the game.McNeil, Alex (1980). Total Television (4th ed.). New York: Penguin Books. . The panel and host would then lightheartedly discuss the phrase for a minute or so before the next round began. Home viewers received a $5 wire transfer and an encyclopedia set valued at $25 if their puzzle was used on-air, plus an additional $50 bonus if the puzzle was sent in along with a boxtop from one of the show's presenting sponsors and an additional $5 for each panelist they eliminated.

Down You Go has been described as \\"one of the wittiest, most intelligent panel shows on television\\". The popular series was nominated for a \\"Best Audience Participation, Quiz, or Panel Program\\" Emmy in 1953. When the struggling DuMont network cancelled Down You Go along with most of its other series during the summer of 1955, rival network CBS briefly picked up the series for the summer. Host Bergen Evans and some of the panelists stayed for the new version, which aired from June 11 to September 3. After twelve days, Down You Go returned to network television, this time on ABC, where it aired until June 4, 1956. NBC picked up the program on June 16 and made Down You Go more comedy-oriented, with new host Bill Cullen and a regular celebrity panel of Jayne Mansfield, Jimmy Nelson, Hildy Parks, and Arthur Treacher. The series ended on September 8, 1956. British version The BBC aired their own version from January 1, 1953, to 1954.

Episode status One episode is known to exist. The panel for the episode was Francis Coughlin, Patricia Cutts, Jerome Weidman, and Laraine Day. The only indication of the date of the program was a brief and unusual promo advising viewers to tune in \\"on another network\\" to watch The Loretta Young Show the following night; as that show was only known by that name after 1954 and aired on Sunday nights, the promo sets this episode of Down You Go during the summer 1955 run on CBS, the only time the show ran on Saturdays. This episode is held by the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago, circulates among collectors, and is available for viewing at the Internet Archive (albeit mistakenly dated September 26, 1951). No episodes are known to have survived of the British version.

He spent the major part of his life with Moulana Amin Ahsan Islahi. He conveyed ideas and thoughts of his teacher and Imam Farhi to general public. He wrote a number of books and articles and delivered lectures on Islam, science and other subjects. By profession he was a chemical engineer but he spent his life in serving Farahi's school of thought. He worked as in charge of Idara Taddabur e Qur'an o Hadith. Early life Allama Khalid Masud was born in Lilla Town, Jhelum District, Pakistan. He belonged to a religious family having association with sufi school of thought, Naqshbandi Mujaddadi. But he and his father Saif U Rehman both were not under influence of sufism and they concentrated mainly towards Qur'an and Sharia. His father Saif U Rehman completed his education in 1926 from Oriental College Lahore where he learnt Arabic as major subject. He was a scholarly person. He kept his eldest son with him during his teaching services in schools of different cities. He played a major role in upbringing of his beloved child. Khalid Masud learnt basics of Arabic and Persian from his father Saif U Rehman who was an Arabic teacher at his time. Education and career He did his Master's degree in Chemistry from Punjab University, Lahore in 1958.A Silent Soldier calls it day In 1964 he went to London for higher studies. He obtained Chemical Engineering Diploma from King's College in 1965. He remained President of UK Islamic Mission there. He also got his Master's degree in Islamic Studies from Punjab University in 1975. He joined Industries Department, Govt of Punjab in 1958. He worked there for 27 years. In 1985 he was offered position of Research Scholar in Quaid e Azam Library, Bagh e Jinnah Lahore. He worked there till his retirement in 1996. There he found every opportunity to do his research work. During his student life (from 1956‚Äì1958), he remained In charge / Nazam of Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba Lahore. But after completion of his studies he did not join Jamiat's parent party Jamat-e-Islami and preferred to learn Qur'an and Hadith from Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi. Association with Maulana Islahi In 1958 Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi separated from politics and Jamat-e-Islami and created a Halqa Taddabur Qur'an O Hadith. Khalid Masud was one of his early pupils who joined his Halqa. He was his only pupil who spent so much time with from 1958 till his death. He associated himself with Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi and remained with him till his death. Khalid Masud did a major role in converting knowledge of his teacher from his lectures into text for the benefits of the public. He also helped him in writing his famous tafseer Taddabur e Qur'an. Maulana Islahi had admired a number of times his efforts in spreading Farahi's & Islahi's schools of thought. Maulana Islahi appointed him Nazam of his Idara Taddabur Qur'an o Hadith and chief editor of his quarterly journal Taddabur in 1981. He served his teacher and Idara for twenty two years till his death in 2003.Khalid Masud: Amin Ahsan Islahi's Intellectual Heir (1935‚Äì2003) After death of Maulana Islahi, management of Madras Ul Islah, Siray Mir Azam Garh UP India arranged Imam Farahi Seminar in January 1999 and especially invited Allama Khalid Masud in place of Maulana Islahi. He presented two papers there. They offered him chair of Imam Farahi for presiding the seminar. Books and magazines He wrote a number of books on Qur'an, Hadith, Grammar, Islam and Science for all ages. Qur'an * Qur'an e Hakim Abridged version of Maulana Islahi's Tadabbur-i-Qur'an in one volume.Compilation by Khalid Masood * Hikmat e Qur'an Based on Allama Hamiduddin Farahi's Arabic books.

Sirah * Hayat e Rasul e Ummi.Publications by Khalid Masood Hayat-e- Rasul-e-Ummi In this book he tried to discuss and to clear some issues related to life of Muhammad in the light of Qur'an with a different and non- traditional approach. In this book he adopted a different non-traditional approach. He put Quran as first source of history. Then he accepted those narrations which match the Quran's statement. He did not accept any narration which was in contradiction Quran. Moreover, he sorted out different narration on a very logical manner.  Imam Farahi's Work  \\"Most of Farahi‚Äôs work was in Arabic. Farahi‚Äôs chief scholarly interest was the Quran, the focal point of all his writings. Most of his published works are in the form of notes that were later compiled by his followers such Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi and Allama Khalid Masud.Founder of Madras ul Islah Below is some of the books which were compiled by both the personalities: * Mufradat al Quran (‚ÄùVocabulary of the Quran‚Äù) * Asalib al Quran (‚ÄùStyle of the Quran‚Äù) * Jamhara-tul-Balaghah (‚ÄùManual of Quranic Rhetoric‚Äù) * Im‚Äôan Fi Aqsam al-Qur‚Äôan (A Study of the Qur‚Äôanic Oaths) * ‚ÄòŸÅŸä ŸÖŸÜ ŸáŸà ÿßŸÑÿ∞ÿ®Ÿäÿ≠‚Äô (Fi man huwa al-Dhabih: Which of Abraham‚Äôs son was Sacrificed?) * Nizam al-Qur‚Äôan (Coherence in the Qur‚Äôan, a commentary on the Qur‚Äôan\\"  Grammar  * Asbaq Al Nahw This book is reproduction of original work of Maulana Hamiduddin Farahi.

The 5DX was manufactured by Hewlett Packard, then later Agilent Technologies when HP was split into Hewlett Packard and Agilent Technologies in 1999. The 5DX performed a non-destructive structural test using laminography (tomography) to take 3D images of an assembled printed circuit board using 8-bit grayscale to indicate solder thickness. It was used in the assembled printed circuit board (PCB) electronics manufacturing industry to provide process feedback to a surface mount technology assembly line, as well as defect capture. The 5DX was one of several tools used by many companies in the electronics manufacturing services sector to provide a means of inspecting both the visible and hidden solder connections between the printed circuit boards and components attached to those printed circuit boards. These solder connections (also known as solder joints) are referred to as PCB interconnects. 5DX technology The 5DX used a gantry robot to move the assembled printed circuit board underneath an source to be able to image the components' joints that require inspection. The positioning of board was guided with the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) data, which represented the outer layers of a printed circuit board's electrical design. The 5DX system used classical laminography to create an x-ray image ‚Äúslice‚Äù, or image plane that will be distinct from other image planes on the object to be imaged. A slice will remove obstructions above or below the plane of focus so that only the regions of interest remain. X-Ray systems that use methods such as laminography ( or the now more commonly used tomography ) are marketed as ‚Äú3D‚Äù x-ray systems. X-Ray systems that do not use these methods and only produce a transmissive shadow image are marketed as ‚Äú2D‚Äù systems. Classical laminographyDigital computed Laminography and Tomosynthesis - Functional Principles and Industrial Applications; S. Gondrom, S. Schr√∂pfer, FhG ITFP, Saarbr√ºcken, D; International Symposium on Computerized Tomography for Industrial Applications and Image Processing in Radiology March, 15 - 17, 1999 Berlin, Germany is based on a relative motion of the x-ray source, the detector and the object. The x-ray source and the detector are moved synchronously in circles 180 degrees out of phase with each other as shown in the figure. An illustration of the imaging method used for creating an image slice with laminography. Due to that correlated motion, the location of the projected images of points within the object moves also. Only points from a particular slice, the so-called focal plane, will be always projected at the same location onto the detector and therefore imaged sharply. Object structures above and below the focal plane will move as the rotation occurs. Because of that, they are not imaged sharply and they will blur to a grey background image. This requires precise height data, created by laser mapping the surface of the board. The focal plane is approximately .003 inches (.076 mm) deep. Rotational laminography requires a complex system to produce the rotating x-ray source, rotate the image detector and maintain synchronization between source and detector. In addition, the laminography systems require a system to map the surface of the object to be imaged. Product to be imaged is rarely perfectly flat.IPC-A-600G, Acceptability of Printed Circuit Boards, Section 2.11 Flatness The 5DX system used a laser mapping system to measure bow and twist so that the effects could be compensated for in the imaging process. In the 5DX system the rotating x-ray source is produced by scanning a high energy electron beam around an x-ray producing target integral to the x-ray tube. The rotating detector is implemented by rotating an x-ray sensitive screen mechanically and projecting the image into a high sensitivity digital camera. Aside from the electro-mechanical complexity, the main disadvantages of classical laminography are the background intensity that reduces the contrast resolution and the fact that in each measurement only one slice is imaged sharply. All other slices have to be inspected consecutively by displacing the object vertically. Classical laminography has been replaced by computed tomography (CT) or computed laminography in more modern automated x-ray systems. History of the 5DX Agilent Technologies (now Keysight Technologies) the OEM of the 5DX and follow on product, the X6000, exited the automated inspection market in March 2009. Both the 5DX and the X6000 were discontinued at that time. Even though the systems have been out of production for several years, a significant number remain in use.

This 0-degree bow angle (AOB) was usually used against attacking destroyers or anti- submarine craft. A \\"down the throat\\" shot would be any shot in which the target craft, or simply put, it was heading straight toward the submarine. These were extremely difficult setups from which to launch torpedoes, and usually it was only the skilled or desperate boat skippers who attempted such attacks. Further complications with the \\"down the throat\\" shot were the gyroscope issues that plagued US torpedoes, as well as the rapidly decreasing range of the target that could prevent arming of the torpedo. It was first used by under the command of Lieutenant Commander Lew Parks during the boat's first war patrol, although it did not hit. Its first successful use was by Dudley W. Morton, while in command of the USS Wahoo (SS-238), according to the foreword written by Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr. in \\"Wake of the Wahoo\\", by Forrest Sterling.

Odds of winning are slightly better than 1 in 10. Rules Cards are placed in a 3x3 grid. Pairs of cards which add up to eleven (5 and 6; 4 and 7; 3 and 8; 2 and 9; Ace and 10) are covered up. Face cards (J, Q, K) may be eliminated in a set of three cards consisting of one Jack, one Queen and one King regardless of suit. If all cards are covered up the game is won; if there are no more pairs of cards that add up to eleven, and there do not exist a Jack, a Queen, and a King, the game is lost. Strategy An individual game of Elevens is a game of pure chance, except for the small element of skill involved in spotting the pairs; the skill and strategic interest comes in not shuffling the cards at the end of each game, but instead collecting them up in order. Variations Elevens is very similar to several other solitaire games in the adding and pairing genre, such as Fifteens, Straight Fifteens, Block 10, and Kings in the Corners, all of which use a 4x4 grid, but require players to remove pairs adding to a total other than 11 such as 15 or 10. The solitaire games Tens, Good Thirteen (also called Thirteens), and Eighteens apply a similar concept to other totals.

She is known (citation pending) for her ambitious music videos and stage performances as well as her poetic, thought provoking lyrics. Since her debut in 1982, Avra has released numerous tracks, and albums. She has written and appeared in several theatre productions and stage performances, including at the Melbourne Fringe Festival.  Biography = Early life  Avra Velis was born in Brisbane as an only child to Greek parents who had immigrated from the islands of Kythera and Ithaca. Her mother enrolled her in after school piano lessons, speech and drama classes, whilst also studying Greek language and culture. Avra attended weekly theatrical productions covering a diversity of genres by various artists, Maria Callas, Liberace, Dame Joan Sutherland, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Kate Bush, Marcel Marceau, Mikis Theodorakis, and Lindsay Kemp. Avra attended Ascot State Primary School and Brisbane State High School where she excelled in drama, debating and English. After secondary education, she moved to Adelaide to complete a Bachelor of Education. Writing and creating music remained an important aspect of her life. She taught secondary English and drama at several South Australian schools, writing numerous school productions. Avra left the school system after four years to pursue interests in the commercial music industry.  Musical career  In the late 1980s Avra formed her first band, Virginia Wolf, with her partner Steve Sutton, a guitarist, songwriter and author. The collaboration produced work which led them to win the West End Battle of the Bands, a contest held in South Australia. Avra contributed, with Joanne Allis and Harry Beach, to The Call to Worship: Songbook, in 1994, which is a set of sacred choruses and songs with piano; it was published by Noiseworks Enterprises. In 1998 she entered the track, \\"Now About You\\", for the Songwriters, Composers and Lyricists Association (SCALA) Festival of Original Music Song Competition (FOOM), which appeared on their compilation album, SCALA: Play Those Songs (1999). The track was the co-winner of the Demo Section of the competition. Also that year her track, \\"Crazy Over You', was Highly Recommended in the Master Section, it was compiled on SCALA: Steps (28 June 2000). On 13 March 2001 Avra record material at the Full Bench studio with herself on lead vocals and Illias Archondoulis on oud and Greek percussion; Sophia Archondoulis and Darren Mullen on keyboards; Peter Grimwood on guitar; Lee McAllistair and Jayne-Anne Power on backing vocals; John McDermott on drums; and Damien Steele Scott on guitars. It was released as her first album, a live-in-the-studio effort, Avra in Session, later that year. All eleven tracks were written by Avra. It was recorded in front of an audience and produced by Andrew Bayfield and Tim Power. One of its tracks, \\"Being Elvis\\", was entered in the FOOM competition for 2002 and was highly commended in the Live section. It was compiled on SCALA: Living in the Mainstream (3 April 2004). Also on that compilation is her track, \\"Baby Kiss Me Now\\", which had been recorded live at the Directors Hotel on 15 June 2002 with Avra on vocals and electric piano and was engineered by Darren Zaza. In late 2002 Avra released a solo album, Innate, to build awareness of chiropractic work and innate healing. The album was commissioned by an international chiropractic organisation. It was distributed throughout Australia, New Zealand and the United States. After that album, Avra returned to her Greek heritage, and over the next three years, she collaborated with various Adelaide-based Greek artists and organisations, including a series of concerts sponsored by the Greeks of Egypt and Middle East Society. She performed at the Adelaide Festival Centre, the Royalty Theatre and the Adelaide Convention Centre. One of the shows, \\"Greeks of the Sea\\", was invited to be part of the Sydney Greek Festival (Paniyiri) Program. Avra performed regularly on a local level at the Cypriot Club and other Adelaide Greek music venues, as well as guest appearances at several Greek clubs in Melbourne. Another project was her \\"Avralicious Show\\", where she performed a parody of the rock diva persona. This inspired her to release a six-track extended play, Superalterego. She worked with Scott as her producer. A national tour followed which included a same titled show at the Melbourne Fringe Festival from September to October 2003. The EP shifted over 5000 units (pending verification). Avra's backing band were Velis on lead vocals and piano with John Doe on keyboards, Ben Palmer on guitar, Jarrod Payne on drums and Corey Stewart on backing vocals and bass guitar. In 2004, Avra co-produced the \\"Avra ‚Äì The Musical\\" which opened at the Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts in July. The script, and the lyrics for all 16 songs, were written by Avra, whilst the musical composition and production marked her first collaboration with dance musician, Kevin Freeman. Set to video screen backdrops created by Tim Rith and lighting designed by Hamish Cliff, it was a combination of dance and theatre.(citation pending) A 20-track CD was recorded and sold at the show, Avra ‚Äì The Musical ‚Äì Songs from the Musical. Avra and two cast members take a moment out from filming the \\"Fashion Police\\" video. (December 2006) Avra continued to work with Freeman on his project, \\"Thousand Ears\\", in 2006; they recorded several songs together including a dance track, \\"Fashion Police\\". The song, written by Avra and produced by Freeman, is a tongue in cheek commentary on the nature of fashion and its industry (citation pending). In December 2006 Steve Malone from Brisbane's Water Street Productions directed the music video for \\"Fashion Police\\".(citation pending) It was shot entirely against a green screen and a A$250,000 GT Pantera sports car was one of the props. Extensive motion tracked 3D animation was used in combination with 3D titles and effects, marking a dramatic departure from basic, utilitarian style music videos. The song was featured in the 2008 Australian Big Brother TV series.  2010s work  In 2010 Avra collaborated with George \\"Yiorgo\\" Bousias, an Australian bouzouki player for the album, Avra and Yiorgo, (2011). It was conceived and produced by Freeman. The album is a collection of Greek and English songs predominantly written by Avra. It included a track, \\"Elevtheria\\", jointly written by Velis, Bousias and Freeman, as well as a ballad, \\"Sam's Song\\" written by Bousias about his daughter. The album was released at the Paniyiri Greek Festival in Brisbane. In 2014 Avra returned to her singer-songwriter roots and released a live acoustic EP, Tricky Little Life sSongs‚Äù, a collection of songs on the Tall Poppy Productions label, which were written during the final months of her father's life. The song, \\"Days\\", was released as a single in 2015 along with her next album, Big Little Word. Avra also continued with her work as a freelance fashion stylist. Avra helped fund a homeless centre, Club 139, in Fortitude Valley and ran a charity drive, Chuck in Your Towel, in March 2016 to sponsor the centre. She promoted the charity on 4MMM's Marto and Ed for Breakfast radio program.

Born at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, he was the son of Christopher PeggeLiterary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century By John Nichols 1812 and his wife Gertrude, daughter of Francis Stephenson of Unstone, near Chesterfield. Christopher Pegge (died 1723) belonged to a family that had lived for several generations at Osmaston, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was a woollen dealer in Derby and later a lead merchant in Chesterfield. Samuel's father was Mayor of Chesterfield three times.Samuel Pegge the Elder in Dictionary of National Biography accessed online September 2007 Samuel published an important study on the Roman roads of Derbyshire as well as notes which his son, also Samuel, continued on the subject of Derbyshire words and phrases.The Samuel Pegge lexicographical manuscripts - June 2006 Kings College Manuscripts by Katie Sambrook. Accessed 26 September 2007 Education Samuel Pegge was educated at Chesterfield and he became a pensioner and scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1722. He graduated B.A. 1725, M.A. 1729. He was elected to a lay fellowship on the Beresford foundation of his college on 21 March 1726, but was removed in favour of Michael Burton (afterwards vice- master of St. John's), who claimed founder's kin. Pegge was then made an honorary fellow, and in 1729 was elected a ' Platt ' fellow of St. John's. In 1730 he was elected a member of the Spalding Society, to which he contributed some papers, and from 1730 to 1732 belonged to the Zodiac Club, a college literary society consisting of twelve members denominated by the signs of the zodiac. Pegge was the original Mars. Vicar and antiquary Samuel Pegge's church in thumb Pegge was ordained in 1729, and in 1730 became curate to Dr. John Lynch at Sundridge in Kent. On 6 December 1731 he became the vicar of Godmersham, Kent, where he lived for about twenty years, writing on antiquities and collecting books and coins. From 1749 to 1751 he lived at Surrenden, again in Kent, as tutor to the son of Sir Edward Dering. In 1751 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in the same year was inducted into the rectory of Old Whittington, near Chesterfield, exchanging Godmersham for the rectory of Brinhill (or Brindle), Lancashire. On 22 Oct. 1758 he exchanged Brinhill for the vicarage of Heath, near Whittington, holding Heath together with Whittington until his death. In 1765 he was presented to the perpetual curacy of Wingerworth, near Whittington. He was a prebendary of Lichfield (1757‚Äì1796), and in 1772 was collated to a stall in Lincoln Cathedral. In 1791 he was created LL.D. by the University of Oxford. He died, after a fortnight's illness, on 14 February 1796 at age 92. He was buried in the chancel at Whittington, where a mural tablet was installed. His small collection of English coins and medals were sold by auction on 23 March 1797. Family 'The Pegge coat of Arms. The Pegge family are originally from Shirley, Ashbourne. A distant relative is Catherine Pegge, a mistress of Charles II of England.Magna Britannia, Daniel and Samuel Lysons, Volume 5, 1817 On 13 April 1732, Pegge married Anne (d. July 1746), daughter of Benjamin Clarke of Stanley, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, and they had three children : Christopher (died in infancy), Samuel (the younger), and Anna Katharine, wife of the Rev. John Bourne of Spital, near Chesterfield. A portrait of Pegge, drawn by Gustavus Brander, and engraved by James Basire, is prefixed to Pegge's Forme of Cury (see illustration above) however there was an oil painting of him (reputed a better likeness) by Elias Needham. Contributions Pegge contributed to the first ten volumes of the Archaeologia memoirs on a great variety of topics, such as Anglo-Saxon jewellery ; the introduction of the vine into Britain; the stylus: King Alfred; the bull-running at Tutbury; the horn as a charter or instrument of conveyance; shoeing horses among the ancients ; cock-fighting; the right of sanctuary; the manner of King John's death ; Kit's Coty House ; the commencement of day among the Saxons and Britons; ' the mistaken opinion that Ireland and the Isle of Thanet are void of Serpents and prehistoric remains generally. He wrote seven memoirs in the Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, including The Story of Guy, Earl of Warwick (1783); The History of Eccleshall Manor (1784); The Roman Roads of Derbyshire (1784); The Textus Roffensis (1784) ; History of Bolsover and Peak Castles, Derbyshire (1783). He also wrote a large number of articles for the Gentleman's Magazine from 1746 to 1795, signing himself ' Paul Gemsege - an anagram of Samuel Pegge), T. Row ( = The Rector Of Whittington), and 'L. E.' ( = [Samue]L [Pegg]E) . While vicar of Godmersham Pegge made collections relating to Kent, including a ' Monasticon Cantianum ' in two folio manuscript volumes, and an account of the antiquities of Wye. He compiled a manuscript 'Lexicon Xenophonticum,' and possessed various lexicons annotated by himself, as well as two volumes of collections in English history.

These films have a variety of aims: to record specific events and ideas; to inform viewers; to convey opinions and to create public interest. A number of common techniques or conventions are used in documentaries to achieve these aims. Actuality in relation to documentary films Actuality is the term for raw film footage of real life events, places and people as opposed to fictional films which use actors, scripted stories and artificial sets. Documentaries are not pure actuality films - rather they combine actuality with explanation, commentary, and perhaps even dramatization Voice-over The voice-over in a documentary is a commentary by the filmmaker, or added to the soundtrack during the production. Through this the filmmaker can speak directly to the viewer, offering information, explanations and opinions. Direct and indirect interviews The interview is a common documentary technique. It allows people being filmed to speak directly about events, prompted by the questions asked by the filmmaker. An interview may take place on screen, or off screen, on a different set. Interviews in a documentary give the viewer a sense of realism, that the documentary maker‚Äôs views are mutually shared by another person or source, and thus more valid. To achieve this much detail from what may be a one-hour interview, clips of only a few minutes are shown. Interviews on opposing sides of an issue may be shown to give the viewer comprehensive information about a topic. Interviews are also a very important technique for character introduction. Lighting, color scheme, framing and camera angle all impact the audience's perception of the person who is speaking. As with narratives, this can lend to a specific feel the director wishes to convey about the person speaking. The impact to the story is key, as the audience will form an opinion of the person based on the initial meeting. Archival footage Archival, or stock footage, is material obtained from a film library or archive and inserted into a documentary to show historical events or to add detail without the need for additional filming. This can include still images as well as archival film. The concept of archival footage can be extended to include the photography of historical material from archives which are used to illustrate to a documentary film and is also the main reason why archive footage is especially important to historical documentary filmmaking. Re-enactment Re-enactments are also often used in documentaries. They are artificial scenes of an event which has been reconstructed and acted out on film based on information of the event. Reconstructions generally provide factual information and give the viewer a sense of realism as if the events are really happening in front of them. They often indicate that the footage is not real by using techniques such as blurring, distortion, lighting effects, changes in camera level, and color enhancement within the footage. Montage A montage sequence conveys ideas visually by putting them in a specific order in the film. Narrative montages involve the planning of sequence of shots used to indicate changes in time and place within a film. Ideational montages link actions with words, and are often used in documentaries. A different positioning of shots conveys different ideas to the viewer. For example, a montage containing a negative theme followed by a positive theme may give the viewer the idea that the positive theme is the main theme of the montage. Montages in documentaries are usually linked with words that characters say. This visual representation of the characters thoughts helps position the viewer in the story, and helps the viewer better understand what the character is saying. It visually presents a progression of ideas on a screen. Exposition In a documentary, the exposition occurs at the beginning and introduces the important themes of the film. It is important because it creates the viewer's first impression and introduces the viewer to the content. Dramatic segments of the documentary are specially chosen in order to grab the viewer‚Äôs attention. These shots are specifically positioned, such that the montage positions us to believe a certain theme presented by the documentary and thus the documentary presents its view much more persuasively to the viewer.

Sartori commenced his career at Swan Districts in 1981 after being recruited from Redcliffe. He missed the 1982 finals due to a kidney injury sustained at an exhibition game in Esperance midway through the season. He continued playing in 1983 and helped his club win both the 1983 and 1984 Grand Finals playing both as a ruckman and at centre half forward. Sartori left Swan Districts in 1986 after six seasons in which he had played 82 games and kicked 119 goals in the number 15 guernsey. He joined the Carlton Football Club in 1987, but with Stephen Kernahan and Justin Madden monopolising the centre half-forward and ruck positions, Sartori was used mainly as a full-forward. A long succession of injuries restricted him to 57 games for the Blues, in which he kicked 114 goals.

Shillingstone is the last surviving example of a station built by the Dorset Central Railway (one of the forerunners of the S&DJR;). The station closed in 1966, when services were withdrawn from the S&DJR; route. Since 2001, enthusiasts have been working to re-open the station as a heritage railway attraction. The main building has now been renovated, and opened to the public as a museum, shop and refreshment room in 2008.Station opening times: see website for details. History The station was opened on 31 August 1863 by the Somerset and Dorset Railway, although planned and designed by one of its two predecessors, the Dorset Central Railway. Initial train services were provided by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). In 1875, the Midland Railway and the LSWR together took over a joint lease of the line, forming the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. At the 'Grouping' of 1923, the Somerset & Dorset Railway Company was dissolved, the lease terminated, and the line and stations became the joint property of the Southern Railway and the London Midland and Scottish Railway companies. Shillingstone station became part of the Southern Region of British Railways when the railways were nationalised in 1948. The regional boundaries later changed several times and the station was subsequently transferred to the Western Region, the final (January 1963) boundary being somewhere between Shillingstone and Blandford. After a prolonged run-down of services, including the closure of freight and goods services on 5 April 1965, the station was closed, along with the remaining former S&DJR; lines, on 7 March 1966, as a result of the Beeching Axe. The station was fully staffed until closure. Track-lifting commenced in 1967, Shillingstone being tackled between March and May. The signal box and platform shelters were demolished at this time, and the last train through the station was the demolition train, hauled by a small diesel shunter. Dorset County Council purchased the trackbed for a proposed Shillingstone by-pass. Various furniture manufacturing companies were sited in the station yard, over the years, occupying industrial buildings constructed in the late 1970s, some of them making partial use of the station building. By December 2002, the by-pass plan had been shelved and the station was unoccupied. Dorset County Council decided to dispose of the redundant station, and, after protracted negotiations, the North Dorset Railway Trust took over the lease in July 2005, with a view to re-open the station as a heritage railway attraction. Restoration work commenced in 2003 and has continued steadily since then (see \\"Shillingstone Railway Project\\"). A length of trackbed around Shillingstone has been opened as a section of the North Dorset Trailway, providing an easy-access route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. At Shillingstone station the trailway is routed up and along the down platform, providing a clear view of the restored buildings. Configuration The station is located on the outskirts of the village, to the north-east. It has two platforms, with brick buildings on the 'up' (north-bound) platform and (originally) a simple wooden waiting shelter on the much longer 'down' platform. The main station building has a substantial wooden awning over the platform. During its original working life, lighting was provided by oil lamps, there being no electricity supply. (A supply has since been installed.) The station was important as one of the passing places on the single-line between and Blandford. The passing loop, new down platform and signal box were opened in 1878; in later years the loop was long, as measured between the facing points at each end, compared with at Stalbridge. There was a small goods yard to the north of the station, on the up side, with a cattle dock, a small goods shed, and a 5-ton crane. There was a siding at the north end of the passing loop on the down side, and another just to the south of the station (also on the down side and installed in 1901) which could accommodate a 14 coach train. The yard, the sidings and the passing loop were controlled from a signal box at the north end of the up platform. Shillingstone Railway Project The 21st century has seen the station taken on by the Shillingstone Railway Project (North Dorset Railway Trust or NDRT). The medium-term aim is to restore the current lease area ( to from Bath Junction) which equates to of single track mainline with loop through the platforms. Services To re- build Shillingstone Station and surroundings to as it appeared in 1950-1960 and to help to educate for future generations. Founded Around the late 1990s the North Dorset Railway Trust (which supports The Shillingstone Station Project) was formed by Michael Paulley and this is when the hard work, negotiation, letter writing and publicity begin in earnest.

A passing place on a stretch of single line, the station had two platforms with shelters, and a small goods yard. This and the passing loop were controlled from a signal box. The station was transferred to the Southern Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Becoming part of the Southern Region of British Railways when the railways were nationalised in 1948. The goods yard gave milk trains access to the private sidings of the local creamery. Started in 1913 by local farmers to produce cheddar cheese and pasteurised milk, it was taken over by the Milk Marketing Board in 1937. Milk trains ceased in 1966 upon closure of the line, with the creamery remaining in operation until 2000, when it was closed by owners Dairy Crest. The station was closed when the S&DJR; closed on 7 March 1966 and subsequently demolished leaving no trace of the station.

They are serine-threonine kinases that contain epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, a cytoplasmic kinase and are located in the cell walls. They provide a linkage between the inner and outer surroundings of cell walls. WAKs are under a group of receptor-like kinases (RLK) that are actively involved in sensory and signal transduction pathways especially in response to foreign attacks by pathogens and in cell development. On the other hand, pectins are an abundant group of complex carbohydrates present in the primary cell wall that play roles in cell growth and development, protection, plant structure and water holding capacity. Pectins are rich in galacturonic acids (OGs) and present in the middle lamellae in plant tissues where they provide strength, flexibility and adhesion between plant cells. Commercially and within the food industry, they are used as gels and stabilizers for desserts and juices. The role of WAKs in cell walls as pectin receptors is vital to a variety of functions involved with cell differentiation, form and host- pathogen relations.  WAKs bind pectin  Galacturonic acid: Major component of pectin Wall-associated kinases are receptors with a calcium mediated cross- link to the cell wall of plants. The presence of a galacturonic acid backbone in the various types of pectin is predicted to be a vital feature for binding to WAKs as WAK1 and WAK2 bind to different pectins including polymers of homogalacturonan (HA) the most abundant pectin in cell walls; Oligogalacturonic acids (OG), and to rhamnogalacturonans (RG) I and II. In- vitro binding between WAKs and pectin is facilitated by charged oxygen groups on pure pectin fragments and charged residues on the ECM of WAKs. Pectinase, an enzyme responsible for degrading pectin present in the cell wall releases WAKs, this became the primary suggestion that WAKs are bound to pectin within the cell wall. Additionally, this hypothesis suggested a covalent bond between pectin and WAKs as they are still bound to each other after exposure to the detergent Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (a detergent) and Dithiothreitol (DTT) and in acrylamide gels. Pectin methyl-esterases (PMEs) remove methyl groups arising from the enzyme which polymerizes pectins (methyl esterified Œ±- (1‚Äì4) D-galacturonic acid polymer) resulting in a de-esterified pectin polymer. WAKs bind more readily to de-esterified pectins due to their more negative charge. This suggestion that charge is responsible for the preferable binding of WAKs to de-esterified pectins (negatively charged) was shown in a mutation in cationic residues in a WAK1 gene to neutral residues which resulted to the loss of binding properties to the de-esterified pectins. This role of charge in binding is further proved through a substitution of arginine residues for glutamine and lysine for threonines within the ECM that showing a reduced binding to the de-esterified pectin. De-esterification of pectins is therefore a need for the activation of WAKs.  Molecular interactions of WAKs and pectin = Model  The binding of WAKs to pectins trigger the functioning of several pathways. Fragmentation of pectins (oligogalacturonic acid) during wounding or pathogenic attack results in a plant stress response, and WAKs play a role in the mediation of that response. However, since WAKs are also required for cell growth by binding to long pectin polymers for plant development and also pectin fragments for wounding response, no means has been found as to how WAKs differentiates between the two types of pectins to either initiate cell elongation or protection. However, a model was proposed to demonstrate the preference of WAKs for de-esterified pectins and a possible explanation for initiating pathogen response rather than growth response. A dominant WAKs allele that requires a pectin binding domain and kinase activity was shown to induce a stress response, however, this allele was suppressed with a null allele of pectin methyl-esterase (pme) which prevented the removal of the methyl groups that polymerize pectin to a de-esterified polymer hence resulting in an esterified pectin. Since WAKs is bound more loosely in esterified pectins, more was present to bind oligogalacturonic acids (in this mutant) thereby inducing a pathogen stress response rather than a growth response. WAKs dependent activation of a cell expansion pathway includes the activation of MPK3, while a pathogen response shows the activation of both MPK3 and MPK6. WAK1 and WAK2 are the most expressed protein variants of WAKS out of the five WAKs known in Arabidopsis, however WAK1 is expressed most in the vasculature while WAK2 is also expressed in organ junctions, abscission zones and meristems.  WAK1: pathogen response  A pathogen‚Äôs path to infection begins with the cell wall; the proteins that connect the cell wall to the plasma membrane are the initial mediators in the pathogen response. WAK1 is induced in a plant‚Äôs pathogenic response along with other pathogen- related proteins that function in protection. Wak1 is present in Arabidopsis plant tissue, with WAK1 mRNA expression more abundant in plant stem, leaves than in the roots and its extracellular domain contains epidermal growth repeats that facilitates cell signaling. Heat and salt do not have an effect in WAK1 production within tissues, however wounding is significant as it causes the expression of a WAK1 message by 2,2-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), a natural salicylate (SA) in the signal transduction pathway in the plant response to infection. Since WAK1 is vital to the survival of a plant in response to pathogens, it simultaneously confers resistant to SA to a point where the plant can survive exposure to high levels of SA. Increased resistance to SA through WAK1 expression can only be conferred through ectopic expression of an entire WAK1 protein or kinase domain. This ultimately means that inducing WAK1 expression causes decreased SA levels and a reduced toxicity, hence protection, demonstrating a role of WAK1 in regulating pathogenic attacks.  WAK2: pectin and gene expression  Pectin affects the expression of WAK2 dependent genes such as those involved in cell wall integrity and external response; WAK2 is suggested to be important in cellular events and gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll. Gene expression using Affymetrix expression arrays with RNA from wild-type or wak2-1 (null mutation) protoplasts treated or not treated with pectin reveals a variety of things. In pectin-treated wild type protoplasts, there was a change in the expression of over 200 genes, with almost 50 of the upregulated genes being those involved in cell-wall synthesis such as pectin esterase, leucine-rich transmembrane kinase, plant defensin. The remainder of the downregulated genes comprised those involved in multiple functions through the plant; however, only one gene in the pectin-treated WAK2-1 was differentially expressed. In comparison to wak2-1, 13 out of the 50 upregulated genes in the wild-type was suppressed in wak2-1 and 37 were expressed similarly to the wild type. 20 genes within those downregulated showed reduced expression in wak2-1 cells, 24 were activated and the remainder had levels similar to the wild type. These patterns allowed identification of genes regulated by WAK2 without pectin treatment, those independent of WAK2 but dependent in the WAK2 pectin response. WAK2 expression in wak2-1 (null mutation) showed the greatest reduction in expression indicating that the gene was not transcribed . WAK1 and WAK2 were upregulated in pectin-treated wild-types but this was not observed in the wak2-1. Evidently, WAK2 is an important component of the pectin signaling pathway, as the absence of WAK2 can amply reduce the transcriptional response to pectin. Both upregulated and downregulated WAK2-dependent pectin-response genes are either related to defense, cell wall structure, protein phosphorylation related or transcription factors.

Gerrit Paape (Delft, 4 February 1752 ‚Äì The Hague, 7 December 1803) was a Dutch plateelschilder (painter of earthenware and stoneware), poet, journalist, novelist, judge, columnist and (at the end of his career) ministerial civil servant.  Life  Gerrit Paape was born to a poor couple with many children. Because he wanted to draw well, his father had him placed in a local earthenware factory in 1765, where he learned the trade of the plateelschilder. In 1779, he was dismissed. He had in the meantime joined a Delft circle of poets, amateur artists and notables. In 1781, he got a job as a clerk at the Kamer van Charitate (‚ÄúChamber of Charity‚Äù), the local institution of poor relief. Gradually Paape became a person of authority in Delft, whose opinions were heeded. In 1782, he became one of the Patriots. In 1785, he became a journalist of the local paper the Hollandsche Historische Courant, since 1775 in the hands of Wybo Fijnje. The paper was regarded as one of the most radical in the country. Fijnje frequently had to defend his articles, especially those written by his friend and co-editor. Paape wrote pamphlets and poems and became a theoretician of the Patriots and a historian of the local societies. On 21 August 1787 a revolution took place in the vroedschap (the local government) in Delft, and various regents were deposed. In his account, Gerrit Paape laid emphasis on the opposition being shamed and silenced by the order and peace which characterised these developments. At the end of September 1787 Paape fled to Amsterdam and two weeks later, wearing a wig and hat, via Antwerp and Brussels, ended up at Dunkirk. On 3 April 1789 he and Wybo Fynje were exiled for life from the four regions (Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Utrecht) for l√®se majest√©. Herman Willem Daendels appointed Paape his secretary in Saint-Omer, and under the French general Pichegru, both men arrived at 's-Hertogenbosch on 21 September 1794 . The siege of the city was to last three weeks. Daendels' plans to take matters in his own hands in the Bommelerwaard were at his instigation reported by Paape in a newspaper article, which, however, upset the French.  After the revolution  After jobs in Delft, Dordrecht and the Hague, he was offered an honourable post in Leeuwarden in September 1796. There he was appointed to the Council of Justice, but without any legal qualifications. Paape resumed his journalistic work, usually under a pseudonym, with the radical Friesche Courant, with a view to acquainting the citizens with the ideas of the revolution. The anti- French revolt of Kollum caused great strain in Friesland, so that Daendels was called in to help. Paape, an anti-Orangist to the very core, squandered his position as an independent by running ahead of judicial procedures and verdicts. Paape was expelled and in May 1797 he left for the Hague, totally disenchanted with the Batavian revolution. Paape then wrote Vrolijke Caracterschetsen (‚ÄúCheerful Profiles‚Äù) en \\"De Knorrepot en de Menschenvriend\\" (‚ÄúThe Growser and the Humanitarian‚Äù), a sharp and brilliant portrait of his former colleague-judge in Leeuwarden, the radical Abraham Staal, who, it is assumed, may have played a prominent part as early as 1787. In 1798, he was appointed a civil servant in the ministry of National Education. At the time of the Coup he renewed his contacts with Pieter Vreede. In his last years Paape was plagued by illnesses that consigned him to his bed. He died of edema at the Hague at the age of 51.  Works  Paape wrote numerous books and plays, mostly romanticised accounts of an exile's life in the southern Netherlands and France, based on real events and facts. Gerrit Paape edited Reize door de Oostenrijkse Nederlanden (\\"A Journey through the Austrian [i.e. Southern] Netherlands\\"). The exiles in the castle of Watten (in French Flanders) also figure in his novel De gelukkige emigranten (\\"The Happy Emigr√©s\\"). Paape kept himself occupied by translating the \\"Explanation of the Rights of Man\\". In 's-Hertogenbosch, Paape produced the periodical De keezensoci√´teit (‚ÄúThe Patriot Society‚Äù). Like Voltaire, he wrote a satirical novel, Het leven en sterven van een hedendaagsch Aristocraat (\\"The Life and Death of a Present-day Aristocrat\\"), in which he very cynically describes how the old nobility ostensibly embrace the revolution, but only to save their own skin and in the end, even without titles and heraldic shields, become even more impudent and power-hungry than before. Beside literary works, he wrote on the exercitiegenootschappen (military societies), bee keeping and plateelschilders (pottery painters). On the first page of his last book, De onverbloemde geschiedenis (\\"The Plain History\\") Paape states that he is not sure whether the Patriot movement should make him laugh or cry.

The unit is part of the Danish Home Guard, and the only one of its kind, working directly for the Danish Army and the only unit in Danish Armed Forces that uses a woven fabric for its cap badge. Like with the other Danish SOFs, the accepted soldiers have one year probation, before they get their beret with the SSR insignia, and can be considered full membershttp://www.ssr.dk/faq.php History The unit ancestor: the Homeguard Special Intelligence Patrols (SEP) was founded in 1959 during the Cold War. SEP was disbanded in 1994 and Patrol Coy Land Command Zealand was established from the SEP unit in 1995. The unit was first assigned as a Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Coy to the Land Command Zealand (Corps-level) and later on the Danish Army Operational Command as Patrol Coy AOC. This unit - Patruljekompagniet - was transformed into the SSR on 1 January 2007 under the Homeguard Command. The unit celebrated the 50 year anniversary of Special Intelligence Patrols on 9 April 2009, as the oldest existing patrol unit of the Danish Homeguard and the only Special Reconnaissance unit of the Danish Homeguard. Soldiers from SSR on partol  Special Intelligence Patrols (SEP)  The Special Intelligence Patrols (Specielle Efterretningspatruljer or SEP) was founded in 1959 during the early cold war years and was specialised in collecting tactical intelligence behind enemy lines. Originally this was done using static observation sites but later on by insertable intelligence patrols operating behind enemy lines. The legacy of the Special Intelligence Patrols has not been forgotten and the basic skills (LRS/LRRP) and special reconnaissance capabilities have been maintained and developed within Patruljekompagniet. During the cold war and until the turn of the century SEP - and later Patruljekompagniet - cross-trained with British TA Special Air Service units from 21 SAS (V) (Artists' Rifles) and 23 SAS (V) when they visited Denmark during large scale NATO exercises, as well as US Army Special Forces.  Combat Swimmers  Patruljekompagniet has the capability to insert patrols covertly from the sea, due to their training with the Danish Frogman Corps, a naval special forces unit. They are trained as combat swimmers and are capable of various kinds of covert surface insertions.  Close protection teams  In 2006, specially selected soldiers from the SSR, among others, were trained by the Danish Army Special Operations Forces J√¶gerkorpset as military close protection operators and participated in Danish Army Protection Teams (Protective Services Detail / DA Army PSD) in Iraq.  SSR  At the beginning of 2007 Patruljekompagniet changed names to Hjemmev√¶rnets S√¶rlig- St√∏tte og Rekognosceringskompagni (SSR) - the Special- Support and Reconnaissance Coy. Patruljekompagniet was no longer available only to the Danish Army Operational Command (DAOC) but opened to all the Danish Defence Commands e.g. the Danish Navy Operational Command. This marked the end of Patruljekompagniet and the beginning of a new era for this historical specialised unit of volunteer soldiers. NOTE: Some local homeguard scoutplatoons carry the name of \\"Patruljekompagni\\" for historical reasons, but has no patrolling capability beyond scoutplatoon-level and has no LRS-capability.

Expansins were originally discovered as mediators of acid growth, which refers to the widespread characteristic of growing plant cell walls to expand faster at low (acidic) pH than at neutral pH. Expansins are thus linked to auxin action. They are also linked to cell enlargement and cell wall changes induced by other plant hormones such as gibberellin, cytokinin, ethylene and brassinosteroids. A subset of the Œ≤-expansins are also the major group-1 allergens of grass pollens. Families So far, two large families of expansin genes have been discovered in plants, named alpha- expansins (given the gene symbol EXPA) and beta-expansins (EXPB). Both families of expansins have been identified in a wide range of land plants, from angiosperms and gymnosperms to ferns and mosses. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains around 26 different Œ±-expansin genes and 6 Œ≤-expansin genes. A subset of Œ≤-expansins has evolved a special role in grass pollen, where they are known as group 1 grass pollen allergens. Plants also have a small set of expansin-like genes (named EXLA and EXLB) whose function has not been established. Some proteins in bacteria and fungi are known to have distant sequence similarity to plant expansins. Strong evidence that at least some of these sequences are indeed expansins came in 2008 when the crystal structure of the YOAJ protein from a bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) was shown to be very similar to the structure of plant expansins, despite the low sequence similarity. This study also noted that proteins related to YOAJ were found in diverse species of plant pathogenic bacteria, but not in related bacteria that did not attack or colonize plants, thus suggesting that these bacterial expansins have a role in plant-microbe interactions. Some animals, such as Globodera rostochiensis, a plant-parasitic nematode, can produce a functional expansin which uses it to loosen cell walls when invading its host plant. To be designated as expansin or expansin-like, genes and their protein products must contain both domain I (N-terminal, catalytic, GH45-like - GH meaning glycoside-hydrolase) and domain II (C-terminal, distantly related to group-2 grass pollen allergens). Non-plant expansins can be designated with the symbol EXLX (expansin-like X), but they do not constitute a monophyletic group; distantly similar to plant expansins, they could have diverged prior to the origin of land plants, or else could have been acquired by horizontal transfer. Nomenclature of genes and proteins of expansins and expansin-like: e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana EXPANSIN A1 is named \\"AtEXPA1\\" as for the gene, and \\"AtEXPA1\\" as for the protein; one adds \\"-1\\" for mutant allele 1. Actions Expansins characteristically cause wall stress relaxation and irreversible wall extension (wall creep). This process is essential for cell enlargement. Expansins are also expressed in ripening fruit where they function in fruit softening, and in grass pollen, where they loosen stigmatic cell walls and aid pollen tube penetration of the stigmain germinating seeds for cell wall disassembly, in floral organs for their patterning, in developing nitrogen- fixing nodules in legumes, in abscissing leaves, in parasitic plants, and in ‚Äòresurrection‚Äô plants during their rehydration. No enzymatic activity has been found for expansin and in particular, no glucanase activity: they don't hydrolyze the matrix polysaccharides; the only definitive assay for expansin activity is thus to measure wall stress relaxation or wall extension. Structure and regulation Expansins are proteins; the two expansins initially uncovered had molecular weights of 29 kDa (kiloDalton) and 30 kDa, which would correspond to around 270 amino acids on average. Generally speaking, Œ±- and Œ≤-expansins and expansin-like are composed of approximately 300 amino acids, with a MW of ~25‚Äì28 kDa for the mature protein. The peptidic sequence of an expansin consists, in particular, of: a signal peptide of around 20‚Äì30 amino acids at the N-terminal end, the putative catalytic domain, a His-Phe-Asp (HFD) motif in central region (except EXL), and the C-terminal putative cellulose-binding domain with conserved Trp (tryptophan) residues. Sequence analysis of expansin genes shows seven introns named A, B, C, D, E, F, and G; sequences from different expansin genes show good correspondence, the exon/intron organization being conserved among Œ±- and Œ≤-expansins, and expansin-like genes, although the number of introns and the length of each intron differ among genes. In the N-terminal signal sequences of Œ±-expansin genes, the general absence of endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (KDEL or HDEL) confirms that the proteins are targeted to the cell wall. A promoter analysis of expansin genes indicates that expression of these genes may be regulated by auxin, gibberellin, cytokinin or ethylene, this being more frequent in Œ±-expansins than in Œ≤-expansins; semi-aquatic plants such as Rumex palustris, which are induced to grow rapidly by submergence, show a transcription induction by submergence, the same as in rice where hypoxia and submergence increase Œ±-expansin mRNA levels. Mechanism The plant cell wall has high tensile strength and must be loosened to enable the cell to grow (enlarge irreversibly). Within the cell wall, this expansion of surface area involves slippage or movement of cellulose microfibrils, which normally is coupled to simultaneous uptake of water. In physical terms, this mode of wall expansion requires cell turgor pressure to stretch the cell wall and put the network of interlinked cellulose microfibrils under tension. By loosening the linkages between cellulose microfibrils, expansins allow the wall to yield to the tensile stresses created in the wall through turgor pressure. The molecular mechanism by which expansin loosens the cellulosic network within the cell wall is not yet established in detail. However, expansin is hypothesized to disrupt the non-covalent adhesion or entrapment of hemicellulose on the surface of cellulose microfibrils. Hemicelluloses can tether cellulose microfibrils together, forming a strong load-bearing network. Expansin is thought to disrupt the cellulose-hemicellulose association transiently, allowing slippage or movement of cell wall polymers before the association reforms and the integrity of the cell wall network is reestablished. Turning to the function of bacterial expansins, the bacterial protein named YOAJ or BsEXLX1 binds to plant and bacterial cell walls and has weak but significant expansin activity, that is, it induces plant cell wall extension in vitro. Moreover, B. subtilis mutants lacking BsEXLX1 were defective in colonizing plant roots, suggesting that this protein facilitates plant-bacterium interactions. Allergenicity In grass pollens, the major allergens (group-1 allergens, main causative agents of hay fever and of seasonal asthma) are structurally linked to a sub-group of the Œ≤-expansins. These expansins appear specialized in pollination, likely in loosening the cell walls of the maternal tissues during penetration of the pollen tube into the stigma and style, as is suggested by their potent rheological effect on grass style and stigma walls, where they are abundantly released by the pollen. Expansin-like proteins are implicated in group-2 and -3 grass allergenes, less important than those of group-1. These three allergens groups share a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), which could be responsible for the binding to the IgE antibody. The expansin domain II, causative of the allergenic effects, could be related to the competition between pollens for access to ovules.

Definition A matroid is defined to be a family of subsets of a finite set, satisfying certain axioms. The sets in the family are called \\"independent sets\\". One of the ways of constructing a matroid is to select a finite set of vectors in a vector space, and to define a subset of the vectors to be independent in the matroid when it is linearly independent in the vector space. Every family of sets constructed in this way is a matroid, but not every matroid can be constructed in this way, and the vector spaces over different fields lead to different sets of matroids that can be constructed from them. A matroid M is regular when, for every field F, M can be represented by a system of vectors over F... Properties If a matroid is regular, so is its dual matroid, and so is every one of its minors., p. 112. Every direct sum of regular matroids remains regular., p. 131. Every graphic matroid (and every co-graphic matroid) is regular.. Conversely, every regular matroid may be constructed by combining graphic matroids, co-graphic matroids, and a certain ten-element matroid that is neither graphic nor co-graphic, using an operation for combining matroids that generalizes the clique-sum operation on graphs.. The number of bases in a regular matroid may be computed as the determinant of an associated matrix, generalizing Kirchhoff's matrix- tree theorem for graphic matroids.. Characterizations The uniform matroid U{}^2_4 (the four-point line) is not regular: it cannot be realized over the two-element finite field GF(2), so it is not a binary matroid, although it can be realized over all other fields. The matroid of the Fano plane (a rank-three matroid in which seven of the triples of points are dependent) and its dual are also not regular: they can be realized over GF(2), and over all fields of characteristic two, but not over any other fields than those. As showed, these three examples are fundamental to the theory of regular matroids: every non- regular matroid has at least one of these three as a minor. Thus, the regular matroids are exactly the matroids that do not have one of the three forbidden minors U{}^2_4, the Fano plane, or its dual.. If a matroid is regular, it must clearly be realizable over the two fields GF(2) and GF(3). The converse is true: every matroid that is realizable over both of these two fields is regular. The result follows from a forbidden minor characterization of the matroids realizable over these fields, part of a family of results codified by Rota's conjecture.. The regular matroids are the matroids that can be defined from a totally unimodular matrix, a matrix in which every square submatrix has determinant 0, 1, or ‚àí1\\\\. The vectors realizing the matroid may be taken as the rows of the matrix. For this reason, regular matroids are sometimes also called unimodular matroids., p. 20. The equivalence of regular matroids and unimodular matrices, and their characterization by forbidden minors, are deep results of W. T. Tutte, originally proved by him using the Tutte homotopy theorem. later published an alternative and simpler proof of the characterization of unimodular matrices by forbidden minors.. Algorithms There is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a matroid is regular, given access to the matroid through an independence oracle..

It is named for Jean Monnet, regarded by many as a chief architect of European Unity. It is part of the European Union's education, youth and sports programme Erasmus+. There are additional funds to increase the participation of higher education institutions from countries outside the European Union as part of the EU partnership instrument, which is specifically designed to promote the Union's strategic interests worldwide by reinforcing its external strategies, policies and actions.  History  The initiative was originally launched in 1990. In 2001 it was open to higher education institutions from all around the world. In 2007 it was incorporated into the EU's education programme LLP. In 2014 Jean Monnet became part of the Erasmus+ programme, and additional funds were earmarked to increase the participation of higher education institutions from countries outside the European Union as part of the EU partnership instrument. Overview Jean Monnet is dedicated to promoting excellence in EU studies in higher education around the world. Its actions aim to build bridges between academics, researchers and EU policymakers. They focus on the study of and research on EU integration and in understanding Europe's place in a globalised world and are implemented by higher education institutions. The programme has funded the creation of a network of Jean Monnet European Centres of Excellence, university-level institutions recognised by the European Commission for high quality research into, and teaching of, topics relating to European integration. The Commission also funds Jean Monnet Chairs and Jean Monnet teaching modules. It has helped to set up 162 Jean Monnet European Centres of Excellence, 875 Jean Monnet Chairs and 1001 Jean Monnet Teaching Modules worldwide in 72 countries in five continents. These projects bring together 1,500 professors, and reach approximately 500,000 students every year. Jean Monnet Projects are selected on the basis of their academic merits and following a process of rigorous and independent peer review. The projects will be implemented in strict compliance with the principle of academic autonomy and freedom.Jean Monnet Programme, accessed 8 August 2012  Jean Monnet Chairs  Jean Monnet Chairs are teaching posts with a specialisation in European Union studies for university professors or senior lecturers. Jean Monnet Chairs can enhance the teaching of EU studies through the curriculum; conduct, monitor and supervise research on EU matters at all education levels; be a mentor and advisor to the next generation of teachers and researchers; and provide expert guidance to future professionals about European matters. Jean Monnet Chairs are encouraged to publish books within their university press; participate in dissemination and information events in their country and around Europe; organise events (lectures, seminars, workshops, etc.) with policymakers, civil society and schools; network with other academics and institutions supported by Jean Monnet; apply open educational resources, and publish the summaries, content, schedule and expected outcomes of their activities.

MacBride was also a poet (in a style similar to that of Edgar Guest), having published many poems over the years through various media, and his works were collated and published in several volumes after his death. Politics MacBride was elected as an alderman in Brantford in 1917 and went on to become mayor four separate times, from 1918 to 1920, in 1925, from 1933 to 1934 and from 1936 to 1937. Always active in pursuing economic opportunities for his city, he once met Herbert Fisk Johnson, Sr. on a train, and convinced him to set up the Canadian head office of S. C. Johnson & Son in Brantford. He represented Brant South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1919 to 1926 as a Labour member. MacBride broke with the United Farmers of Ontario- Independent Labour Party coalition that took power following the election after the Labour contingent voted to nominate Walter Rollo rather than MacBride for the position of Minister of Labour. MacBride, however, argued that his departure from the caucus was due to its acquiescence to the United Farmers in the selection of cabinet members. MacBride remained a Labour MLA but sat in the Opposition benches and ran for re-election as a Conservative- Labour candidate in 1923. After his second term in the legislature ended in 1926, he did not run for re-election and was appointed Supervisor of Highways by the Conservative provincial government of Howard Ferguson. He returned to the legislature in the 1934 provincial election, representing Brantford from 1934 to 1938 as an Independent Liberal member. He served as Minister of Labour in the provincial cabinet from 1937 to 1938. He died in Brantford in 1938, while still in office.

The show aired in the Thursday evening eight o'clock time slot. Characters The title characters are three men who wander throughout Japan in the late Edo period. In each episode they encounter antagonists, and in the final tachimawari (fight scene) kill them. The characters traveled sometimes together, sometimes separately. When they arrived in a town they might settle in the same lodging, but sometimes take up with rival factions. In the end, they work together to overcome evil. For the first five series, these characters were the same. Yasaka Heishir≈ç, nicknamed \\"Tono-sama\\" (\\"Lord\\") is a refined, disciplined r≈çnin played by Hideki Takahashi. The other characters occasionally speculate that he is a second son of a daimy≈ç but his identity is never revealed. He is the informal leader of the group. Yasaka uses the Onoha Itt≈ç-ry≈´ style of sword fighting. He appears in the first six series; at the beginning of the seventh series he is written out of the script by traveling to America. Kuji Shinnosuke, or \\"Sengoku,\\" is also a ronin, or a spy for the Tokugawa shogunate, or a commoner, as suits the episode. His nickname refers to his wish to work as a samurai with a stipend of a thousand koku. A native of the Satsuma Domain, Kuji practices the Jigen- ry≈´ sword fighting style. He appears in the first five series and returns in the seventh. K≈çji Yakusho played the role of Kuji. Tsubakuro Jinnai is the third member of the group. Nicknamed \\"Tako\\" (\\"octopus\\"), he describes himself as a descendant of the K≈çga ninja and fights with a variety of weapons. Round- faced rakugo comic Koasa Shunp≈´tei portrayed Jinnai in all seven series. The title of the series specifies three people, so a replacement was necessary for Kuji and Yasaka in the final two series. Kira Ukon (Masahiko Kond≈ç, a descendant of Kira Yoshinaka, filled in first for Kuji, then for Yasaka. A debt-collector, he received the nickname \\"senry≈ç,\\" \\"a thousand gold pieces,\\" in imitation of Kuji's nickname. During sword fights, he always found an opportunity to ask his opponent his style. In most series, there was also a woman who accompanied the three. The first was Okei, portrayed by Kaoru Sugita. Next came Osen (Minako Fujishiro); then Och≈ç (Y≈çko Nagayama). They were followed by Okaru (Wakako Shimazaki) and finally Ory≈ç (Machi Katsuragi). Schedule The first series premiered in 1987, and the seventh ended in 1995. In addition, TV Asahi broadcast another series in 2002 with a new cast and new characters.

An eccentric and controversial figure, Girault was also a prolific and dedicated entomologist. He published more than 325 papers and described over 3000 new taxa from Australia. Biography Alexandre Ars√®ne Girault was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on January 9, 1884, to Joseph Bonaparte Girault and Elizabeth Frances Girault (n√©e Goodwin). He is named after his grandfather, Ars√®ne Napoleon Alexandre Girault de Saint Fargeau, one of the founding faculty of the US Naval Academy. Girault earned his Bachelor of Science degree from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1903. From 1904 to 1907 he was employed as a field assistant for the United States Bureau of Entomology. During this time, he was involved in research on plum curculios (Conotrachelus nenuphar), Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and American plum borers (Euzophera semifuneralis). In 1908, he moved to Urbana, Illinois, where he worked as a laboratory assistant of the Illinois State Entomologist. From 1909 to 1911 (still in the employ of the Illinois State Entomologist), he worked as an assistant in entomology at the University of Illinois, studying bedbugs (Cimex spp.) and Colorado potato beetles. In a paper published in 1908, Girault vividly described an encounter with bedbugs in 1907 in a hotel room in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects. Alexandre Ars√®ne Girault and family (left to right: Elizabeth, Lawrence, Helen, Alexandre, and Ernest). Taken at Stanthorpe, Queensland on April 25, 1924. Frank and Daisy Girault have yet to be born at this time. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, the Government of Queensland requested the services of an entomologist from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), hoping to discover the reason for the failure of the sugarcane crops in Queensland. Highly recommended by his superiors, Girault moved to Australia in 1911. He worked for the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) in Nelson (now Gordonvale, Queensland) at an annual salary of ¬£400. His main area of study while in BSES was the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), a pest of sugarcanes; but he also studied parasitoid wasps (his area of expertise and personal interest), as well as some true bugs and thrips. Here, he met and married Elizabeth Jeannette Pilcher in 1911. Their first child, Ernest Alexandre Girault, was born on November 3, 1913. In 1914, Girault moved back to the United States to resume working for the USDA. He worked in Washington, D.C., on Chalcidoidea systematics. During this time, his wife gave birth to their second son and first daughter, Lawrence Joseph Girault on August 27, 1915, and Helen Joan Girault on August 10, 1917. He strongly disliked the city, describing it as a \\"bedlam\\" and \\"a place unfit for scholarship.\\" Yet during this time, he also finished his major work, a 900-page monograph on chalcid wasps. Girault returned to Australia in 1917 to work as assistant entomologist in the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. He and his family lived in Indooroopilly, Brisbane, where his second daughter and third son were born (Daisy Lydia Girault on July 19, 1925, and Frank Stephen Girault on May 23, 1928). He never returned to the United States, though he retained his American citizenship. Girault's work was irregular in Australia, including periods of unemployment. This was exacerbated by bad economic conditions in Australia as a result of World War I. His work at the Department of Agriculture and Stock ceased in 1919, but resumed again from 1923 to 1930. At times, Girault was forced to work in jobs unrelated to his field of expertise out of necessity (including working as a shopkeeper and as a rock-breaker in a stone quarry). He also increasingly became disillusioned with economic entomology (which also prompted his departure from the United States). He began to include acerbic criticisms, poems, and essays in his papers, resulting in publishers turning his work away and frequent clashes with superiors and colleagues. His love for pure taxonomy, however, led him to publish numerous papers privately. Most of these were short notes and often printed poorly. His wife contracted tuberculosis while in Australia, leaving her bedridden for years until her death on September 9, 1931. Devastated, Girault's behaviour increasingly became erratic and paranoid. One afternoon, around 1936, Girault started shouting at their neighbours for hours for no apparent reason. This continued on into the night until someone finally called the police who took him away. Two days later, his sons, Ernest and Frank, drove him to Goodna Mental Hospital. He was admitted several more times into the asylum. He was on leave from the Goodna asylum in the care of his son until 9 May 1940 when he was admitted to Dunwich Benevolent Asylum on North Stradbroke Island on 16 July 1940 where he died on 2 May 1941 at the age of 57. His cause of death was officially listed as paraphrenia and exhaustion. He was buried at Dunwich Cemetery and now lies in an unmarked grave. Legacy Girault was a controversial and eccentric figure. Even though most of his career was spent in economic entomology, he deeply loathed the economic aspects of his work and was obsessed with the importance of science for its own sake. He described the use of entomology for economic gains as a \\"prostitution of science and leaning.\\" He gained notoriety for his scathing criticism of scientists who worked for such purposes (including those he worked with and worked for such as L.O. Howard). His earlier remarks were mostly aimed at his American superiors and colleagues in Washington. Most of these were in the form of essays or poetry (Girault's other great passion). At times, it consisted of a single sentence inserted in the most unlikely places. Among a list of synonyms in Descriptiones hymenopterorum chalcidoidicarum variorum cum observationibus (1917), is the completely out of place \\"Liberty is Soul\\". One of his most famous poems was aimed at his USDA superior and the then president of the Entomological Society of Washington, Altus Lacy Quaintance. It was entitled A Song after the manner of 'Auld Lang Syne': ::Should A. L. Quaintance be forgot ::And other childish men? ::Who their first love let go to pot ::that they might fatten. His Australian colleagues and superiors became the target of his criticism after he moved permanently to Australia. This was most likely the reason for his later difficulties in finding employment. A more eloquent essay of his position can be found in a 1920 paper: In the same paper, he also described a parody genus and species of a mymarid wasp, Shillingsworthia shillingsworthi from the planet Jupiter. It was a sarcastic insult meant for his then superior, Johann Francis Illingworth: In one instance, the director of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock actually prohibited him from publishing several new genera and species. He published it anyway, under the cheekily titled Some new hexapods stolen from authority (1928). Despite this, Girault was a dedicated and prolific taxonomist. He wrote over 325 papers, describing more than 3000 taxa (mostly of chalcid wasps). His great love for pure taxonomy is obvious in his writings. Besides criticism of his \\"traitorous\\" colleagues, he also used poetry at times to describe newly discovered species. Like other taxonomists, he also frequently dedicated the names of the wasps he described to people and causes he admired. This included many genus names including Davincia, Shakespearia, Beethovena, Mozartella, Elijahia, Emersonia, Emersonella, Emersonopsis, Raffaellia, Raphaelana, Raphaelonia, Ovidia, Goetheana, Goethella, Lutheria, Marxella, Marxiana, Thoreauella, Thoreauia, Tennysoniana, Lincolna, Lincolnanna, Bachiana, Keatsia, Whittieria, Plutarchia, Haeckeliania, Schilleria, Aeschylia, Aligheria, Aligherinia, Anselmella, Rubensteina, Carlyleia, Grotiusomyia, Grotiusella, Borrowella, Finlayia, Boudiennyia, Richteria, Ratzeburgalla, Buonapartea, Zamenhofella, Gounodia, Herodotia, Anthemiella, Delisleia, Cowperella, Cowperia, Hannibalia, Magellanana, Lamennaisia, Lomonosoffiella, Angeliconana, Giorgionia, and Froudeana, plus numerous epithets such as longfellowi, shakespearei, goethei, etc., as well as names honoring the Jewish people, and his children. Even financial and publishing problems didn't stop him from continuing his work. About a third of the taxa he described were published with his own meagre funds. They were often very brief, very poorly printed, and were given away free to a very few institutions and fellow specialists working with Hymenoptera. Despite this, Girault's work is still considered valid by current taxonomists because of his careful preparation of the type specimens. Most of these were later donated to the Queensland Museum, from whence they can still be observed to this day. However, Girault died before he could complete his final great work, a monograph on Australian chalcid wasps started in 1917. The bulk of his work and his type specimens were later reexamined by the Queensland Museum Curator of Entomology Edward \\"Ted\\" J. Dahms in the 1970s. For this, Dahms was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Queensland. Dahms later collaborated with the entomologist Gordon Gordh in finishing the checklist of Australian chalcid wasps that Girault had started, an area of entomology that was largely ignored after Girault's death. Taxa named after him include Plutarchia giraulti, which B. R. Subba Rao named in a 1974 paper.

The band is currently composed of singer-bassist Nolan Krebs, drummer Joshua Korf, guitarist Ryan Hagan and singer-guitarist Ben Taber. The band's original co-frontman and guitarist Andrew Tamlyn left the band in March 2017 to focus on his new band Fyrrh. History The band was originally formed as Plantains in 2013 as a four piece band including Alex Falardeau. High School friends Andrew Tamlyn (who had previously released material under the names Amish Bread and Yoke) and Nolan Krebs (who had been a member of Drone Wolves) moved to Grand Rapids from Midland, Michigan. The duo bonded over traditional surf music and \\"messed around with music a little bit\\" before parting ways to go to college. They moved to Grand Rapids with the purpose of pursuing a musical project together due to the area's music scene They enlisted Ann Arbor native Joshua Korf on drums, who was their new next door neighbour. Under their original name they released a collection of demos titled Union in October 2013 via Bandcamp and a split-10\\" EP with Paris-band band Os Noctambulos in February 2014 via UK label Stolen Body Records. By the time the EP was released, they had already changed their name to Heaters and dropped Falardeau from their lineup. They had also already released another collection of songs via Bandcamp titled EP, and another digital-only release in April 2014 titled Brown Sugar. Commenting on their early progress and the regional buzz around the band, Krebs stated that \\"we‚Äôve been playing shows pretty much every week between Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Chicago and Detroit. We‚Äôre also pretty obsessive about recording which we mostly do at home\\". The band released their debut EP/album proper in October 2014 in the form of Solstice via Dizzybird Records in the US and Stolen Body Records in the UK. In 2015, the band signed to Beyond Beyond Is Beyond and released the single Mean Green in April that year. In support of the single, the band toured the US with the likes of Wand, Ultimate Painting, Holy Wave and F√∂llakzoid. They released their full length debut Holy Water Pool in September 2015 and embarked on their debut EU/UK tour though January‚ÄìMarch 2016. The band released their second full length release Baptistina in August 2016. Commenting on putting the album together, Tamlyn stated that \\"parts of Baptistina were created very much in the moment, as we had a small window to finish recording before going overseas for the winter\\". Whilst touring the album, they added former Knife Rituals guitarist Ryan Hagan to their live band. In March 2017, co-frontman Andrew Tamlyn left the band prior to a planned EU/UK tour and promptly formed Fyrrh (initially called Lucid Fur) with Casey Huizenga and Logan Mooney. Heaters revealed their new lineup as a four piece, retaining live guitarist Ryan Hagan and adding additional guitarist and singer Ben Taber. on 29 April, the new lineup of the band announced that they had completed the third full length album. Third album Matterhorn was released in October 2017 via Beyond Beyond Is Beyond. Their latest and fifth album, Suspended Youth, was released in November 2018.

Career Schaie has spent much of his career studying the psychological development from young adulthood to old age. He is currently working at the Pennsylvania State University as Evan Pugh Professor Emeritus of Human Development and Psychology. He is an Affiliate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington. His current research encompasses an interest in the life course of adult intelligence, the impact of cognitive behavior in midlife and the integrity of brain structures in old age, and early detection of risk for dementia. Schaie also studies developmental research methodology in addition to the applications of the age-cohort-period model to psychology. Schaie is the author and or editor of 60 books and 300 journal articles and chapters on the psychology of aging. Schaie is also known for his contributions to testing literature such as the Test of Behavioral Rigidity and the Schaie-Thurstone Test of Adult Mental Abilities. Contributions Schaie is most well known for his involvement in the Seattle Longitudinal study. The research that Schaie conducted in the field of geropsychology has resulted in changes in public policy such as raising the mandatory retirement ages from 65 to 70 in many fields. Now millions of individuals have the option of remaining employed as they age into their sixties and seventies. With the results from the Seattle Longitudinal Study, Schaie has challenged earlier models of cognitive aging. ReferencesExternal links * K.

From 1997 until 2011, he served as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. His judgments were highly influential in commercial law, giving rise to new approaches in insolvency, competition law and class actions.  Early life and education  Finkelstein was born in Munich, Germany in July 1946. His father, Wolf Finkelstein, grew up in Poland, near the border with Ukraine. The Second World War led Wolf Finkelstein to Germany, where he met fellow Pole Lisa Altstock. In 1951, as stateless Jews, the family came to Melbourne by boat. Finkelstein's secondary education was at Elwood High School, where he was reportedly a rebellious and disobedient student. In 1965, he was accepted to study at Monash University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Jurisprudence and a Bachelor of Laws. Finkelstein was a teaching fellow at Monash University Law School from 1974 to 1975. Career In 1975 Finkelstein began practicing as a barrister at the Victorian bar.

By that point, his colleagues Goldberg and Merkel were also on the bench. It made Melbourne a hub for corporate law litigation. At one point in time, around 90% of corporate cases in the Federal Court were listed in Victoria. He has presided over a number of notable cases, including the civil hearing of prominent Australian businessman Steve Vizard, in which he increased the sentence proposed in the Agreed Statement of Facts by both ASIC and Vizard to a $390,000 fine and a ban from holding company directorships for ten years. His judgment of Vizard attracted widespread media attention, but was widely misunderstood as the matter was a civil hearing, involving the review by the Court of an Agreed Statement of Facts The head of ASIC, Jeff Lucy, later conceded that much of the media outrage was caused by ASIC's failure to properly communicate the full facts to the media.

During the Middle Ages, India sees some exploration by Chinese and Muslim geographers, while European maps of India remain very sketchy. A prominent medieval cartographer was Persian geographer Abu Rayhan Biruni (973‚Äì1048) who visited India and studied the country's geography extensively. European maps become more accurate with the Age of Exploration and Portuguese India from the 16th century. The first modern maps were produced by Survey of India, established in 1767 by the British East India Company. Survey of India remains in continued existence as the official mapping authority of the Republic of India. Prehistory Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008) proposes that the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500‚Äì1900 BCE) may have known \\"cartographic activity\\" based on a number of excavated surveying instruments and measuring rods and that the use of large scale constructional plans, cosmological drawings, and cartographic material was known in India with some regularity since the Vedic period (1st millennium BCE).Schwartzberg, 1301‚Äì1302 : 'Though not numerous, a number of map-like graffiti appear among the thousands of Stone Age Indian cave paintings; and at least one complex Mesolithic diagram is believed to be a representation of the cosmos.'Schwartzberg, 1301 Susan Gole (1990) comments on the cartographic traditions in early India: Antiquity Ptolemy's Geography, rediscovered by Maximus Planudes in Constantinople . Cartography of India as a part of the greater continent of Asia develops in Classical Antiquity. In Greek cartography, India appears as a remote land on the eastern fringe of Asia in the 5th century BCE (Hecataeus of Miletus). More detailed knowledge becomes available after the conquests of Alexander the Great, and the 3rd-century BCE geographer Eratosthenes has a clearer idea of the size and location of India. By the 1st century, at least the western coast of India is well known to Hellenistic geography, with itineraries such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Marinus and Ptolemy had some knowledge of the Indian Ocean (which they considered a sea) but their Taprobana (Sri Lanka) was vastly too large and the Indian peninsula much reduced. They also had little knowledge of the interior of the country. Native Indian cartographic traditions before the Hellenistic period remain rudimentary. Early forms of cartography in India included legendary paintings; maps of locations described in Indian epic poetry, for example the Ramayana. These works contained descriptions of legendary places, and often even described the nature of the mythological inhabitants of a particular location.Sircar, page 327 Early Indian cartography showed little knowledge of scale, the important parts of the map were shown to be larger than others (Gole 1990). Indian cartographic traditions also covered the locations of the Pole star, and other constellations of use. These charts may have been in use by the beginning of the Common Era for purposes of navigation. Other early maps in India include the Udayagiri wall sculpture‚Äîmade under the Gupta empire in 400 CE‚Äîshowing the meeting of the Ganges and the Yamuna.Schwartzberg, 1302 Middle Ages The 8th-century poet and dramatist Bhavabhuti, in Act 1 of the Uttararamacarita, described paintings which indicated geographical regions.Sircar, 328 In the 20th century, over 200 medieval Indian maps were studied in the compilation of a history of cartography. Also considered in the study were copper-plate text inscriptions on which the boundaries of land, granted to the Brahman priests of India by their patrons, were described in detail. The descriptions indicated good geographical knowledge and in one case over 75 details of the land granted have been found. The Chinese records of the Tang dynasty show that a map of the neighboring Indian region was gifted to Wang Hiuen-tse by its king.Sircar, 326. In the 9th century, Islamic geographers under Abbasid Caliph Al-Ma'mun improved on Ptolemy's work and depicted the Indian Ocean as an open body of water instead of a land-locked sea as Ptolemy had done.Covington (2007) The Iranian geographers Ab≈´ Muhammad al-Hasan al-HamdƒÅnƒ´ and Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi set the Prime Meridian of their maps at Ujjain, a centre of Indian astronomy.Kennedy, 189 In the early 11th century, the Persian geographer Abu Rayhan Biruni visited India and studied the country's geography extensively. He was considered the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the western Indian subcontinent. He also wrote extensively on the geology of India.Salam (1984) In 1154, the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi included a section on the cartography and geography of India and its neighboring countries in his world atlas, Tabula Rogeriana.See Italian scholar Francesco Lorenzo Pull√® reproduced a number of Indian maps in his magnum opus La Cartografia Antica dell'India. Out these maps two have been reproduced using a manuscript of Lokaprakasa‚Äîoriginally compiled by the polymath Ksemendra (Kashmir, 11th century CE)‚Äîas a source. The other manuscript, used as a source by Francesco Pull√®, is titled Samgrahani. The early volumes of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also described cartographic charts made by the Dravidian people of India.Sircar, 330See Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 14th edition, volume XIV, 840‚Äì841. The cartographic tradition of India influenced the map making tradition of Tibet, where maps of Indian origin have been discovered. Islamic cartography was also influenced by the Indian tradition as a result of extensive contact. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached the subcontinent on 20 May 1498, anchoring off Calicut, on Malabar Coast. He would, with other Portuguese, navigate and chart much of the sub-continents coast line, within decades. These charts were rapidly reproduced, and appeared in say the 1502 Cantino planisphere. 16th century Portuguese navigational chart of the region Mughal era Maps from the 1590 Ain-e-Akbari, a Mughal document detailing India's history and traditions, contain references to locations indicated in earlier Indian cartographic traditions. Through the 16th century European explorers, and traders, such as Jan Huygen van Linschoten ventured into the interior, from the growing number or European trading posts, and expanded on and refined the previous navigational charts, with geographic detail. A series of geographies published under the title Itinerario (later published as an English edition as Discours of Voyages into Y East & West Indies), appeared in 1596, and graphically displayed for the first time in Europe detailed maps of voyages to the East Indies, particularly India. Map of Goa, in Linschoten's Itineraries, ca.1590 The seamless hollow Celestial globe was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589‚Äì90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce hollow metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology. These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.Savage-Smith (1985) The scholar Sadiq Isfahani of Jaunpur compiled an atlas of the parts of the world which he held to be 'suitable for human life'. The 32 sheet atlas‚Äîwith maps oriented towards the south as was the case with Islamic works of the era‚Äîis part of a larger scholarly work compiled by Isfahani during 1647 CE. According to Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008): 'The largest known Indian map, depicting the former Rajput capital at Amber in remarkable house-by-house detail, measures 661 √ó 645 cm. (260 √ó 254 in., or approximately 22 √ó 21 ft).'Schwartzberg, 1303 Colonial India For contributing to geographical knowledge about Asia, the pundit (explorer) and cartographer Nain Singh Rawat (19th century CE) received a Royal Geographical Society gold medal in 1876. A map describing the kingdom of Nepal, four feet in length and about two and a half feet in breadth, was presented to Warren Hastings.Sircar, page 327 In this raised-relief map the mountains were elevated above the surface and several geographical elements were indicated in different colors. The Europeans used 'scale-bars' in their cartographic tradition. Upon their arrival in India during the middle ages, the indigenous Indian measures were reported back to Europe, and first published by Guillaume de I'Isle in 1722 as Carte des Costes de Malabar et de Coromandel. With the establishment of the British Raj in India, modern European cartographic traditions were officially employed by the British Survey of India (1767). One British observer commented on the tradition of native Indian cartography: The Great Trigonometric Survey, a project of the Survey of India throughout most of the 19th century, was piloted in its initial stages by William Lambton, and later by George Everest. To achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry: * Curvature of the Earth * The non spherical nature of the curvature of the Earth * Gravitational influence of mountains on pendulums * Refraction * Height above sea level Thomas George Montgomerie organized several cartographic expeditions to map Tibet, as well as China.Nagendra (1999) Mohamed-i-Hameed, Nain Singh and Mani Singh were among the agents employed by the British for their cartographic operations. Nain Singh, in particular, became famous for his geographical knowledge of Asia, and was awarded several honors for his expeditions.In 1876, his achievements were announced in the Geographical Magazine. The awards and recognition soon started flowing in. On his retirement, the Indian Government honoured him with the grant of a village, and 1000 rupees in revenue. The crowning achievement came in 1876, when the Royal Geographical Society honoured him with a gold medal as the ‚Äòman who has added a greater amount of positive knowledge to the map of Asia than any individual of our time‚ÄîNagendra 1999. Modern India (1947 to present) The modern map making techniques in India, like other parts of the world, employ digitization, photographic surveys and printing. Satellite imageries, aerial photographs and video surveying techniques are also used.See Indian Express (1999). Modern map- making techniques on display. Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd. The Indian IRS-P5 (CARTOSAT-1) was equipped with high resolution panchromatic equipment to enable it for cartographic purposes. IRS-P5 (CARTOSAT-1) was followed by a more advanced model named IRS-P6 developed also for agricultural applications.

They took their name from the famous French painter Henri Matisse. Biography=Early history (1999-2002) Matisse was originally formed in 1999 by Aris Siafas, John Massouras, Andreas Ioannou and Petros Tsolis without making any significant actions as a band. The band became active, when they started performing and writing songs for the first time in January 1999. In the beginning of their career the band was making live performances, mostly in small venues in Athens. Still though, they didn't have enough money for recordings. Matisse have also supported many acts including Reamonn, Puressence, Shed Seven, The Frank and Walters, Drugstore. While recruiting keyboardist Kostas Synodinos they continued with the occasional live show and demo, until they signed a contract with Sony Greece in 2002. By winter of 2002, they began recording their EP 4 (Four), which was released in the summer of 2003. Days before the release, Ioannou left the band and was replaced by Grigoris Kollias (Greggy K). Breakthrough success (2005-2006) Two years after the release of their EP 4 (Four), in June 2005 Matisse released their debut album Cheap As Art which hit the #3 spot on Pop & Rock Magazine's \\"Best of the Year List\\". The lead single of the album She Smiles, became a radio classic. Enthusiastically received by the critics Cheap As Art set off the band to a great start. A few days after the release of their debut, Matisse opened the first day of the Rockwave Festival as supporting act for Garbage and Marilyn Manson. Their performance was welcomed by journalists and public alike. In the beginning of 2006, the band started writing material for their second album, with few changes in their line-up; Kostas Synodinos departed from the group and Petros Tsolis was replaced by Nikos Manosopulos. In December of the same year they also supported Kaiser ChiefsOfficial website in their live performance in Greece. In May 2007 their second album Toys Up was released. In 2007, Aris Siafas left the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by Alex Kavadias, a Greek-Australian singer. The band re-released Toys Up, in deluxe edition, with videos, remixes, as well as a new mix from their cover on Cyndi Lauper's song \\"She Bop\\" performed by their new singer Alex. Rock 'N Roll Mafia (2009) In 2009 the band released their third album, Rock 'N Roll Mafia, the lead single being the album's namesake, Rock 'N Roll Mafia.Last FM This is also the only album of the band with Alex on the vocals, who left two years later to pursue a solo career.

Vaupel (born May 2, 1945), is an American scientist in the fields of aging research, biodemography, and formal demography. He has been instrumental in developing and advancing the idea of the plasticity of longevity, and pioneered research on the heterogeneity of mortality risks and on the deceleration of death rates at the highest ages. Current positions Vaupel is the founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany (since 1996). He is also a research professor at Duke University and the director of its Population, Policy, Aging and Research Center. Vaupel is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, a regular scientific member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been involved in many endeavors and published over 20 books. Contributions Convinced that formal demography is the source of the discipline's strength, Vaupel has contributed to the methodological foundations of demography. In 2001 he was awarded by the Population Association of America the Irene B. Taeuber Award for his lifetime research achievements. In 2008 he received the Mindel C. Sheps Award for his work in mathematical demography. Vaupel has been a leading proponent of the idea of the plasticity of longevity. Many people believe there is a looming limit to human life expectancy. Vaupel's research shows that life expectancy is likely to increase well beyond the purported limit of 85 years. Furthermore, Vaupel and others (such as Bernard Jeune of Denmark) advanced a new proposition: that the human life span is not fixed, but is a function of life expectancy and population size. He and S. Jay Olshansky have had a disagreement about what this means in terms of future projections of the human life span. Vaupel's work also focuses on the nascent field of evolutionary demography. His research activities here strive to understand age-specific mortality in terms of the evolutionary processes that shape it. Because in his studies, particular attention is paid to mortality improvements at the end of the lifespan, Vaupel has been instrumental in the emerging field of research into supercentenarians as a population subset. The number of persons aged 110+ in a single European nation is rather small. Vaupel therefore began the push in 2000 by inviting experts from around the world to meet in international workshops and to found the International Database on Longevity, which provides information on individuals attaining extreme ages and permits demographic analysis of mortality at the highest ages.

This seems definitely to be incorrect, perhaps resulting from a confusion with his father who was Peirce. Charles de Lacy O'Mahony (9 June 1850 ‚Äì 31 October 1930), known up to 1901 as Pierce Mahony, and from 1912 also as The O'Mahony of Kerry,This article follows the practice of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in referring to O‚ÄôMahony by the name he was using at the time referred to. was an Irish Protestant nationalist politician and philanthropist, who practised as a barrister from 1898 to 1900. He was remarkable in having had successively three names, two wives and three faiths, and for being honoured by the Kings of two opposing countries in World War I. He should not be confused with his grandfather Pierce Mahony (1792‚Äì1853), a close associate of Daniel O'Connell who was elected as MP for Kinsale in 1837 but unseated on petition; or with his son Pierce Gun Mahony (1878‚Äì1914). Early life Born in Dublin to a Church of Ireland family, Mahony was the only surviving son of Peirce Kenifeck Mahony of Kilmorna, Duagh, County Kerry, and of Jane, daughter of Robert Gun Cuninghame, D.L., of Mount Kennedy, County Wicklow. His grandfather was Pierce Mahony, Repeal MP for Kinsale. His father died shortly after he was born. When he was six his mother married Col. William Henry Vicars, and the family moved to Leamington, Warwickshire. Mahony was educated at Rugby School and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he did not take a degree, but established an Irish Home Rule club and formed a friendship with his later Parliamentary colleague J. G. Swift MacNeill. Mahony went on to the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, where he won the Haygarth Gold Medal in 1875. In 1877 he married Helen Louise, only daughter of Maurice Collis, a member of the Royal Irish Academy. She died in 1899 and in 1901 he married a first cousin, Alice Johnstone, who died in her turn in 1906. An ancient stone cross taken (with permission) from the Bulgarian monastery at Banska stands over Alice's grave in the church cemetery at Ballinure in West Wicklow, Ireland. In 1913, his son Dermot O‚ÄôMahony married Grace Hill. Mahony was an Assistant Land Commissioner 1881‚Äì84, a magistrate in County Kerry and County Limerick, Poor Law Guardian at Listowel, a member of the Roads and Piers Commission under the Relief of Distress Act 1886, and a member of the Royal Commission on Market Rights and Tolls. Irish nationalism He was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Meath in the July 1886 general election, taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Charles Stewart Parnell's leadership in 1890, Mahony was one of the four Protestant MPs who supported Parnell. The two remained close, with Mahony entertaining Parnell in Kerry shortly before the latter's death in 1891.Lyons (1977), p.597 At the general election of 1892, Mahony was defeated in North Meath by the prominent land campaigner Michael Davitt, who had taken a particularly strong and clericalist line against Parnell from early in the crisis, by 54% to 46%. This general election was characterised by ferocious hostility to the Parnellites on the part of the Catholic Church. Mahony successfully petitioned the courts to set aside the result on the basis of clerical intimidation of the voters. In the re-run election in February 1893, Davitt did not stand, having been elected unopposed to a vacancy at Cork North East. However clerical Anti-Parnellite influence continued to be strong. The Times reported that \\"the priests...swarmed at all the polling stations, and kept the voters constantly in view\\".The Times, 23 February 1893. Mahony again lost, by the fractionally smaller margin of 53% to 47%. Mahony remained active in the Nationalist movement, and made three further unsuccessful attempts to return to Parliament. He stood as Parnellite candidate for Dublin St Stephen's Green at a by-election in September 1895 but failed to unseat the Liberal Unionist member, William Kenny. He contested another by-election for Dublin Harbour in 1915, but came well short of election with 24% of the vote. In the general election of 1918 he fought West Wicklow for the Irish Parliamentary Party but lost to the Sinn F√©in candidate Robert Barton by the particularly wide margin of more than four to one. Later career In 1898 Mahony was called to the Irish bar, and subsequently practised as a barrister. In 1900 he inherited an estate from an uncle and thereafter did not need paid work, instead devoting himself to philanthropy. In 1903 O‚ÄôMahony travelled to Bulgaria to undertake relief work among orphans who had fled from Turkish massacres during the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, and in 1904 opened St Patrick's Orphanage in Sofia. On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he unsuccessfully tried to prevent Bulgaria entering alliance with Germany, and after the war argued for Bulgaria to be exempted from war reparations. On 20 January 1915, he was awarded the Order of Civil Merit by Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. In 1913, O‚ÄôMahony supported the workers led by James Larkin in the Dublin Lockout. During the First World War he served as a member of the Irish Recruiting Council for Irish regiments, and in September 1915 visited the Leinster Regiment with some members of the Irish League who were visiting the front, where he made a long speech on Ireland and on having such a fine battalion.Bowman, Timothy: Irish Regiments in the Great War: Discipline and morale, p.24, Manchester Uni. Press (2003) For his recruiting work he was awarded a CBE in 1920, but declined it. Later in the year and resigned as Deputy Lieutenant of County Wicklow and as a magistrate in protest against British policy in the Irish War of Independence then in progress. While in Bulgaria, O‚ÄôMahony had joined the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, but he remained also a member of the Church of Ireland until 1927 when a new Rector forced him to choose between the religions. He then became a Catholic, in 1929, the year before his death. In commemoration of his relationship with the Bulgarian Orthodox church, in 1909, Pierce commissioned a fresco by Iliev Gannin, depicting Saints Methodius, Cyril and Patrick. This unique juxtaposition of important Christian saints can be found in the chapel at the monastery of St Nicholas near the town of Maglizh in Bulgaria. Some say St Patrick looks quite like Pierce O'Mahony. His son Dermot O'Mahony was a Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael member of the D√°il √âireann for Wicklow from 1927 to 1938. A street in Sofia is named Pierce O'Mahony Street in his honour. Asenovgrad-born Bulgarian theatre director Atanas O'Mahony (b. 1979) bears the name of the Irish philanthropist. Atanas' grand-grandfather Ivan was among the Bulgarian orphans adopted by Pierce O'Mahony and given his own family name. ReferencesPublications * Pierce Mahony and J. J.

The Ch√¢teau de Failloux (Castle of Failloux) was built in the 18th century in northeastern France. It is located in the commune of Jeuxey in the Vosges d√©partement, France, a few kilometers from the historical center of √âpinal. The castle takes its name from the local hamlet, Grande Failloux. Etymologically, the term \\"Failloux\\" derives from the unusual abundance of deciduous trees in an area generally dominated by coniferous trees. Although falling within the administrative area of the commune of Jeuxey, the site of Failloux is isolated from the village and is located closer to the town of √âpinal. The castle entrance has an ornamental wrought-iron gate designed by the workshops of Jean Lamour, who built the gates of the Place Stanislas in Nancy, in France. Introduction The site of Faillouox is steeped in five centuries of history. The first recorded mention of the site can be traced back to the year 1445. Although historians have been unable to establish an exact date for the construction of the castle, extant documents including a letter from the Duke of Lorraine, Francis III, dated July 3, 1736, and setting it up as fief of Failloux, confirm that a manor house was among the properties of Fran√ßois-L√©opold Masson, who thus became the first lord of Failloux.  Architecture  The features of manor house are similar to those common to many 18th-century stately homes and comprises two dovecotes, a bell-tower, outbuildings, and a park.  The castle  The 26 windows in the m√πain facade. The castle is a narrow building, long, and only wide, with a height of about , providing three floors and an attic. Three low-vaulted cellars provide the support for the building. At the time of its construction, the house had 21 rooms, one of which was used for indoor tennis. Some time around 1772, the rear part of the castle was widened, and fireplaces (√† la royale‚Äù (with a large mirror above) added to two reception rooms. In one of the fireplaces, an iron plate on the bottom of the hearth is decorated with a capped blazon of a royal crown and flowers with lily. The main staircase is made of 21 relatively low, wide steps of single blocks. The wrought-iron banister was made by the same workshop that supplied the entrance gates.  Courtyard  This is one of the two dovecotes that flank the main entrance. One has a baker's oven and a smokehouse for pork. The courtyard is a square, with two-story houses with slate four-sided hip roofs in the angles. The right-hand house still has a pigeon loft, and the ground floor has a well-preserved fireplace. Between these two houses, a wall supports a succession of surmounted cylindrical bars with spaded points. Two stone pillars, finished by a ballot box, support the grids of the entry. A stone alley leads to the castle. On its line is a fountain with water that comes out a head of a watery god. The whole is overcome by a large urn.  The roof  The bell dated from the 17th century and engraved ‚ÄúJesu Maria‚Äù located at the top of the roof. with four sides is covered with slates, and is dominated by a steeple of a bell dating back to 1625, and engraved \\"Jesus Maria\\". At the top of this steeple, there is a crescent. It is probable that this symbol is imported from Ottoman culture, which was very popular in the 18th century.  The gates  The gilded wrought iron gates of the Castle, realized by the workshops Jean Lamour, 1st half of the 18th century. by the famous ironworker Jean Lamour, who also made those that surround Place Stanislas in Nancy. The initials of the first owner appear in the high part of the gate (Fran√ßois-L√©opold Masson), and those of the Collinet de la Salle family appear in the low part. It is now enough to examine this gate to imagine the destination of the castle. On each side of the central parts, there is a succession of rubbles, violins, harps, fifres, bagpipes, horns and horns of hunting. The first instruments return to the pleasures of the music, or even the dance, the last seem invited to discipline hunting. By their decoration, the piles that support the gate give a movement of solemn base to the unit. During World War I in 1914, this gate would have been dismounted and hidden in a secure place for fear that the German enemy might steal it.  The park  The park of the castle, with the ornamental pond the castle, at the top of a staircase, the park extends on a surface from one hectare. It was used like a pleasure garden. In its center, a stone basin formed the starting point of four alleys (north, south, east, west). It heads a real formal garden. Today, there is a vegetable garden, a few vines, as well as a sheepfold and some animals.  The orangery  Built on the left side of the castle, the orangery was preceded by a small garden with in its center a water basin and a spray. It contained until 1919, extremely rare exotic plant species of any beauty. After this date, the owner of the time, a retired officer, back from the colonies, converted it into a transitory factory of buttons of mother-of-pearl, used to equip the soldiers of the many barracks of the area. It is not known whether it was built at the same time as the castle.  Failloux through the ages  As mentioned previously, it is almost impossible to give the exact date of the beginning and the end of the building work of the castle. It is known however that it already existed in 1736. Another thing is sure. The farm located on the left side of the castle is older. Two families of owners truly marked the history of the castle of Failloux: the Masson family and the Collinet de la Salle family.  Historical context  Until 1766, √âpinal and its area was French but was not attached to the Duchy of Lorraine. In 1670, the French captured the city of Nancy, and the duke Charles IV took refuge in √âpinal. The city, defended by the Count de Tornielle, was attacked by the troops of the marshall of Cr√©qui. This last seized the town of √âpinal on September 19 and its castle on September 28. The city was condemned to pay an exorbitant sum of thirty thousand French francs with Barrois and must demolish at its own expense the castle and the fortifications. These conditions, required on order of the king, were intended to frighten Lorraine. The castle was destroyed but the fortifications were destroyed only partially. The amount of money to be paid was much reduced after the rendering of the other Lorraine fortified towns. But the fall of the city represented a turning point: the city ceased being a fortified town. The city was francized gradually. In 1736, the duke Francis III, son of L√©opold and his wife the archduchess Maria Theresa, heiress of the House of Habsburg. Alsace was gradually annexed to the kingdom of France during the reign of Louis XIV. Because of that, Lorraine and Barrois became nearly a foreign enclave in its territory. Louis XV refused to see it pass to the hands of a great foreign power: the Empire, its hereditary enemy. By an agreement between Austria and France, Fran√ßois gave up Lorraine to become Grand Duke of Tuscany (an Austrian possession), and France accepted Pragmatic Sanction of the emperor. To spare feelings, the duchies were not immediately annexed in France but given for life to the father-in-law of Louis XV, the former king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who, since 1737, was the last sovereign duke. The country had been controlled in fact by a French-named chancellor. On the death of Stanislas in 1766, Lorraine and Barrois were reorganized and annexed to France.  The construction of the castle  Fran√ßois-L√©opold Masson, lawyer, adviser and prosecutor of the king in √âpinal, enjoyed rights and preferences of exception. In 1736, he was ennobled and built the castle. He thus became the first owner and became the first lord of Failloux. On August 13, 1761, Fran√ßois-L√©opold Masson, lord of Failloux, accommodates Ladies of France, Adela√Øde and Victoire, daughters of Louis XV, at the time of their passage to √âpinal, on the road of very in-vogue terms of Plombi√®res-les-Bains.  The Collinet de la Salle family  Two years after the death of F. L. Masson, on 21 July 1767, for problems of succession and because of the too great number of heirs, the estate was put on sale. In 1768, Fran√ßois Loyal, receiver of the sums of money of the town of √âpinal, and his wife, bought the fief of Failloux, which they resold four years later. On April 7, 1772, Charles-Fran√ßois-Xavier Collinet de la Salle, rider, lord of Fremifontaine and Bouzillon and his wife, Anne-Marie Magdelaine Maurice de Sarisming, each bought one-half of the stronghold of Failloux. He then became Seigneur of Fr√©mifontaine and Failloux. During the Revolution, the Collinet family of the Room would suffer. It would have been necessary to justify non- emigration of his wife (left in cure to Switzerland) and of her son so that the fief remains in the hands of Charles-Fran√ßois-Xavier. One of his cousins, Pierre-Maurice Collinet de la Salle, did not have as much chance, and was placed in front of Revolutionary Tribunal, condemned and executed in Paris, the same day as Charlotte Corday. With the death of Charles-Fran√ßois-Xavier Collinet de la Salle, which occurred in his castle on November 21, 1813, his three children inherited the Failloux and others. Following family arrangements, only their son Charles-Marie remained at it, the single owner until his death. When on June 1, 1863, he died, unmarried, at 89 years of age, it is the end of the fief of Failloux. It from then on was parcelled out in three parts: the castle, the farm of Grande Failloux, and that of Petite Failloux.  The Franco-Prussian War in Failloux  Map of the site of Failloux on a scale 1 to 4000, dated March 4, 1868. The castle of Failloux occupies a ‚Äústrategic‚Äù site with the accesses of the Epinal-native agglomeration. It makes it possible, indeed, to supervise the roads, which, coming from Rambervillers, give access, by Poissompr√©, to the suburbs of the Michaelmas and Ambrail, in the center of the city. In 1870, after the defeats at the borders and with Sedan, 250 national guards went to √âpinal for \\"to defend the castle of Failloux\\". It is there, which on October 12, 1870, held the ultimate combat that delivered to the Prussian armies, the defenders of √âpinal. It arises from the testimonies transcribed in \\"The army of the East\\" that: : \\"The battalion of the national guard of √âpinal, was composed of 7 companies of a total staff complement of approximately 1500 men. [‚Ä¶] The 6th company, without chiefs, sprang beyond the line of defence, and was thrown in the property of Failloux dominated on all sides by the enemy who was in wood neighbors. These some national guards are transferred soon attacked by a German cloud. [‚Ä¶] These Epinal-native troops did not cease facing the enemy whom they defied at very short distance (often with 100 meters), all disseminated behind the wood clusters, in the farm of Failloux. A long time, they were defended, but finally had to move back in front of the number and were partly disarmed and captive. There, especially, the national guard had to regret of the victims, six men died and eight wounded and 12 other prisoners.\\" The combat lasted four hours, leaving the prefect time to transfer his administration, the material of the railroad, the case of general treasury of a value of 4 million, and 400 wounded in a military hospital. Following this war, the castle remained French, as well as the department of the Vosges, which would never form part of Alsace-Lorraine.  Failloux in the 20th century  With the death of Charles-Fran√ßois-Xavier Collinet de la Salle in 1863, the estate of Failloux became nothing more but one simple place of dwellings and farms. The owners would follow one another in a number until the year 1960. One of them cut down an alley of oaks centenaries connecting the castle to the way of Failloux, located on the other side of the current expressway (RN 57). It also benefited from the withdrawal of the exotic plants located in the orangery, to make a factory of mother-of-pearl buttons of it. Surprisingly, less is known of the use of the castle at the 20th century than before. Some say it would have been used as an appendix with the prefecture of the Vosges during the world wars, others that it would have been a hospital.

The station, which began broadcasting in June 1961, is currently owned by KDUN, LLC. KDUN broadcasts at 50,000 watts in the daytime, the maximum power output permitted by the FCC for AM stations. At night, the station must reduce power to 633 watts to protect WBZ in Boston. Programming KDUN broadcasts an oldies music format. History=Launch as KRAF A construction permit was filed in September 1958 by Oregon Coast Broadcasters for a new standard broadcast station licensed to Reedsport, Oregon with transmitter and studios located on Bolon Island. The construction permit was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in March 1960 for a new daytime-only AM station, assigned call letters KRDP, broadcasting with 5,000 watts of power on a frequency of 1470 kHz. A request was made and granted in April 1961 to change to KRAF. Then on June 2, 1961, KRAF began regular broadcasting with Walter J. Kraus as the president and owner of Oregon Coast Broadcasters and Gless Connoy as the station's general manager. The KRAF callsign represented the \\"Reedsport and Florence\\" coverage area of the station. The station was marketed with the slogan, \\"Listening is heavenly on 1470\\". The KRAF call letters were first filed for in 1936 by Edwin A. Kraft and licensed to KRAF in Fairbanks, Alaska. In 1966, Gless Connoy purchased the station outright from Kraus. Wayne A. Moreland bought KRAF from the Connoy family on July 1, 1968. Becoming KDUN Wayne A. Moreland filed for and was granted a call letter change to KDUN in September 1969. Then Moreland's ownership of KRAF would prove short- lived. Brothers Steve and Jerome Kenagy's and J. Westley Morgan of Communications Broadcasting, Inc. were granted transfer of control on February 11, 1972. The new owners implemented a \\"middle of the road\\" music format. The KDUN call letters have a rich history as they were first assigned in 1921 as the radiotelegraph call sign aboard the ship \\"Ripple\\" owned by James T. McAllister. The Kenagy brothers shifted ownership of KDUN in March 1972 to a new company named KDUN Radio, Inc. The brothers maintained the \\"middle of the road\\" music format through the rest of the 1970s. In August 1973, KDUN was granted a construction permit to move the studio and transmitter site from Bolon Island (located on the site of the former drive-in theater) to Lower Smith River Road, its current transmitter location and the studios moved from the transmitter site into town in the early 1980s. Move to 1030 In March 1982, the station applied to the FCC for authorization to change their broadcast frequency from 1470 kHz to 1030 kHz, increase daytime signal power to 10,000 watts, and make some technical changes in their antenna system. The FCC finally granted the station a construction permit to make these changes on May 7, 1987. KDUN began broadcasting at the lower frequency and higher power in February 1998 and received their license to cover the upgrades on April 18, 1998. In April 1982, the Kenagy brothers applied to the FCC to transfer ownership of KDUN Radio, Inc., to their now-larger software company, Custom Business System, Inc. The transfer was approved by the FCC on April 23, 1982. In November 1985, CBSI announced that it was selling KDUN Radio, Inc., to Lyle and Eleanor A. Irons so that it could focus on the traffic and billing business. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 11, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on April 23, 1986. The KLLU years After a quarter-century of continuous corporate ownership, KDUN Radio, Inc., reached an agreement in June 1997 to sell this station to Shae Partners, LLC. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 5, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on September 15, 1997. The station's callsign was changed to KLLU on November 21, 1997. In July 1999, Shae Partners, LLC, reached an agreement to sell this station to the Broadcast Development Corporation for $200,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 24, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on August 29, 1999. Less than two weeks later, in early September 1999, Broadcast Development Corporation reached an agreement to sell this station to Pamplin Communications Corporation subsidiary Pamplin Broadcasting-Oregon, Inc., for $350,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 29, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on November 1, 1999. Back to KDUN The station was granted a new construction permit in August 2000, this time to increase the daytime signal to 50,000 watts and the nighttime signal to 630 watts. KLLU began broadcasting at the higher power in March 2001 and the station received its license to cover the changes on June 18, 2001. The station was reassigned its heritage KDUN call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 25, 2002. In January 2006, Pamplin Broadcasting-Oregon, Inc., CEO Robert Boisseau Pamplin Jr. reached an agreement to sell this station to Bill Schweitzer, doing business as WKS Broadcasting, Inc., for a cash price of $220,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 5, 2006, and the transaction was consummated on August 29, 2006. At the time of the sale, KDUN was broadcasting a country music format. KDUN went temporarily silent on November 27, 2007, when the station's owners were unable to pay their electricity bill due to \\"financial problems with its operations\\". According to their April 2008 filing with the FCC, new owners for KDUN were being sought. KDUN today In May 2008, WKS Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Sand & Sea Broadcasting, LLC. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 23, 2008, and the transaction was consummated on August 6, 2008. On September 1, 2013, KDUN was sold to Post Rock Communications, LLC. The current format is Oldies AC. Former on-air staff Delilah Rene, a native of Reedsport, Oregon, and host of a nationally syndicated American radio show featuring song requests and dedications, got her first job in radio at KDUN in the mid-1970s after winning a speech contest. While still attending junior high school, she reported local news and sports as the host of \\"Delilah, On the Warpath\\". In 2007, Rene was a finalist for the Radio & Records Industry Achievement Award as Syndicated Personality/Show of the Year. Traffic and billing software In 1975, KDUN's owners were frustrated by the volume of paperwork then required for scheduling advertising, billing advertisers, and producing each day's commercial lineup, they purchased a Wang Laboratories minicomputer and, along with engineer Wes Lockard, invented software to handle these traffic and billing tasks. As the brothers took on these tasks for other stations in the area, they realized that a market for computerized traffic and billing existed and, in 1978, they founded Custom Business Systems, Inc. At its peak in the mid-1990s, CBSI software was in use by roughly one-third of the commercial radio stations in the United States and by broadcasters in 24 other countries. In 1999, it was described as the \\"world's largest supplier of business software for the radio broadcast industry\\". CBSI and the Kenagy brothers sold their interest in KDUN in 1985. CBSI itself is now a part of Marketron Broadcast Solutions.

Warsaw Pogrom Holy Cross Church, Warsaw, in the 1890s A contemporary Jewish-Russian historian, Simon Dubnow, gives details of this event: on Christmas Day 1881 the outbreak of panic after a false warning of fire in the crowded Holy Cross Church resulted in the deaths of twenty-nine persons in a stampede. It was believed that the false alarm was raised by pickpockets, who used the ruse to allow them to rob people during the panic. A crowd gathered on the scene of the event and some unknown persons started to spread a rumor, which subsequently proved to be unfounded, that two Jewish pickpockets had been caught in the church. The mob began to attack Jews, Jewish stores, businesses, and residences in the streets adjoining the Holy Cross Church.Simon Dubnow History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Avotaynu, 2000, , p. 342 The riots in Warsaw continued for three days, until Russian authorities (who controlled the police as well as military in the city) intervened, arresting 2,600 people. During the Warsaw pogrom two people were left dead and 24 injured. The pogrom also left about a thousand Jewish families financially devastated. In the months afterwards about one thousand Warsaw Jews emigrated to the United States.Brian Porter When Nationalism Began to Hate, Oxford University Press, 2002, , p.162 The pogrom worsened Polish-Jewish relations, and was criticized by such members of the Polish elite as writers Eliza Orzeszkowa, Boleslaw Prus and several other notable activists. Historians Simon Dubnow, Yitzhak Gruenbaum, Frank Golczewski and Magdalena Micinska have argued that the pogrom might have been instigated by the Russian authorities, trying to drive a wedge between Jews and Poles or show that pogroms, increasingly common in Russian Empire after the assassination of the tsar Alexander II in 1881 (in that period over 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in Russian Empire, notably the Kiev and Odessa pogroms), Pogrom , based on Alina Ca≈Ça, Hanna Wƒôgrzynek, Gabriela Zalewska, \\"Historia i kultura ≈ªyd√≥w polskich. S≈Çownik\\", WSiP were not a Russia-only phenomena. Magdalena Micinska, INTELIGENCJA ≈ªYDOWSKA W POLSCE, 2002Dubnow wrote: \\"Evidently, someone had an interest in having the capital of Poland repeat the experiments of Kiev and Odessa, and in seeing that the \\"cultured Pole\\" should not fall behind the Russian in order to convince Europe that pogroms were not exclusively a Russian manufacture.\\" See Klier and Lambroza for more details. However historian Michael Ochs disagreed with this explanation, citing insufficient evidence.John Doyle Klier, Shlomo Lambroza, Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History, Cambridge University Press, 2004, , p.182 Ochs calls those explanations conspiracy theories, arguing that they fail to present what the Russian authorities would have gained from the pogroms. He notes that period from 1863 to 1881 was witnessing the increase of anti-Semitism in Poland, with disillusionment among Poles with the idea of assimilation of the Jews was growing, and hence there was less need for the Russian authorities to orchestrate a pogrom, which might have been spontaneous.

He was also a Conservative Party politician, and sat in the House of Commons between 1902 and 1922.  Life  Edward Allen Brotherton was born 1 April 1856 at 2 Tiverton Place, Ardwick Green, Manchester to Theophilus Brotherton, a yarn agent, and Sarah nee O'Donnell. He is also related to educational reformer Edward Brotherton and the 1st MP for Salford, Joseph Brotherton. At the age of 14 Brotherton made an unsuccessful attempt to go to sea which lasted only two days. He left school at 15 working at a hardware store before finding a position as an assistant at a chemical laboratory. At this time, he also attended evening classes in chemistry taught by Henry Roscoe at Owens College, Manchester. At 19 he began work at a chemical works in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. In 1878 Brotherton, with backing from his family, became the founding partner of Wakefield company Dyson Brothers and Brotherton. The company manufactured ammonium sulphate, taking advantage of plentiful supplies of ammoniacal liquor produced by the local coal and gas industry and supplied ammonia to the textile industry and for use in the extraction of gold. In 1882 Brotherton married Mary Jane Brookes, daughter of artist and designer Warwick Brookes. Sadly their marriage was short-lived as Mary died in childbirth in 1883. The child, a daughter also died. Brotherton never remarried and kept in contact with Mary's family for the rest of his life. In 1889 Brotherton's partnership with the Dyson brothers ended and he continued the business alone under the name Brotherton and Co. The company would go on to become one of the largest private chemical companies in the country expanding into coal tar distillation and manufacturing products such as pitch, TNT and creosote during the First World War. The business also moved from headquarters in Wakefield to City Chambers, Leeds. Brotherton's nephew Charles Ratcliffe, husband of Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, later succeeded his uncle as head of the business and took the name Brotherton. The company continued after Brotherton's death until 1957 when it was acquired by British Chrome and Chemicals. The company later traded under various names such as Brotherton Chemicals Ltd, Brotherton Speciality Products Ltd and Brotherton Esseco Ltd. Brotherton spent his later years at Roundhay Hall, Leeds (now Spire Leeds Hospital) and Kirkham Hall, Yorkshire where he died on 21 October 1930. His burial at Lawnswood Cemetery, Leeds on 24 October 1930 was attended only by the male members of his family, at his stipulation.  Collecting  During his lifetime Brotherton amassed an impressive collection including books, manuscripts and letters. His first foray into collecting was, however, unsuccessful. In February 1922 he attempted to buy a 15th century Towneley manuscript of Wakefield Mystery Plays but was outbid by the American book dealer A.S.W. Rosenbach. His niece, Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, was so disappointed by the loss that Brotherton took her to the bookseller Bernard Quaritch where they bought a first edition of Andrew Marvell's Miscellaneous Poems instead. Aided and encouraged by Dorothy, Brotherton continued to add to what would become a large and varied collection and later employed J Alexander Symington as librarian. In 1926 Brotherton published a catalogue of the highlights of the collection. Brotherton enjoyed showing his treasures to visitors to his home and welcomed many scholars to his private library.  Brotherton Library  A bust of Edward Allen Brotherton, 1st Baron Brotherton, on display in the Brotherton Library, University of Leeds. In 1927 Brotherton donated ¬£100,00 to the University of Leeds for a new library. In June 1930, in one of his last public acts, he laid the foundation stone for the building, at the same time announcing that he would bequeath his collection of books and manuscripts to the university. The Brotherton Library opened in 1936 and still houses his collection which includes 35,000 books, 400 manuscripts, 4,000 deeds and 30,000 letters. On his death Brotherton's will also revealed a further bequest of ¬£100,00 to the university. Today the Brotherton Circle honours the generosity of alumni and friends who include a gift to the University of Leeds in their will.  Political career and honours  Brotherton was elected as Alderman/Councillor for Leeds City from 1911-1915 and was Lord Mayor of Leeds in 1913‚Äì14. Brotherton was also an Alderman of Wakefield from 1901, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Wakefield 1902‚Äì1910 and 1918‚Äì1922. He was first elected at a by-election in March 1902, after his predecessor Lord Milton inherited a peerage on the death of his grandfather. He was created a Baronet, of Wakefield in the West Riding of the County of York, in 1918 and raised to the peerage as Baron Brotherton, of Wakefield in the County of York, in 1929, for \\"political, public and charitable causes\\". The titles became extinct on his death in October 1930, aged 74. During the time that Brotherton served as Lord Mayor of Leeds his niece, Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, took the role of Lady Mayoress. As Lord Mayor he raised the West Yorkshire Regiment (Leeds Pals) at his own expense, in return receiving the title of Honorary Colonel.

Neighbourhood Support is a community-led movement that brings people and neighbourhoods together to create safe, resilient and connected communities. Neighbourhood Support works closely with New Zealand Police and a number of organisations and other partners to equip neighbourhoods to improve safety, be prepared for emergencies and support one another so that our communities are great places to live. History Neighbourhood Watch was introduced to New Zealand as a crime prevention initiative in the late 1970s. The initiative evolved to become Neighbourhood Support New Zealand, a community-owned and managed organisation with a wide- ranging interest in crime prevention and community safety. The national body of Neighbourhood Support, Neighbourhood Support New Zealand, became an Incorporated Society in 2000.Certificate of Incorporation, Neighbourhood Support New Zealand Society Incorporated 2000, Incorporated Societies Register, Companies Office, New Zealand In 2001 it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the New Zealand Police. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to establish and promote a collaborative working relationship between Neighbourhood Support New Zealand Incorporated and the Police. Objectives Neighbourhood Support aims to make homes, streets, neighbourhoods and communities safer and more caring places in which to live. This is primarily achieved through the establishment of a \\"Neighbourhood Support Group\\", comprising anywhere from several to dozens of residential households in a single street or suburb. Groups throughout a suburb or a wider town or city area are then coordinated by a Neighbourhood Support New Zealand Member Organisation which are often a stand alone Trust or Incorporated Society, but may also be operated through a local Council. These organisations are usually ran via a Neighbourhood Support Area Coordinator or Manager (either in a paid or voluntary position) as well as other volunteers including a Board or Trustees depending on the organisation's structure. Community Constables based at Police stations often also play a role in supporting their local Neighbourhood Support. Being involved in Neighbourhood Support comes in many shapes and forms. Households which are part of a Neighbourhood Support Group may meet regularly or only as needed, stay connected online or by email, host barbecues or events, volunteer to be a Street Contact, undertake some neighbourhood projects, or even start a separate group. When someone joins a Neighbourhood Support group, they will: ‚Ä¢ Have a great way to get to know the people that live around them. ‚Ä¢ Receive emails and alerts that will keep them up-to-date with news from Neighbourhood Support community partners, including New Zealand Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, and the National Emergency Management Agency. ‚Ä¢ Gain tips and resources to improve household and neighbourhood safety. ‚Ä¢ Learn how they can be better prepared for emergencies, and more. The primary objective of Neighbourhood Support is to create a well- connected community which helps to improve the safety, resilience and well- being of all residents. Neighbourhood Support is always free to join. Typical Scheme The following description is based on the framework adopted in New Zealand but is similar in intent to schemes known as \\"Neighbourhood Watch\\" in other countries. Neighbourhood Support National Body Neighbourhood Support New Zealand is the national body that oversees all Neighbourhood Support New Zealand Member Organisations which span all 12 Police Districts and support over 220,000 households across the country. Neighbourhood Support Group Small clusters of households in a single street or adjoining houses in nearby streets form what is known as a \\"Neighbourhood Support Group\\". This can comprise anywhere from several to dozens of households in a single street or suburb. Information about important community news, severe weather alerts, local crime, crime prevention and community safety advice is provided to neighbours through participation in a Neighbourhood Support Group. Members exchange contact details and valuable household information which is typically managed by their local Coordinator. They also meet as needed to discuss local issues or to simply stay in touch and build connections. Some groups may have regularly organised meetings or social functions. Each group is usually supported by a \\"Street or Group Contact\\" person who is one of the members of the group. Larger groups may have several \\"Contact\\" persons. The role of the Street or Group Contact is to ensure that the group contact lists are correct and up-to-date as people arrive or leave the area, and contact lists are provided to group members and to their Area Coordinator. Newsletters and updates received from the Area Coordinator are also distributed to members. They may also wish to keep their Area Coordinator updated on any serious incidents in their area or rising concerns. They may also seek assistance from their Area Coordinator to plan an event such as a Community Safety Day or local meeting with Police or Fire and Emergency. Neighbourhood Support Area Suburbs, towns, cities or sections of a city are usually coordinated by one or more \\"Area Coordinators or Managers\\" whose role is to assist Neighbourhood Support Groups with important local news and information for their area, provide a conduit for Police to distribute crime alerts, and pass on other community safety tips. In some cases, a single Street Contact may also act as an informal Area Coordinator, tying together a number of groups in the same suburb or street. Neighbourhood Support Governance Governance of the Neighbourhood Support movement in New Zealand, is provided through a national organisation Neighbourhood Support New Zealand which is overseen by a Board. Board members are elected voluntary representatives from a Neighbourhood Support New Zealand Member Organisation. A Police representatives nominated by New Zealand Police national headquarters attends Board meetings representing the Commissioner, and has a liaison and advisory role. A formal Memorandum of Understanding is established between Neighbourhood Support New Zealand and the New Zealand Police to make clear the nature of the relationship, and the obligations of each party. Regionally, activities within each district are overseen by an elected and voluntary District Representative with boundaries aligned with those of the Police Districts.NZ Police ‚Äì Organisation, Wikipedia, \\"New Zealand Police\\" See also *Neighbourhood Watch (UK) ‚Äî UK organisation *Neighborhood Watch ‚Äî US organisation ReferencesExternal links *www.neighbourhoodsupport.co.nz Neighbourhood Support New Zealand (National body) *www.police.govt.nz New Zealand Police homepage Category:Organisations based in New Zealand Category:Crime in New Zealand Category:Neighborhood watch organizations ","title":"Neighbourhood Support"},{"id":"13416140","text":"Lustreware vase in \\"Royal Lancastrian Ware\\", c. 1923, designed by William S Mycock In this early 20th century image, Pilkington's factory and kilns can be seen on the right of the image, with Fletcher's Canal in the foreground. Pilkington's Lancastrian Pottery & Tiles was a manufacturer of tiles, vases and bowls, based in Clifton near Pendlebury, Lancashire, England. The company was established in 1892 at Clifton Junction, alongside Fletcher's Canal. The company employed talented designers, the most famous of whom was Charles Voysey. Production of art pottery was stopped at the end of the 1930s, although tile production continued. Today the site is occupied by Pilkington's Group Plc. History In 1889 the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company sank a pair of pit shafts with the intention of working the coal seams lying adjacent to the geological feature known as the Pendleton Fault. However, the work became increasingly difficult due to the excessive quantity of water that was encountered. When it became clear that the work would not produce coal, the four Pilkington brothers decided to use the marl that had been encountered to make glazed bricks, however, the marl was found to be unsuitable for this purpose. By chance, the secretary of the coal company knew William Burton, a chemist working for Josiah Wedgwood and Sons. Burton tested the marl and suggested that a more commercial venture would be to make tiles. Decorative tiles were at that time becoming quite fashionable and they were in high demand. The site of the proposed factory had many advantages--it was close to Clifton Junction railway station, it was adjacent to Fletcher's Canal and there was abundant coal nearby in the local Wet Earth Colliery, a short distance away along the same canal. William Burton joined them as Manager, and his brother Joseph as Assistant Manager. Production began in January 1893.Bergesen, 223 By 1903 the factory had developed an opalescent ceramic glaze called Lancastrian, named after the county of Lancashire where the factory was sited. It became popular in Pilkington's Lancastrian line of pottery. A later glaze took its name from Manchester, the Cunian glaze. Other famous glazes were used, e.g. sunstone, eggshell, fiery crystalline, aventurine, merged and curdled glazes. Glazes of different textures were also produced. These \\"fruit skin\\" glazes had surfaces like orange peel or apricot. The pottery's work was exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908 in London. William Burton (1863‚Äì1941) Thrown vase with mottled glaze, Royal Lancastrian, 1938. William Burton was a chemist with the Wedgwood Company at the Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent, with an extensive knowledge of the ceramics industry. It was he who suggested that the red clay and marl found at Clifton was suitable for production of ceramic tiles. Decorative tiling was becoming a popular trend at the time, and represented a long term commercial proposition. Burton oversaw the production of fine pottery in the style of ancient Persian and Chinese potters, employing fine artists and commissioning work from some of the top designers of the time. Burton was a friend of H. G. Wells and was inspired by the Arts & Crafts Movement, and in particular, the workings of William Morris and John Ruskin. He chose artists and designers that shared this inspiration, and Lancastrian Pottery works became high quality examples of the art pottery that was part of the wider Arts & Crafts Movement. John Chambers (1869‚Äì1945) Burton invited John Chambers to join him in the running of the Pilkington's Tile & Pottery Company. Chambers was often responsible for designs produced in what became known as the 'Persian style', and was head of the architectural pottery department throughout his time with the company. Royal Lancastrian Glazes High lustre glaze finishes were produced from 1906, and are particularly associated with the designer Gordon Forsyth, who joined the company in the same year.Examples of Gordon Forsyth's works at the Victoria & Albert Museum The name 'Lancastrian' was used for the new ware due to the location in the county of Lancashire. Later on, 'Cunian' glazes were named after the site's close proximity to Manchester. Glazes of different textures were used. Some of the more famous glazes used by the Royal Lancastrian Pottery Company included sunstone, eggshell, crystalline and aventurine. One of the most notable, Lancastrian Lustre, was exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908. In 1913 King George V and Queen Mary visited Lord Derby, in whose home several Lancastrian vases were proudly displayed. It was then that permission was granted for the royal warrant to be used and the firm became Pilkington's Royal Lancastrian Pottery Company. After the First World War The First World War was a difficult time for all ceramic companies, and Forsyth, who had left to fight, only returned briefly after the war. Increasingly, the tile side of production dominated. \\"Lapis Ware\\", with special underglaze colours, was introduced in 1928. But production of pottery (as opposed to tiles) ceased in 1938.Bergesen, 223 A distinctive type of ware produced in the last years were glazed with a formula including uranium compounds, which gave a bright orange colour, but have the disadvantage of being slightly radioactive; \\"it has been suggested by experts that one should not store a large number of such pieces in a closed cabinet. Opening the door after a prolonged period could be equivalent to receiving an X-ray\\".Bergesen, 224 A pottery studio was opened in 1948, making \\"attractive decorative wares in the Contemporary style of the 1950s\\". It closed in 1957, but there was another period in 1972-75.Bergesen, 223-224 In 1971 the Thomas Tilling Group took the company over; it was in turn bought by British Tyre and Rubber in 1983.Bergesen, 223-224 NotesReferences *Bergesen, Victoria, Bergesen's Price Guide: British Ceramics, 1992, Barrie & Jenkins, *Pottery productions from 1900 to 1975 * * External links *Pilkington's Tiles Group PLC Website *Pilkingtons Lancastrian Pottery Society Website *Early history of the Pilkington's Tile and Pottery Company * Tile and Architectural Ceramic Links Category:English pottery Category:Design companies established in 1892 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1892 Category:1892 establishments in England Category:Irwell Valley Category:British companies established in 1892 Category:Art pottery ","title":"Pilkington's Lancastrian Pottery &amp; Tiles"},{"id":"13416152","text":"Dobe may refer to: *Dob√™, a village in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China *Dobe, Slovenia, a settlement in the Municipality of Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia ","title":"Dobe"},{"id":"13416159","text":"The Impossibles is an Australian rock band, started by Bow Campbell of Front End Loader, Dave Aston of Trout Fishing in Quebec, Brendan Smyly of The Andy 500 and Geoff Martin of Imp as a gentler outlet of musical expression.

It may be used as a reason to deny any insurance on such individuals.http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how- insurance-companies-measure-risk/ Early work The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee, Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London. Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.  Present study  The subject is still being studied actively. Research into accident- proneness is of great interest in safety engineering, where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system. One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.  Statistical evidence  Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.  Doubt  However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a distinct, persistent and independently verifiable physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.  Nature and causes  The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown. Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included absent-mindedness, clumsiness, carelessness, impulsivity, predisposition to risk-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.

She was the second woman to be elected to Parliament after Elizabeth McCombs and first to enter parliament as a result of a general election. Stewart saw herself as the \\"Member for Everywoman\\" and felt obliged to concentrate on issues in the interests of women, children and those in need. In 1941, she was joined by Mary Dreaver, also of the Labour party, bringing the total of female MPs to two. Stewart was defeated in the next election held in .

He was a pupil of Santo Peranda. Several of his works are in the churches and public buildings of Venice, particularly in San Giorgio Maggiore, and in the church of the \\"Padri Croceferi\\".  Life  The Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, where the main works of Matteo Ponzone are kept. According to several sources, Ponzone was born in Venice, identified as ¬´Mathi et Simon fiol de noble Patron Claudio Bolzon et Agnesina Negro equal in Madonna¬ª born in the parish of Saint Moses November 9, 1583.Lino Moretti, New Documents on Ponzone and Forabosco, in Art Veneta, XL, Milan 1986. Some other sources reported his date of birth approximately in 1586 in Rab, in the far north of Dalmatia, that time owned by Republic of Venice. Matteo Ponzone operated mainly in Venice, unless an interim period of ten years spent in Dalmatia, leaving their works in various locations of the coast.According to Moretti (cit. .), the Ponzone received a series procurement in Dalmatia thanks to the fact that his brother was the archbishop of Split Sforza from 1616 to 1640. Ponzone was young student of Jacopo Palma the Younger, and was related to the painter Sante Peranda, who was probably one of his teachers and whose influence is evident in the work of Ponzone. He joined the Fraglia dei Pittori of Venice from 1613 to 1633, being one of the busiest in town throughout this period. In his workshop he had as pupils Antonio Zanchi, Andrea Celesti, Pietro Negri, and Giovanni Carboncino, who assist him in various paintings orders of the last Venetian period. The large amount of work left in situ adequately define the importance for the history of Venetian painting of the first '600, although the significance was detected only in recent years.See in this regard Rodolfo Pallucchini ,The Venetian painting of the seventeenth century, Mondadori, Milan 1981. Similarly, the caliber of orders received -those of particular importance include works in the churches of San Giorgio Maggiore, Madonna dell'Orto, and San Cassiano - account for the great success and wide contribution of Ponzone to Venetian artistic history.  Major works =In Venice Flagellation of Jesus.

There are also Miani people within the Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan who are related to the Mianis settled in the Gomal plains. History Mianis are believed to be a Shirani tribe that descended from the Sarbani. The Shiranis have three sub- tribes, namely Marani, Miani and Babar. Maranis still refer to themselves as 'Shirani' as they are the main sub-tribe, but Babars and Mianis identify themselves as completely separate tribes. A number of clans and sub clans of Miani tribe were Powindahs, who migrated between Afghanistan and Pakistan, afterwards large number of them settled in the Gomal Plains along with their other earlier settled tribesmen. Gomal plains The Mianis lived in the Gomal Plains of the Tank District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan Though initially a nomadic tribe, Mianis settled in the Gomal plains by or before 1850. The estimated population of nomadic Miani tribe was about 800 in the 1870s. They were a semi-independent group that lived along the Tank border, except for the hot season, when they moved into the hills. They were living among a small tribe, the Ghorezais (or Ghwarazai), of whom there were about 350 people. The larger tribe in the area was the Wazir, of whom there were a couple thousand people. An important technique that the British used to manage the frontier was to make certain tribes responsible for monitoring who had passes to travel on particular routes into the hills. They called this ‚Äúpass responsibility‚Äù. The Bhitannis first accepted pass responsibility on the Tank frontier. Then, pass responsibility for the Girni, Murtuza and Manjhi posts was assigned to the Miani and Ghurezai tribes in 1876. That year, they also accepted responsibility for monitoring passage into the Gomal Valley, as did a portion of the Ghwarazai that lived away from the other clan members of the Kakar tribe of Baluchistan. In 1879, when Tank was raided by the Mehsuds and an uprising took place, wherein the tribes believed that the British control over the area is weakening, Mianis along with Suleman Khels and Kharotis looted a number of villages around Tank.Imperial Frontier: Tribe and State in Waziristan By Hugh Beattie The same fact has been narrated by Evelyn Berkelen Howell, that in January 1879, Tank was raided by the Mahsud.

The consequences way of carelessness are often undesirable and tend to be mistakes. A lack of concern or an indifference for the consequences of the action due to inattention may partake in the origin of carelessness. Carelessness has been hypothesized to be one possible cause of accident-proneness.  Associated areas of concern = Education  In any education environment, careless mistakes are those errors that occur in areas within which the student has had training. Careless mistakes are common occurrences for students both within and outside of the learning environment. They are often associated with a lapse in judgment or what are known as mind slips because the students had know-how to have avoided making the mistakes, but did not for undeterminable reasons. Given that students that are competent of the subject and focused are most likely to make careless mistakes, concerns for students exhibiting careless mistakes often turn toward neurological disorders as the cause. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is known to impact performance in school due to the culmination of its symptoms of exhibiting abnormalities in their levels of attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The concern regarding students making careless mistakes in school being driven in the direction of ADHD, without any other logical explanation, is not entirely invalid. In addition, making careless mistakes is a symptom of ADHD that is commonly studied. Although largely studied for its prevalence in children and adolescents, there is still limited knowledge about the origin of the disorder.  Research and data collection  Data is information or evidence that is gathered from an environment or sample to be processed and interpreted to find and provide results for a particular study. Research data has an important role in the field of psychology, providing insight to be analyzed, shared, and stored for future reference. Particularly, survey data collection refers to the gathering of information from subjects in a sample by empirical research methods in order to attain a comprehensive examination of a situation or specific study from the individuals. The validity of the a responses of the subjects in the sample is important, as they provide the basis for which a conclusion can be drawn in that study. In survey data, careless responses are those that are defined to have not been entirely authentic or to be lacking in relevance to the topic being examined in the study. Also referred to as random response, this is an area of concern in research studies and data collection due to the possible impacts that error data could have on the significance conclusion to be drawn later. Attention and interest are both factors that have a possible influence on the validity of an individual's responses. Careless data can lead to lower reliability which will ultimately decrease the intensity of correlation, if one exists. A method known as data screening is recommended as a means of discerning between response data that is valid and that which is careless.

He had previously served as the first Venetian Duke of Crete, and two terms as Podest√† of Constantinople (1218-1220 and 1224-1227). During his first term, following the capture and mysterious end of Peter of Courtenay, Tiepolo acted as de facto ruler of the Latin Empire, negotiating treaties on behalf of the Empire with Egypt and the Seljuk Turks.Donald M. Nicol, Byzantium and Venice: A study in diplomatic and cultural relations (Cambridge: University Press, 1988), pp. 162-164  History  Probably born in the latter part of the twelfth century, Jacopo assumed the post of Duke of Crete (Italian: duca di Candia) around the year 1212. During his tenure, Venetian dominion over Crete was challenged considerably by the Greek locals, culminating eventually in its capture at the hands of Marco Sanudo. His success, however, was short-lived, as a Venetian fleet soon arrived, forcing him to evacuate the island. Jacopo was elected Doge on 6 March 1229, his predecessor Pietro Ziani having abdicated the month before. At the election, a stalemate was reached between Jacopo and his rival Marino Dandolo, both of them having twenty votes each. This was rectified by drawing lots, leading to Tiepolo's victory. This is thought to have sparked the feud between the Dandolo, who were an old aristocratic family, and the Tiepolo, who were seen as nouveau-riches.John Jeffries Martin and Dennis Romano, Venice Reconsidered: The History and Civilization of an Italian City- state, p. 77-81 In an attempt to prevent the recurrence of a split vote in future elections, the number of electors was increased from forty to forty- one. Prior to ascending the ducal throne, Tiepolo also had to sign a traditional promissione, seriously limiting his powers.John Julius Norwich A History of Venice (London: Penguin Books), p. 151 Despite Emperor Frederick II's cordial visit to Venice in 1232, relations between the Empire and the Republic deteriorated. Consequently, in 1239, Venice joined the Lombard League and fought against Ezzelino III da Romano, a powerful ally of the Emperor. In the subsequent fights the Doge's son, Pietro Tiepolo, was captured at the Battle of Cortenuova on 27 November 1237. He was later taken to the Emperor's castle at Trani and hanged, worsening relations further. Jacopo Tiepolo's dogate brought significant change to Venice. In 1242 the Doge produced Statutum novum, by which Venetian civil law was codified in five books of statutes. This process of codification had been first initiated by Enrico Dandolo some fifty years earlier. Additional to this, Tiepolo had granted land in 1234 to the Dominican and Franciscan orders, upon which two churches were built. These were the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo ('San Zanipolo') and the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. Tiepolo abdicated in 1249 and retired thereafter to his private residence at Sant' Agostino, in San Polo. Andrea Dandolo's Chronicon Venetum records that he vacated the Doge's Palace on 2 March and died on 19 July. He was buried in the church of San Zanipolo.Jacopo and Lorenzo's Tiepolo ark, in Venice. He married twice, firstly to Maria Storlato, and following her death in 1240 to Valdrada of Sicily. Maria bore him three children: Lorenzo, who served as Doge from 1268 to 1275; the aforementioned Pietro, podest√† of Padua; and a third son named Giovanni. Valdrada bore him two children, both young at the time of their father's death, and whose identities remain unknown.

Furthermore, the sensor network will be able to detect many water-related environmental factors that affect the health of humans such as pollution and biological changes. Disasters on rivers and coastal waters are also detected. In studies of dike stability, about eighty dikes will be destroyed and establish, ultimately, a relation between the sensor readings and the future of the dike. Hence the (in Dutch) good-sounding name IJkdijk: dijk=dike and ijk is from the Dutch word ijken=to calibrate (models). Clearly the most urgent goal here is to forecast dike failures. In contrast to popular belief, most disasters with dikes occur because they are too wet and not because they are too low. Another major source of dike failures are streams of water flowing through the dike, ultimately destroying, through erosion, the dike from the inside. A detection system for these failure mechanisms might be cheaper and safer than the alternative: over-dimensioning by adding more clay. As dike improvements are very costly, e.g. 500 euros per meter, there is ample financial room to pay for the sensor system. The IJkdijk will also increase the geophysical understanding of dike behavior. A better understanding of dikes, expressed in a sensor-based early warning system in dikes, prevents unnecessary and costly over-dimensioning. That is good news for the owners of millions of kilometers of dikes that exist nowadays and the developers of millions of kilometers of dikes that will be constructed in the future. Driving forces Failed section of peat levee at Wilnis, August 2003 Dike innovations are no luxury. With the expected climate changes, the land subsidence, the increased economic value of the low-lying areas as a result of economic prosperity, and the declining acceptance of calamities by the general public, many countries of world need to invest substantially in flood protection to keep the risk of flooding at an acceptable level. Especially developing countries seek new lands for housing and industry which are frequently found close(r) to rivers. Here building dikes is equivalent to economic growth. As investments in dikes are in the same order of magnitude as investments in economic development, developing countries will benefit most from smarter, cheaper and safer dikes. Developments in communication and sensor technology have advanced so far that it seems possible to utilize this new technology to effectively support the management and monitoring of flood protection works in an economically efficient manner. This seems to open up ways to offer cheaper and better alternatives for the traditional methods of embankment monitoring, maintenance and improvement. However, most of the recently developed sensor technology still needs to be tested under field circumstances, to prove its applicability and suitability. Recently, prototypes of dike conditioning systems have been constructed that aim at maintaining the dikes continuously in optimum shape. Inline with jargon from the sensor communities we call such systems actuators. Design goals River embankment at Bergambacht after field test, November 2001 In many cases, protection against flooding is not only determined by the height of the embankments, but merely by the strength of the embankments. Most of the weak spots in the embankments collapse because of a lack of strength with regard to stability or internal erosion rather than be flooded. The key to a better utilization of the existing embankments and thereby reduction of the flood risks is to find ways to determine the very processes which undermine the strength of embankments with a high degree of certainty. The system must ultimately be able to sense weaknesses in tens of thousands of kilometers of embankments. Determining failure processes of embankments is still a research field in development. It is clear that the strength of embankments depends on a large number of parameters which are hard to determine. Calculation methods for embankment strengths are available, but there seems to be a significant uncertainty, or gap, between the calculated strengths and the actual ones. Because of the huge investments involved and the increasing costs of maintenance and management for the regional water boards this is a very unsatisfactory situation. Systematic experiments are needed to calibrate the models. This enables the design of correctly sized embankments. Furthermore, a primary design goal are models, when fed by real time data from sensors in dikes, calculate the short and long time future of the embankment system. Most importantly they can report if immediate safety issues are at stake. IJkdijk consortium The IJkdijk (‚ÄòCalibration dike‚Äô (or embankment, levee)) is an initiative of the research institutes TNO ICT and , the Dutch national water board research foundation STOWA (Stichting Toegepast Onderzoek Waterschappen), regional development agencies NOM (Investerings- en Ontwikkelingsmaatschappij voor Noord-Nederland) and IDL. The plan emerged to build test embankments to enable the systematic testing of various types of new sensor, actuator and communication technologies, both during construction and the entire lifetime of an embankment. The embankments and the corresponding data infrastructure are set up in such a way that ensures that any future technologies can be tested. Furthermore, the IJkdijk is an open innovation environment where companies have been invited to join the experiments. About 50 companies are enlisted now. IJkdijk results The IJkdijk enables to overstress embankments to failure using diverse and realistic methods in a controlled and reproducible manner. This will provide knowledge of: *sensor, actuator and communication technology for embankment monitoring; *enhanced geophysical knowledge of failure mechanisms and computer models that forecast these failure mechanisms; *the practical and economical feasibility of systems tested for use in large-scale applications; *technologies for large scale sensor, actuator and communication technology that support GEOSS technologies; Thus, the IJkdijk project provides valuable insights and practical technologies for organizations dealing with water management, e.g. regional water boards and the national department of public works ‚Äì everywhere in the world. New technologies Several new (sensor) technologies may contribute to a more accurate, cheaper and/or faster determination of the relevant parameters in the various processes which may lead to embankment failure, resulting in a better picture of the actual strength and the current protection level of the embankment and enabling measures in a more timely and location-specific manner. This is of great importance. Intensive monitoring of the strength: *reduces costly over-dimensioning of embankment reinforcements, or the alternative, widening and deepening of the river system; *enables transparent and reproducible decision-making during imminent calamities; *enables improved determination of the effectiveness of innovative reinforcement technologies; *increases the accuracy of the results of periodical safety assessments of embankments, such as the five-yearly safety assessment in the Netherlands enforced by the Dutch law, providing a continuously up-to-date picture of the actual safety situation; *may contribute to establish the priorities and effectiveness of measures such as the river realignment works currently in preparation for the Lower Rhine river system in the Netherlands. There is a growing need for new methods to measure the various key parameters related to embankment safety. But solutions exist, while new solutions are under development. Testing new technologies Although there is a growing need for a more continuous and objective manner of measuring and monitoring, at the same time there is too little knowledge to evaluate the favourability of current technologies. There are a number of reasons for this: *There are no generally accepted selection criteria for applying a specific technology; *Most available technologies may have a proven track record in laboratory conditions or in fields different from those in which the regional water boards operate, but they have no track record in real field situations relevant to the water boards; *Often, there is insufficient clarity for the district water boards about the profitability of the different technologies and systems in practice: what will this investment yield? *There is general need among the regional water boards, but the actual need has not yet crystallized. In view of the gap between the suppliers for embankment technologies on the one hand, and the regional water boards with their questions on the other hand, the test facility of IJkdijk is being set up. The fieldlab shows and evaluates technologies for an audience of water management bodies. Furthermore, the new insights in the geophysical processes of dikes and their monitor systems can be translated to well-considered actions, embankment designs and accurate maintenance planning. Sensor technology in and around embankments to forecast future failures Project objectives The first IJkdijk, built in December 2006, destroyed by wave overtopping experiments in November 2007. It is 14 meters long, 4 meters high and wide The objectives of the IJkdijk project are: #To study the applicability of sensor technologies in controlled field situations for the inspection and monitoring of flood defences as performed by the water boards; #To develop know-how on the development of embankment failure mechanisms with the use of applicable sensor technologies to develop a warning system for embankments, levees and dams; #To use sensor technologies to investigate the current state of embankments in greatest detail over thousands of kilometers. #To stimulate the business prospects of those companies who are involved with the project. The commercial parties will focus on development of the technologies, while the research institutions will concentrate on development of knowledge. The failure mechanisms which are to be monitored will be central in the project. In a brainstorm session with several experts from regional water boards, the department of public works and the inspecting authorities, the following questions have been formulated from the point of view of the water management bodies: *What processes occur within embankments and what are their effects on potential failure mechanisms? *What are the indicative parameters and what is the relation between these parameters and the occurrence of a failure mechanism? *Which decisive actions can be distinguished when a calamity is imminent? *Which technologies are suitable to measure the indicative parameters in existing embankments? How to choose from the technologies offered? What should be the spatial intensity and the frequency of the measurements? *What are the costs and benefits for the implementation of new monitoring technologies? In the initial phase of the project these questions will be addressed and converted into experiments to be conducted. Technical facilities The first dike at the opening of the IJkdijk facility on November 2, 2007. The yellow construction is a wave over topping simulator that is able to flood the land side of a dike with 14m3 waves. The IJkdijk provides an infrastructure for to connect various sensor and actuator systems. It supplies them with energy and fixed and wireless communication means. Furthermore, a camera system and weather monitor is present to augment any other observations. The infrastructure is developed in several phases, allowing flexibility and, above all, the possibility to learn and improve. Initially, only the infrastructure to conduct the first experiments and the reference measurements will be implemented, and the network infrastructure required for the connection of the sensors for subsequent experiments. The following are considered: *An application platform with a number of basic applications (GIS visualization, command and control facilities, ...); *A multiparty data acquisition, data publishing and analysis infrastructure; *A regular network for the permanent sensors; *The permanent sensors; *Access points to the network for the experiment-specific sensors. These will be based on both cable and wireless network technology; *A power source. Over time, the infrastructure will grow based on the demands and requirements of the experiments to be conducted. The next figure shows a plan view of the location with the spatial planning of the larger elements planned so far. Experiments A movie that shows the last wave thrown over a dike at the opening of the IJkdijk facility on November 2, 2007 The intention is to study systematically a wide range of geophysical processes in embankments. At first, a series of experiments is conducted in which previously applied technologies such as CTD divers, flux meters and humidity meters are used. These will be read continuously via remote (wireless) network monitoring. As stated in the table above, experiments are always combinations of a failure mechanism to be studied, a loading scheme, and several measuring methods. At present, experiments are in preparation related to stability, erosion due to wave over- topping, sliding due to steady state overflow and internal erosion (piping). Apart from experiments to increase the knowledge of failure mechanisms, there will also be experiments that aim more specifically at testing new sensor technologies and their relevance to flood defence management. Together, both types of experiments will contribute substantially to the effectiveness and efficiency of embankments both in the Netherlands and abroad. A gaping hole was created by the wave over topping experiment on November 2, 2007. The Macrostability Experiment The dike that collapsed on Saturday September the 27th at 16.02h was part of an experiment that gathered data about the stability of dikes. Furthermore, several sensor systems were tested in the experiment. More than a terabyte of data was obtained, a globally unique data set. The experiment was the first scientific success of the IJkdijk. The dike was roughly 100m long, 30m wide and 6m high and consisted of a nucleus of white sand and a shell of clay. A drainage system was placed at the bottom of the sand nucleus, allowing the addition or removal of water. Containers were placed on top of the dike, eventually to be filled with water. The subsoil was charted carefully, whilst the dike contained numerous proven and experimental sensor systems. In addition to that, the dike was carefully monitored from the outside by lidar and visual and infrared camera systems, and, of course, numerous people. When the dike was completed, on Friday September 26, a ditch was cut in the soil and subsoil. After 16 hours, at 08.00h on Saturday 27 of September 2008, the waterlevel in the dike was raised. At 16.02h, the dike collapsed.

The family moved to York sometime prior to 1752 where Peckitt worked in his father's glove making business before establishing himself as a glass painter in Colliergate, York. He married Mary Mitley, daughter of the sculptor Charles Mitley on 3 April 1763The Register of Marriages in York Minster, Illustrated with Biographical Notices 1681 to 1762. By Robert H. Skaife, The Mount, York (1873). and the couple had 4 daughters. Peckitt worked throughout his life on the maintenance of the medieval glass in York Minster as well as painting new windows there. He also undertook commissions for cathedrals, churches and houses throughout England. He produced windows for a number of colleges including the \\"fabulous\\" Alma Mater window for Trinity College. He died on 14 October 1795 and is buried in the church of St Martin-cum-Gregory, York. His wife made a memorial window to him in the church and it is placed next to a memorial to two of his daughters by Peckitt himself. Glass painting and stained glass By Peckitt's time, the medieval art of manufacturing stained glass had been lost and ‚Äúall that survived were the painting of enamels on to glass and the process of silver staining‚Äù. Although most of the work produced by Peckitt was painted glass he did experiment with stained glass and produced windows incorporating it, unlike his contemporaries. He ‚Äúrealised that colour is the sine qua non of Stained Glass‚Äù.Armitage, E. Liddall, \\"Stained Glass\\", Leonard Hill (Books) Limited, 1959 He continued these experiments throughout his life and in 1780 he patented an invention \\"for blending Coloured and Stained Glass\\". Although his contributions to the technical development of the craft have been well recognised and documented his draughtsmanship has sometimes been criticised;‚Äù his work has little merit in either design or colour‚Äù.A History of the County of Yorkshire: the City of York,1961 He attempted to resolve this by employing established draughtsmen such as the Italians Biagio Rebecca and Giovanni Battista Cipriani to draw cartoons for him.

The Radical Party's ideology found its roots in the principles of the 1789 French Revolution, upholding the values of liberty, equality, solidarity, participation and well-being. It had been created in the middle of the 19th century as a response to the conservative liberals then at power, and mainly represented the middle classes. It finally succeeded in being in power due to the Popular Front left-wing coalition, although its cabinets were fragilized by constant parliamentary instability. Aguirre Cerda (1938-1941) The first Radical President, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, was a teacher and lawyer of the University of Chile, a perfect example of the socio- economical categories supporting the Radical Party. He was elected in 1938 as a candidate of the Popular Front, under the slogan \\"Gobernar es educar\\" (\\"to educate is to rule\\"). He narrowly defeated the conservative candidate Gustavo Ross, mostly because of the political backlash caused by the Seguro Obrero Massacre which followed an attempted coup d'√©tat by the National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNS), intended to take down the rightwing government of Arturo Alessandri and place Ib√°√±ez in power. The fascist MNS had merged in the Alianza Popular Libertadora coalition supporting Carlos Ib√°√±ez, but after the attempted coup, Ib√°√±ez opposed Ross, lending indirect support to Cerda. Pedro Aguirre Cerda promoted the development of the technical-industrial schools as a means to promote the formation of technicians for the nascent industrialization of the country. He also created thousands of new regular schools and the growth of the university system to cover the whole of the country. A strong earthquake shook Chile on January 24, 1939, killing more than 30,000 people and destroying much of the infrastructure. Cerda's cabinet thereafter created the Corporaci√≥n de Fomento de la Producci√≥n (CORFO) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization as well as launching important public works. In the same time, the Empresa Nacional del Petr√≥leo (ENAP) oil state company was created, as well as ENDESA electricity company, the Compa√±√≠a de Acero del Pac√≠fico (CAP) steel holding and the Industria Azucarera Nacional (IANSA) sugar company. This was the basis for the industrialization of Chile. The German-Soviet Non Aggression Pact of 1939 during the Second World War led to the dismantling of the left-wing coalitions, as the Comintern then denounced the Popular Front strategy. However, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, the Chilean Communist Party joined again the government. During his first year he had to face the military opposition to his plans, that boiled over with the Ariostazo in August 1939, led by General Ariosto Herera and Ib√°√±ez. The leaders of the attempted putsch, in particular General Herera, was strongly influenced by Italian fascism, where he had been military attach√© in the 1930s. Furthermore, Cerda also campaigned for a Nobel prize for Gabriela Mistral, which only came to fruition under his successor, Juan Antonio R√≠os. On September 3, 1939, 2,200 Spanish Republican refugees landed in Valpara√≠so on board of an old cargo ship, the Winnipeg, which journey had been organized by the Special consul for Spanish emigration in Paris, the poet Pablo Neruda. In 1941 due to his rapidly escalating illness, Cerda appointed his minister of the Interior, Jer√≥nimo M√©ndez as vice- president, and died soon after, on November 25, 1941. Juan Antonio R√≠os (1941-1946) The left-wings' coalition remained intact after President Cerda's death, united by a common opponent, General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. The Democratic Alliance (Alianza Democr√°tica) chose as candidate a member of the conservative wing of the Radical Party, Juan Antonio R√≠os, who defeated Ib√°√±ez in the February 1942 election, obtaining 55,7% of the votes. R√≠os' presidency was marked by parliamentary instability, caused by rivalries between different political tendencies in his cabinet, and renewed influence of the Congress. The Chilean Communist Party opposed R√≠os who had initially chosen neutrality and refused to break off diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers, while the right-wing accused him of complacency with the Left. At the same time, the Chilean Socialist Party accused him of being too light on large firms and to abstain from passing labour legislation protecting workers'. In 1944, the Radical Party itself presented to R√≠os a serie of propositions which he deemed unacceptable. Those included the break-off of relations with Francoist Spain -- diplomatic and especially economic pressure had caused him to finally break off relations with the Axis Powers in January 1943 -- the recognition of the USSR and a cabinet exclusively composed of Radicals. By breaking off relations with the Axis, President R√≠os made Chile eligible for the United States' Lend-Lease program, and obtained loans necessary to help achieve an economic recovery. The close relations that emerged with the United States were, however, problematic for him at home. Furthermore, his refusal to implement the Radical Party's propositions (made in 1944) caused the resignation of all of the Radical ministers, leaving the President without a party. These internal divisions partly explained the right-wing success' during the 1945 legislative elections, which were a debacle for the Socialists and the Communists, who obtained close to no seats in Parliament. The Radicals themselves lost a number of seats. Furthermore, the repression of riots on Plaza Bulnes in Santiago, leading to several deaths, gave another reason for criticisms against the President, and led to the resignation of part of the cabinet. Finally, shortly after the war, in October 1945, his entire cabinet resigned in protest of a state visit he made to Washington, D.C.. Economically, he faced labor unrest at home, brought about, in large part, by the drop in copper prices worldwide. Faced with a cancer in terminal stage, he gave up his presidential powers in January, 1946, to his Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Duhalde V√°squez, who acted as Vice-President until his death on June 27, 1946. Gonz√°lez Videla (1946-1952) Then senator Pablo Neruda. For the second times in five years, a presidential election was held on September 4, 1946, opposing the Radical candidate Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla to the physician Eduardo Cruz-Coke as representative of the Conservative Party, Bernardo Ib√°√±ez for the Socialist Party and Fernando Alessandri Rodr√≠guez for the Liberal Party. The Radicals, who had chosen as candidate a member of its left-wing, did not succeed in reviving the Democratic Alliance left-wings' coalition, as the Socialist Party decided to go alone for the elections. However, the Radicals did ally themselves with the Communists, the poet and Communist senator Pablo Neruda leading Gonz√°lez's electoral campaign. Commemorative stamp on the Declaration on the Ant√°rtica Chilena Province. Gonz√°lez was elected with 40% of the votes against 29% for the conservative candidate, Cruz Coke, and 27% for the liberal candidate Alessandri Rodr√≠guez. Since Gonz√°lez did not reach the necessary 50%, he had to be confirmed by Congress. He was duly confirmed on October 24 that year, following various negotiations between the parties, which led to the creation of a composite cabinet, including liberals, radicals and communists. Once in the presidency, Gonz√°lez had a fallout with the communists. Following the municipal elections, during which the Communist Party highly increased its representation, the PCC demanded more cabinet seats, which Gonz√°lez refused to grant. On the other hand, afraid of the successes of the PCC, the Liberal Party withdrew from the cabinet. In June 1947, incidents during a strike affecting the public transports in Santiago led to several casualties and the proclamation of a state of siege in the capital. In August and October 1947, various strikes struck the carbon mines in the South, jeopardizing the government. Finally, President Gonz√°lez's travel to the region succeeded in bringing back tranquility. A few days afterwards, the miners of Chuquicamata initiated another strike, prompting Gonz√°lez to make increasing use of emergency laws. Finally, under the pressure of the United States, Gonz√°lez enacted a Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy (Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia, aka known as Cursed Law, Ley Maldita) which outlawed the Communist Party and banned more than 20,000 persons from the electoral lists. The detention center in Pisagua, used during Iba√±ez's dictatorship (and which would also be used during Pinochet's dictatorship), was re-opened to imprison Communists, Anarchists and revolutionaries, although no detainee was executed this time. Prominent Communists, such as the senator Pablo Neruda, fled into exile. He also broke relations with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact states. A pro-communist miners' strike in Lota was brutally suppressed. Demonstrations against what the communists called la ley maldita (\\"the damned law\\") led to the declaration of martial law, but were successfully repressed. Gonz√°lez's new supporters, which approved of his anti-communist stance, were the two right-wing parties, the conservatives and the liberals. He constructed a new cabinet made up of conservatives, liberals, radicals, some socialists, and members of the small Democratic Party. Gonz√°lez's tough stance against social movements led to protest demonstrations, allegedly in an intent to repeat the events of the Bogotazo in Colombia. However, these were quickly repressed, while Gonz√°lez's government also had to confront itself, on the right-wing, to an attempted military coup which aimed at bringing back to power Carlos Ib√°√±ez, the Pig trotters' conspiracy (complot de las patitas de chancho), thus named because the coup leaders met in a restaurant which specialized on this Chilean dish. He immediately ordered an investigation and the arrest of the coup leaders, including the head of the operation, General Ram√≥n Vergara. Ib√°√±ez, however, was absolved of all responsibility. In the parliamentary elections of 1949, the pro-government parties triumphed. However, the unity between right-wing parties and radicals and socialists did not last long. Radicals were unhappy with the economic policies of the right-wing Finance Minister, Jorge Alessandri, no matter how successful they were in controlling inflation. When a protest by government employees broke out in 1950, the radicals immediately declared their support for the protesters' demands. The right-wingers responded by resigning from Gonz√°lez's cabinet. By losing the liberal and conservative support, Gonz√°lez lost the pro-government majority in Congress. He was of course unable to achieve much thereafter, but he did manage to do significant improvements for women's rights. Gonz√°lez's cabinet had the first woman minister, he appointed the first woman ambassador, and created the Oficina de la Mujer. Despite this political, social and economical instability, Gonz√°lez's government did manage some important successes, including the complete integration of women to political life, the remodeling of the city of La Serena, the development of an Antarctic policy with the creation of the Ant√°rtica Chilena Province -- Gonz√°lez was the first chief of state of any nation to visit Antarctica, and the Gonzalez Videla Antarctic Base was named after him -- and the determination along with Peru and Ecuador of the of the Exclusive Economic Zone.

The Principal is David Munn. History Aviation High is located in Clayfield, Brisbane, near the Brisbane International Airport and Toombul shopping centre. It has had a number of name changes over the years; ‚ÄòHendra Secondary College‚Äô, as it was known previously, opened on Tuesday 29 January 1963 as Hendra State High School.Aviation High - School History In 1990 the name changed to Hendra Secondary College, and provided not only education to students, but also to adults who could enroll in the school and participate in grades 10-12. The Principal is David Munn who was appointed in Semester 2 2013. There are three sporting houses at Aviation High, Miller, Hinkler and Kingsford-Smith. They are named after famous Australian aviators Robin Miller, Bert Hinkler and Charles Kingsford-Smith respectively. The competition between the houses are tight in the annual Cross-Country, Swimming, Athletics and Intra-School sport. The extra-curricular activities offered by Aviation High are often utilised by not only students, but also members of staff. Two activities are key to the aviation focus the school has, the 'UAV Program' and the 'Rocketry Group'. The UAV program is a successful entrant to the annual UAV Outback Challenge, held at Kingaroy and Calvert in alternative years. The school won the event in 2009, and several students have received the Airmanship Award, for displaying diligence and sportsmanship during the 2 day event. The Rocketry Group participates in the Australian Youth Rocketry Challenge, winning the event in 2011. The UAV Challenge is held by Engineering Teacher Steve Wright and Aerospace (Aeroskills Technology) Head of Department Jack Clarke. It is widely utilised with several teams fielded each year, and supported by companies such as Hobby King, which donated several components when the UAV program was decimated by floods in 2015. The Rocketry Group is facilitated by the Science Department, consisting of a smaller group including Physics and Aerospace teachers. However the group is used primarily for experience in componentry by junior grades before gaining the necessary skills for the more advanced UAV program. The school has 11 main buildings, A, B, C, D, E, H, J, K, L blocks, the Hall and the Canteen. A Block is mainly computer rooms, with one science lab in the lower part of the building. B block is where the Communications department have many rooms. A Technology lab and a Computer workshop, leased to the Rotary Club of Nundah are the exceptions. A dedicated Macintosh Lab, where Apple iMac's are used, and a Recording Studio, are also located in this block. C block is a multi-use block, with the Main Administration, Maths and Science classrooms being located here. D block is the Aeroskills Technology Block, where Manual Arts and Graphics takes place. The block has 3 workshops and one classroom, for Graphics. A laser cutter is located in this block. E block is an annex to A block, with a Multi Media Room (Theatre) and Career Education being housed here. H block is where the Hospitality kitchens are located, as well as theory classrooms, and a cabin-crew training area, with actual seats from a Boeing 767 being used for realism. J block is the dedicated Science block, with 4 science laboratories and a special room for Flight Simulator's inside J block. Most Science classes are held here, and are all fitted with smart-boards as standard. K Block is another name for the Library. The Library houses over 1000 books, and a gym underneath for HPE classes. There are also 2 annexes for classes to be held, or presentations to be given. L Block is where Art classes are held. Inside is a studio, and a Mac Lab. Outside is a Fire-powered kiln, for clay works completed over the year. Next to L block is the Hall, which is used for Futsal, Basketball, Assemblies and (once) plane storage. The hall is well used. The Canteen is a popular place at Aviation High, with very fresh and hot food being prepared by a very specific chef. No. 220 Squadron, Australian Air Force Cadets house their headquarters in a demountable building at Aviation High. Location The school is located near to Centro Toombul Shopping Centre which is a hub of public transport. The Toombul and Eagle Junction Railway Stations are only a few minutes walk away and the school has a bus stop outside, utilised by many students. Its unique location near the Airport Link Tunnel also allows several students easy access to school, especially people not local to the school's catchment. \\"Gateway to Aerospace Industries\\" programme In 2004, the school became part of the \\"Gateway to the Aerospace Industries\\" programme. This programme added elements to the curriculum at schools around the state, in order to give students an environment that was relevant to their careers in the aviation industry. It does this by incorporating aviation themes and topics into each subject, as well as by promoting pathways to aviation careers. By the end of 2006, the Aerospace Project had been so successful that the Premier Peter Beattie MP announced the establishment of Aviation High on the existing Hendra Secondary College site. Classes commenced in January 2007 under the new name. The Aviation Part Aviation high includes try's to include aviation into all of its subjects, such as making mathematical questions aviation related. (E.g. Plane fuel amount x = Distance x). But year nine onwards, it also has classes dedicated to aviation (Such as avionics). Also, there are lunch time and after school programs/activities such as; UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Club, Flight simulator Club, Hangar/engineering club and more. All of These are accessible to all the students years 7-12. Partnerships The school has partnerships with companies offering entry into courses relating to aircraft maintenance and cabin-crew training, especially Aviation Australia, as well as partnerships with TAFEs for students to access vocational training. Aviation High staff and students are at an advantage due to the close partnerships and relationships with aerospace industry partners, as well as direct-entry offers to courses at Griffith University and QUT, amongst others. Enrolment The enrolments at the beginning of 2015 stand at 376 students. Also, the Combined Pilots and Learners group (CPL) have made their name in Canberra by sending a number of students down on a tour of Canberra, visiting the Australian War Memorial and the Australian Defence Force Academy. The USA trip also is popular, with students traveling to NASA Space Camp, and later, California. A new tour has recently been announced, taking students to the Western Front and other historical battlefields in Europe. The tours now happen in alternating years.

Knighted in 1971, he was created a life peer as Baron Lowry, of Crossgar in the County of Down, on 18 July 1979, in the early months of the Thatcher government. Early life His father was former Ulster Unionist Member of ParliamentODNB and Attorney General for Northern Ireland William Lowry. His mother was a niece of Sinn F√©in activist, Robert Wilson Lynd.Obituary: Lord Lowry; The Independent; 18 January 1999 He attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read Classics, achieving a double first. Military During the Second World War, he fought with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in Tunisia, followed by the Royal Irish Fusiliers before becoming a Major in 1945. He has since held the title of Honorary Colonel for *38th Irish Infantry Brigade - 5th Battalion and 7th Battalion *Royal Irish Rangers- 5th (Volunteer) Battalion Law He was admitted to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1947. He was a High Court Judge in Northern Ireland from 1964 until he became Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in 1971, when he was also made a Northern Ireland Privy Counsellor. Prior to the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 coming into force, Lowry excluded confessions made by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) suspects in British Army detention on the grounds that they were not made voluntarily. The introduction of the Act reduced the scope of what was inadmissible. Lowry did not exclude self-incriminating evidence alone as insufficient to convict upon, and in R v. Gorman[1974] NI 152 he found that the Northern Ireland Act 1972 s. 1, by retrospectively validating the conferment of powers of arrest under the regulations, rendered lawful the otherwise unlawful arrest and subsequent detention of Gorman. Lowry was unable to implement Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as it was not incorporated into UK law until the Human Rights Act 1998. In 1975, Lowry was appointed by Merlyn Rees to chair the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention, an unsuccessful attempt to replace the collapsed Sunningdale Agreement. In 1977, John Hume challenged a regulation under the 1922 Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland), which allowed any soldier to disperse an assembly of three or more people. Lowry held the regulation was ultra vires under Section 4 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which forbade the Parliament of Northern Ireland from making laws in respect of the British Army. In 1980, Lowry partly excused the actions of two Royal Ulster Constabulary members of the Glennane gang convicted of murder and bombing by saying they acted under the \\"powerful motive... that more than ordinary police work was justified to rid the land of the pestilence which had been in existence\\". This was criticised by the Historical Enquiries Team of the Police Service of Northern Ireland as \\"difficult to conceive of a statement more fundamentally flawed or calculated to destroy the confidence of a large section of the community in the court's independence and probity\\".HET report, Micheal McGrath Lowry presided over some of the Diplock court cases. He also presided over the supergrass trial in 1983 where Kevin McGrady, a former IRA member, gave evidence which led to the conviction of seven out of ten defendants. As a result, Lowry became an IRA target, narrowly missing death on at least three occasions. In 1982, having just survived a hail of IRA bullets, he proceeded to give a planned lecture at Queen's University, Belfast. He was an honorary Bencher of the King's Inns, Dublin, and of the Middle Temple, and he was a Law Lord.

Paul Haber was born of Polish Jewish ancestry in the Bronx in 1937. He won countless American and Canadian handball titles. Haber took an overlooked sport and turned it into a publicized one. Haber appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in 1970. Numerous magazines featured him including Sports Illustrated, Ace, and Argosy. It was not just Haber's ability on the court that caught national media attention. Haber would clobber the straight arrow handball players and then wind up in jail or a hospital after days of being on a bender with various females. He supported himself giving handball and golf lessons, playing cards, pool, board games, and betting on his handball matches. Haber lived day-to-day forgetting each night's escapades and capers in anticipation of the next one. He lived a lifestyle that would have ruined most professional athletes.

Haber was notorious for his daily hours and hours on the court and playing with outstanding defense. He is buried in San Diego, California. Haber's peak years for national handball single and doubles titles were from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. In this time, he won five four-wall singles championships, three three-wall doubles championships, and one three-wall singles championship. His primary doubles partner was Armando (Paul) Morlos.

Melissa Dougherty joined the band in 2009 after the departure of founding bassist, former CKY bassist Vern Zaborowski. Ostrander, Lyons and Dougherty recorded The Santa Fe EP, which they self-released on September 30. The band sold limited edition signed artwork copies off of their website. The EP gained more exposure when it landed TV placements for 'Friday Night Lights' and 'Melrose Place'. Both shows featuring 'Sideways Walking', a song Ostrander says is about trying to quit smoking. The band was also featured on the season finale of Gossip Girl on May 17, 2010 with their rendition of Bob Dylan's 'Don't think twice it's all right'. The song quickly became the band's number one seller on iTunes. Based on the success of the Santa Fe EP the band decided to release another EP in early 2010, but then decided to record a full length once they realized they were going to be on the upcoming Twilight Eclipse soundtrack. The album, entitled Speak-ahh, will be released on April 26 via RockHampton Records.Type3Media: Eastern Conference Champions announce new album It is said to be the biggest departure to date from the band's already unique sound.

The shell apex is blunt (more pointed in other Viviparus species). The shell has 5.5-6 weakly convex whorls. The last whorl is relatively large compared to that of other Viviparus species. The umbilicus is narrow.Species summary for Viviparus viviparus. AnimalBase, last modified 26 October 2013, accessed 4 June 2014. The animal can lock itself behind a round lid adorned with concentric striations (the operculum) , allowing it to protect itself-for several months if necessary - from dehydration. Once closed the operculum is flush with the opening of the shell.The operculum is attached to the dorsum and to the rear foot of this mollusc, the body of which is wide and T shaped and whose colour varies from spotted grey to greenish to orange.His mouth has a radula and a respiratory siphon opens on the right side of the head, feeding gills located in front of the heart. This trap also allows the animal to filter the water.There are two short tentacles; the eyes are on the external side of each tentacle.

They are often found in deep water.They are sometimes found in dense clusters (reaching thousands of individuals) on submerged branches and on various man-made objects present under water. More rarely, they are present more scattered in bottom mud, and then are much more discreet. They are also found in canals, artificial ponds, the water behind dams and in reservoirs but usually not in small isolated standing waters.Jakubik B (2012) Life strategies of Viviparidae (Gastropoda: Caenogastropoda: Architaenioglossa) in various aquatic habitats: Viviparus viviparus (Linnaeus, 1758) and V. contectus (Millet, 1813). Folia Malacologica, 20(3), 145-179 (r√©sum√©) They require high oxygen content. Feeding Viviparus viviparus species feeds on plankton and organic microdebris in suspension in the water and picked up through the siphon which allows the animal to breathe while filtering the water.This filter feeding habit makes it popular with owners of ponds or aquariums where they are known to consume filamentous algae, some microalgae, cyanophytes and waste solids and thus help to purify and clarify the water.They may however carry some parasites. Reproduction As its latin name suggests, it is a viviparous (oviviparous) snail, a rare phenomenon among snails. The female gives birth to live young, after producing eggs that hatch internally. The naturalist Jan Swammerdam, was the first to recognize the viviparous character of this species to which he gave the name of Cochlea mirabilis and Cochlea vivipara but he seems not even have understood that there were males and females in this species (most other snails are hermaphroditic). Then in 1863 √âmile Baudelot clearly states that among the paludines (river snails) there are two distinct sexes \\"The male system extends from the anterior end of the right tentacle to the top of the spire. We may consider it four distinct portions, which are going from top to bottom, the testis, vas deferens, seminal reservoir and the penis.'' .Baudelot E (1863) Recherches sur l'appareil g√©n√©rateur des Mollusques Gast√©ropodes (Th√®se de zoologie), Imprimerie de L. Martinet. The male is distinguished by a shorter and round tipped right tentacle, which also serves as a penis during fertilization:the female is usually slightly larger than the male at the same age, and it has two identical tentacles. Sexual maturity is reached after two years, when the snail is about 2 cm long. Each female bears eggs (up to 30 and at all stages of development) with a size of 3 to 7 mm in diameter and up to the full development of the embryo. At the time of their expulsion, the young are about 7 mm and their shell is already marked with the characteristic stripes of the river snails. After producing all its young, the female dies.

Born into a substantial naval dynasty, he would achieve similar status in the military, commanding three troops of Royal Horse Artillery at the Battles of Alma in September 1854, Balaclava in October 1854 and Inkerman in November 1854, and throughout the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War and eventually rising to the rank of field marshal. Family and early life Richard James was born in 1799, the son of Richard Dacres, who became a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy, and his wife Martha Phillips Milligan. The Dacres had a long history of naval service, Sydney's uncle, James Richard Dacres, was a vice-admiral, while his cousins Barrington Dacres and James Richard Dacres would both serve in the navy, the former becoming a post-captain, the latter a vice-admiral. His younger brother, Sydney Dacres, also had a naval career, eventually reaching the rank of Admiral, and serving as a First Naval Lord. Richard James attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1815, and embarked on a career with the army when he joined the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 15 December 1817. Career Dacres was promoted to first lieutenant on 29 August 1825, and a second captain on 18 December 1837. He transferred to the Royal Horse Artillery in 1843 and was promoted to major on 11 November 1851. He became a lieutenant-colonel on 23 February 1852, and was appointed to command the three troops of Royal Horse Artillery sent to take part in the Crimean War. He and his forces were attached to the cavalry, commanded by Lord Lucan. Dacres commanded his forces at the Battles of Alma in September 1854, Balaclava in October 1854 and Inkerman in November 1854, and throughout the Siege of Sevastopol. He was with the headquarters-staff at Balaclava, having his horse killed under him. When Brigadier-General Fox-Strangways was killed in the battle, Dacres took over command of all the artillery in the Crimea, retaining the post until the end of the war. He was advanced to the local rank of colonel on 23 February 1855, brigadier general on 30 March 1855, and was promoted to major-general on 29 June that year. He was created a Knight Commander of the Bath on 5 July 1855 for his services in the capture of artillery at Sevastopol, as well as a Commander of the Order of Savoy, and a Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. He was also among the officers authorised to accept the appointment to the Second Class of the Order of Medjidie on 2 March 1858. Dacres was appointed Commandant of the Woolwich district in May 1859, holding the position until 1865. Dacres was made colonel-commandant of the Royal Horse Artillery on 28 July 1864, and was promoted to lieutenant general on 10 December 1864. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1869. He was retired from active service at the rank of colonel-commandant on 2 October 1877, and was subsequently appointed to the position of Constable of the Tower on 27 July 1881, a position he occupied when the tower was one of the London targets bombed on 24 January 1885 by Feinian terrorists, wounding several people and causing some damage by fire. He became master gunner of England in 1882. Dacres was made a field marshal in July 1886, but died at Brighton on 6 December 1886 at the age of 87. He was succeeded as Constable of the Tower and Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets by The Lord Napier of Magdala on 6 January 1887.

He used various pseudonyms for Samizdat, like N. A. Klenov, A.B. Nazyvayev, D.A. Rassudin, S.T. Karneyev, etc. If published, his translations were usually issued under the name of A.I. Fedorov, which reproduced Fet's own initials and sometimes under the names of real people who agreed to publish Fet's translations under their names.  Biography  Abram Fet was born on 5 December 1924 in Odessa into a family of Ilya Fet and Revekka Nikolayevskaya. Ilya Fet was a medical doctor; he was born and grew in Rovno and studied medicine in Paris. Revekka was a housewife; she grew in Odessa. Fet's father often changed jobs, moving with his family over Ukraine looking for places where to escape starvation, and the children had to change schools. In 1936, the family settled in Odessa. There Abram Fet finished high school at the age of 15 and entered the Odessa Institute of Communications Engineering. He had hardly finished the first year when the Second World War broke out. Fet's family was evacuated to Siberia, to the Tomsk region. In 1941, Fet entered the Mathematics Department of Tomsk University, where he was admitted to the second year of studies. At that time, many professors evacuated from European Russia were teaching at the local university, among them Petr Rashchevsky who advised him in 1946 to continue his education in Moscow University. There Fet attended the seminars of Gelfand, Pontryagin, and Novikov and started to specialize in topology on advice of Vilenkin, under supervision of Lazar Lusternik. In December 1948, Fet defended his Candidate Thesis named \\"A Homology Ring of Closed Curve Space on a Sphere\\", which was recognized as an outstanding contribution by the mathematicians of Moscow University. After graduation, he started working in Tomsk University as a junior lecturer and then an associate professor of the Calculus Department. Among others, he taught V. Toponogov and S. Alber. Beginning from 1955, Fet worked in various colleges of Novosibirsk. In 1960, he got employed as a senior researcher in the Ceometry and Topology Department of the newly established Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. At the same time, he also taught at the new Novosibirsk University. In November 1967, he defended a doctorate at Moscow University named \\"A Periodic Problem of Variational Calculus\\", focused around Fet's theorem about two closed geodesic arcs, which became classical. In 1968, Fet signed the \\"Letter of 46\\" in defense of imprisoned dissidents, which became the reason for his dismissal both from the research institute and from the university. The real reason, though, was not the very fact of signing the letter but his independent character and straightforwardness with which he spoke about the professional and human qualities of his co-workers, about the intrigues of functionaries in science and about the privileges in Academgorodok (a limited- access grocery shop for residents, a special medical center and other privileges for the science town management and for doctors of sciences and their families). During four years, from October 1968 to June 1972, Fet was unemployed, earning his living by doing technical translations and translating mathematical books from different languages, which his friends arranged for him, and continued his research. Back in 1965, Fet began working together with Yu. B. Rumer, a Soviet physicist. The two monographs became the result of their joint work: \\"The Theory of Unitary Symmetry\\" (published in Moscow in 1970) and \\"The Theory of Groups and Quantum Fields\\" (Moscow, 1977), as well as a number of papers, including \\"Group Spin-(4) and the Periodic Table\\" (\\"Theoretical and Mathematical Physics\\", v. 9, 1971). This paper began group description of the system of chemical elements. In 1972, A.I. Fet was employed as a senior researcher at the theoretical physics laboratory of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry thanks to its director A. V. Nikolayev. During the subsequent ten years, A.I. Fet developed the ideas of group classification of atoms in a number of publications, which by the beginning of the 1980s he summed up in his monograph \\"A Symmetry Group of Chemical Elements\\". As a result, the entire field of chemistry related to the Periodic Table became part of mathematical physics. In 1984, this monograph was prepared by the Siberian branch of the Nauka Publishing House for publication but suddenly the manuscript was withdrawn from print, and the type matter was decomposed. The reason why it was done became clear soon: on 8 October 1986 Fet was dismissed from work \\"due to noncompliance with the position held based on the performance evaluation.\\" Again he continued to do science on his own, earning a living by casual translations. Not less than being a pure scientist, Abram Fet was a thinker. According to his philosophy, it is the man that is the end goal of any culture, a man with a harmonious personality, lofty ideals, and noble aspirations. And it is intelligentsia that has the mission of enlightening the society, though under conditions of harsh censorship. Back in the 1960s, Fet took part in \\"Samizdat\\" publishing by translating books for Samizdat. Fet introduced the Russian reader to the main works by Konrad Lorenz, whose ideas made a significant impact on his own thinking: Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins (Die acht Tods√ºnden der zivilisierten Menschheit, 1974), On Aggression (Das sogenannte B√∂se. Zur Naturgeschichte der Aggression, 1966), and Behind the Mirror, a Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge (Die R√ºckseite des Spiegels. Versuch einer Naturgeschichte menschlichen Erkennens, 1973). Later those translations were published openly by Respublika Publishing House in Moscow (Behind the Mirror, and On Aggression, 1998); another edition was published in 2008 with Kulturnaya Revolutsia Publishing House (Moscow). Fet was the first to translate and introduce many books on psychology for Samizdat which failed to pass the censorship in the USSR of the time: Eric Berne, Games People Play, 1964, The Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis, 1957, Sex in Human Loving, 1970; Erich Fromm Escape from Freedom (Die Furcht vor der Freiheit, 1941); Karen Horney, The Neurotic Personality of our Time, 1937, and many others. To introduce the reader to various kinds of society organization, Fet translated books for Samizdat from the series of pocket ABC books published in Warsaw and disclosing the basics of social and economic organization in different countries: The ABC of Stockholm, The ABC of Vienna, The ABC of Bern. These translations were complemented by Fet's own articles: Social Doctrines (1979) and What is Socialism? (1983). Beginning with the mid-1970s, Fet closely followed the events which took place in Poland. He perceived the Polish crisis of 1980‚àí1981 as the start of collapse of the so-called Socialist camp. His book The Polish Revolution written in the wake of the events was anonymously published in 1985 in Paris and in London, with a foreword of Mario Corti. He provided an analysis of the Polish events, disclosed their historic prerequisites, demonstrated the outstanding role of the Polish intellectuals, and foretold the ways of further development for the country. Fet wrote most of his humanitarian articles for Samizdat, as they could not appear in the censored Soviet periodicals. In the 1980s, the Russian emigree journal in Paris called Syntax published six articles by Fet signed with the pseudonym A.N. Klenov, which he later used for other writings on social issues. Throughout his life, Fet was thinking on the human society, on the biological and cultural nature of man, on the social mission of the intelligentsia, on religious beliefs and ideals. These reflections resulted in his books Pythagoras and the Ape (1987), Letters from Russia (1989‚Äì1991), Delusions of Capitalism, or the Fatal Conceit of Professor Hayek (1996), the main work being Instinct and Social Behavior, published in 2005. This book is dedicated to the history of culture presented from the viewpoint of ethology. The author set a goal \\"to reveal the impact of the social instinct on the human society, to describe the conditions frustrating its manifestations and to explain the effects of various attempts to suppress this invincible instinct\\". Fet discovered and first described a kind of social instinct specific to humans, which he called \\"the instinct of intraspecific solidarity\\". Its specificity consists in the ability of being spread from minor groups to larger ones. Using comprehensive historic examples, the author has convincingly demonstrated how our morals and our love for our neighbors originated from tribal solidarity, which gradually became transformed into intraspecific solidarity, thus spreading the mark of kinship to ever wider communities, eventually to be referred to the entire mankind.  Fet's works in mathematics  Fet's main areas of interest in mathematics are variational calculus and topology, including applications to geometry and calculus. The best known are Fet's classical theorems on closed geodesic arcs: The theorem of Lyusternik and Fet states that there exists at least one closed geodesic arc in any compact Riemann manifold. This result obtained by Lyusternik and Fet in 1951 was improved only in 1965, when Fet proved the theorem of two closed geodesic arcs. Fet's theorem states the existence of at least two non-recurrent closed geodesic arcs under the assumption that all closed geodesic arcs are non- degenerate. The result of 1965 has not yet been improved. * Fet's works in mathematics.  Fet's works in physics  Fet worked in the field of symmetry physics and the theory of elementary particles. Beginning with the early 1970s, he worked at physical substantiation of the system of chemical elements. He was the first to describe the logic of atomic weights previously considered unpredictable and developed the formula of atomic weight. * Fet's works in physics.

In the film, he interviews his \\"old friend\\" Woody Allen. Description The film mainly consists of an interview of Woody Allen by Godard, with the help of film scholar Annette Insdorf acting as off screen interpreter. In a prologue, Godard can be seen from the rear in silhouette standing at a window looking out over Central Park in New York City, while on the sound track a Gershwin tune previously used by Allen in Manhattan can be heard. The interview proper is presented as a series of fragments that frequently obfuscate the subject of the conversation, though it is evident that much of the conversation is about Allen's film Hannah and Her Sisters, which had just been released. The conversation fragments are separated by various still images and by intertitles; the text comments on the conversation, often in a punning way characteristic of Godard. The filmmaker, for whom intertitles are a frequent device, asks Allen about his own use of intertitles in Hannah and Her Sisters. Allen observes that, while for Godard the device is filmic, for Allen it is literary, and Allen goes on to say more about the literary origins of Hannah and Her Sisters. Godard then asks Allen about the influence of television on his work, saying that Allen's shots of New York City buildings in Hannah and Her Sisters seem to owe something to the way television portrays things. Finding the question obtuse, Allen instead rhapsodizes on his youthful experience of the cinema. In an epilogue, Godard is seen rifling through ephemera and a stack of books on a table. Suddenly, declaring that \\"the meeting is finished,\\" he slams the stack of books down on the table, slowing down the gesture in post production, so that the slam of the books hitting the table has a low, ominous tone. The final intertitle, displayed longer than the others, declares: \\"Meeting's Over.\\"  Background  The film was made as a substitute for the traditional press conference with the director following the premiere of Hannah and Her Sisters at the Cannes Film Festival. According to Tom Luddy, who helped arrange the interview, the impetus was to keep Allen involved in Godard's King Lear project while Godard was stalled for lack of ideas. Knowledge of Godard's life and work illuminate what might otherwise be an opaque encounter as one in which Godard was disappointed by his interview subject. For example, Allen describes being influenced by novels when writing Hannah and Her Sisters and asserts that script writing is the most important phase of filmmaking for him. This is at diametrically opposed to Godard's philosophy and method of filmmaking, where the work is in the process of being created across all stages of filmmaking, particularly editing, and the primacy is on images, not text.

She was a minister and president of the National Spiritualist Church of New Zealand, a journalist as Maorilander in the New Zealand Woman's Weekly, and a broadcaster on Radio 1ZB as Aunt Maisy. In 1934 she became the first woman minister appointed by the church in New Zealand. Political career Dreaver sought selection by the Labour Party for the in the electorate, but was beaten by Tom Bloodworth. In 1931 she was elected to the Auckland Hospital Board as a Labour candidate. In 1933 a visit by her to the hospital kitchen and claims of long hours and \\"sweated labour\\" there aroused controversy on the board. Dreaver then sought the Labour nomination for the in the seat, but was beaten by Arthur Osborne. In the she stood for Labour in , coming second. In 1940 she stood for the Labour nomination at the Auckland West by-election following the death of Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage, but lost to Peter Carr.

A new system for new private cars was introduced on 1 July 2008 where the tax rates are based on the carbon dioxide emissions of the car while in operation. Prior to this, tax rates are assessed on engine displacement - this includes used imports first registered in their original country of sale before July 2008. Motorcycles are all taxed the same regardless of engine displacement, with a special rate for electrically powered cycles. For goods vehicles, commercial vehicles and PSVs it is based on weight or is a standardised fee. For taxation of cars with Wankel engines under the old size-based system, the actual engine displacement is multiplied by 1.5 so for example a Mazda RX-8 with a 1.3 litre rotary engine is taxed as a 1.8 litre engined vehicle. Motor tax can be purchased for a duration of three, six or twelve months for some classes of vehicles. Valid vehicle insurance is required to pay for motor tax. Once tax is paid, the vehicle owner receives a motor tax disc which is required by law be displayed on the vehicle (usually on the front windscreen where available, along with insurance and NCT discs where required). Failure to display a tax disc can result in a fine, and failure to pay for motor tax can result in further fines or prosecution. Motor tax can be refunded if the car has not been in use in public places under certain circumstances - for example if the vehicle has been scrapped, permanently exported from the country, stolen and not recovered, or the owner has been unable to use the vehicle for certain reasons. Rates As of 2014, annual motor tax rates for private cars on the emissions-based system range from ‚Ç¨120 (0 g/km CO2) to ‚Ç¨2,350 (more than 225 g/km). Tax for motorcycles varies from ‚Ç¨35 to ‚Ç¨88.http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/MotorTax/MotorTaxRates/RateofDutyonOtherVehicles/ Vehicles 30 years old or more qualify for \\"vintage\\" motor tax status - a special low rate of ‚Ç¨26 per year for motorcycles or ‚Ç¨56 per year for all other vehicles.https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/41c9cc-motor-tax-rates/#veteran- and-vintage-vehicles-more-than-30-years-old Motor tax can be paid in annual, half-year and quarterly instalments. The tax can be paid online or in person at Motor Tax Offices. Exemptions There are a number of exempt vehicles: *State-owned vehicles (these still carry tax discs, with a rate of ‚Ç¨0.00 printed on them), for example Garda vehicles and CI√â buses) *Diplomatic vehicles. *Vehicles exempted under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (S.I.

Early life She was born as Mary Victoria Cracroft Wilson at Culverden in 1897. Her parents were John Wilson, a sheepfarmer, and Mildred Hall. Her paternal grandfather was John Cracroft Wilson, and her maternal grandfather was John Hall; both had been prominent MPs. Her mother was known for her involvement with public activities, particularly those involving women. Mary was educated for eight years at the Brondesbury School in London, where she became a head girl. During the First World War she served in the nursing division of the VAD (Voluntary Aid Division). Political career In 1941 Grigg was elected onto the Ashburton Hospital Board and became its first woman member. She was also president of the Ashburton Plunket Society, a member of the Red Cross executive and President of the Mount Somers Ladies' Guild. When her husband Arthur Grigg rejoined the army, she took over his parliamentary duties in the electorate. She was elected to represent the Mid-Canterbury electorate in Parliament from 1942 after the death (on 29 November 1941) of her husband Arthur Grigg in a political practice known as widow's succession. She had married Grigg in 1920, and he had held the Mid-Canterbury electorate from 1938 Her greatest area of concern was farming issues, followed by housing, health and education. In 1942 she joined with other women MPs from both sides of the House to argue that the number of women police officers should be increased and that they should be issued with a uniform. She also campaigned for women to be permitted to sit on juries. She married William Polson MP on 29 June 1943 and did not seek re-election in the September 1943 general election. Grigg continued to be active in the National Party after her parliamentary career ended. She supported Hilda Ross in her first election campaign in 1945, and in 1949 Ross and Grigg co-wrote the National Party's election manifesto. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours. She was styled Lady Polson when her second husband was knighted in the 1951 Birthday Honours. She was the fourth woman to be elected to Parliament after Elizabeth McCombs, Catherine Stewart and Mary Dreaver, and the first woman not from the Labour Party to be elected. Lady Polson was the President of Victoria League Canterbury from 1965 to 1970.

Lisa Marie portrayed the character in 1980, Roseanne Arnold in 1994, Sally Struthers in February 2002, and Holly Gagnier in June 2015. Casting The role of Jennifer Smith was originated by actress and model Lisa Marie, in 1980. Shortly after, the character was written out of the show. In 1994, Jennifer returned to the canvass, portrayed by comedian and Roseanne star Roseanne Arnold. Arnold, who is a fan of the series, appeared with her then-husband Tom Arnold, for three episodes in late March 1994. In return, Anthony Geary and Genie Francis, who portray Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, appeared in an episode of Arnold's sitcom, Roseanne. The role was played by All in the Family actress Sally Struthers for 10 episodes in 2002. Struthers said of Jennifer's return, \\"Needless to say, Jennifer has a few issues with Luke and Laura. She has some unfinished business.\\" Jennifer returned to the screen on June 22, 2015, portrayed by Holly Gagnier. Jennifer is holding Lucky Spencer hostage and demanding that if Luke and Laura want to see Lucky again, Luke Spencer must spend the night with her.

It is located near the southern tip of Manhattan Island, across from Battery Park. History=Early history James Watson was the first Speaker of the New York State Assembly and a Federalist member of the New York and United States Senates. He was a Yale University graduate who became a prosperous importer-exporter. Once part of a row of late-eighteenth-century mansions, the building recalls the time when New York's merchant families lived at Manhattan's southern tip, near the river, in order to have an unobstructed harbor view and to be in close proximity to their shipping interests. At that time it was numbered 6 State Street. In 1806 Watson sold the house to Moses Rogers and the address was changed to 7 State Street. Rogers was the brother-in-law of shipping magnate, Archibald Gracie, who built the spacious home on the northeast side of Manhattan that came to be known as Gracie Mansion. Moses Rogers combined his house with the residence next door which sat significantly back due to the curve of the street. In order to create a unified facade, a colonnaded portico was added, reportedly using masts from his fleet of merchant ships which he was converting to steam power. The architect of the eastern (original) half is unknown, but the western extension, next to the church, is attributed to John McComb, Jr. With the exodus of wealthy families northward, the building housed the office of the Ithaca Line.Williams, Edwin. \\"William's New York Annual, J.

Between 1856 and 1921, 3.6 million emigrants left Ireland for North America; a majority of them were women. For every eight Irishmen who left between 1871 and 1951, ten Irishwomen emigrated. Eighty-nine percent of those women were single and younger than twenty- four.Miller, Chandra. \\"‚ÄòTumbling Into the Fight‚Äô Charlotte Grace O‚ÄôBrien (1845-1909); The Emigrant‚Äôs Advocate\\", History Ireland, Vol. 4, Issue 4 (Winter 1996) On a visit to Queenstown, the main port of embarkation, Charlotte Grace O'Brien was appalled at the conditions faced by immigrant women, who encountered overcrowded, overpriced lodgings and robbery. In April 1882 she opened the 105-bed \\"O'Brien Emigrants Home\\", a boarding-house for the reception and protection of girls on the point of emigrating. She also visited the ships for which her lodgers were destined, along with a medical officer. Finally, O'Brien sailed to New York to investigate conditions upon arrival. O'Brien found little effort to provide food or drink or accommodation at the Castle Garden entry facility and illiterate young women being tricked into prostitution through spurious offers of employment.Owen, William Benjamin. \\"O'Brien, Charlotte Grace\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 She contacted Archbishop John Ireland, who through his contacts with the Irish Catholic Association, arranged the establishment of an information bureau at Castle Garden. Ireland also contacted Cardinal John McCloskey, Archbishop of New York, about providing a chaplain specifically for immigrants arriving at Castle Garden.

In the sixteen years ending with July 1, 1899, 476,149 Irish people landed in New York, of which 249,995 were women, nearly all under forty years of age.Henry, Michael J., Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary for the Protection of Irish Immigrant Girls, New York, 1900 The Mission used its influence to persuade steamship lines to better safeguard their immigrant passengers. It guided those at landing who intended to proceed by rail or steamboat to another destination. It provided a home on State Street for 70,000 girls whose friends did not show up on the day of arrived, or who had no one expecting them, or who were unable to proceed on their journey. It attempted to locate relatives of those who had only an incomplete address, and examined the fitness of those claiming to be relatives and friends who called for the immigrant. It secured positions for over 12,000 young women, mostly in domestic services, for those ready to go to work. and it provided an on-site chapel for spiritual support.

She recently served as the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, and was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China from 2007 to 2017, a State Councilor between 2007 and 2012, and headed the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party between 2002 and 2007. A graduate of Tsinghua University, Liu's career has long been associated with her fellow alumnus and Communist Youth League colleague Hu Jintao. As such Chinese-language media has sometimes labelled Liu as part of the so-called \\"Tuanpai\\", or \\"Youth League clique\\". Since the retirement of Wu Yi, Liu has been the highest-ranked female political figure in China, and one of only two women with a seat on the Politburo, the other being current vice premier Sun Chunlan. Biography=Early career Liu Yandong was born in Nantong County, Jiangsu, in what was then Republic of China. Her father Liu Ruilong was one of the founders of the 14th Army of the Reds, an early Communist revolutionary militia force. As her father was of a revolutionary background, she has been classified by some analysts as a princeling. Liu entered the prestigious Tsinghua University in 1964, weathered the Cultural Revolution, and graduated in 1970 with a degree in chemistry. While in college, Liu was a part-time political instructor. Shortly after graduation, Liu began work at a chemical production plant in Tangshan, an industrial city in northeastern China, in what was likely an assignment by the state. In 1980, she was transferred to work for the party organization in Beijing, in 1981 she was made deputy Party Secretary of Chaoyang District. In 1982, Liu began working for the Communist Youth League, where she worked with contemporaries Wang Zhaoguo, Hu Jintao, and Song Defu. She worked at the Youth League for nine years. During this time she served as Chairwoman of the All-China Youth Federation. In March 1991, she began working at the United Front Work Department as its deputy secretary-general. The mandate of the United Front is essentially to keep non-Communist political and civic organizations in line with the overarching ideologies of the Communist Party. During her term at the department, she gained on-the-job master's and doctorate degrees at Renmin University and Jilin University. Politburo Between 2002 and 2007, she served as the head of the United Front Work Department. In March 2002 she was also elected Vice Chair of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Having long been an ally of Party General Secretary Hu Jintao and ascended from the ranks of the Communist Youth League, she entered the 17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China in 2007. Widely speculated to become Vice-Premier in an upcoming leadership reshuffle, by 2007, Liu was the sole woman with a seat on the Politburo and the highest ranked female politician in China. At the 2008 National People's Congress she was elected State Councilor, and was not elected as a Vice- Premier. She was also deputy chair of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. At the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, she was elected to the 18th Politburo of the Communist Party of China. She became the first woman since Deng Yingchao to serve consecutive terms on the Politburo. A few months later, at the first plenary session of the 12th National People's Congress in 2013, she was also appointed Vice Premier, second in rank, overseeing the broad portfolios of health, education, and sports. Since 2013, Liu has been the leader of the Leading Group for Health Care Reform. Personal life Liu is married. On April 13, 2009, Stony Brook University conferred upon Madame Liu Yandong an Honorary Doctor of Laws.

It is inhabited by the Blood (Kainai) First Nation and was established under the provisions of Treaty 7. This reserve is managed from the town of Stand Off on its northwest border and encompasses the majority of lands bounded by the cities of Fort MacLeod, Lethbridge and Cardston. It is traversed by Alberta Highway 2, Highway 5 and Highway 509. The St Mary River and the Belly River are major rivers supplying and draining the lands. At , this is the largest reserve in Canada, and the third most populous after Six Nations and Akwesasne. On June 12, 2019 Federal Courts ruled that, according to the Treaty Land Entitlement provisions of Treaty 7, the Blood Tribe was entitled to a reserve equal to 710 square miles in area, an increase of 164.1 square miles over the existing lands. The judgement did not address remedy nor costs. It is located between the Cities of Fort MacLeod and Lethbridge and the Town of Cardston, bordering the Municipal District of Willow Creek No. 26 to the northwest, the Lethbridge County to the northeast and Cardston County to the east, south and southwest.

Later, they were expanded to include radio. The awards were named after their sponsor, W. & R. Jacob & Co. Ltd., a biscuit manufacturer, and recipients were selected by Ireland's national newspaper television and radio critics. Jacob's Award winners were chosen annually until 1993, when the final awards presentation took place. Winners of a Jacob's Award include Fionnula Flanagan (1965), Gay Byrne (1979), and Brendan Gleeson (1992). The record for the most awards won is held by Gay Byrne, who was honoured six times between 1963 and 1981.  History  Telef√≠s √âireann was launched as Ireland's first indigenous television station on 31 December 1961. Three months later, it was announced by W. & R. Jacob & Co. Ltd. that they intended to sponsor an award for outstanding contributions to the new medium.The Irish Times, \\"Firm to sponsor TV awards\\", 7 March 1962 On 4 December 1962, the first awards ceremony took place at the sponsor's headquarters in Dublin. There were nine winners, chosen by a panel of national newspaper television critics. Each winner received an award designed by the artist, Richard Kingston. This consisted of a silver St. Brigid's Cross mounted on a base of bog oak and Connemara marble.The Irish Times, \\"BBC wins award for Hancock series in first T.E. critic's selection\\", 5 December 1962 The Jacob's Awards honoured teams of programme makers as well as individuals. For instance, in 1962, Telef√≠s √âireann's Sports Department won an award for its general coverage during the station's first year of broadcasting. In 1965, a limit of eight annual awards was set, and the critics also decided not to confine themselves to fixed categories in making their selections.The Irish Times, \\"Jacob's Television Awards\\", 12 October 1965 A special \\"Golden Trophy\\" was introduced in 1966 to recognise exceptional performance. This was awarded every five years although it was dropped in the mid-1980s.The Irish Times, \\"Television awards presented\\", 8 December 1966 In 1969, the number of awards was increased to a maximum of thirteen in order to incorporate radio. A separate panel of national newspaper radio critics was formed to choose recipients of the new award, a highly polished, white metal cylinder designed by Robert Costelloe. This was replaced in 1981 by a trophy comprising a painted canvas mounted on a stainless steel background, designed by Theo McNab.The Irish Times, \\"Kee wins award for TV history of Ireland\\", 11 April 1981 For most of their history, Jacob's Awards were awarded to programmes broadcast on RT√â because the national state broadcaster held a monopoly in Ireland. However, in 1989, commercial radio was introduced and RT√â's monopoly in sound broadcasting was broken. The critics responded by widening the scope of the awards to include the new local stations. RT√â did not face indigenous competition in television until the advent of TV3 in 1998, by which time the Jacob's Awards had ended. Awards ceremony In the 30 years of its existence, comp√®res of the annual Jacob's Awards event included Hilton Edwards and Frank Hall. Winners were presented with their awards by a senior member of the Irish Government, sometimes the Taoiseach of the day. Due to the \\"economic circumstances of the sponsoring company\\", the 1983 and 1984 awards were presented at a single event, which took place on 22 February 1985.The Irish Times, \\"Jacob's prize producer leaving for Australia\\", 23 February 1985 What turned out to be the final awards ceremony took place in Dublin on 11 November 1993. Presenting the awards on that occasion was Michael D. Higgins, then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.The Irish Times, \\"Higgins warns of threat to service\\", 15 November 1993 No formal announcement was made by the sponsor subsequently as to the future of the Jacob's Awards so the reason why they were terminated remains a mystery. However, the death of public relations consultant and radio presenter, Frankie Byrne, shortly after the 1993 event may have been a factor. From the inception of the Jacob's Awards, each of the annual presentation events was organised and promoted by Frankie Byrne. However, according to former Jacob's chairman, Gordon Lambert, she actually started the awards in 1962 and her role in their eventual longevity seems to have been crucial. This is borne out by the fact that no further awards ceremonies took place following Byrne's death in December 1993.The Irish Times, \\"Frankie Byrne dies after long battle with illness\\", 13 December 1993 Recalling her involvement in the Jacob's Awards five years after her death, television critic Tom O'Dea summed up her unique contribution:\\"I think it is no skin off anyone's nose to accord her the distinction of giving the awards night the character it had, wheelchairs for the irretrievably drunken, and all.\\"Irish Independent, \\"Frankie: we did it her way\\", 21 December 1998 Controversy The 1970 awards were attended by some controversy. Eoghan Harris refused to accept an award for his production of the Irish-language current affairs programme, F√©ach. In a statement issued on the day of the awards ceremony, Harris criticised RT√â for its involvement with commercial sponsorship.The Irish Times, \\"Controversy is indication of RT√â's success, says minister\\", 11 December 1970 However, five years later his attitude changed and he accepted a second award for a special report on 7 Days. Also in 1970, guests arriving at the awards ceremony were confronted by a picket of 50 female employees of W. & R. Jacob who were protesting against the cost of the banquet. One picketer carried a placard bearing the legend: \\"Only room at the inn for the in-people\\". In 1990, RT√â threatened to pull out of its longstanding practice of broadcasting the awards ceremony because of the involvement of T√°naiste, Brian Lenihan. Lenihan had been invited to present the awards in his capacity as T√°naiste and Minister of Defence. However, in the meantime, he was chosen by Fianna F√°il as that party's candidate in the forthcoming Irish presidential election. RT√â claimed that going ahead with its planned broadcast would give unfair additional publicity to Lenihan, leaving the station in breach of its own guidelines on election coverage. After a brief stand-off, Lenihan agreed to withdraw from the awards ceremony. He was replaced by Minister for Labour, Bertie Ahern.The Irish Times, \\"Lenihan pulls out of Jacobs show\\", 4 October 1990  Winners - multiple awards =Six *Gay Byrne (1963, 1970, 1971, 1976, 1978, 1981) Four *Mike Murphy (1978, 1979, 1980, 1988) *Andy O'Mahony (1969, 1981, 1986, 1989) Three *Wesley Burrowes (1965, 1974, 1976) *Brian Mac Lochlainn (1969, 1971, 1992) *Olivia O'Leary (1973, 1982, 1986) *Julian Vignoles (1984, 1991, 1992) Two *Tony Barry (1970, 1990) *John Bowman (1970, 1981) *Anne Daly (1980, 1989) *Norris Davidson (1973, 1974) *Derek Davis (1983, 1991) *Donall Farmer (1969, 1978) *Brian Farrell (1968, 1977) *Pat Feeley (1977, 1979) *Alan Gilsenan (1989, 1990) *Frank Hall (1966, 1975) *Shay Healy (1984, 1989) *Michael Heney (1990, 1992) *Eamon Keane (1966, 1971) *Joe Lynch (1962, 1977) *Muiris Mac Conghail (1967, 1985) *Ciar√°n Mac Math√∫na (1969, 1990) *Ian McGarry (1975, 1981) *Joe Mulholland (1977, 1979) *John O'Donovan (1970, 1974) *Kevin O'Kelly (1969, 1980) *Cathal O'Shannon (1976, 1978) *Eoin √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (1965, 1974) *James Plunkett (1965, 1969) *John Quinn (1988, 1993) *RT√â Sports Department (1962, 1966)  Winners - full details =1960s1962= Television *Eileen Crowe (Best actress for The Well of the Saints) *Joe Lynch (Best actor for Shaw's The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet) *Burt Budin (Best producer) *Hancock's Half Hour (Best imported programme) *Broadsheet (Best home-produced programme) *Proinsias Mac Aonghusa (Best contribution in the Irish language) *Hilton Edwards (Most original contribution to television for the series Self Portrait) *Telef√≠s √âireann's Sports Department (general coverage) *Charles Mitchel (Newsreader) =1963= Television *Blaithin Nic Chaomhin (Best contribution in the Irish language) *Radharc (Most enterprising programme) *Conor Cruise O'Brien (Best original script for programme on Charles Stewart Parnell) *Telef√≠s √âireann's Sports Department (Best outside broadcast) *Cyril Cusack (Best actor for Triptych) *Gay Byrne (Outstanding personality) *Peter Collinson, (Best producer for The Bomb) *Monica Sheridan (Individual award for her cookery programme)The Irish Times, \\"Presentation of television awards and citations\\", 4 December 1963 =1964= Television *Bunny Carr (Presenter of Teen Talk) *Paddy Jennings (Editor of On The Land) *Paddy Crosbie (\\"for his many amusing and entertaining contributions to Telef√≠s √âireann\\") *Brian Cleeve (script and narration on Discovery) *Jim Norton (acting performance in Solo series) *64 (current affairs series) *Alan Pleass (design of Letter from the General) *Chloe Gibson (producer of The Importance of Being Oscar) *The Great War, (BBC series) *Miche√°l MacLiamm√≥ir (acting performance in The Importance of Being Oscar)The Irish Times, \\"Television awards presented\\", 2 December 1964 =1965= Television *Wesley Burrowes (contributions to Telef√≠s √âireann's Drama Department) *James Plunkett (writer and producer of Many Happy Christmases episode of The Life and Times of Jimmy O'Dea) *Gerry Murray (producer of TV coverage of the 1965 Irish General Election) *Tom McGrath (producer of Irish National Song Contest) *Fionnula Flanagan (acting performance in An Triail ) *Eoin √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (presenter of Labhair Gaeilge Linn) *Peter Watkins (writer and director of Culloden)The Irish Times, \\"Television awards presented\\", 9 December 1965 =1966= Television *Michael Viney (maker of documentary Too Many Children) *Frank Hall (editor of Newsbeat) *Lelia Doolan (producer of The Plough and the Stars) *May Cluskey (acting performance in Tolka Row and The Plough and the Stars) *Eamonn Keane (acting performance in When do you die, Friend?) *Justin Keating (writer and presenter of Telef√≠s Feirme) *Stuart Hetherington (\\"for his outstanding film work\\") *Andreas √ì Gallch√≥ir (producer of On Behalf of the Provisional Government)Gaeilgeoir whose media career spanned four eventful decades Irish Times, 2011-07-23.

Taxonomy The Noritaceae as revised (Tozer 1981) is composed of the Noritidae, Inyoitidae, Lanceolitidae, Ophiceratidae, Stephanitidae, Ussuriidae Noritidae is the type family of the Noritaceae and may have been derived from the Dieneroceratidae through the Xenoceltitidae. The Inyoitidae is based on the Inyoitinae, which was removed from the Xenoceltitidae and elevated in rank. The Lanceolitidae, containing Lanceolites as the sole representative, was included in the Hedenstroemiidae as the Lanceolitinae. The Ophiceratidae and the Stephanoceratidae were removed from the Otocerataceae and the Ceratitaceae respectively. The Ussuriidae is a small family retained in the Noritaceae.  Noritacean taxonomy in the Treatise The Treatise, Part L, gives 13 families in the Noritacea, six of which collectively contain 15 subfamilies. Of these: The Flemingitidae and Meekoceratidae have been placed in the Meekocerataceae along with the Prionitidae and Proptychitidae. The Hedenstroemiidae, less the Lanceolitinae, have been combined with middle and upper Triassic late derivatives of the Medlicottiadae, the Sageceratidae, in what is known as the Sageceratceae. Medlicottiadae is a family in the Melicottiaceae, a superfamily of prolecanitids (order Prolecanitida). Sageceras, type genus of the Sageceratidae, is described as having lenticular shells with flattened bicarinate venters and small umbilici. Sutures form numerous subequal auxiliary and adventitious lobes. Hedenstroemiidae are described as having discoidal, compressed, generally smooth, involute shells with tabulate to oxynote venters. Suture are ceratitic with adventitious saddles and lobes.

Today, the Italian intelligence agencies are part of the Department of Security Informations (part of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers), and are: AISE (foreign intelligence) and AISI (internal security). Birth In 1925 born the SIM (Servizio Informazioni Militari). In 1949 the SIFAR and in 1966 the SID (Servizio Informazioni Difesa). It was always military intelligence agencies.  1970s-2007  A scandal rocked Italy and its intelligence agencies in 1977, after the arrest in 1974 of a former chief of Servizio Informazioni Difesa (SID), General Vito Miceli, for \\"conspiracy against the state\\" following the attempted Golpe Borghese (Borghese Coup). Legislative Act n.801 of 24/10/1977 attempted to reorganize intelligence agencies under civilian control. This re-organization mainly consisted of: * The split of SID, the intelligence agency at that time, into two separate agencies with different roles: SISDE (the domestic one, for the defence of democratic institutions, run by the Interior affairs ministry) and SISMI (the military secret service, run by the Defence Ministry). * The creation of CESIS, with a coordination, analysis and direction role between the two intelligence agencies, put under the authority of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, and ultimately responsible for the intelligence structure. * The creation of the Parliamentary Committee, COPACO, to oversee the activities of the two agencies. Another scandal succeeded to Prime minister Giulio Andreotti's public revelation, on 24 October 1990, of the existence of Gladio, a stay-behind anti-Communist network supported by NATO which was accused by the Left of having engaged in the \\"strategy of tension\\" during the Years of Lead.  New scandals  In the 2000s, the SISMI became again the target of national controversy, leading to the resignation of its chief, Nicol√≤ Pollari, in November 2006, after his indictment in the Imam Rapito affair, which concerned the \\"extraordinary rendition\\" and kidnapping of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka Abu Omar) in Milan in 2003. As part of the judiciary investigation on the abduction of Abu Omar, a SISMI-run black operation targeting center-left politician Romano Prodi and a vast domestic surveillance program, involving the Telecom, was uncovered. The planting of disinformation through paid informants in the Italian press as well as misleading of justice has also been underlined.Statewatch News, \\"Italy - Law reforms intelligence services\\", URL accessed on September 24, 2007 Beside the Imam Rapito affair, the SISMI was implicated in the Niger uranium forgeries scandal, during which SISMI agents transmitted false documents to US President George W. Bush, which were used as main pretext in the invasion of Iraq. Finally, Italian magistrates searching the SISMI's headquarters in August 2007 found documents proving that the intelligence agency had spied over various European magistrates between 2001 and 2006, who it considered carrying a \\"destabilization\\" potential. These included the Medel, a European association of magistrates, as well as three French judges, including Anne Crenier, former president of the Syndicat de la magistrature French union, who is married to Italian magistrate Mario Vaudano who works at the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).Ecco i dossier del Sismi sui generali \\"di sinistra\\", La Repubblica, 6 July 2007 Trois juges fran√ßais espionn√©s par les services secrets italiens, Rue 89, 12 July 2007  The March 2007 reform  Henceforth, the new center- left government of Romano Prodi enacted the Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, which created a new \\"information system for security\\" named Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica placing in particular the intelligence agencies more closelyEven if operators of the intelligence bodies act for purposes not related to those of the judge and, consequently, are entitled to take action even outside court proceedings and the guarantees linked to them: under the Prime Minister's supervision, who is responsible for nominating directors and deputy directors of each agencies, and which It replaced the SISDE, SISMI and CESIS by Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Interna (AISI, internal information and security agency), Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna (AISE, external information and security agency) and Dipartimento delle Informazioni per la Sicurezza (DIS, security information department),Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, reported in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic, General Series, n.187 of 08/13/2007. . and the COPACO, transformed into the Comitato interministeriale per la sicurezza della Repubblica (CISR, Interministerial committee for the security of the Republic) was granted additional oversight and control powers, and is still chaired by the Prime minister. It also comprises the ministers for foreign affairs, home affairs, defence, justice and economy. The DIS general director will act as secretary of this body. While the intelligence agencies were before this reform mainly divided into the SISMI, dependent of the Defense Ministry, and the SISDE, part of the Interior Ministry, the main division line now passes between \\"internal\\" and \\"external\\" security. On the other hand, the Italian military's new intelligence agency, the II Reparto Informazioni e Sicurezza of the Stato maggiore della difesa (RIS), is not integrated into this \\"information system for security\\". Its function is limited \\"exclusively\\" to activities of a technical military and military police nature, particularly with regards to collecting information to protect armed force outposts and activities abroad, in co-ordination with AISE. According to Statewatch, \\"the law also envisages the adoption of a regulation including provisions to guarantee the information services access to the computer archives of public administrations and public utility providers, with technical means of monitoring what personal data was checked after the event.\\" Furthermore, the \\"intelligence services are forbidden from employing or commissioning advisory or co-operation services from elected politicians at the European, national, regional and local level, members of governing bodies or constitutional bodies, judges, religious ministers and journalists.\\" The DIS will have an investigation office to verify that the activities of the various agencies respect rule of law, and will also have powers to conduct internal investigations. The commission of illegal acts by intelligence officers, detailed in the law and excluding license to kill, will have to be authorised, case by case, by the Prime Minister or delegated authority, in compliance with a principle of \\"special cause for justification\\" for such conduct, as part of an \\"authorised operation\\". Such permission will have to be motivated, in writing, and may be subsequently revoked. In cases of \\"absolute urgency\\" that do not allow the normal procedure for authorisation to be followed, agency directors may authorise the activities, informing the Prime Minister and DIS \\"immediately\\", and explaining the reasons for such a course of action. According to the new law, the principle of justification is not applicable to actions: \\"Authorized operations\\" explicitly excluded ordinary illegal acts which would be carried in the offices of political parties, in regional parliaments or councils, trade union offices, or if they target professional journalists. Aiding and abetting is allowed, except for cases involving false testimony before judicial authorities, concealing evidence of a crime or where there is an intention to mislead investigations. Three to ten-year prison sentences are envisaged for officers who illegally fix the conditions under which \\"authorized operations\\" are granted. 3 to 10 years prison sentences may be incurred for compiling illegal dossiers outside of the intelligence agency's objectives, with secret archives also forbidden. State secret status may cover \\"documents, news, activities or any other thing.\\" Declaring \\"things\\" a state secret falls under the prerogative of the Prime Minister, who may do so for 15 years period, renewable to 30. It may not be applied to activities involving subversion, terrorism or to attacks aimed at causing deaths. In particular, the Constitutional Court may not be denied access to documents on the basis of them being state secrets. The PM can lift state secret when the initial motivations for it do not apply anymore. State secret may also be lifted for the COPACO if the unanimity of its members agree to do so.

The Mennonite municipality of Goes, consisting of 14 members, of which the majority had for the last 50 years been in that of Middelburg. Nothing was known of revolutionary activities in Bolsward during the time of the Patriots, although the Mennonites were quite strongly represented in the local voluntary schutterij and were sure to be lent a willing ear by him. In Leeuwarden, Abraham Staal became part of the hard core of political activists. In 1796, he was appointed by the people's representatives to be a raadsheer in the Court of Friesland (1796), together with the journalist Paape. Both had no legal schooling, but were appointed because of their political experience. Within a year Staal and Paape got into difficulties for their fanaticism, especially after a small popular revolt in Kollum. On the advice of a commission, in which Eise Eisinga played a part, Paape was expelled a few months later. After the coup in January 1798, Staal was put under house arrest in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague, where the prisoners could walk in the garden, but not speak whilst there.

History The first efforts to restore the Montgomery Canal were made by the Shropshire Union Canal Society in 1968, when the section in Welshpool was restored. Further progress towards restoration was made in 1980, when the concept of a restored canal was written into the Shropshire and Powys County Structure Plan. Seven years later, British Waterways obtained an Act of Parliament to authorise the restoration. This was the first occurrence of such an Act being granted. With the need to co-ordinate a number of authorities and manage applications for grants to fund the work, an umbrella organisation was needed, and so the Montgomery Waterway Restoration Trust was created. The Trust was formed in 1980 and its members include: *Inland Waterways Association *Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust *Powys County Council *The Prince's Trust *Shropshire Council *Shropshire Union Canal Society *Shropshire Wildlife Trust *Waterway Recovery Group \\"Friends of the Montgomery Canal\\" is a less formal group, created by the Trust for people living in the canal corridor, which provides them with information and opportunities for involvement in various canal-related activities. The Friends organises events including the annual Montgomery Dinghy Dawdle, which provides an opportunity for a large number of people in unpowered boats such as canoes and coracles to explore a section of the canal, and generates publicity for future restoration. The event is jointly organised with the Shropshire Union Canal Society. Activity One of the first big tests for the new organisation occurred in 1982, after the Powys Structure Plan had included a clause protecting the canal north of Whitehorse Bridge No. 120. Just three weeks later, the British Waterways Board announced that they would not be starting any more work on the canal once the existing work at Frankton and Carreghofa was completed. They declared that restoration of the whole canal was uncertain, and that no water for it would be available from the Llangollen Canal. The Trust then requested a meeting with Sir Frank Price, the chairman of the BWB, and the two organisations agreed on the need for an economic study, which would inform future development plans. The meeting was held on 5 April, and the report was to be completed by October of that year.

In 1999 they merged with the IPC to form the IPC SMEMA Council.From Vacuum Tubes to Nanotubes: An Amazing Half Century, Published by the IPC, Edited by Michael L. Martel One standard they have is for the wiring of communications between Surface mount technology producing machinery such as a Stencil Printer or a Pick and Place Machine on an Electronics production line. This allows the machines, including the \\"bridges\\" between the two known simply as conveyors, to communicate that they are busy, or awaiting a circuit board. The communication only goes sequentially, as there is no addressing. Instead the machine's SMEMA cables connect to each other's upstream or downstream plug. The plugs and wires are multimate connectors and receptacles consisting of 14 wire connections. However, only 4 wires are used for data, while the 8th pin connection is the shielding. History In 1984 a group of North American capital equipment suppliers started their collaboration to develop the original SMEMA specification. No formal document was available until 1987. Core companies credited with founding of SMEMA are Dynapert, Zevatech, Universal Instruments, MPM and BTU. Core members include Ernest Roberts (Dynapert), Robert Black (Zevatech),Patrick Torigian(Universal Instruments) and Gary Freeman (MPM). The current version of the standard is IPC/SMEMA 9851-2007, published in February 2007, which superseded version 1.2.http://ocmmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IPC-SMEMA-9851.pdf In April 2017 the Hermes protocol was released as an intended upgrade to and replacement of SMEMA. By the end of 2018 IPC has confirmed to recognize The Hermes Standard to be the successor to ‚Äúthe SMEMA Standard‚Äù IPC-SMEMA-9851, which has been the only globally accepted and broadly established standard for machine to machine communication in SMT with regards to PCB handover. Accordingly, The Hermes Standard was assigned an IPC naming code: It can now officially be referred to as IPC-HERMES-9852. Specifications The specifications are for single board transfer systems with conveyors as the transporters. Specifications state that the boards should be moving from left to right although the same standard does apply to board transfers going right to left. For proper sequencing of boards, two signal lines should be used; \\"Board Available\\" and \\"Machine Ready\\", the signal \\"Failed Board Available\\" is optional http://www.dynamixtechnology.com/docs/smema1.2.pdf Conveyor Height: Each machine shall have the transport conveyor height adjustable from 940 to 965mm (37 to 38 in) from the floor to the bottom of the PC board. Fixed Rail: For the purpose of the standard, the front rail is defined as the fixed rail. Tooling Pins: Tooling pins, if used, should be on the front edge of the board (next to the fixed transport rail). A recommended hole diameter is 4mm (0.157 in) Distance from the edge should be 7.6mm (0.299 in).

After 1938, he lived in the United States. At the time of his death, he was the Curt Hugo Reisinger Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literature at Harvard University.Unsigned article, \\"Renato Poggioli Dies at 56, Noted Scholar and Author\\", Harvard Crimson, May 6, 1963. A prolific writer and translator, who was fluent in five languages, he is considered one of the founders of the academic discipline of comparative literature in the United States. Early life Poggioli was born in Florence, Italy, the son of a railroad administrator. In 1929 he received his doctorate in letters with a specialty in Slavic literature under the direction of Ettore Lo Gatto of the University of Florence. He also worked as a translator and critic. In 1931‚Äì32 he was an exchange professor at the University of Prague, returning to Prague in 1934 to lecture on Italian culture as a representative of the Italian government. He also lectured in this capacity in Vilnius and Warsaw in Poland. In 1935, he married Renata Nordio, a former classmate and student of Spanish literature at the University of Florence.F. Guligan, \\"Faculty Profile: Auditors, Go Home!\\", Harvard Crimson, March 1, 1955. He received a second doctorate in 1937 at the University of Rome. Academic career and writings In 1938 Poggioli, who wished to leave Italy, came to the United States with his wife to teach in a summer program at Middlebury College in Vermont. Virtually on his arrival in New England, he became involved in anti-Fascist initiatives that led in 1939 to the creation of the Mazzini Society, of which he also served as interim president.Roberto Ludovico, \\"Renato Poggioli. Between History and Literature\\", Studi Slavistici 10 (2013): 307. Members included Gaetano Salvemini (whose final lectures before his exile from Italy in 1925 Poggioli had heard as a student at the University of Florence); the former Italian foreign minister, Count Carlo Sforza; and Max Ascoli. In the fall of 1938 Poggioli was hired as a visiting lecturer in Romance language and literatures at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, where he gave a course in Dante. The following year he became Assistant Professor of Italian Literature teaching graduate students at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, with an interruption from 1943‚Äì45 when he served in the United States Army as a translator. The academic year 1946‚Äì47 saw his first stint, at the behest of Harry Levin, as visiting professor at Harvard. He also taught during the summer of 1947 at the University of Chicago. Poggioli's most ambitious project during this period was his founding editorship, with Italian writer Luigi BertiSee the entry on Luigi Berti in the Italian Wikipdedia, who was based in Florence, of the Italian-language literary periodical Inventario (1946‚Äì1963) to which Poggioli contributed numerous articles and translations. The publication was intended to expose Italian readers, whose horizons had for years been narrowed by Mussolini's censorship, to a broad range of new developments in contemporary literature of all countries.Ludovico, \\"Renato Poggioli. Between History and Literature\\": 304 and passim. It published literary and critical works by and about such important writers as Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pablo Neruda, T. S. Eliot, Salvatore Quasimodo, Vladimir Nabokov, and Boris Pasternak. Poggioli's own magnum opus, his Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia, which traced the connection between the twentieth-century avant garde and the legacy of nineteenth-century Romanticism, first appeared in Inventario in four installments between 1949 and 51. In the fall of 1947, Harvard University, as part of its ongoing expansion of its department of Slavic studies, hired Poggioli and two year later, Roman Jakobson ‚Äì in 1952 the two would collaborate on an edition of the Medieval Russian epic, Tale of Igor's Campaign. Poggioli was named full professor of Slavic and Comparative Literature at Harvard in 1950. Unsigned article, \\"Poggioli Is Appointed to Full Professorship\\", Harvard Crimson, April 21, 1950. In 1951 he became head of the Department of Slavic Studies, switching over in 1952 to head the Department of Comparative Literature, a position he held until his death. While teaching at Harvard, Poggioli also received Fulbright grants to teach at La Sapienza in Rome (1953‚Äì54), at the Sorbonne in Paris (1961) and at the University of Puerto Rico (1962). Poggioli's best known book is his Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia (1962), which was not issued as a single volume until 1962.Ludovico, \\"Renato Poggioli. Between History and Literature\\": 308. It was translated posthumously into English as The Theory of the Avant-garde (Gerald Fitzgerald, translator, Harvard University Press, 1968). Poggioli was also the author of The Poets of Russia 1890‚Äì1930 (Harvard University Press, 1960), a study of the poets of the so-called \\"Silver Age\\" of Russian poetry (1890‚Äì1910), which was awarded the 1960 Harvard Faculty Prize; and The Oaten Flute: Essays on Pastoral Poetry and the Pastoral Ideal (Harvard University Press, 1975). Death and legacy After completing an academic year at Stanford University as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Poggioli took his family by car to Portland, Oregon, where he intended to visit Reed College. En route, Poggioli's car crashed, and he died of his injuries several days later in a hospital in Crescent City, California. Mrs. Poggioli was also severely injured in the accident that killed her husband; their daughter, Sylvia, who was in the car with her parents, suffered minor injuries. Poggioli is briefly mentioned in Saul Bellow's 1964 novel Herzog.Saul Bellow, Herzog (New York: Viking Press, 1976), p. 71. His daughter, Sylvia Poggioli, who was born when her father was teaching at Brown University, is the senior European correspondent for NPR.

It is a variation of the game of shinty as played in the fishing communities of Lybster, Caithness. It used to be played widely in the town, as was shinty in the rest of Caithness, but it ceased to be played around the end of the 19th century, until 1993 when it was revived by local enthusiasts. It involves a stick (knotty), which can be almost any form of wooden implement, and a cork fishing float as ball with varying sizes of players. Local history books suggest knotty was invented by the fishing wives of Lybster ‚Äì once one of the Europe's busiest herring ports ‚Äì to help keep their men sober when they were ashore. However, whilst this would have been a fine side effect of the game, the sport draws from the same prevalence of stick-ball games throughout Scotland at that time, many of which became codified into shinty in other areas. With the rundown of the industry in the late 19th century, knotty fell into abeyance until local hotelier, the late Bert Mowat, found a copy containing the few rules of the sport wedged between the pages of a Gaelic bible in a bedroom. World Championship The Knotty World Championship takes place in Lybster every year, Sinclair Bay Hotel of Keiss being 2006 champions. In 2006, the lack of cork floats made in the traditional style was seen as a threat to the continuation of the sport.

The trio is one of Mendelssohn's most popular chamber works and is recognized as one of his greatest along with his Octet, Op. 20. During the initial composition of the work, Mendelssohn took the advice of fellow composer Ferdinand Hiller to revise the piano part. The revised version was in a more romantic, Schumannesque style with the piano given a more important role in the trio. Indeed, the revised piece was reviewed by Schumann, who declared Mendelssohn to be \\"the Mozart of the nineteenth century, the brightest musician, who most clearly understands the contradictions of the age and is the first to reconcile them.\\"Er ist der Mozart des 19ten Jahrhunderts, der hellste Musiker, der die Widerspr√ºche der Zeit am klarsten durchschaut und zuerst vers√∂hnt. Movements The trio has four movements: # Molto allegro ed agitato (D minor) # Andante con moto tranquillo (B-flat major) # Scherzo: Leggiero e vivace (D major) # Finale: Allegro assai appassionato (D minor, ending in D major) A typical performance lasts just under 30 minutes. Molto allegro ed agitato The first movement is in sonata form, without an introduction. It begins with a cantabile main theme played by the cello, with the piano providing a syncopated accompaniment. The violin then joins the cello with a distorted version of the theme. Further variations of the main theme fill the transition to the second theme, also introduced by the cello, which is in A major. Mendelssohn combines both themes in the development, which is predominantly in D minor, the key in which the movement also ends. In the recapitulation, Mendelssohn adds a violin counter-melody to support the return of the original theme. Andante con moto tranquillo The piano introduces the second movement, with the eight bar melody in the right hand and the accompaniment divided between the hands, as in a number of Mendelssohn's Songs without Words. Below this, the bass line in the piano moves methodically, carefully balancing with the accompaniment and the melody. After the piano plays the main theme, the violin repeats it with a counterpoint played on the cello. Scherzo The short and light scherzo is essentially in sonata form. As in the second movement, the main theme is first played on the piano, which then reduces itself to fragmentary accompaniment almost immediately. The rhythmic motif of the main theme is present throughout the movement, except in the more lyrical central section, whose theme resembles material from the first movement. Finale After Hiller gave Mendelssohn his advice, the finale was the most revised movement and unsurprisingly has a busy piano part. Various keyboard techniques are called upon in the movement, from close chords to sweeping arpeggios and chromatic octaves. The cantabile moments provide a refreshing contrast. The trio finishes with a shift to D major shortly before the end.

Sylvia's Lovers (1863) is a novel written by Elizabeth Gaskell, which she called \\"the saddest story I ever wrote\\". Plot summary The novel begins in the 1790s in the coastal town of Monkshaven (modeled on Whitby, England) against the background of the practice of impressment during the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. Sylvia Robson lives happily with her parents on a farm, and is passionately loved by her rather dull Quaker cousin Philip. She, however, meets and falls in love with Charlie Kinraid, a dashing sailor on a whaling vessel, and they become secretly engaged. When Kinraid goes back to his ship, he is forcibly enlisted in the Royal Navy by a press gang, a scene witnessed by Philip. Philip does not tell Sylvia of the incident nor relay to her Charlie's parting message and, believing her lover is dead, Sylvia eventually marries her cousin. This act is primarily prompted out of gratefulness for Philip's assistance during a difficult time following her father's imprisonment and subsequent execution for leading a revengeful raid on press-gang collaborators. They have a daughter. Inevitably, Kinraid returns to claim Sylvia and she discovers that Philip knew all the time that he was still alive. Philip leaves her in despair at her subsequent rage and rejection, but she refuses to live with Kinraid because of her child. Philip joins the army under a pseudonym, and ends up fighting in the Napoleonic wars, where he saves Kinraid's life. Kinraid returns to Britain, and marries. His wife, who knows nothing of their history together, informs Sylvia that her husband is a great military leader. Kinraid's marriage suggests to Sylvia that he was not as faithful to her as she had remained to him, and she then realizes she is actually in love with Philip. Philip, meanwhile horribly disfigured by a shipboard explosion, returns to the small Northumbrian village to try to secretly get a glimpse of his child. He ends up staying with the sister of a servant of Sylvia's deceased parents, and rescues his child when she nearly drowns. He is fatally injured while saving his daughter, but his identity then becomes known and he is reconciled with his wife on his deathbed.  Characters  * Sylvia Robson - the heroine * Daniel Robson - Sylvia's father, a former whaler * Molly Corney - Sylvia's friend * Charley Kinraid - a specksioneer or harpooner on a whaling ship * Philip Hepburn - Sylvia's cousin (her mother‚Äôs nephew), works in a draper's shop * Hester Rose - also works in the draper's shop * Alice Rose - Hester's mother * press-gangs - gangs who capture and force men to fight against France  Reception  The novel is one of Elizabeth Gaskell's least known works. John McVeagh has pointed to a \\"sudden lapse into melodrama\\" which \\"reduces and cheapens an interesting story\\".. The novel does seem to show signs of hurry at the conclusion. For instance, detailed attention is given to Sylvia's growing infatuation with Kinraid, but her eventual disillusionment with him following his hasty marriage at the end of the story is described in only a few sentences. As her obsessive love for him has ruled her life, it does seem surprising that this receives such a cursory treatment. TJW, in an article in the Modern Language Review,. comments that 'Kinraid is eventually shown to be a shallow character, but Mrs Gaskell's portrayal of him is so superficial that we find it hard to appreciate the strength of Sylvia Robson's love for him'. However, it has also received praise and been compared positively with the writings of George Eliot, particularly Adam Bede.

It remains Aghabullogue's only county final victory. Inter-county Buckley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork as part of the Aghabullogue selection in 1890. That year he lined out in his first provincial decider with Kerry providing the opposition. The game was far from exciting, however, at full-time Cork were the champions by 2-0 to 0-1. It was Buckley's first Munster title. Cork's next game was an All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford. The game was a controversial one and was marred by ill-tempered behaviour. A Cork player had his toe broken by one of his Wexford counterparts. Cork captain, Dan Lane, led his men off the field in protest. At the time Cork were trailing by 2-2 to 1-6, however, the GAA's Central Council later backed Cork and Buckley collected an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship title. Buckley was dropped from the Cork team again in 1891, however, he was back in 1892. That year he lined out in his second provincial decider with All-Ireland champions Kerry providing the opposition once again. An exciting game developed, however, at full-time Cork were the champions by 5-3 to 2-5. It was Buckley's second Munster title. Cork's next game was an All-Ireland final meeting with Dublin. The game was a controversial one as referee Dan Fraher changed his mind after initially awarding a goal to Cork. He eventually decided that the GAA's Central Council should decide the matter. Dublin, however, had walked off the field and, because of this, Cork were awarded the title. It was Buckley's second All-Ireland title.

The composition is typical of Bart√≥k's style, utilizing folk elements. The work combines Hungarian and Romanian scales; Hungarian peasant music is based on the pentatonic scale, while Romanian music is largely chromatic.  History of the composition  Allegro barbaro was composed in 1911, but the first performance didn't occur until 1921. According to Maurice Hinson, editor, Bart√≥k premiered the piece in February 1913 in Kecskemet, Hungary. Like many of Bart√≥k's compositions, there are several different editions of Allegro barbaro. The piece was performed in private by Bart√≥k many times by memory before he even started to notate the music. In many early printed versions of the composition, the tempo markings were indicated at a much slower speed. These indications would confuse musicians because the recordings of Bart√≥k performing his own composition was much faster than indicated. Also, many times certain accents and dynamics would be performed by the composer, but would not make it to paper because each performance wasn't the same. The publications of the composition that took place in 1918 in Vienna has become to standard and final edition. Allegro barbaro is a frequent choice of students to orchestrate, in particular for their college studies.  Analysis  File:Allegro Barbaro Score.jpg The opening melody of Allegro barbaro is largely pentatonic (the first 22 notes of the melody use a cell that consists only of a whole tone and a minor third, the building block of the pentatonic scale). Indeed, the opening melody uses a Phrygian mode subset. Like many of Bart√≥k's compositions, this piece circles around a tonal pitch. This pitch almost always stays constant and the major, minor, or modal relations around it changes. Allegro barbaro is a short, dance-like composition, that at first sounds like it's free composed. However, one can begin to find traditional structure to the piece by looking at the harmony. Allegro barbaro is in ternary form, which means that there are two distinct themes, but one is presented twice. A typical diagram looks like this: A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA. The beginning of the composition centers on F, the second thematic area centers on F, and the return of theme 1 is again centered on F. Allegro barbaro melodic material is mostly based on the pentatonic scale, while the underlying harmonies are chromatic. Many of the cadence points end in a major or minor fashion, but arrived by chromatic motion. To keep the edge of freedom and wild force, Bart√≥k frequently breaks the flow of Allegro barbaro in a peremptory way to scare us a little with a potential for violence. The irregular-seeming cadences ending the major phrases and sections catch you by surprise or make you wait a bit for each return to the attack. Many analyses of this composition include the overall form and harmonies, but have not been able to find a pattern in how the cadences are formed. The dynamics are jagged and shocking as well through the entire piece. For example, there are accent marks and the (which means \\"subito fortissimo\\"/‚Äúsuddenly very loud‚Äù) above these lines of the score.  Discography  Allegro barbaro has been recorded on hundreds of albums. Some of the most famous recordings include: * Out of Doors, performed by pianist Jen≈ë Jand√≥ * B√©la Bart√≥k Piano Works, performed by Andreas Bach * B√©la Bart√≥k Baroque Transcriptions performed by Gy√∂rgy S√°ndor Many students and professionals perform this composition in recitals and the list of recordings is quite long. Progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer adapted the piece as \\"The Barbarian\\", featured on their debut album.  References Further reading * Jaroslav Smolka: Mal√° encyklopedie hudby.

Maps of the Yuan dynasty The expansion of Chinese geographical enterprise to a world scale originates from a historical setting of the Mongol Empire, which connected the western Islamic world with the Chinese sphere, enabling both trade and the exchange of information.Miya Noriko ÂÆÆÁ¥ÄÂ≠ê, \\"Kon'itsu Ky≈çri Rekidai Kokuto no Zu\\" he no michi „ÄåÊ∑∑‰∏ÄÁñÜÁêÜÊ≠¥‰ª£ÂõΩÈÉΩ‰πãÂõ≥„Äç„Å∏„ÅÆÈÅì, Mongoru jidai no shuppan bunka „É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´ÊôÇ‰ª£„ÅÆÂá∫ÁâàÊñáÂåñ, (2006) pp. 487-651 After the founding of the Yuan dynasty in 1271, Kublai Khan ordered the compilation of a geography monograph named Dayuan Dayitong Zhi (Â§ßÂÖÉÂ§ß‰∏ÄÁµ±Âøó) (extant manuscripts lack maps) in 1285. In 1286, Persian astronomer JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n made Kublai Khan (who had brought him east to undertake co-operative research with Chinese scholars in the 1260s)Rossabi, Morris; Khubilai Khan: His life and times; University of California Press (1988) , chap. 5 a proposal for merging several maps of the empire into a single world map, and it resulted in the Tianxia Dili Zongtu (Â§©‰∏ãÂú∞ÁêÜÁ∏ΩÂúñ). It was supposedly a world map but is lost today. He also ordered to obtain a book called RƒÅh-nƒÅmah (road book) from Muslim sailors. An extant map attached to the Jingshi Dadian (Á∂ì‰∏ñÂ§ßÂÖ∏; 1329‚Äì1333) proves Mongols' accurate knowledge on Inner Asia that was obtained from Muslims. Influence by these official projects, Taoist monk Zhu Siben (Êú±ÊÄùÊú¨) compiled a geography monograph of China named Jiuyu Zhi (‰πùÂüüÂøó) in 1297. Based on this earlier work, he created a now lost map of China named Yuditu (ËàáÂú∞Âúñ) in 1311-1320. These materials were, however, too large for circulation. What directly impacted Chinese intellectuals were the secondary compilations. In the first half of the 14th century, encyclopedias such as the Hanmo Quanshu (Áø∞Â¢®ÂÖ®Êõ∏) and the Zhishun edition of the Shilin Guangji (‰∫ãÊûóÂª£Ë®ò) updated their geographic knowledge from the preceding Jurchen Jin and Southern Song Dynasties to the contemporary Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty. Newly discovered materials reveal personal networks among intellectuals of southern China, centered in Qingyuan (Ningbo). Qingjun, who was from neighboring Taizhou, created the Hunyi Jiangli Tu when he stayed in Qingyuan. Wu Sidao, who left an important bibliographic clue, was also from Qingyuan. In addition, Ningbo was one of the most important seaports and the sea routes were extended to Fuzhou and Guangzhou, and Southeast Asia, Japan and Goryeo. They must have acquired marine information from Muslim sailors. Maps in the Chinese tradition tended to be known by specific titles, easily expressed as short sequences of ideograms, such as the Yu Gong Jiuzhou Lidai Diwang Guodu Dili Tu (Á¶πË≤¢‰πùÂ∑ûÊ≠∑‰ª£Â∏ùÁéãÂúãÈÉΩÂú∞ÁêÜÂúñ; Map of Capitals of Historical Emperors and Kings in the Nine Provinces described in the Yu Gong). Shengjiao Guangbei Tu The Shengjiao Guangbei Tu (\\"map of the resounding teaching (of the khan) prevailing all over the world\\") by Li Zemin is lost. Its original state can be deduced by examining its derivative works: the Guangyutu (Âª£ËàáÂúñ)(1555) by Luo Hongxian (ÁæÖÊ¥™ÂÖà) contains a pair of maps named Dongnan Haiyi Tu (Êù±ÂçóÊµ∑Â§∑Âúñ) and Xinan Haiyi Tu (Ë•øÂçóÊµ∑Â§∑Âúñ) that are considered to be the southern half of the Shengjiao Guangbei Tu although Luo's copy dropped most place names except for coastal areas and islands. The Da Ming Hun Yi Tu (Â§ßÊòéÊ∑∑‰∏ÄÂúñ/Dai Ming gurun-i uherilehe nirugan), a Ming period map with much later Manchu translations of its labels, is also considered to have been based ultimately on Li Zemin's map. The Shengjiao Guangbei Tu was a world map. It contained not only China but also Africa and Europe. Luo's copy and the Daming Hunyi Tu suggest that the original depicted India more accurately than the Korean adaptation although it is also possible that the Daming Hunyi Tu reflects 17th century knowledge. Little is known about the author Li Zemin. Based on place names on the map, it has been presumed that it was created around 1319 and revised sometime between 1329 and 1338. However, Wu Sidao's statement (described later) suggests that his map was newer than Qingjun's (1360?). Guanglun Jiangli Tu The Hunyi Jiangli Tu by Zen monk Qingjun (1328‚Äì1392) is lost. However, the Shuidong Riji (Ê∞¥Êù±Êó•Ë®ò) by the Ming period book collector Ye Sheng (ËëâÁõõ) (1420‚Äì1474) includes a modified edition of the map by the name of Guanglun Jiangli Tu (Âª£Ëº™ÁñÜÁêÜÂúñ). Ye Sheng also recorded Yan Jie (Âö¥ÁØÄ)'s colophon to the map (1452). According to Yan Jie, the Guanglun Jiangli Tu was created in 1360. The extant map was modified, probably by Yan Jie, to catch up with contemporary Ming place names. The original map covered place names of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty. The Guanglun Jiangli Tu was one of historical maps that were popular among Chinese intellectuals. It showed historical capitals of Chinese dynasties in addition to contemporary place names. It followed Chinese tradition in that it was a map of China, not the world. But contrary to Song period maps which reflected limited Chinese knowledge on geography, it incorporated information on Mongolia and Southeast Asia. It also provided information of sea routes (There remain traces on the Honmy≈çji map). Wu Sidao's work Contemporary to Qingjun, Wu Sidao (ÁÉèÊñØÈÅì), author of Chuncaozhai Ji (Êò•ËçâÈΩãÈõÜ), merged the Guanglun Tu (Âª£Ëº™Âúñ) and Li Rulin (ÊùéÊ±ùÈúñ)'s Shengjiao Beihua Tu (ËÅ≤ÊïôË¢´ÂåñÂúñ) although his map is not known today. The Guanglun Tu must refer to Qingjun's Guanglun Jiangli Tu. It is likely that Rulin was Li Zemin's courtesy name and that Shengjiao Beihua Tu was an alias for his Shengjiao Guangbei Tu. Late maps in the Chinese tradition In 1579, Luo Hongxian published the Guang Yutu atlas, including more than 40 maps, a grid system, and a systematic way of representing major landmarks such as mountains, rivers, roads and borders. The Guang Yutu incorporates the discoveries of naval explorer Zheng He's 15th century voyages along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, India and Africa. From the 16th and 17th centuries, several examples survive of maps focused on cultural information. Gridlines are not used on either Yu Shi's Gujin xingsheng zhi tu (1555) or Zhang Huang's Tushu bian (1613); instead, illustrations and annotations show mythical places, exotic foreign peoples, administrative changes and the deeds of historic and legendary heroes.

She has been promised, in an arranged marriage, to Ernest, Vicomte de Brissac. He is a young nobleman and the son of an old war comrade of Erminie's father. Erminie and Ernest have never met each other. Erminie, however, is secretly in love with her father's secretary, Eug√®ne, and Ernest is secretly in love with Cerise Marcel, who is Eugene's sister and Erminie's friend. Eug√®ne and Cerise are orphans who were taken into his household by Erminie's father. Eugene feels that his subservient position makes it impossible for him to ask the Marquis for Erminie's hand in marriage. On his way to the betrothal ceremony, Ernest runs into a pair of crafty \\"philanthropists\\" (thieves), Ravennes and Cadeau, who steal his money and wardrobe and tie him to a tree. They disguise Ravennes as Ernest and Cadeau as a Baron and blunder into the Lion d'Or for the betrothal, saying that they were waylaid by thieves. Seeing the wealthy wedding guests, they scheme to make off with a lot of money. Cadeaux gets drunk, however, and his bad manners nearly spoil the scheme. Ernest eventually escapes his bonds and arrives late and in disordered attire at the Lion d'Or. Seeing Ernest, Ravennes cries \\"Seize the villain,\\" claiming that Ernest is the thief who attacked them earlier in the day. Ernest is arrested and tossed in jail. ;Act II At the Chateau Pontvert that evening, Ravennes, still disguised as Ernest, pretends sympathy for Erminie's love for Eugene. He promises to help her to elope. At the same time, she unwittingly helps him to rob the house and the wedding guests. Eventually, however, in a farcical comedy of errors and mistaken identities, the plan fails, and the robbers are arrested. Nevertheless, their scheming inadvertently rescues Erminie from the arranged marriage, as both pairs ‚Äì Eugene and Erminie, and Ernest and Cerise ‚Äì are happily united.

The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency operates the house as a historic house museum and offers tours of the home that emphasize Vachel Lindsay's poetry and art. It is open seasonally. Description and history The Vachel Lindsay House is located near Springfield's downtown area, at the southwest corner of South 5th and East Edwards Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a hip-roof single-story porch extending across the center three bays, with square posts and a dentillated cornice. The entrance is framed by a Greek Revival surround, but the doorway itself is a later Victorian feature. The first floor contains an entry hall, two parlors, library, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and pantry. The second floor includes a central hall, sewing room, five bedrooms, bathroom, and trunk room. Rooms have been decorated in the late Victorian style, and included the bed in which Vachel Lindsay was born, a desk he built, and the table at which he did much of his writing. Nicholas Vachel Lindsay was born here in 1879, and at first sought to become an artist. He discovered a talent for poetry, and his first volume was published in 1913. \\"The Congo\\", was published in 1914, and brought him fame. His approach to poetry was unusual and distinctive for the time, using colloquial language, which he delivered in a sing-song chanting style during his public appearances.

The park presents a biodiversity endemic to the area of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, featuring a variety of climates (mountain climate) and geography that ranges from arid sea level to 900 meters above sea level. The park covers approximately of maritime area in the Caribbean sea and approximately of land. It was the second most visited national park in Colombia in 2019, with 458,755 visitors.  History  The Tayrona National Park was created by the 191st Law of the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA), in order to guarantee the protection of the region and the preservation of the ecological environment.  Geography  The park has an area of 150 square kilometers. It is located in the jurisdiction of the Santa Marta municipality, in the Department of Magdalena, alonged the north coast of Colombia which borders on the Caribbean Sea. Taganga is its most southern part; its western boundary goes toward the northeast following the coastline, including a kilometer of sea area, until the Piedras River. The boundary follows the left side of the river until the North Highway, and then toward the west, crossing the following places with clear demarcations in the terrain: * Santa Rosa Hill * Tovar Hill * Guacamayo Pick * Aguas Muertas Hill * Cielito Pick * Hondonada Site * Humo Hill It also crosses several creeks, like the Piedras River, Ca√±averal, Santa Rosa, La Boquita, Cinto, and other water branches, including the Rodr√≠guez and Gairaca creeks. Climate Temperatures in the park and surrounding citites range from at sea level. Rainfall in this region varies from nothing to around per month, but overall the climate is tropical and hot, with agriculture requiring irrigation from streams that drain from the snowy peaks.http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=90008&cityname;=Santa- Marta-Caqueta-Colombia  Flora and fauna  A sign in the park points out that this area is the last place in the world where the endangered cotton-top tamarin still exists Scholars have done an extensive classification of animal species living in the park, which include about 108 species of mammals and 300 species of birds. The Mantled howler, the oncilla, deer and more than 70 species of bats are among the park's typical residents. The park's 300 species of birds include the montane solitary eagle, the military macaw, black-backed antshrike, white- bellied antbird and the lance-tailed manakin. There are also approximately 31 species of reptiles, 15 species of amphibians, 202 species of sponges, 471 species of crustaceans, 96 species of annelids, 700 species of molluscs, 110 species of corals and 401 species of sea and river fish. There are more than 350 algae and more than 770 species of plants. It is one of three national parks in the Colombian Caribbean with coral reefs on its territories, the other two being Old Providence McBean Lagoon and Rosario and San Bernardo Corals.  Archaeology  There is archaeological evidence of ancient human settlements in the area of the park up until the 16th century. The place now has facilities for the eco-tourism, with paths suitable for walks. The Archaeologic Museum of Chairama is located in the Ca√±averal Site, near the mouth of the Piedras River. Other places which attract visitors are Los Naranjos Path, Castilletes Beach, The Pool, the Piedras River and the San Juan Out. The site of El Pueblito was a popular hike but is currently closed in 2019 due to the wishes of the indigenous residents.

A report had appeared in a local newspaper in September, indicating that the British Waterways Board intended to drain part of the Newport Branch of the Shrewsbury Canal, which had been closed since 1944. The Association was formed in response to a suggestion from the North- Western branch of the Inland Waterways Association that a local society was needed to campaign for restoration. In 1966 the Ministry of Transport rejected the restoration proposals, the Association changed its name to the Shropshire Union Canal Society and two years later, in 1968, set out to restore the Montgomery Canal.

The second ship to be named Energy by the Navy, AM-436 was launched 13 February 1953 by J. M. Martinac Shipbuilding Co., Tacoma, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. A M. Baughman; and commissioned 16 July 1954, Lieutenant Commander F. H. Sonntag in command. She was reclassified MSO-436, 7 February 1955.  West Coast operations  Energy arrived at Long Beach, California, her home port, 3 August 1954, and began training along the U.S. West Coast with the ships of her division. On 4 January 1956, she sailed for her first tour of duty in the western Pacific Ocean, taking part in a large-scale exercise off Iwo Jima, and training with ships of the Republic of Korea and the Republic of China. Returning to her home port 15 June, she cruised along the west coast during the next year, conducting sonar tests and serving as a schoolship for officers of the Thailand Navy.  Matsu and Quemoy crisis  During her second deployment to the Far East, from 2 June 1958 to 6 January 1959, Energy stood by at Taiwan during the crisis brought on by renewed Communist shelling of Quemoy and Matsu, and again exercised with Chinese minesweepers. Specialized mine warfare exercises and general training with the fleet along with visits to various west ports, were conducted through the summer of 1960. For the remainder of the year Energy served with the U.S. 7th Fleet in Far East waters.  Final status  Energy after transfer to the Philippines in the 1970s as Davao del Norte (PM 91). Energy was loaned to the Philippine Navy as Davao de Norte 5 July 1972. Energy was later returned and stricken 1 July 1977, she was subsequently sold for scrapping on 8 July 1977.

A semi-official organization with close links to the federal government, it advises the Bundestag (the German parliament) and the federal government on foreign and security policy issues, and also advises decision- makers in international organisations relevant to Germany, above all the European Union, NATO and the United Nations. SWP is regarded as one of Europe's most influential think tanks in international relations. It is headquartered in Berlin and incorporated as a foundation. Sitz der Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik in Berlin  History, Organization and Functions of the SWP  SWP was set up in 1962 in Munich. On 21 January 1965, the Bundestag unanimously decided that the German government would become a member of the foundation. In 2001 the headquarters of the foundation and its research institute moved from Ebenhausen near Munich to Berlin. Since then it has been housed in a listed building on Ludwigkirchplatz. To help it carry out its role as a civil-law foundation, SWP receives institutional funding at a rate determined by the Bundestag. This grant is approved annually on production of a budget by SWP, is paid from the Chancellery budget and covers all costs generated by SWP's core activity. SWP also conducts special research projects that receive third-party funding. In the financial year 2016, the SWP was federally funded to the tune of 12.3 million euros. This support was supplemented by 2.53 m from external sponsors. The Council (Stiftungsrat) is SWP's highest supervisory and decision-making body. It has three ‚Äúbenches‚Äù: # ‚Äúthe Bundestag bench‚Äù, consisting of one representative of each parliamentary party (currently 4). # ‚Äúthe Government bench‚Äù: at least seven representatives of the federal government at the suggestion of the head of the Chancellery (currently 8). # ‚Äúthe private bench‚Äù: at least seven eminent figures from academia, business and public life (currently 8). Additionally, there are a president and two vice-presidents. The president and one of the vice- presidents also have to be eminent figures from academia, business or public life; the other vice-presidency is reserved for the head of the Chancellery. While the Chancellery supervises the organization of SWP, the Federal Government does not control its Council. It can neither assume the Council's leadership nor dominate voting majorities: no single ‚Äúbench‚Äù can reach a simple majority by itself. Moreover, the election of members requires a two- thirds majority. The statutes thus deliberately compel the various representatives on the SWP Council to work together. Every two years, the guiding framework is redrafted by SWP's research department and the institute's leadership, before being submitted to the SWP Council for confirmation and then being put to the vote. Overall, the guiding framework concentrates on general issues in the two-year time frame, with particular reference to the current and foreseeable state of affairs in international politics. It sets specific thematic challenges and topics, for instance the United Nations‚Äô sustainability goals (SGDs), refugees and migrants, the dissolution of regional structures in the Middle East, and international crisis management (examples from the 2017‚Äì2018 research framework). Within the established guiding framework, SWP is free to carry out and structure projects and research as it sees fit. This safeguards SWP's unhindered ability to address long-term issues as well as current events in international politics. Examples include analyses and texts on the crisis in Ukraine; the nuclear agreement with Iran; projects on refugee flows and development cooperation; and Israel and Its Regional and Global Conflicts: Domestic Developments, Security Issues and Foreign Affairs.  Research Divisions and Main Lines of Research  SWP research is organised into eight divisions totalling about 60 researchers: EU/Europe; Centre for Applied Turkish Studies, International Security; the Americas; Eastern Europe, Eurasia; Middle East and Africa; Asia; and Global Issues. There are currently more than 140 staff working at SWP, not counting visiting academics or researchers on fellowships. Following a decision by the SWP Council in January 2001, the staff of the Cologne-based Federal Institute for Russian, Bundesinstitut f√ºr Ostwissenschaftliche und Internationale Studien (BIOst) and the department of contemporary research at the Munich-based Institute for Southeast European Studies (SOI) were integrated into SWP. All staff members of a research division hold university degrees, which tend be aligned with its subject. Among them are political scientists, lawyers, economists, natural scientists, sociologists, and physicists. Officers of the German military are also retained to share their expertise in security-related affairs. SWP publishes all submitted analyses and reports.  Management  The first director of SWP after its transfer to Berlin in 1998 was the political scientist Christoph Bertram, whose task was to integrate the staff members and specialisations of three institutes. Since 2005 the Middle-East expert Volker Perthes has led the Institute, using new approaches to transform it into one of the leading think-tanks in the Western hemisphere. The President of SWP Council is Nikolaus von Bomhard, who until 2017 was chairman of the board at Munich Re (Munich Reinsurance Company). His vice-presidents are the federal minister and head of the Chancellery, Helge Braun, and Angelika Niebler MEP. The chair of the research advisory committee is Christopher Daase (Frankfurt University).  Information Infrastructure  Around 30 members of staff work in SWP's information infrastructure, which provides information services to both SWP academics and the Bundestag and federal ministries. SWP also leads the international relations and area studies information network (FIV), which manages one of the world's largest literature databases in the social sciences, World Affairs Online. This is made available to the (professional) public via various portals, catalogues and indexes, as well as SWP's own professional portal, IREON.  ‚ÄúThe Day After‚Äù Project  As part of the project ‚ÄúThe Day After‚Äù, the SWP together with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) gave Syrian intellectuals and representatives of various Syrian political movements the opportunity to discuss their ideas for the political, constitutional and economic development of Syria following a hypothetical replacement of Bashar al-Assad's government. In 2011‚Äì2012, many governments and observers alike were convinced that the uprising in Syria might well lead to the overthrow of the president, as it had in Tunisia and Egypt. The results of the project were made public in Syria and internationally via the report ‚ÄúThe Day After. Supporting a Democratic Transition in Syria‚Äù. The project did not address ideas, plans or preparations for an overthrow or regime change. A number of Syrians subsequently founded an NGO called The Day After to publicise and discuss the results among Syrians, and to contribute to the post-war order through projects in transitional justice mechanisms, document security and national heritage protection.  The ‚ÄúNew Power, New Responsibility‚Äù Project  A paper co-produced with the German Marshall Fund entitled ‚ÄúNew Power, New Responsibility‚Äù (November 2012 ‚Äì September 2013) called on Germany to assume more responsibility for dealing with ‚Äúthose who disrupt the international order‚Äù. It argued that Germany and the EU need to show more willingness to act on international security issues, recommending inter alia that ‚ÄúEurope and Germany need to develop formats for NATO operations that make them less dependent on US support. This will require increased military deployment and stronger political leadership. Above all, Europe must take greater security precautions in its own neighbourhood: that is its own responsibility and no-one else‚Äôs. Germany will have to make a contribution that is commensurate with its weight.‚Äù The paper attracted much attention and is said to have exerted substantial influence on prominent members of the German government. Peace activists, however, were sharply critical. During the presentation of the new White Book by Federal Defence Minister von der Leyen, Volker Perthes emphasised that Germany was ‚Äúa responsible middle power‚Äù and needed to ‚Äúsafeguard and transmit the European and global order along with other states‚Äù. See also: List of participants in the project ‚ÄúNew Power ‚Äì New Responsibility‚Äù.  WikiLeaks  In November 2010 and January 2011 WikiLeaks published memos by US Embassy staff in Berlin on two events in December 2009 and January 2010 in which SWP director Volker Perthes had participated. Inter alia, the events addressed transatlantic differences of opinion on how to deal with Iran. At the January 2010 event, Perthes raised the question of whether the US was also considering non- belligerent or non-military means of preventing a potential nuclear ‚Äúbreakout‚Äù on the part of Iran. The question was based on the assumption that such programmes (cyber-attacks or other forms of sabotage which could render parts of the nuclear programme inoperative without starting or provoking a war) already existed. Perthes had also voiced this assumption in an article published on Open Democracy in January 2010. It was proved correct by reports showing that the Stuxnet attack must have started at least half a year before the January 2010 conversation at the US Embassy. In a Guardian interview about the January 2010 event at the US Embassy, Perthes said he had suggested that ‚Äúunexplained occurrences‚Äù or ‚Äúcomputer failures‚Äù were preferable to military strikes. And that military strikes or military escalation with Iran definitely needed to be avoided.

Although loyalists were often punished through persecution, beatings, tarring, or destruction of property, Bates never suffered any of these casualties. This was likely due to her low profile, and the respect she maintained amongst her neighbors regardless of the volatile political climate in Philadelphia at the time. Career Ann Bates used her resourcefulness and wit to eventually become a great spy. Because women were generally understood to be uneducated about wartime strategy and armaments during the Revolution, she was able to go un- noticed in American camps.McBurney, Christian M. Spies in Revolutionary Rhode Island. Charleston, SC: History, 2014. Print. While in hiding, she disguised herself as a peddler and freely traveled amongst the American soldiers.Spy Letters of the American RevolutionAnn Bates. Undated, unsigned letter. She is most well known for her spy expeditions at George Washington's camp in White Plains, New York. Entering the spy ring Ann Bates was first discovered by a civilian-spy, John Craig, or \\"Craiggie\\". The two met sometime during British occupation in Philadelphia. Craig was an active member in Clinton's espionage network, and assigned Bates with small secret tasks while they were still in Philadelphia. Craig quickly noticed her intelligence, and referred her to meet with his general, Major Duncan Drummond, in New York City. She would then go on to flee Philadelphia on June 18, 1778, when British commander General Clinton evacuated his forces from the capital. General Clinton added Major John Andre as an aide and commander of his intellegence coordination, this is where Ann Bates became a member of Major Andre's spy ring. This was in response to news of an alliance between France and the United States. As the political climate was changing, Bates was one of many loyalists who left Philadelphia with the British Army. She swiftly left the capital after convincing the General at the time, Benedict Arnold, that she was leaving to sell her goods in New York City. After her husband joined Clinton's army on June 18, 1778, Bates followed the British to their headquarters in New York City. After she arrived at headquarters to meet with Craig, she was surprised to meet with one of Clinton's main spy handlers, Duncan Drummond, instead. The two persuaded Bates to join the British spy network. He was recorded describing their meeting; \\"A woman whom Craig has trusted often came to town last night. She is well acquainted with many of the R.A. (Royal Army)... It is proposed to send her out under the idea of selling little matters\\". Washington's camp and the Rhode Island Campaign Entry of the French squadron in Newport Bay, Aug. 8, 1778 (drawing by Pierre Ozanne, 1778) On June 29, 1778, Bates left New York City for her first mission after only one day of training. She subsequently traveled to Washington's camp in White Plains, New York under the name \\"Mrs. Barnes\\". Because she was familiar with the artillery used during the Revolution, she was able to relay valuable information about the Americans' materials and strategy. Initially, Bates' mission was to find a disloyal soldier in Washington's camp who could give the British intelligence some potential intel, but she was unsuccessful in that mission. She then changed her mission while at the camp, and listened in on many conversations and counted artillery pieces on the camp. At George Washington's camp in White Plains, American troops were planning the Rhode Island Campaign. She recorded valuable intelligence on American movement into Rhode Island. On her way back to New York City after her first mission, she was stopped at an American patrol stop four miles from White Plains for unknown reasons, and arrested at the check-point due to suspicion. Bates remained in confinement overnight, but was released the next morning. Once she finally returned to New York City, she relayed the vast information that she was able to gather to Major Drummond. She reported that American weapons were far more scarce than the British had originally believed them to be. General Drummond was impressed with her work, her memory, and her capabilities. Although Bates had just undergone a stressful mission, she was eager to return to White Plains again. She totaled three trips to the camp, and relayed information necessary for the British troops to combat American military efforts in the Battle of Rhode Island. In her third mission, she noted that 600 boats were being prepared to attack Long Island. Bates was able to give specific and important intelligence about the number of troops that were heading to attack British forces stationed in Long Island. In September 1778, when she was on another mission infiltrating Washington‚Äôs army, a deserter from the British Twenty-Seventh Regiment recognized her, but she was able to elude capture.McBurney, Christian M. \\"Ann Bates: British Spy Extraordinaire.\\" Journal of the American Revolution. December 1, 2014. She then went on to travel through a series of safe houses that were designed for women spies at the time. She later wrote, \\"I had the Opportunity of going through their whole Army Remarking at the same time the strength & Situation of each Brigade, & the Number of Cannon with their Situation and Weight of Ball each Cannon was Charged with\\". New Jersey and capture During her final mission in White Plains, Ann Bates came across a former British soldier, a defector, who she suspected would report her after seeing her. She had recognized him from an earlier mission, and immediately left the American camp. She fled directly back to New York, and while doing so, cut straight through New Jersey. While traveling throughout that state, Bates stayed in Tory safe houses throughout the state. She wrote of the safe houses, \\"where I might be accommodated through the Jerseys.\\" The expansive network of Loyalist safe houses throughout mid Atlantic proved to be effective. Many British prisoners were able to escape American camps from Virginia, up the east coast due to the effectiveness of the safe houses. Bates wanted to get back to British lines as quickly as possible, for fear that her cover would be blown. On Saturday, September 26, 1778, on her way back to New York City, she was discovered at an American headquarters. The American unit had over 5,000 troops, and was under the command of General Charles Scott. General Scott was Washington's Chief of Intelligence, and was on the lookout for British counter-intelligence. Bates was detained and taken to Scott who questioned her. Bates told Scott that she \\"was a Soldier's wife in the Centre Division & had forgot something about five or six Miles below the Plains.\\" Bates eventually was let go, but she was rattled by the occurrences, and suspicion that she was beginning to garner. After she returned to New York City and delivered information to Major Drummond, Drummond took her to Long Island with him for fear of her running into American forces again. A few days later they returned to Manhattan and Drummond asked her to meet with a friend of Benedict Arnold's within a 47-mile radius of Philadelphia. This displays Benedict Arnold's early involvement with the Tory intelligence network. British advancement to Charleston Between October 1778 and August 1779, Bates did not have any participation in Clinton's spy espionage network. This was due to Clinton sending Drummond back to England due to a disagreement between the two. Major John Andr√© went on to take Drummond's place. Andr√© was most well known for his collaboration with well-known American traitor, Benedict Arnold.\\"Spy Letters of the American Revolution\\". University of Michigan. Archived from the original on November 17, 2001. Retrieved 17 April 2016. In April 1780, her husband, Joseph Bates, was sent to Charleston, South Carolina to siege the city. Bates traveled with him there, but refrained from taking part in any further spy networking while in Charleston. An old friend, British Colonel Nisbet Balfour called for Bates' assistance in operating a spy ring out of Charleston. While there were plans for her to aid in General Cornwallis' mission to siege Charleston, both missions were aborted. Legacy Detail of a 1780 map drawn by a British engineer showing the Charleston defensesOn March 6, 1781, Ann Bates and her husband sailed for England. She is remembered as a well-connected, intelligent, and integral spy for the Loyalist army during the American Revolution. Her busy career and the family's economic distress put a strain on her marriage, and Joseph left her soon after they arrived in England. Regardless, Bates took pride in her role after the war was over, and wrote a petition for a pension in 1785. The petition stated, \\"my timely information as the blessed means of saving the Rhode Island garrison with all the troops and stores who must otherwise have fallen a prey to their enemies\\". She contacted Major Duncan Drummond to assist her in securing a pension from the British government for her services during the American Revolution. Major Drummond's personal papers, official government documents, and her memory secured her a pension. Bates' date of death was not recorded, but it is suspected that she died in England. Ann Bates is portrayed by Tina Benko in the AMC TV series, Turn: Washington's Spies.

DeBruin was working as a \\"kicker\\" for Air America in 1963 when his C-46 was shot down. He was a POW at a Pathet Lao prison camp in Laos until he and other prisoners attempted to escape. After this, there is little known about DeBruin's whereabouts. Biography=Early life and military career Eugene DeBruin was born April 1, 1933, in Kaukauna, Wisconsin. He was the second eldest of ten children that grew up in a Wisconsin farm. While growing up, DeBruin became interested in outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing and skiing. After graduating from high school, DeBruin joined the U.S. Air Force in 1952. He served four years, mostly in Japan, as an aircraft mechanic reaching the rank of Staff sergeant. During that time, he also obtained a private pilot license. He practiced judo during his time in Japan. After being discharged from the Air Force, DeBruin enrolled at the University of Montana at Missoula, Montana, obtaining a bachelor's degree in forestry. He then worked as a \\"Smokejumper\\" for three years in Alaska. DeBruin then moved to Mexico to learn Spanish with the intent of becoming a writer. After declining to join the Peace Corps, DeBruin volunteered as a \\"kicker\\" with Air America. His job was to kick the pallets of rice and other food out of an airplane to aid Lao refugees.Briggs, p. 204. According to his brother, he had plans of joining the Peace Corps after he finished his stint with Air America. Capture and first escape attempt On September 5, 1963, during one of his flights over Laos, DeBruin's C-46 cargo airliner was shot down by ground fire.Briggs, p. 208. He took off on a mission with fellow Americans, C. Cheney and Charles Charles Herrick, Thai Pisidhi Indradat, Prasit Promsuwan and Prasit Thanee, and Chinese To Yick Chiu. He crashed about 2 kilometers from Tchepone in Savannakhet Province. DeBruin, To, and the three Thai nationals parachuted to safety, but were immediately captured by the Pathet Lao. Cheney and Herrick were killed in the crash. After his capture, DeBruin was moved to four different prisons, together with the other four prisoners. In May 1964, they managed to escape for three days, but were caught at a watering hole. =Second escape attempt= After that failed attempt, DeBruin attempted a second escape. The other six prisoners who worked together for this second attempt were: *Pisidhi Indradat (Thai) *Prasit Promsuwan (Thai) *Prasit Thanee (Thai) *To Yick Chiu (Chinese) *Duane W. Martin (American) *Dieter Dengler (American) Dengler was the last to arrive at the POW camp, and was initially distrusted by the other prisoners as they thought he might be an informant.Dieter on Gene Debruin video Eventually the prisoners advised Dengler of their past escape attempts. On June 29, 1966, while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand and foot restraints and grabbed the guards' unattended submachine guns. The Pathet Lao guards spotted some of the other prisoners trying to escape. A shootout between the two sides ensued and Dengler and Indradat ended up killing five guards so the others could escape. Two others ran off, presumably to get help. The seven prisoners split into three groups: Indradat, and the other Thai prisoners; DeBruin stayed with To, who had been too ill to continue with the escape; and Dengler and Martin headed for the Mekong River to escape to Thailand. Martin was killed by a Laotian villager, while Dengler was rescued after 23 days in the jungle. Indradat was also rescued later. Later life Of the seven prisoners that attempted to escape, only two reached safety (Dengler and Indradat). One report stated that DeBruin was killed in the escape attempt, but Indradat originally reported that he last saw DeBruin attempting to \\"reach high ground in a classified location\\". In March 1971, the Central Intelligence Agency had reconnaissance Team Papaya/305 operating in the area of DeBruin's capture. Tasked with gathering military intelligence concerning DeBruin, it returned a report that the CIA's case handler thought truthful:Briggs, pp. 210‚Äì211. > Eugene Henry DeBruin arrived at Muong Phine (XD 0927) in late 1966. On or > about 3 January 1967 DeBruin was taken from Muong Phine and arrived at Muong > Nong (XD 6010) on or about 5 January 1967.

The villagers did not know Ong Lui's > rank and said he was not from that area, but probably came from NVN to get > the prisoners. The villagers were told only that DeBruin and the others were > being taken away for training. End of report. The case agent's superiors in the CIA disbelieved the report, as did the Defense Intelligence Agency. DeBruin's brother, Jerome DeBruin, traveled to Laos in 1972 in search of information. Although the Pathet Lao admitted holding American prisoners of war, they insisted that the United States negotiate directly with them to ensure their release, but this never happened. Eugene DeBruin in film Eugene DeBruin was portrayed by Jeremy Davies in Werner Herzog's 2007 film Rescue Dawn. The film focuses mostly on Dieter Dengler's life as told to Herzog by Dengler himself, but has been severely criticized by members of the family of DeBruin and Indradat, the other survivor of the group, for portraying DeBruin as a selfish and unstable prisoner who threatened to betray his fellow prisoners at any time, and who, at the time of their escape, did not know what to do. Herzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but Herzog was unaware of this until after the film had been completed. Herzog states that this narrative aspect probably would have been included had he learned it earlier.Herzog, Werner, The Making of a True Story, documentary feature on the American DVD release of Rescue Dawn See also *List of people who disappeared NotesTextual reference * Briggs, Thomas Leo (2009).

The Kingdom of Mysore (Kannada ‡≤Æ‡≥à‡≤∏‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤∏‡≤Ç‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤•‡≤æ‡≤®,maisuru samsthana) (1399 - 1947 CE) was a kingdom of southern India founded in 1399 by Yaduraya in the region of the modern city of Mysore. The Wodeyar dynasty, as the ruling family is known, ruled the southern Karnataka region until Indian independence in 1947, when the kingdom was merged with the Union of India. Origin Mysore palace lit up at night Sources for the history of the kingdom include numerous lithic (stone) and copper plate inscriptions, written records in the Mysore palace and contemporary literary sources in the Kannada language such as the Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, describing the achievements of King Kanthirava Narasaraja I, court music and composition forms in vogue; Chikkadevaraja Vamshavali, describing the Wodeyar family history; Chikkadevaraja Binnapam, on the achievements of King Chikka Devaraja; and Keladinripavijayam. Information about Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan are available from various linguistic sources including Nishan-i-Haidari in Persian and Haider Name in Kannada.Kamath (2001), pp. 11‚Äì12, pp. 226‚Äì227; Pranesh (2003), p. 11Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 23 Other historical sources are Apratimavira Charite, Chikkadevaraja Vijaya and Chikka Devaraja Yaso-bhushana, on the achievements of King Chikka Devaraja; Kanthirava Narasaraja Charitra, on the life of King Kanthirava Narasaraja I; Deva Raja Vijaya, on the reign of Dodda Devaraja; Maisuru Arasugala Purvabhyudaya; Kalale Doregala Vamshavali; documentation pertaining to the Dutch East India Company relations with Mysore for the 1762‚Äì1790 period; Portuguese sources on the life of Haider Ali; and written documents by catholic missionaries from the mid-17th century.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 23; p. 89; Kamath (2001), p. 12Subrahmanyam (2003), p. 64Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89 According to legend, when the city of Dwaraka (in modern Gujarat state) had drowned in the ocean, the Hindu god Krishna asked Parvati (consort of the Hindu god Shiva) to protect his descendants and make them rulers of the southern region of Yadushaila (modern Melkote in Karnataka state). As per his wishes, Parvati brought Krishna's descendants to the Chamundi hills in Mysore and made them rulers there.Pranesh (2003), p1 The historical origins of the kingdom are obscure. The kingdom is first mentioned in early 16th-century Kannada literature from the time of the Vijayanagara King Achyuta Deva Raya, while the kingdom's own earliest available inscriptions date from the rule of a petty chieftain, Timmaraja II, in 1551.Stein (1989), p82 It is known that the kingdom originated as a small state based in the modern city of Mysore and that it was established by two brothers, Yaduraya (also known as Vijaya) and Krishnaraya. The origin of the brothers is, however, contested. Some historians claim a northern origin, saying that they came from Dwaraka, while others argue that they were originally from the Karnataka region. The earliest mention of their origin in the city of Dwaraka and their journey down to the Mysore region is found in the writings of Govinda Vaidya (17th century), court poet of Narasaraja Wodeyar, and is later repeated in the writings of Tirumalarya, court poet of Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar.Pranesh (2003), p2Kamath (2001), p226 According to these texts, the two brothers arrived at Mysore in 1399, for reasons which differ by text. At that time, the incumbent King Chamaraja died, leaving behind his queen, Devajammanni, and a princess, Chikkadevarasi, but no male heir to the throne. Yaduraya killed Maranayaka, the army commander who tried to assert his power over the royal family, married princess Chikkadevarasi, and was crowned with the feudal title \\"Wodeyar\\", which the ensuing dynasty retained.Rice B.L. (1897), p361 This theory has been rejected by other historians, who counter that it is farfetched to believe that two brothers could arrive there from a distant city and begin ruling as kings. Instead they claim that the founders of the kingdom were descendants of the local Tonnur Hoysalas. According to this theory, when the Hoysala Empire succumbed to the Mogul invasion in 1327 (and the capital Halebidu was sacked), the Hoysala family withdrew to the Tonnur region (modern Tondanur near Melkote in modern Mandya district) and continued to rule from there as petty chieftains under the Vijayanagara Empire. The historians claim that Yaduraya, the chieftain of Melkote, rescued the queen of Mysore by killing the commander Maranayaka, married princess Chikkadevarasi, and launched the new Wodeyar dynasty.Pranesh (2003), p3 According to another theory, the brothers were most likely Yadava fugitives from the Vijayanagara Empire court who took advantage of the upheaval caused by the king's death to gain control of the Mysore region.Wilks and Aiyangar in Aiyangar (2004), p275-276 It is known that the Mysore feudal family initially controlled no more than a handful of villages and grew into a kingdom only after the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.

It runs from King's Lynn to Cromer via Fakenham, which it bypasses to the north. Route=King‚Äôs Lynn starting point Road Sign at the Junction of the A148 and Britons Lane to Beeston Regis. Holt is incorrectly displayed as a Primary Destination, though as Holt is the next major town, it is displayed for navigation purposes Starting at the western end, A148 starts as an exit from a roundabout on the A47. It runs in a northerly direction, as Saddlebow Road, through the King‚Äôs Lynn suburb of South Lynn. In just over Safdlebow Road becomes Wisbech Road and crosses the River Nar. The road now joins a roundabout at the bottom end of King's Lynn. At this roundabout the A149, Hardwick Road, runs of to the right whilst the B1144 is straight across the island and runs around the eastern skirt of the town. The A148 turns right and northward and is now called London Road. The road soon passes under the South Gate of what were once the town's defences. This gateway was built during the Reign of Edward III. It is brick built with stone surrounds to the arches. The gate only straddles the northbound carriage way and was restored at a cost of ¬£80,000Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk: South Gate in 1982. The road now takes a route through the heart of King's Lynn as St James Road and after enters a one way system as Railway Road. At the road turns right into Austin Road and at its junction with Littleport Road it reverts to a two way carriageway again, and after a short distance crosses a bridge over the Gaywood River and becomes Gaywood Road. The road soon passes the King Edward VII School on the right and on out into the Suburb of Gaywood. Gaywood road then becomes Lynn Road and now after from the start the road takes a left turn into Wooton Road. The road direction is now to the north east towards South Wooton. At the road comes to a 'T' Junction controlled by traffic lights. From the left is the A1078 which terminates at this junction and to the right the A148 continues on its way out of King's Lynn. Now Grimston Road, the road inclines towards a large roundabout. King‚Äôs Lynn to Hillington It is now since the start and the roundabout is the junction with the A149 Queen Elizabeth Way. The A148 continues on over the roundabout now signposted to Fakenham and Cromer. The road is now characterised by long straights through dense woodland on both sides of the carriageway. After the road crosses the River Cong, and a turning on the left which is the B1440 to Sandringham and the Royal Estate there. At the village of Hillington is reached. On the left as you enter the village is a filling station and the three-hundred-year-old coaching inn called the Ffolkes Arms Hotel. Many years ago the attic rooms of this Inn were used to lock up prisoners overnight who were being transported to Norwich Prison. further on from the hotel is the gatehouse entrance to Hillington Hall. This estate once extended over of the Norfolk Countryside and was the home Ffolkes family who purchased it in 1678. The purchaser was Martin Ffolkes who was the Attorney-General to Queen Catherine who was the wife of Charles II. Hillington to Fakenham The road now skirts the boundary wall of Hillington Park on its left and passes the B1153 (southbound) to Grimston on the right. At the end of the wall on the left the road passes the junction with the northbound B1153 to Flitcham. The road now heads in an easterly direction over undulating West Norfolk countryside towards Harpley. At the mark, the long distant footpath Peddars Way cross the road south to north at Harpley Dams just before the village. Peddars way is an old Roman road. From here the road inclines sharply. The road has an overtaking lane on the Eastbound carriage way which allows passing only on that carriage way and is marked with double white lines on the westbound carriageway. The village Harpley is bypassed on the right hand side. A brown tourist signpost on the left points out the road to nearby Houghton Hall just out of the village. The next section of the road towards the villages of East and West Rudham are characterised by long straight sections of road. Now having travelled from the beginning the road reaches West Rudham. In the heart of the village on the left is a 17th-century Inn called the Duke‚Äôs Head. The pub is a free house and has log fires. At the road passes through East Rudham passing on the left side of the village green and the Crown public house which is located on the eastern side of the green. On the way out of the village the road also passes a pub on the left called the Cat and Fiddle but was formally the Bakers Arms. Further on the road reaches the villages of Tattersett on the left and Coxford on the right and crosses the Culvert of the River Tat a tributary of the River Wensum although you can not see the river from the road. After passing the junction of the B1454 to Docking on the left (), the road now crosses an area of rolling hills and dips and passes the former airbase of RAF Sculthorpe on left. The road then drops down towards the village of Sculthorpe by-passing it on the left. At the road passes the junction of the B1355 to South Creake and the Burnhams on the left. This stretch of road between this junction and before reaching a traffic island which marks the start of the Fakenham by-pass, is called Creake Road. Fakenham to Cromer The road drops down into the heart of Cromer At the roundabout the A1065 from Swaffham joins from the right. Straight across is the old route of the road called Wells Road which takes you into the center of Fakenham. The A148 bares left and now by-passes the town swinging around to the north passing the B1105 to Wells-next-the-Sea on the left. Now at the road comes to another roundabout. The road to the right is A1067 from Norwich which terminates at the island. Straight over the island is the continuing A148. The next stretch of road sees the first speed camera at from the King's Lynn start point. According to the Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership, the siting of this camera has resulted in only 1% of drivers breaking the speed limit along this section of the road, although before and after accident figures are not available. The Junction right to Kettlestone just past this site has always been a notorious accident Black Spot, as has the staggered cross road Junction at Little Snoring just beyond. At the road passes through part of Little Snoring and through a cross road junction with Snoring Road. On the right just past the junction is the Green Man Public House. For the next the road dips and rise through scenic woodland on either side of the road crossing the River Stiffkey at Brookhill plantation. On the right at Thursford is another filling station and a restaurant called the Old Forge. Dating from the 14th century the old forge was once a coaching station and many years ago was a resting place for pilgrims making their way to Walsingham Abbey. Today it is a popular seafood restaurant. Now at since the start, the road emerges from the woodland and reaches a junction where the B1354 sweeps away to the right towards Melton Constable. The A148 swings northeast up an incline over a crossroads and past the Crawfish public house on the left which serves Thai food. The route now inclines and straightens out passing through more woodland before entering an area of open countryside. This long straight takes you to another filling station on the left. Bale Filling station marks from the start. Speed camera site at Bale 500m from the garage is the second and last speed camera on the A148. Once again the placing of this camera has been a deterrent to speeding with only 2% of drivers passing this point breaking the speed limit, although again it is not clear whether this has resulted in a reduction of accidents. From the camera's location the road takes a long sweeping bend toward the north east and once again the road is characterised by long straight section across open countryside. At the road to the left at the crossroads is the B1156 to the village of Langham, the right hand lane leads to the village of Sharrington. further on from the crossroads the road narrows in width and enters a section that is undulating and includes some very sharp blind bends. Drivers should be mindful of the fact that this road is used considerably by HGVs and this section should be driven with great care. At the road passes through the village of Letheringsett. On the right in the centre of the village is the Kings Head Public House which is a fine example of a Georgian Building. Also on this junction is one of two Watermills in the village. The road crosses the River Glaven next to this redundant mill and 100 m further on passes a Brown Tourist sign locating the second Watermill on the right. Letheringsett WatermillLetheringsett Watermill, Holt, Norwich, Norfolk, milling demonstrations, wholewheat flour, spelt flour is the last remaining watermill in Norfolk to produce flour. From Letheringsett the road inclines towards the Town of Holt reaching the western end of the town center at . In the past the A148 passed through the center of this Georgian town but today it by-passes the center. At the next roundabout the road turns left on to the bypass. The road to the right is the B1110 to Melton Constable, the road straight over the island is the B1149 to Norwich. The by-pass was built on the old track bed of the Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway. At the road from the left marks the point were the by-pass rejoins the old route of the A148. Just before this junction is Holt Station on the preserved part of the afore mentioned railway. It is the North Norfolk Railway which runs from Holt via Weybourne to Sheringham. The road now passes through High Kelling and out into the open countryside. Glimpse of the sea can now be seen on the left as the road heads towards the village of Bodham at . further on is the junction with the B1157 on the left which takes travellers to the village of Upper Sheringham. Also at this junction there is a brown Tourist Sign indicating the entrance, 10 m from the junction, to Sheringham Park which is a National Trust property. The roads route now takes the high ground parallel with the coast. This high ground is called the Cromer Ridge and is on average about 90 meters above sea level, the highest point of Norfolk is located on this ridge at Beacon Hill at 105 meters above sea level. At 39¬Ω is the left hand junction to Sheringham on the A1082. At is the left hand turn to Beeston Regis (the location of the top picture of the road sign). Continuing on and the road passes a public house called the Roman Camp Inn on the right hand side of the road. There is a filling station here also on the right. Beacon Hill is a on the left but is not visible as the road here is shrouded with dense woodland on both verges. The woodland on the right hand side of the road marks the boundary of the Felbrigg Estate, also in the hands of the National Trust. After the next junction on the left is the B1436 to Roughton. Reaching the final part of the road the route now crosses the bridge of the Bittern Line railway that links Norwich to Cromer and Sheringham, and drops down the Cromer Ridge, past the North Norfolk District Council Headquarters on the right into the town of Cromer. At there is a filling station on the right operated by British Petroleum. At this section, the road has the designation of Holt road before becoming West Street after a Mini roundabout as it approaches the town Center. There is a Public House called the White Horse on the Left and just 50 m further on the A148 reaches its Terminus/Start at a junction with the A149.

Geology Callander Bay is an eroded Proterozoic volcanic pipe formed by the violent, supersonic eruption of a deep-origin volcano. These volcanoes originate at least three times as deep as most other volcanoes, and the resulting magma that is pushed toward the surface is high in magnesium and volatile compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. As the body of magma rises toward the surface, the volatile compounds transform to gaseous phase as pressure is reduced with decreasing depth. This sudden expansion propels the magma upward at rapid speeds, resulting in a shallow supersonic eruption. Callander Bay contains uncommon rocks such as nepheline syenite and carbonatite and the minerals: aegirine, amphibole, analcime, apatite, barite, biotite, calcite, cancrinite, chalcopyrite, chlorite, diopside, dolomite, fluorite, garnet, hematite, kaersutite, magnetite, muscovite, nepheline, olivine, perthite, pyrite, pyroxene and pyrrhotite.

The trust was created in 2000. History In 1964, reports appeared in local newspapers that the British Waterways Board intended to drain part of the Newport Branch, which had been officially closed since 1944. The North-Western branch of the Inland Waterways Association suggested that a local group should be set up to campaign for the restoration of the canal, and the Shrewsbury and Newport Canal Association was formed in December 1964 to pursue that aim. Following the rejection of their initial plans, the group became the Shropshire Union Canal Society, and then spearheaded the restoration of the Montgomery Canal, which had also been part of the Shropshire Union network. Over 30 years later, the Shrewsbury and Newport Canals Trust revived the vision for the canal. It was registered with Companies House on 21 September 2000 as a private company, limited by guarantee, with no share capital, and has the company number of 4075920. It is also a charity, number 1088706, registered with the Charity Commission. The aims are stated to be the restoration of the Shrewsbury Canal and the Newport Arm of the Shropshire Union Canal, including its structures and building, for the public good. Activities In 2001, the Trust produced a document entitled \\"The Shrewsbury and Newport Canals - A case for restoration\\", which they circulated to the five local authorities who manage the areas through which the canals run. The local authorities are the County Councils of Staffordshire and Shropshire, Stafford Borough Council, and Telford and Wrekin Council. They specifically asked that the councils should give support in principle to the aim of restoration, including working with the Trust and with the other affected local authorities, should support the production of a feasibility study into the restoration, and should use planning powers to protect the line of the canal. Stafford Borough Council's consideration of the report listed ten benefits to the community which would arise from the restoration. The report was well received by the local authorities, all of whom gave their support in principle. The feasibility study was commissioned in 2003, and Alun Michael MP, the Waterways Minister, presented the findings in 2004, which concluded that full restoration was both technically possible from an engineering point of view, and economically viable. The estimated cost for full restoration is ¬£86 million. In 2007, the Wappenshall canal basin and warehouse were put up for sale. The Trust campaigned for it to be purchased and restored, rather than turned into flats, for which outline planning permission existed. In June 2008, Telford and Wrekin Council agreed to fund the purchase of the site, allowing the Trust to concentrate on its restoration, rather than trying to raise the money for its purchase.

Throughout the 1980s, WLOL was most known as a top- rated CHR station. The current inhabitant of the 99.5 FM frequency is KSJN, owned by Minnesota Public Radio, which purchased the station in 1991. Since then, the WLOL call letters have been used by several AM and FM stations in the area. The WLOL call letters currently reside at 1330 AM, the original station to hold them. History The 99.5 frequency dates to 1945 when AM station WMIN started broadcasting on the new FM band. WMIN-FM was sold in 1956 to the owners of WLOL, becoming WLOL-FM, which remained its call sign until being sold to MPR in 1991. The history of the WLOL call letters is intertwined with many other area stations. WLOL was first used in 1940 when WLOL signed on the air at 1300 AM and was a part of the Mutual Broadcasting System. The station moved to 1330 in March 1941 as required by the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) under which most American, Canadian and Mexican AM radio stations changed frequencies. For many years, WLOL-FM had a variety of formats. The original classical music format gave way to easy listening in 1973, then later soft rock as Easy Rockin' FM 100 WLOL. The AM station was sold to MPR in 1980 and became KSJN (AM). The owner retained WLOL-FM, and on December 12, 1981, the station dumped soft rock and became Musicradio 99¬Ω WLOL, the only Twin Cities FM station playing Top 40 music at the time. The new WLOL became a massive success, eventually achieving a 10 share in the Arbitron ratings.http://radiotapes.com/WLOL/WLOL-FM_Sales_Kit_12-12-1981.pdf Get Me Up, WLOL! WLOL was noteworthy for its presentation. The station combined typical top-40 programming philosophies with a local touch and relied heavily on unique jingle packages, including the now iconic \\"Get Me Up!\\" jingle, which was written by Kyrl Henderson of the now defunct Reel Good Productions. Local artists such as Prince & The Revolution, Morris Day & The Time, Information Society, Alexander O'Neal and The Jets all received support from WLOL. The station was purchased by Emmis Broadcasting in 1983. New competition arrived later that year when longtime AM top-40 station KDWB returned to its co-owned FM frequency after the FM's several years of playing album oriented rock. WCCO-FM briefly switched to top-40 in the fall of 1982, but after dismal results, it reinvented itself as Adult contemporary WLTE. WLOL and KDWB became bitter rivals throughout the 1980s, with WLOL and the (John) Hines and (Bob) Berglund Morning Show dominating the format for the next five years. In 1988, KDWB, which had been in a slump for years, hired a new program director and new airstaff, updated its on-air presentation and promotion, and created a new logo. By the end of the 1980s, the tables were turned. Some listeners felt WLOL had grown stale and KDWB had become the hip new CHR station. From that point on, KDWB led WLOL in listenership, and became the dominant CHR station in the market. In addition, the Steve Cochran Show toppled Hines & Berglund in the ratings. Playing catch-up, WLOL started tweaking the programming and airstaff, shook up its longtime morning show, and finally, in May 1990, teased a format change. On May 11, WLOL became a rhythmic top 40 station, dropping rock bands such as Bon Jovi, Def Leppard and Aerosmith and replacing them with Dance, Hip-Hop and R&B; music.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1990/RR-1990-05-18.pdf It aired dance mixes of songs, sometimes creating in-house custom mixes. Labeling itself as Today's Best Music, the new WLOL hired a new airstaff and rejuvenated itself as 99.5 WLOL. The end of WLOL, and relocation of KSJN While ratings did improve and 99.5 was neck- and-neck with KDWB (which WLOL personalities derided on-air as K-DWeeB) in the Arbitron ratings, finances at this time grew tight for Emmis after founder Jeff Smulyan led a group which purchased the Seattle Mariners in 1990. The company started selling off some of its most successful stations, including WFAN in New York City and KXXX in San Francisco. WLOL became the next Emmis sale; on December 26, 1990, the station announced it would be sold to Minnesota Public Radio, which had sought for years an additional FM station in the market to use for KNOW (coincidentally, the original WLOL licensee).http://www.startribune.com/search-the-star-tribune-paid- archives/120225044/https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-01-11.pdf MPR planned to move KSJN from 91.1 to 99.5 and move KNOW to 91.1. Pop music fans in the Twin Cities were furious as WLOL slowly counted down to its last day, which finally came on February 26, 1991. The staff spent WLOL's last day paying tribute to the station by playing music and jingles from the station's ten-year history, covering 1 year per hour (8-9 a.m. for 1981, 9-10 a.m. for 1982, and so on). Former air personalities dropped by or recorded farewell messages, and 92 KQRS, K102 (where morning host John Hines later landed) and even KDWB bought advertising time on WLOL, redirecting listeners to their stations. WLOL signed off with a half-hour montage of clips from songs played by the station during its ten-year history, followed by a sign-off announcement from Hines and \\"Miss You Much\\" by Janet Jackson. At around 6:30 p.m., when Jackson said \\"That's the end?\\" in the song, WLOL Program Director Gregg Swedberg responded \\"Yes\\", ending live programming from WLOL. At 7 p.m., after about a half hour of dead air, WLOL started playing music without live DJs for about an hour (with more liners in between from KDWB wishing WLOL \\"happy trails\\" and redirecting listeners to their station), after which it officially signed off with 1999 by Minneapolis native Prince fading out as WLOL ended after 35 years of serving the Twin Cities.https://archive.org/details/cftp-wlol-1991-02-26WLOL Signs Offhttp://radiotapes.com/WLOL/WLOL-FM_Final_Hour.mp3 The next morning, 99.5 FM became the new home of KSJN, and KNOW-FM made its debut at 91.1. Future locations of WLOL call letters Shortly after WLOL's demise on 99.5, KXLV, a station located north of the Twin Cities in Cambridge at 105.3 FM, picked up the WLOL call letters for its Hot AC format. When the station was purchased and turned into WREV, its new sister station, KZTG, became the new parking spot for the historic calls. This continued until 1999, when AMFM Broadcasting (soon to be absorbed into Clear Channel Communications) purchased the WLOL calls for a new station to make its debut at 100.3 FM, in an attempt at bringing back the WLOL '80s-era excitement, albeit with a 1970s-oriented classic hits format. The new WLOL lasted until 2003, when it flipped to smooth jazz. Hubbard Broadcasting considered putting the call letters on one of its stations, even putting a ten-day hold on them with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but eventually declined. In 2005, when Starboard Media sought out new call letters following its purchase of 1330 AM, the unclaimed WLOL calls returned to its place of origin, this time standing for \\"Our Lady of Lourdes\\". Technical aspects of 99.5 In 1971, WLOL-FM participated in \\"quadcast\\" (quadraphonic stereo) experiments with KSJN, when that station was located at 91.1 FM.

Classic versions of State of War and State of War: Warmonger were released in December 2018 on Steam.  Story  This description is told by narrator at the beginning of the game. After centuries of continuous struggles, war and turmoil; humankind finally came together and founded the United Federation of Seven Continents (UFSC). It was decided that every member of the Federation would provide their armed forces to build a single military unit with the goal to protect the Earth and settle eventual conflicts. Thus it was no longer possible for any individual group to use military force to resolve their personal aim. Within several years, the Federation created a Global Defense Network, known as \\"Overmind\\". Actually, it was a super intelligent mainframe computer - a unique work of hundreds of the most gifted scientists on the planet. It was operated by an intelligent software and consisted of 22 military bases worldwide located far from populated areas ready to act in case of the conflict. Since then, no machinery was ever controlled by man. Only the formal approval to activate \\"Overmind\\" had to be given by each UFSC representative. Global society, however, carried its burdens. People suffering from spiritual emptiness sought refuge in organizations that offered salvation. The most influential among them was the Beho-Sunns. Charismatic leaders of the cult used their personal charm and rhetorical skills to attract more and more people. Their audience included every social group from workers, scienties, lawyers to elite politicians. Behind it all, there was the wicked plan to get hold of \\"Overmind\\". None of the Beho-Sunns followers knew that during their meditation seasons the cult gathered all kinds of information from their minds. Over years, the Beho-Sunns discovered much about Overmind's mechanics and were able to hack the software which controls Overmind. It so happened that the Beho-Sunns leaders tried to hack Overmind, but due to sophisticated firewall protection, they failed. Consequences were fatal. The Global Defense System went out of order and malfunctioned. Members of the Beho-Sunns quickly recovered from their defeat and started occupying defenseless military bases. Their actions must be halted! To do so, the UFSC have declared a state of war. Sequels A sequel titled State of War: Warmonger was released. Designed as a stand-alone version, the game includes 16 new missions in which 11 are single-player and 5 multiplayer.http://www.cypronia.com/pc In 2007 a sequel titled State of War 2: Arcon was released in the Czech Republic, Slovakiahttp://www.cypronia.com/pc and Russia.http://ru.akella.com/Game.aspx?id=436 In 2008 a Nintendo DS game titled Command and Destroy was releasedhttp://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/1_T5VbpgZxMi3Og5-VBmBbXGCjgcvF65#game- details featuring similar visual and real-time strategy design.

He became Director of the √âcole des Hautes-√âtudes. He was an agr√©g√© in philosophy, contemporary with Henri Vaugeois and Louis Dimier. As a young man he was a strong nationalist and anti-Dreyfusard. He was the leading literary critic of Action fran√ßaise and the author of the first work on Charles Maurras. Along with Georges Valois, Lasserre was one of the first to work to incorporate Nietzschean themes into neoroyalism.Frohock, Wilbur Merrill (1937). Pierre Lassare: The Evolution of His Critical Doctrines, Edwards Brothers, Incorporated. Life Lasserre defended neo-classicism against romanticism, which he tied to the ideals of the French Revolution. He upheld a controversial thesis on this topic in 1907, on French Romanticism, at the University of Paris. Part of his general argument, that the French romantics had damaged the concept of monarchy, was influenced from the side of the Action Fran√ßaise and Maurras. That strand of anti-romanticism, close to that of the essayist Ernest Seilli√®re and the counterrevolutionary tradition, later affected Carl Schmitt and his Politische Romantik of 1921. Up to World War I, Lasserre was a militant, associating with Charles P√©guy and digesting the ideas of Georges Sorel. He opposed the trend of modernisation in the university system, supporting classical and humane studies. His colleagues Henri Massis and Alfred de Tard were concerned also at the perceived falling away of classics at the Sorbonne. In 1914, Lasserre broke with Maurras and the Action fran√ßaise. Others in the circle had made much of a crude form of his arguments on romanticism: Louis Reynaud had claimed German romanticism was corrupting of contemporary French culture, and Lasserre was Germanophile and not a subscriber to the nationalist line of the Action fran√ßaise. He subsequently followed an orthodox academic career.Halperin, Maurice (1934). \\"Pierre Lasserre as a Liberal,\\" PMLA, Vol. 49, No. 4, pp. 1154-1165. Works * La Crise chr√©tienne.

It stars Pat Shortt, Anne-Marie Duff and Conor J. Ryan. The film tells the story of a lonely petrol station attendant and how he slowly begins to come out of his shell. Garage won the CICAE Art and Essai Cinema Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Film prize at the 25th Torino Film Festival. Plot Josie (Pat Shortt) is a good- natured man with learning difficulties who lives and works at a garage in a small rural Irish village. The owner, Mr Gallagher, is a former schoolmate who is not interested in the garage and is only waiting for the right offer from developers so he can sell. For Josie, one day rolls into another with nothing but his menial job and a few pints in the local pub, even though the regulars mock him and his ways. Kind-hearted Josie's only other companion is a large horse that is tethered alone in a field. He talks to the animal and brings it food. One day his boss hires his girlfriend's 15-year-old son, David (Conor Ryan) to help Josie. Slowly Josie connects with David as they endure the slow and menial pace of the garage. One night after work, Josie innocently shares some beers with David. They sit and watch the sunset at the rear of the garage. Josie joins David and other local teenagers down by the railway tracks and brings beer for all of them. The new social aspects to his life lifts his confidence. At the local pub, he gets the courage to dance with Carmel, the local shopkeeper. But she shows her cynicism for Josie by explicitly telling him she feels no physical attraction towards him. The friendship between Josie and David progresses nicely until one fateful day after work. Josie shows David a pornographic film which Josie received from a trucker who frequents the petrol station. David feels uncomfortable and leaves. Josie, sensing something is wrong, follows him outside but is unable to clarify the situation. David returns the following week but does not stay after work. Instead, he leaves with Declan, a local boy who openly mocks and despises Josie because he is different. Nevertheless, Josie offers Declan a beer and cheerful goodbye. The next day, the local Garda come to the garage and take Josie to the police station because there has been \\"a complaint\\". It transpires that David told Declan about the previous weekend's incident and word reached David's mother that Josie had supplied her son with alcohol and shown him pornography. After an interview with a sympathetic officer, Josie explains it was just a bit of \\"craic\\" and \\"pure innocent\\". No charges are brought and he is released. But he is told to stay away from the town and especially to avoid contact with David. Josie returns to the garage. While eating dinner, he suddenly realises what has happened. Shocked, he puts his head in hands all alone in his little room at the back of the garage. The next day Mr Gallagher comes to the garage. Although not explicitly stated, Josie is told that he or the garage are finished. Unable to sleep that night, Josie gets dressed and sits on the edge of his bed. He then goes down to the river at dawn and sits for a while on the bank. Josie then takes off his well- polished shoes and socks before neatly placing his garage cap on them. He then wades slowly into the water arms outstretched. In the final scene, the lonely horse which was tethered in a field, has been cut free. It stops and looks directly into the camera as the screen fades to black. Cast * Pat Shortt as Josie * Anne Marie Duff as Carmel * Conor J.

Garage initially had a limited release in 11 cinemas around Ireland, with a wider release afterwards. Reception Garage received generally positive reviews, based on its showing at Cannes. The Irish Times declared \\"Pat Shortt is a revelation in the central role. He brings a wonderful physicality to the character of Josie.\\" Screen daily also gave good reviews stating \\"The comic timing of the first two-thirds of the film, on the part of both actor and director, is impeccable.\\" RT√â said \\"Playing the misfit with a poignancy that bears down on you more with every scene\\" and gave it four stars. Awards As well as winning the CICAE Art and Essai Cinema Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, Garage has been an official selection for the London Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the S√£o Paulo Film Festival, the Torino Film Festival and the Pusan Film Festival.

He is the host of Savage Family Diggers, a reality treasure hunting show airing on Spike TV. He also conducts haunted \\"ghost tours\\" in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Huguelet wrestled across the eastern seaboard of the U.S. from 1990 until 1997. While spending much of his career in the independent circuits, he also wrestled for the National Wrestling Alliance, United States Wrestling Association, Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and National Championship Wrestling. Professional wrestling career=Early career Huguelet broke into the wrestling business in the independent circuit in western North Carolina. He was trained initially in a garage in Waynesville, North Carolina by Chuck Justice, a high school friend. Savage then wrestled every independent show he could before getting his first television break with South Atlantic Pro Wrestling in 1991 in a televised match against Chief Wahoo McDaniel. Savage then trained briefly under the \\"Russian Bear\\" Ivan Koloff at his school in Indian Trails, North Carolina. Professional Wrestling Federation Huguelet went to work for the Professional Wrestling Federation owned by Gary Sabaugh (The Italian Stallion) and George South. Savage would compete against Nelson Knight and Bobby Knight before the pair went to the World Wrestling Federation as Men on a Mission. He also wrestled \\"Mean\\" Mark Canterbury. World Championship Wrestling Sabaugh booked Huguelet with World Championship Wrestling where he would perform at several television tapings in 1992, but was used as a jobber. Huguelet left WCW at the advice of friend and mentor Jimmy Valiant, to wrestle for Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Alliance. United States Wrestling Alliance Huguelet would only work for USWA for a week due to a desire at that point to leave professional wrestling and begin preparing for a career in law. While working for Lawler, Huguelet feuded with Skull Von Krush. He would also wrestle Tommy Rich, Eddie Gilbert, and The Moondogs. Huguelet had the opportunity to work with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, where he would build a friendship with Ricky Morton. After Huguelet left the USWA, he began to focus more on college and wrestled on the independent circuit to pay his bills. He toured with Jimmy Valiant for several months. Huguelet also tried a brief, unofficial cross-promotion with 1980s glam metal band Quiet Riot, but the venture was not a success. National Wrestling Alliance Huguelet wrestled for the National Wrestling Alliance, where he was booked by former Four Horsemen member Tully Blanchard, and was managed by former Freebird Michael P.S. Hayes. Huguelet had formed a tag-team with a biker gimmick called the Hard Riders with Frankee Lawless (Mark Cavnar) and the pair became the leading \\"heel\\" tag-team in the new NWA wrestling federation based out of the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas and run by pioneer professional wrestling promoter Jim Crockett, Jr. The Hard Riders feuded with brothers Chris and Mark Youngblood. The Hard Riders also competed against Ahmed Johnson, Greg Valentine, Chris Adams, C.W. Anderson and the Junkyard Dog. Huguelet and Lawless met an obscure brother duo at this time that would influence Huguelet's later career. The team was Matt and Jeff Hardy. Huguelet would work closely with the Hardy's for the remainder of his time in wrestling. The Hard Riders drifted apart after Crockett folded in 1996. Extreme Championship Wrestling In 1996, after getting his bachelor's degree from Western Carolina University, Huguelet and travelling partner Kid Kash rode to Philadelphia to get work with Extreme Championship Wrestling at the suggestion of Savage's friends New Jack and Rob Van Dam. Huguelet wrestled several house shows as Shane Douglas' Bounty Hunter in an ongoing feud with The Pitbulls. Paul Heyman had Huguelet change his name to Ric Rage to avoid any conflicts with WCW over \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage. Huguelet left ECW after a few months, but Kash stayed on. After ECW, Huguelet went back to the independent circuit. During this time he made a regional television promo with Rickey Medlocke of Blackfoot, now the lead guitarist of Lynyrd Skynyrd. The promo was aimed at curbing domestic violence against women in western North Carolina but never aired. Huguelet also made some regional talkshow appearances as well. Independent circuit Huguelet and Cavnar reunited The Hard Riders when Ric Flair offered the team a shot to try out for WCW where they had a dark match the following week at Center Stage in Atlanta. The gimmick did not go over with WCW fans and was dropped. Huguelet then went back to the independent circuit as a single's wrestler and changed his look to a grunge rocker. His old friend from the NWA Ahmed Johnson introduced him to Chief Jay Strongbow at a WWF show. Strongbow scheduled a dark match for Savage in Fayetteville, North Carolina. But Strongbow suffered a massive heart attack and was released from the WWF before he could return. Huguelet's dark match fell through the cracks. National Championship Wrestling Huguelet teamed for a while with Bull Buchanan in a team called \\"Body Count\\" in National Championship Wrestling which was a promotion owned by Huguelet's longtime manager and friend Steve Martin. But Buchanan was first signed by Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling and later by the World Wrestling Federation causing him to leave Body Count. Huguelet then teamed in Body Count with David Young and Rusty Riddle. Riddle turned on Huguelet and joined Kid Kash and feuded with Huguelet and Young for the NCW world tag titles. It was in 1996 that Huguelet partnered with Martin in National Championship Wrestling, and Huguelet began to help create the wrestler's characters, storylines, and do interview coaching. NCW did monthly television tapings from Huguelet's hometown of Sylva, North Carolina. Notable wrestlers that worked for NCW during that time are Matt and Jeff Hardy, Brad Cain (Lodi), Shannon Moore, Ricky Morton of the Rock and Roll Express, Bull Buchanan, Kid Kash, Jason Arhndt (Joey Abs of the Mean Street Posse), Rick Michaels, and Chris Hamrick. NCW later became NWA Wildside and was briefly syndicated after Huguelet left the promotion. Retirement After suffering from a left knee reconstruction, and three lower back surgeries, Huguelet retired from professional wrestling in 1997. Initially, he moved to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where he performed a live storytelling presentation called Haunted Gettysburg for author Bob Wasel at the now defunct Conflict Theater. It was in Gettysburg that Huguelet met his wife Rita. They have three children and two recent grandchildren. In 1998, Huguelet moved his family to New Jersey, where they lived until moving to Virginia in 2009. Huguelet is very interested in American history, in particular the Civil War. He is an avid artifacts collector, and maintains a website that assists collectors in identifying fake Civil War and World War II relics. He enjoys metal detecting across the country for historical artifacts. Since 2007 Huguelet has written a column for American Digger magazine called The Savage Facts that provides tips on identifying fraudulent Civil War and other militaria collectibles. He has done lectures for Civil War roundtables, metal detecting clubs, and other historical organizations across the United States on avoiding the pitfalls of buying fake or misrepresented militaria items. It was announced on August 10, 2011 that Spike TV bought 13 episodes of the new reality show, American Digger, featuring Huguelet and his team of artifact recovery experts. However, the concept of the show is being protested by a number of archaeological and historical institutions, including the Society for American Archaeology and the American Institute of Archaeology, as promoting illegal looting and destroying shared cultural history. In April 2013, American Digger magazine stated that they would no longer have any association with Rick Savage, saying, \\"We won‚Äôt lie, our dropping his association was in great part because of the controversy his TV show has created, and the confusion that American Digger Magazine had anything more than a passing association with the Spike TV series which shares our name.\\" According to Huffington Post, the American Anthropological Association sent Spike TV a letter \\"urging [the network] to withdraw or modify the contents\\" of \\"American Digger\\" because it \\"wrongly represents archaeology as a treasure- seeking adventure, in which our collective heritage is dug up and sold for monetary gain.\\" Savage Family Diggers (previously American Digger) In 2012 American Digger debuted on Spike TV. The show performed well and drew an average audience of 1.2 million viewers weekly. Huguelet and his crew of artifact recovery experts dug on private property in Tombstone, AZ, Brooklyn, NY, Detroit, MI, Mechanicsville, Jamestown, and Middletown, VA, Chicago, IL, Venice, LA, St. Augustine, FL, Asheville and Sylva, NC, Girdwood, AK, and Aiken, SC. It was announced in August 2012 by Spike TV that another 13 episodes of American Digger had been ordered and would be filmed in the fall and winter with a planned airtime in spring 2013. American Digger is produced by Gurney Productions who also produce Duck Dynasty, Auction Hunters, American Guns, Hollywood Treasure and Haunted Collector as well as many Shark Week specials. One of the signature points on the show is when Huguelet yells his catch-phrase \\"boom baby\\" after a significant discovery. The phrase is popular with show fans and has been made into both T-shirts and ringtones. In December 2012, Spike TV announced that American Digger would be renamed Savage Family Diggers for its second season premiering January 30, 2013, saying the name change better reflects the crew which adds Savage's wife Rita and son Nick to the dig team. Highlights from the second season would be a dig with Emmy nominated actor Bill Paxton and his son James, a dig lead to Memphis, Tennessee from Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Rickey Medlocke, a hunt for Blackbeard's treasure, and a tour of one of America's Gilded Age havens, loaded with mansions of the early elite. The Savage~Turner Rock Express Radio Show/Podcast In November 2013, Ric Savage and Erik Turner of '80's powerhouse Band, Warrant (American band), joined forces to create The Savage~Turner Rock Express Radio Show. The show airs Saturday and Sunday nights at 10p EST on the KZOI / KZOY FM stations located in Sioux City, Iowa and Sioux Falls, SD. The show streams worldwide at Sunnyradio.com. The show consists of Savage and Turner interviewing guests from a diversity of fields from rock musicians to professional wrestlers. Guests have included: Rickey Medlocke of Lynyrd Skynyrd, actor Peter Sherayko, Gary Hoey, Matt Hardy, and other notable personages from all genres of entertainment. The interviews are punctuated with music from artists from the '80's through today. The show used to contain a weekly fitness tip from Todd Howard, star of Spike TV's Worlds Worst Tenants, and also a special segment with Rock legend Carmine Appice, former drummer for Rod Stewart, Ozzy Osbourne, and Vanilla Fudge. He is currently the drummer of The Rascals. The radio show became a podcast in 2016, and it is hosted on SoundCloud. Guests have included Nick Searcy, John Moyer of Disturbed, Ambassador Scott Brown and more. ‚ÄúBorn to be Wild‚Äù Single and Video In March of 2016 Ric Savage teamed up with Danger Danger frontman Ted Poley and Trixter guitar wizard Steve Brown to do a heavy metal remake of the iconic Steppenwolf hit, Born to be Wild. They were joined by the legendary Carmine Appice on drums, ‚ÄúThe Fretless Monster‚Äù Tony Franklin from Whitesnake on bass, and Mike Orlando of Adrenaline Mob on lead guitar. The single was released by Rocker Records, and the video was shot in New Jersey and is available on YouTube. Greg Smith, bass player for Ted Nugent played the bass track on the video.

Founded in 1917 as a regiment of the British Indian Army, the regiment re-used the name of an unrelated earlier unit, the 10th Regiment (1st Burma Rifles) Madras Infantry, which evolved into the 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles. After Burma was formally separated from India, the regiment was allocated to Burma. Following Burma's independence from Britain in 1948, the regiment was absorbed into the new Burmese army. Origins of the regiment=Early history The expansion of the British Indian Army during World War I led to the raising of two companies of Burma Pioneers in Mandalay in November 1916. Burmese of all groups were recruited for these units. After expanding to four companies, the Pioneers became the 70th Burma Rifles in September 1917. The 85th Burman Rifles were raised from the Burma Military Police in July 1917. A second battalion of 70th Burma Rifles was raised in January 1918 and both battalions served in the Middle East in 1918‚Äì20. Two more battalions were raised during 1918. According to John Gaylor in his history: Sons of John Company ‚Äì The Indian & Pakistan Armies 1903‚Äì1991, the 3/70th Burma Rifles, raised in April 1918, went to Southern India to suppress the Moplah Rising whilst the 4/70th, raised in May 1918, remained in Burma. 1922 reorganisation of the British Indian Army In the 1922 reorganisation of the British Indian Army the 70th Burma Rifles and the 85th Burman Rifles were merged to form the 20th Burma Rifles. The new regiment numbered four regular battalions. A new battalion, the 11th (territorial) battalion was also formed in 1922. The Burman element in the regiment was mustered out after 1927, although Burmans continued to serve in the Burma Military Police. Personnel drawn from the hill-tribes of Burma and other groups (Karens, Kachins and Chin) continued to serve and in 1940 Burmans were again recruited, although the Anglo-Burmese tended to be overly represented in the Burma Rifles and the Burma Military Police. Separation from India After the British formally separated Burma from India in 1937 the 20th Burma Rifles was allocated to Burma and renamed the Burma Rifles. The intention was for officers to be drawn from the British Army. However the majority of the British officers already serving with the regiment chose to remain with their units on secondment from the British Indian Army. World War II The regiment was expanded during the Second World War to a total of 14 battalions and served through the Japanese invasion of Burma during the Burma Campaign. Eight Battalions of Infantry were raised along with a holding battalion, a training battalion and four territorial battalions. The men of the territorial battalions were under no obligation to serve outside the borders of Burma. After the British Burma Army's retreat from Burma, a reconstituted 2nd Battalion continued to take part in the Burma Campaign. The remaining highly weakened battalions were disbanded although many of the non-Burmese nationals (Indians and Gurkhas) from them went to form battalions of the Burma Regiment created in September 1942. The 2nd battalion participated in the 1st and 2nd Chindit expeditions into Burma. In his official report following the first expedition Orde Wingate the Chindit commander wrote: As a result, for the 1943 Chindit operation, the battalion was expanded and broken down into reconnaissance platoons for the Chindit columns. In 1944, the battalion was broken down into three detachments for attachment to Special Forces units among the Chindit force. In 1945, the 2nd Burma Rifles was reconstituted as an infantry battalion. In July 1945, the 1st battalion was re-raised in Burma. Over the following three years leading up to Burmese independence, the 3rd through 6th battalions were re-raised. Post World War II Reorganised as a conventional infantry battalion of four companies, the 2nd Burma Rifles was based at Hshiarpur in India, where it remained until August 1945. It was listed in September 1945 as being as part of an internal security and administration static command in the South Burma District. In January 1946 the battalion was transferred to Syriam and in May 1947 formed part of a force involved in operations against dacoits. On 4 January 1948 Burma became independent and the Burma Rifles was absorbed into the new Burma Army, which unlike its Indian and Pakistani counterparts did not retain the regimental structure and traditions of the former Indian Army. Uniform and insignia The mess uniform of the Burma Rifles was rifle green with scarlet facings. In Volume 2 of his work \\"Indian Army Uniforms\\" W.Y. Carman describes a full dress uniform in the same colours, noting that it was worn by officers and other ranks forming part of the Coronation Contingent of 1937. It is not however known on what other occasions (if any) it was used. The last surviving Burma Rifles Officer, Major Neville Hogan MBE noted the following further insignia distinctions from the World War II period: Shoulder titles : rifle green with \\"BURMA RIFLES\\" in red. Collar dogs: a (male) Burmese peacock (displaying) over a title-scroll \\"BURMA RIFLES\\" in white metal (officers silver or silver gilt). Officers pips: silver for full dress, black for service dress. Black embroidered onto red worsted (after the traditions of the 60th Rifles/KRRC). Enlisted stripes & crowns: black embroidered onto rifle green worsted (after the traditions of the 95th Rifles/Rifle Brigade). This unusual mix was noted and verified by photographs in Major Hogan's collection.

The Xenodiscaceae, named by Frech in 1902, presently contains ten families, only one of which was included in the original Otocerataceae of Hyatt, 1900, the remaining having been added. The Xenodiscaceae has its origins in the Middle Permian in the prolecanitid Daraelitidae through the ancestral Xenodiscidae. According to Kummel (1952) and Arkell et al. (1957) the Xenodiscidae gave rise to the Otoceratidae and Ophiceratidae. The Ophiceratidae in turn gave rise to the Dieneroceratidae which is considered the source for all remaining ceratitid stocks. All four families made up the original Otocerataceae The Xenodiscidae is removed from the Otocerataceae as originally perceived (Arkell et al. 1957) to become the root of Xenodiscaceae, as emended. The Otoceratidae remains the type family of the Otocerataceae as revised. The Ophiceratidae is reassigned to the Noritaceae along with the Dieneroceratidae. The Huananoceratidae, Liuchengoeratidae, Plueronodoceratidae, and Tapshanitidae, described by Zhao et al. 1978, include Late Permian and Early Triassic genera from Asia.

The specific epithet velleioides is a reference to how sterile material of this species resembles Velleia spathulata. It is an herbaceous annual that grows from 15 to 30 cm tall. Obovate leaves, about 6-30 per plant, either form a terminal rosette with stems present or a basal rosette when stems are absent. The leaves are generally 8‚Äì33 mm long and 3.5‚Äì9 mm wide. This species produces 1-3 scapes per plant. Inflorescences are 15‚Äì25 cm long and produce pink flowers that bloom from March to November in their native range. S. velleioides is endemic to tropical Queensland from Mount Surprise to St Lawrence. Its typical habitat has been reported as along creekbanks and seepage areas in eucalypt woodlands. S. velleioides is similar to several other species in section Debilia. It, like S. paniculatum, has a paniculate inflorescence, but differs from S. paniculatum by its longer capsules and column. It can also be confused for S. semipartitum, which has glandular-hairy leaves and scapes whereas S. velleioides's leaves and scapes are glabrous. It is also related to S. debile, which has bracteoles present, racemose inflorescences, and shorter columns and posterior petals. In his assessment of the conservation status of this species in 1999, Tony Bean described it as secure.Bean, A.R. (1999). A revision of Stylidium sect. Debilia Mildbr., S. sect.

Katz (241 Iowa 115, 40 N.W. 2d 41 (1949)) was a landmark civil rights victory involving the Katz Drug Store in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Case synopsis On July 7, 1948, at 3:45 p.m., Edna Griffin, her infant daughter Phyllis, John Bibbs, and Leonard Hudson entered the Katz Drug Store in Des Moines, Iowa, and ordered ice cream at the lunch counter. The manager refused to serve them, saying, \\"It is the policy of our store that we don't serve colored.\\" Outraged members of the community responded with sit-ins and picketing directed at Katz and other local lunch counters that refused to serve people because of race. The Polk County Attorney's Office prosecuted the Katz manager under Iowa's only civil rights law, a criminal statute prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. The manager was found guilty by a jury and fined $50. The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the conviction on December 13, 1949. On December 2, 1949, civil rights attorneys Charles P. Howard and Henry T. McKnight, who was head of the local NAACP Legal Redress Committee, negotiated an agreement, which successfully ended Katz's discriminatory practices. Iowa Civil Rights Act In 1884, the Iowa General Assembly enacted a law making it a crime to deny any individual \\"The full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement,\\" on the basis of such factors as race, religion, or ethnic background. Prior to 1884, only Massachusetts, New York, and Kansas had enacted statutes that guaranteed African Americans and other minority groups equal opportunity in \\"places of public accommodation.\\" The Iowa state courts, however, tended to interpret narrowly the legislative intent of the 1884 Act. Because the public accommodations provision specifically enumerated types of facilities, the court construed that it necessarily meant to exclude from its operation those facilities not so listed. Many kinds of establishments catering to the public were therefore left untouched by this provision; these establishments retained an unfettered discretion to discriminate among their patrons on such bases as race, religion, or ethnic background. Among establishments that were exempt from the proscriptions of the 1884 Civil Rights Act, were retail stores, beauty shops and salons, parking lots, gas stations, schools, health clinics, doctors' and dentists' offices, hospitals, banks, loan companies, lawyers' offices, real estate brokers' offices, employment agency offices, as well as many others.

During all of these tours of duty, she exercised with ships of other NATO navies, joined in fleet operations, and visited a large variety of Mediterranean ports. In both 1956 and 1957, Exultant spent a month in northern waters, in 1956 exercising with minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in 1957, participating in cold weather sweeping operations out of Argentia, Newfoundland. Her other activities through July 1960 included fleet operations in the Caribbean, as well as individual training there, amphibious exercises on the beaches of North Carolina, and participation in experimental operations in the development of mine warfare.  Exultant catches on fire with loss of life  On 12 August 1960, while underway off the U.S. East Coast, Exultant suffered extensive interior damage from a flash fire in her engineering spaces. Valiant performance of duty by the minesweeper's damage control parties, and gallant help from extinguished the flames and enabled Exultant to return safely to port. Five of Exultant's crew lost their lives in the blaze.  Final status  Exultant decommissioned 30 June 1993 and was stricken from the Navy list on 9 March 1994.

A posthumous One More Grain 7\\" single of the traditional English song Scarborough Fair was released via Static Caravan in 2008. Following the announcement of his retirement, Quinn moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, and oversaw \\"In Nem\\", a New York minimalist-inspired, gamelan recording project in Central Java. This was in addition to writing liner notes for Trance Gamelan in Bali. Quinn then became a writer and editor for an Indonesian volcano website, Gunung Bagging, which provides information on the peaks of the country with 1,000 metres topographic prominence, known as the Ribus. After five years in Indonesia, Quinn moved back to the UK and settled in Stornoway. His new EP, I, Sun, was released via Bandcamp in April 2016. Currently Quinn is working as a critical thinking and creative problem solving consultant.

The series aired in syndication in the United States.Magers, Boyd. Western Clippings. \\"Casey Jones\\". Retrieved April 8, 2019 Casey Jones aired on the BBC in the United Kingdom and on the Seven Network in Australia. Synopsis The series is set in the late 19th century, featuring the adventures of railroad engineer Casey Jones and the crew of the Cannonball Express steam locomotive, fireman Wallie Sims and conductor Redrock Smith, working for the Midwest and Central Railroad. Casey lived in the fictional Missouri town of Midvale, within commuting distance of St. Louis, with his wife, Alice, their young son, Casey, Jr., and their dog Cinders. Although there really was a famous locomotive engineer named Casey Jones of the Illinois Central Railroad, the television series is only loosely based on him. However, it uses the real names of his train, the Cannonball Express. The name of the character Wallie Sims is a conflation of Illinois Central employee Wallace Saunders, who wrote the earliest version of \\"The Ballad of Casey Jones,\\" and the real Jones' fireman, Simeon \\"Sim\\" Webb. Unlike Wallie Sims, both Saunders and Webb were black. Kenneth Gamet, the producer of Casey Jones, offers a gentler Western series against the more violent adult shows of the time. Casey Jones features the same classical types of plots as other westerns such as train robbers and vandals, but the episodes center as much on Casey's interaction with his family, particularly Casey, Jr.Casey Jones at FIFTIESWEB.

Retrieved April 8, 2019 Shot for one season, in part because of Alan Hale's commitment to filming episodes of Rory Calhoun's The Texan, the series ran for 32 half-hour black-and-white episodes. Its theme song was a version of the \\"Ballad of Casey Jones\\". The regular version of the opening titles features Alan Hale with Bobby Clark in the cab and credits Mary Lawrence, but the inclusion of Cinders is inconsistent. A reversed image is used in a close up of the Cannonball and the nameplate can be seen as reversed behind the show title. There are alternate versions of the closing credits. Both feature Alan Hale and Bobby Clark waving from the cab, the second features different shots of the Cannonball, including one of it passing over a trestle and the brow of a hill, and a different version of the song with slight amendments to the lyrics (to include Cinders).

Background Born as Rose Rosenbaum in Manhattan on December 29, 1890, she graduated from Normal College (formerly known as the Female Normal and High School) in 1910 at the age of 19, with degrees in mathematics and music. According to an article based on a 1995 interview, she enrolled in 1907. According to her obituary in The New York Times, Rose Rosenbaum was at that time the youngest graduate in the college's history. She went to her first horse race in Germany and after returning to the United States she attended most, if not all, the Preakness Stakes between 1915 (or 1918) and 1988 (or 1992). She became the first woman licensed in Baltimore to sell real estate (at age 47, in 1938). She still managed her schedule so she could make it to the track at Pimlico almost every day. In 1975 she moved back to Manhattan to be near her children. She gave up selling real estate to become a rental agent for a Manhattan building, but eventually returned to selling real estate, retiring in 1990, aged 99, only because, at that time, as she put it: [The New York real estate] market had been absurdly bad ... I miss it‚Äîlife is without a challenge. She focused on the track becoming a regular at the Aqueduct and Belmont Racetracks. She began to get a lot of attention after she turned 100.

Fortify was launched 14 February 1953 by Seattle Shipbuilding and Drydocking Company, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Donald Scobie; and commissioned 16 July 1954, Lieutenant R. Juarez in command.  West Coast operations  Fortify first arrived at Long Beach, California, her home port, 3 August 1954, and in December became flagship of Mine Division 92. Fortify was reclassified MSO-446 on 7 February 1955. During her first tour of duty in the Far East, from 1 July 1955 to 17 February 1956, Fortify took part in exercises with Japanese, Korean, and Chinese minesweepers, as well as fleet operations in Japanese waters. Her training activities and participation in exercises along the west coast prepared her for additional tours of duty in the Far East where she participated in Exercise \\"Bulwark\\" in the Philippines on March 1958 and Thailand in 1960. USS Fortify was deployed off the coast of South Vietnam in 1962‚Äì1963 in the Tonkin Gulf. Its minesweeping gear was removed and an electronic countermeasures \\"box\\" was installed on the fantail. The ship was involved in monitoring and intercepting Viet Cong radio transmissions and it vectored South Vietnamese gunboats to interdict large junks coming down the coast from the north that were suspected of furnishing arms and ammunition to cadres of Viet Cong in the south. During its monitoring activities, the ship was frequently the subject of sorties by North Vietnamese torpedo boats who would bear down on the ship in the late night - early morning hours. However, the torpedo boats never actually attacked but veered away after the ship went to general quarters. These are the same torpedo boats that purportedly \\"attacked\\" USS Maddox in the first Tonkin Gulf Incident. USS Fortify participated in Operation Market Time Patrol (coastal surveillance force) from 1968 through the end of the war. During patrol Fortify was responsible for boarding and searching South Vietnamese fishing junks for smuggled weapons and other contraband intended to aid the Viet Cong. In July 1971 Fortify embarked on a WestPac deployment for coastal patrol in the coastal waters of South Vietnam and returned to her new home port at the Naval Base Guam upon completion of her tour. After the mining of Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam by the United States, Fortify was placed on alert and was sent underway from Guam to operate in the coastal waters of South Vietnam off of the coast of Da Nang as a precautionary countermeasure. The minesweeper was assigned to participate in Operation End sweep after the war (removing mines laid by United States in Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam and other water ways). Operation End sweep was one of the final military operations to end the war in Vietnam. The crew of USS Fortify crew earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation for their service. Fortify was decommissioned on 31 August 1992 and struck from the Navy list on 9 March 1994. She was sold for scrapping in 2000.

He is said to be a good saint to invoke in cases of rheumatism. St Miliau is a figure of some importance in Breton cult and legend. He is sometimes represented as a cephalophore, i.e. holding his own severed head. It is hard to be sure what historical core there might be to the legends. Legend The legend of St Miliau, as retold in Brittany, pictures him as a good and just prince, slain by his evil brother. Miliau was the son of Budic and grandson of Alain le Long, kings of Armorica in Brittany. His brothers were Theodoric and Rivod. Miliau is said to have married Haurille and their son was St Melar. Miliau was famous as a protector and benefactor of the poor, and is represented as dividing his cloak with a beggar, like St Martin of Tours. When he succeeded to the throne, Rivod had him assassinated by decapitation, around 531. A few years later, Rivod eliminated Melar in the same way.\\"Saint Miliau\\", Nominis Detail from the Retable of the Passion at Lampaul-Guimiliau, showing the martyrdom of St Miliau. Blood gushes from his neck as he holds his severed head. However, the historical Alan I, King of Brittany, flourished in the 9th century and died in 907. He really did have a son called Budic, who did not succeed him as king. The date 892 is sometimes given for the martyrdom of St Miliau, making him a contemporary of the Carolingian emperors, rather than the early Merovingian kings. This seems a better fit with the alleged ancestry of St Miliau, and it is reasonable to suppose that Budic might have had two sons who quarreled over their ranking within the kingdom. This dating separates Miliau from St Melar by more than three centuries. On the other hand, the paternity, and even the geographical origins, of Melar are disputed, and it possible that the connection between the two is based on a misunderstanding. A further confusing factor is that St Herv√©, whose date of death (as an old man) is generally given as 556, is also regarded as a native of Guimiliau. Even the earlier dating for Miliau would make it improbable that Herv√© was born in a village of that name, though it would not exclude the possibility that he was born in that locality some time before Miliau.

Route description Starting at the Wissahickon Transfer Center, Route 38 crosses the Schuylkill River along City Avenue, winds its way through the River Park neighborhood to Belmont Avenue and the Please Touch Museum in Fairmount Park. Turning southeast, the route continues along Parkside Avenue, 40th Street, Mantua Avenue and Spring Garden Street. After recrossing the Schuylkill River and circling the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the route enters Downtown via Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 20th Street. Buses reach 5th and Market Streets by way of Market and Chestnut Streets, and return on Market Street and JFK Boulevard. History=Streetcar service The original streetcar line ran from Parkside Loop on Parkside Avenue (where it connected with the Fairmount Park trolley) to Market Street and Delaware Avenue (now Columbus Boulevard). On August 7, 1908, streetcars were rerouted into the Subway-Surface tunnel. Bus service Buses replaced trolleys on October 15, 1955, following the original route, but only as far as 33rd and Market Streets. On May 27, 1956, it was extended east along Market Street back to City Hall. On September 1, 1960, Route 38 was extended north along Belmont Avenue and City Avenue to the Presidential Apartments (at Presidential Boulevard), replacing Route XB. Monday through Saturday express service was added between Center City and Parkside via the Schuylkill Expressway and Girard Avenue. At the same time service was extended four blocks south from Penn Square to Broad and Spruce Streets in Center City. On June 16, 1963, the route became express-only, with local service via Powelton Village transferred to Route 30. A stop was added at the Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center on January 28, 1973. Express service was eliminated on June 19, 1983, in favor of new local service via the Benjamin Franklin Parkway that replaced the \\"Cultural Loop\\" bus. On June 15, 1986, Route 38 was split into two due to bridge weight restrictions on 34th Street at the Philadelphia Zoo. \\"Via Zoo\\" buses ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, 32nd Street and Girard Avenue, while \\"via Mantua\\" operated through the residential neighborhood of the same name. Westbound service through Center City was moved from Chestnut Street to Market Street on June 11, 1989, to allow the reopening of Chestnut to all traffic, back from a transitway. On September 9, 1990, the route was extended across the Schuylkill River to the Wissahickon Transfer Center. The \\"via Zoo\\" routing was transferred to Route 76 on May 16, 1993. At the same time, Bala Cynwd Shopping Center service was also eliminated. New service to the relocated Please Touch Museum in Fairmount Park was added on November 2, 2008.

History In June 1946, Manuel Ant√≥nio da Mota incorporated Mota & Compania in the Portuguese city of Amarante. In that same month and year a branch of the company was opened in Angola. Until 1974 Mota & Companhia operations focused on the Angolan territory, firstly in the exploration and processing of timber and as of 1948 also in the area of construction and public works. In 1952, Mota & Companhia was awarded the implementation of Luanda International Airport, near Luanda, the first major public work executed by the company in this territory, at the time still under Portuguese colonial administration. In the same year and in Lisbon, Portugal, Fernando Jos√© Saraiva and Ant√≥nio Lopes de Almeida founded Engil, Sociedade de Engenharia Civil, Lda. In 1954, Sim√µes C√∫cio and Ant√≥nio Valadas Fernandes joined Engil and gave it a new boost and renewed energy. In 1961, Engil's operations until then focused on the region of Lisbon start spreading to other regions within the Portuguese territory through the award of the Escola Industrial e Comercial of Castelo Branco, Portugal, and the construction, in Mirandela, of the Bridge over the Tua River. 1969 will be remembered for the signing of a contract with the company Siemens-Baunnion. Engil acquires in exclusive for Portugal the rights of use of the Siemcrete patented sliding forms system, allowing it to carry out countless major works as from then, involving silos and chimneys. Under the expansion of its operations the North delegation was created in Porto. Operations in Africa In 1975, Mota & Companhia expanded its activity to other African territories and started in Namibia with the construction of the Dreihuk dam. In South Africa, it was responsible for the infrastructures of the Sun City Resort and of the Matooster ‚Äì Bierkraal road. Later, in Swaziland the company built the Lonhlupheko ‚Äì Lomahasha road. All these constructions led Mota & Companhia into a process of progressive internationalization of its operations and businesses. 1976 was marked by an upturn of Mota & Companhia in Portugal through the award of a small dam (Lucefecit, Alentejo). Shortly afterwards, Mota & Companhia was awarded the contract for the regularization works of the Lower Mondego River. This allowed the company to launch itself as one of the top construction companies for large national building projects and soon became the third largest Portuguese company within this sector. In 1978, together with Retosa, with head office in Caracas, Venezuela, Engil participated for two years in the construction of factories and of the Guri Dam. As of 1980, Mota & Companhia expanded its operations within the People's Republic of Angola. In this same year and in a partnership with the Angolan government, it set up the company Constru√ß√£o de Terraplenagens Paviterra, UEM. Mota & Companhia and Paviterra were for many years the only corporate structures involved in the construction of public works in Angola. In August 1987, Mota & Companhia, a limited company, became a public limited liability company, following which it floated 12% of its equity capital on the stock market and requested admission to the Lisbon Stock Exchange. That year Engil SGPS was incorporated endeavoring to meet the evolving public and private works market and the need to diversify its activities. In the following years the company acquired these companies: Sociedade de Empreitadas Adriano (1988), Gerco - Sociedade de Engenharia Electrot√©cnica, SA (1990) and Ferrovias e Constru√ß√µes (1991). The year 1987 became associated with the major public work - the construction of the Lindoso Dam. The size and technical features of this construction work make of it a landmark amongst the major works developed by Engil. By entering the Angolan market in 1989 Engil's internationalization process is once again relaunched. In 1993, 1994 and 1996, a new boost was given to the internationalization process when the company entered, respectively, the following markets: Mozambique, Germany and Peru. As of 1990, Mota & Companhia gave a push to the diversification of its activities. It goes into business in the following areas: real estate development, road signs, prefabrication of structural elements, ceramics, asphalt masses, commercialization of vehicles and equipment, maritime transport and paint industry. In 1994 Mota & Companhia comprised the construction consortium of the Vasco da Gama Bridge, in Lisbon connecting north and south banks of the Tagus River. The year is further marked by more diversification of businesses by venturing into the area of Transport Concessions together with other reference companies. Hence, Lusoponte, concessionary company of the Tagus road crossing downstream of Vila Franca de Xira, is incorporated. On 23 July 1999, companies of the Mota family, launched a take-over bid for the whole of the equity capital of Engil SGPS, and this led to the constitution of the Mota- Engil Group in the year 2000. In 2002 the merger of Mota & Companhia, SA, Engil ‚Äì Sociedade de Constru√ß√£o Civil, SA and Mota-Engil Internacional, led to the creation of the largest Portuguese construction company. Simultaneously, the diversification strategy was intensified, with special focus on the transport concessions and environment and service sectors. In 2003 four autonomous business areas were established. The holding company Mota-Engil SGPS aggregates Mota-Engil, Engenharia e Constru√ß√£o, SA, Mota-Engil, Ambiente e Servi√ßos, SGPS, SA, MEITS ‚Äì Mota-Engil, Imobili√°rio e Turismo, SA, Mota- Engil, Concess√µes de Transportes, SGPS, SA, and holds the capital of Mota- Engil Servi√ßos Partilhados Administrativos e de Gest√£o, SA. In 2012 the Group's organization model changed, being defined by Regions (Portugal/Africa/Central Europe and Latin America).

After the merger of both of the group's subsidiaries, Mota-Engil Polska was incorporated originating the fourth-largest construction company operating in Poland. In 2005 Mota-Engil is listed on the PSI-20, the main Euronext Lisbon index. At the end of 2006, via Mota-Engil Ambiente e Servi√ßos, SGPS, the Mota-Engil Group had acquired a controlling stake in the Tertir Group, thus entering in the logistics and port sector. In 2007, Martifer SGPS, subsidiary of the Mota-Engil Group requested admission to trading on Euronext Lisbon, increasing the capital from 75 million shares to 100 million shares through an Initial Public Offer (IPO) of 25,000,000 shares representing the share capital.Mota Engil's Martifer affiliate delays planned IPO; wants to debut in June, em Forbes.com, 13, March 2007.

It was named after one of Omaha's original industrialists, Levi Carter, who ran a white lead smelter in the area. History As recently as 1876, Levi Carter Park was the west bank of the Missouri River. The next year flooding caused the river to jump its banks and shorten the main stream, with the long meander becoming an oxbow lake. Residents on both sides of the river now found themselves on the west bank, attached to Nebraska. Because of this their lake was originally called \\"Cut-Off Lake.\\" The name was first changed in the late 1900s to Lake Nicoma for the fabled Omaha wife of early Nebraska settler Peter A. Sarpy. Around that time the lake was a popular resort area.

Mesosociology lies between analysis of large-scale macro forces such as the economy or human societies (which is a domain of macrosociology), and everyday human social interactions on a small scale (a domain of microsociology). Social control Meso-level forces of social control include organizations and communities. The organizations are middle level structures of control. One type is a total institution, which is an organization in which people are confined until they can adhere to society's norms, including prisons and mental hospitals. Another type of middle level organization is the reintegration structure. This structure rehabilitates those who do not conform. These include rehabilitation centers for drugs and alcohol. A final type of organization is a safety-valve organization. These provide outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, including prostitution. Communities also are instruments of social control. Things that are controlled by local governments are often the most visible signs of social control in a community, such as a police force and the organization of neighborhoods.

Daniel Lysons (1762‚Äì1834) was an English antiquarian and topographer, who published amongst other works the four-volume Environs of London (1792‚Äì96). He collaborated on several works with his antiquarian younger brother Samuel Lysons (1763‚Äì1819). Life The son of the Reverend Samuel Lysons (1730‚Äì1804) and Mary Peach Lysons of Rodmarton, Gloucestershire, Lysons studied at Bath Grammar School and St Mary Hall, Oxford, graduating MA in 1785, and followed in his father's footsteps to become a curate in Putney, west London from 1789 to 1800. While at Putney, Lysons began his survey of the area around London, in which he was encouraged by Horace Walpole, who appointed him as his chaplain. In 1800, he inherited the family estates at Hempsted, near Gloucester, from his uncle Daniel Lysons (1727‚Äì1800), and the following year married Sarah Hardy (c.1780‚Äì1808), with whom he had a son, Samuel. In 1813, he married Josepha Catherine Susanna Cooper (c.1781‚Äì1868). His daughter went on to marry Sir James Carnegie, 5th Baronet (1799‚Äì1849). Works Lysons's major work is The Environs of London, being an Historical Account of the Towns, Villages and Hamlets within twelve miles of that Capital. With his brother Samuel, Lysons began Magna Britannia, being a concise Topographical Account of the several Counties of Great Britain (1806‚Äì1822), but after the first six volumes, covering the counties from B to D, Samuel died and the project was discontinued. Daniel Lysons also contributed views and illustrations to other works and published several pamphlets on religious and historical subjects.

Because the latter monomer mainly exists as its tautomer acetaldehyde, the copolymer is prepared by polymerization of ethylene and vinyl acetate to give the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer followed by hydrolysis. EVOH copolymer is defined by the mole % ethylene content: lower ethylene content grades have higher barrier properties; higher ethylene content grades have lower temperatures for extrusion. The plastic resin is commonly used as an oxygen barrier in food packaging. It is better than other plastics at keeping air out and flavors in, is highly transparent, weather resistant, oil and solvent resistant, flexible, moldable, recyclable, and printable. Its drawback is that it is difficult to make and therefore more expensive than other food packaging. Instead of making an entire package out of EVOH, manufacturers keep costs down by coextruding or laminating it as a thin layer between cardboard, foil, or other plastics. It is also used as a hydrocarbon barrier in plastic fuel tanks and pipes.  Industrial production  Because of the high capital cost to build an EVOH plant, and the complexity of making a food grade product, only a few companies produce EVOH: Kuraray produces EVOH resin under the name \\"EVAL,\\" with a 10,000 ton plant in Okayama, Japan; a 58,000 ton plant in the U.S. (near Houston, TX) under its subsidiary Kuraray America; and a 35,000 ton plant in Belgium under its subsidiary EVAL Europe.EVAL Division Nippon Gohsei produces EVOH under the trade name Soarnol.

It is a tank-type 6 MW reactor that is moderated and cooled by light water and uses heavy water as a reflector. It is the second largest university based research reactor in the U.S. (after the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center) and has been in operation since 1958.Cambridge evaluates MIT's nuclear reactor ‚Äì The Tech It is the fourth-oldest operating reactor in the country.  Technical specifications  The MITR-II design uses finned plate-type fuel arranged in a hexagonal pattern of rhomboid fuel assemblies. Power is controlled by 6 manual boron-stainless steel blade-type control rods and one aluminum with cadmium control rod which can be placed on automatic control. Light water flows upwards through the core and a tank of heavy water surrounds the core. A wall of dense concrete that serves as shielding surrounds the tank of heavy water. The maximum coolant temperature is . The light water and heavy water are cooled using forced circulation through heat exchangers to a secondary coolant system. The heat from the reactor is ultimately dissipated to the atmosphere via the secondary cooling system using two modular Tower Tech cooling towers ‚Äì model TTXL-081950;.unit placard The reactor uses highly enriched uranium fuel, in the form of uranium-aluminum cermet with aluminum cladding. Refueling takes place 3 to 4 times every year. A single refueling consists of rearranging the assemblies in the core or a combination of rearranging and replacement of old assemblies with new ones. This is more frequent than both nuclear power plants, which may go 17 to 23 months between refueling outages when they rearrange the entire core and replace 1/3 to 1/2 of the core, and most research reactors (particularly university reactors), many of which go decades without refueling due to the high energy density of nuclear fuel and infrequent use at high power levels.  Uses  The MITR research program encompasses most aspects of neutron science and engineering including nuclear medicine. Some of these activities are: *Neutron activation analysis for the identification of trace elements and isotope ratios in geological specimens *Fission engineering *Materials testing *Training *Neutron transmutation doping of silicon The MITR is one of only six facilities in the world that was engaged in patient trials for the use of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) to treat both brain tumors and skin cancer. The MITR fission converter beam is the first to be designed for BNCT. The facility no longer conducts BNCT trials.

In March 1917, with America's entry into World War I imminent, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels called on women to enlist in the Naval Reserve to free sailors for combat duty. Hardin joined the Navy at a time when women were still denied the right to vote. She was among almost 12,000 women who served in the Navy during World War I as clerks, draftsmen, translators, camouflage designers and recruiters, in the rating Yeoman (F), commonly known as \\"Yeomanettes\\". She was on active duty from September 1918 to March 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia. She performed clerical duties, receiving outstanding grades in reading proficiency and perfect marks in obedience and sobriety, the three areas in which the Navy graded women. She remained a teetotaler. By 1920, all the Yeomanettes were released from duty, and women would not be permitted to serve in the Navy again until World War II. She then moved back to Portsmouth, Ohio and married the first of four husbands, all of whom she outlived. She had three sons and a daughter from this marriage. All three sons served in World War II. In 1997, wearing a World War I \\"Yeomanette\\" uniform and a wide-brimmed hat reading \\"U.S. Naval Reserve\\", Hardin attended the October 18, 1997 ceremonies dedicating the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, honoring the almost two million women who had served in the armed forces. She was a featured speaker, along with then-Vice President Al Gore. She donned a neatly pressed Navy uniform and told women in the crowd of 30,000 people to \\"Carry on! You are doing a wonderful job!\\"  Death  In 2000 Frieda Hardin died at the Veterans Affairs nursing home in Livermore, California, five weeks shy of her 104th birthday, survived by her huge extended family of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren.

It emerged as a grassroots movement with individuals seeking to live their faith and/or spiritual values in the workplace. Spiritual or spirit-centered leadership is a topic of inquiry frequently associated with the workplace spirituality movement.(Benefiel, 2005; Biberman, 2000; Fry, 2005; Giacalone & Jurkiewicz, 2003; June, 2006) History The movement began primarily as U.S. centric but has become much more international in recent years. Key organizations include: * International Center for Spirit at Work (ICSW) * European Baha'i Business Forum (EBBF) * World Business Academy (WBA) * Spiritual Business Network (SBN) * Foundation for Workplace Spirituality Key factors that have led to this trend include: # Mergers and acquisitions destroyed the psychological contract that workers had a job for life. This led some people to search for more of a sense of inner security rather than looking for external security from a corporation. # Baby Boomers hitting middle age resulting in a large demographic part of the population asking meaningful questions about life and purpose. # The millennium created an opportunity for people all over the world to reflect on where the human race has come from, where it is headed in the future, and what role business plays in the future of the human race. In the late 1990s, the Academy of Management formed a special interest group called the Management, Spirituality and Religion Interest Group. This is a professional association of management professors from all over the world who are teaching and doing research on spirituality and religion in the workplace. Examples The International Center for Spirit at Work offers examples of workplace spirituality including:From the 2008 International Spirit at Work Award Application, p. 2). * \\"Vertical\\" spirituality, transcending the day-to-day and developing connectedness to a god or spirit or the wider universe. This might include meditation rooms, accommodation of personal prayer schedules, moments of silence before meetings, retreats or time off for spiritual development, and group prayer or reflection. * \\"Horizontal\\" spirituality, which involves community service, customer service, environmentalism, compassion, and a strong sense of ethics or values that are reflected in products and services.

History In 1958, the first Route de Chill Mhant√°in was held, organised by Bray Wheelers, a cycling club from Bray, Co. Wicklow. It was devised by Joe Loughman one of the main organisers of the club who wanted to make a tough race over the Wicklow Mountains. The race begins and finishes in Bray after taking a loop that goes over the Wicklow Mountains including the steep ascent of the Old Wicklow Gap, locally known as Croghan, as well as the Glenmalure climb where there is the Shay Elliott monument. The Route de Chill Mhant√°in was the first open massed start race that Bray Wheelers had organised. The first edition was won by John Lackey. The race was renamed ‚ÄòThe Shay Elliott Memorial‚Äô in later years. The trophy presented each year was won by Elliott himself as a prize for best amateur in France in 1955. Winners of the race include the best of Irish cycling including two-time champion Sean Kelly (who was the only rider to have won the race while still a junior), former professional Peter Crinnion, two time Tour of Ireland winner Pat McQuaid, Peter Doyle (the first rider to win the Tour of Ireland and the Ras Tailteann) and Phil Cassidy (a two-time winner of the Ras Tailteann).

W. Upton on 17 June 1863, for action against Confederate commerce raider CSS Tacony which was then preying upon Northern merchantmen during what Professor Richard S. West has called \\"the most brilliant daredevil cruise of the war.\\" Search for Tacony Howquah departed Boston 25 June 1863, with Acting Volunteer Lieutenant E. F. Devens in command, to search for Tacony in the southern section of the Banks of Newfoundland but her quarry had been destroyed the day before she sailed. Taconys captain, Lieutenant Charles W. Read, OSN, in an effort to elude the Northern gunboats who were scouring the sea for his ship, shifted his guns to captured fishing schooner Archer and put the torch to Tacony. He and his crew were captured 3 days later while attempting to escape to sea from Portland, Maine, in still another prize, Revenue cutter Caleb Gushing.(q.v. Tacony, p. 571, vol. II) Blockade duty When Howquah returned to Boston 3 July, she received orders to sail for Wilmington, North Carolina, for blockade duty. Except for occasional brief interruptions for repairs, she remained in waters off Wilmington until close to the end of the war, usually stationed near New Inlet. There on 5 November 1863 she assisted USS Nansemond and Army transport SS Fulton capture CSS Margaret and CSS Jessie after the ship had run the blockade 15 times. Only 5 days later, she took CSS Ella, a small, fast and new side-wheel steamer subsequently serving the Navy as a picket, patrol, and dispatch vessel. Next, on 11 December, she forced an unidentified ship to run on the beach to be wrecked by a heavy sea. On Christmas Eve she transported troops from Beaufort, North Carolina, to Bear Inlet to ruin salt works vital to the Confederate war economy. Again on 21 April 1864, she joined USS Niphon in an attack on salt works on Masonboro Sound. Her guns shelled the beach while a landing party smashed salt-making equipment ashore. Early morning 7 May 1864, Howquah and five other blockaders engaged Confederate ironclad ram CSS Raleigh and drove her back toward the harbor to run aground and \\"break her back\\" while attempting to cross the bar to safety. On 25 September, while chasing and firing on blockade runner CSS Lynx, Howquah was caught in a cross fire from Fort Fisher and from \\"friendly guns\\" on two other Union ships, USS Governor Buckingham and USS Niphon. In this operation one of her bluejackets was killed and four others were wounded, but her hull was not seriously damaged. CSS Lynx ended up on the beach totally destroyed by fire. Second Battle of Fort Fisher Christmas Eve 1864 found Howquah engaged in amphibious operations. This time the objective was Fort Fisher, which protected Wilmington, one of the South's most successful centers of blockade running and her last port for overseas aid. Howquah landed troops who took the Flag Pond Hill battery and bombarded enemy positions to support Union forces ashore. Unfortunately, Major General B. F. Butler nullified this success by ordering his troops to give up their beachheads and return to their ships; and Howquah had the unpleasant task of assisting in the evacuation. But in less than a month, the Northern ships were again attacking Fort Fisher in conjunction with the Army. Howquah anchored off Half Moon Battery 16 January 1865 and fired at targets ashore while her cutters evacuated the wounded. She remained in the area supporting Northern troops and the fleet's landing force with her guns until the last pockets of resistance along the Wilmington waterfront had been snuffed out. To the Gulf Howquah was transferred to Key West for duty in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. She was stationed in Saint George's Sound, Florida, until ordered North 1 June. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 22 June 1865 and was sold at public auction 10 August 1865.

Early lenses often included the word Anastigmat in their name to advertise this new feature (Doppel-Anastigmat, Voigtl√§nder Anastigmat Skopar, etc.). The first Anastigmat was designed by Paul Rudolph for the Carl Zeiss AG in 1890. All modern photographic lenses are close to being anastigmatic, meaning that they can create extremely sharp images for all objects across their field of view; the underlying limitation is that the lens can deliver the anastigmatic performance only up to a maximum maximum aperture (i.e., it has a minimum F-number) and only within a given working distance (focusing range). Note that all optical aberrations (except spherical aberration) become more pronounced for objects lying in the edges of the field of view, which applies even to high-end anastigmatic lenses. Anastigmatic performance is accomplished by a proper combination of multiple lenses (optical surfaces), usually three of more. Aspheric lenses can minimize the number of surfaces required and, thus, the bulk and weight of the composite lens; however, aspheric surfaces are more costly to manufacture compared to spherical and other conic section (hyperbolic, parabolic) ones. Many high-end catoptric telescopes are three-mirror anastigmat, while the corresponding catadioptric telescopes use two mirrors (reflector) and one lens (refractor) to accomplish the same result.

The platform provides the means to receive market data, perform technical analysis, and send and manage orders to a broker, both manually and automatically. MultiCharts supports multiple data feeds and brokers , and provides the ability to receive market data from a variety of data providers and brokers (i.e. the broker does not also have to be a data provider). The platform comes with a number of publicly available technical indicators and trading systems, which are written in PowerLanguage. PowerLanguage PowerLanguage is very similar to EasyLanguage, which was created and produced by TradeStation. The platform is capable of ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù EasyLanguage files, meaning that the files do not need to be converted to another format prior to being used in the platform. Users may write their own indicators and trading systems, copy and paste EasyLanguage script from another source, or import EasyLanguage files (supported file extensions are ELD, ELA and ELS).EasyLanguage Friendly description Accessed on November 2, 2010 Protected EasyLanguage files cannot be imported, unless they are unlocked first. QuoteManager The platform includes an organizational tool for data management called the QuoteManager, which saves any loaded data to the local hard drive. This allows the user to examine the data, edit it, delete it, or add to it from some other data source. The database files can be copied to another drive for backing up, or other analytic purposes. Strategy Backtesting The platform supports different modes of backtesting, which is a method used for testing theories about market behavior by applying them to historical data. It is possible to apply a technical indicator or a trading strategy to only one instrument or to a portfolio of instruments at the same time. For portfolio analysis users must use a separate module called the Portfolio Backtester, which comes with the platform. Automated Trading The platform is capable of algorithmic trading, which means that program generated orders are automatically sent to a broker after being triggered by a PowerLanguage script. Discretionary Trading The platform allows the user to generate an order manually (outside of writing, compiling and applying a script to an instrument). Orders can be generated via a vertical ladder style Depth of Market interface, or directly from a market data chart. Discretionary order execution features were introduced in version 7.4 Beta and higher New Features in MultiCharts v7.4 beta 2 Accessed on December 7, 2011 Market Scanner A Market Scanner is a feature also known as a \\"screener\\", \\"radar screen\\", or ‚Äúquote board‚Äù in other trading software.

According to old lore, it was constructed in the 9th century as a stronghold against the Vikings and is named after the knight Klaus Lembeck who had allegedly been residing there as a steward of king Valdemar IV of Denmark in the 14th century. After breaking his feudal oath, though, Lembeck is said to have been besieged by the king's host. √çt is disputed though whether Lembeck ever set foot on the island. Archaeological findings on Sylt island in the late 1970s suggest, however, that the Lembecksburg and similar facilities on Sylt date back to the days of the Roman Empire. In 1991 a wind mill was erected in place of an older, dilapidated mill. Today, Borgsum counts about 350 inhabitants.

It can grow in many areas due to its hardiness. It is most often grown as a plant for wildlife. Ruby-throated hummingbirds use it in their natural range as well as other birds, butterflies, and bees. It hosts the caterpillars of spring azures and snowberry clearwing moths. It is also grown as an ornamental for its attractive flowers, especially as a native alternative to the invasive Japanese honeysuckle. Several cultivars have been selected for variation in flower color, including 'Magnifica' (flowers red outside, yellow inside), 'Sulphurea' (yellow flowers), and 'Superba' (bright scarlet flowers).Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . It is a twining vine growing to 20 ft or more through shrubs and young trees. The leaves are produced in opposite pairs, oval, up to 5 cm long and 4 cm broad; the leaves immediately below the flowers are perfoliate, joined at the base in a complete ring round the shoot. They are evergreen in zone 8 and warmer and deciduous in colder climates. This is the reason for the species epithet, from Latin sempervirens, meaning \\"evergreen\\". The flowers are produced on new growth in clusters of several groups of three together, tubular, 5 cm long, with five small lobes opening at the tip to expose the stamens and stigma. The leaves have been shown to deteriorate during the winter.

He directed 78 films between 1910 and 1926. He was born in Liverpool and died in Hollywood, California from cancer. Travers Vale's actual birth name was Solomon Flohm, son of Joseph Flohm and Esther Flegeltaub who were both Russian Polish Jews who had emigrated to the UK during the Crimean War. Biography Soon after Solomon's birth, they set sail to Australia on the SS Great Britain with other family members and ended up settling in Ballarat, Victoria although had spent time prior to this in Sandhurst [Bendigo, Victoria] and Pleasant Creek [Stawell, Victoria]. Travers Vale [Solomon Flohm] married his first cousin, Leah Flegeltaub [daughter of Esther's brother Aaron] on 24 July 1893 in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. By this time Solomon had been working as a photographer [his father-in-law, Aaron Flegeltaub was a respected photographer]. However Travers had also taken an active interest in stage where he worked for a period as a stage manager in Melbourne. The extended family also had an interest in the Arts - stage and music - so it is fair to say that he would have as a child been influenced by the family around him. Family myth suggests that his first independent stage production [in which he used the name, Travers Vale] was when he produced a stage version of 'The Mystery of the Hansom Cab' - a ripping murder mystery novel written in Melbourne in the 1880s by Fergus Hume and contains many descriptions of Melbourne life at that time. Sometime late 1890s / early 1900s, he ventured with his wife [who had changed her name to Leah 'Lily' Vale] to India and then onto London. In London Leah gave birth to their first child, Violet Rachel Vale, in 1894. Some time later they arrived in the USA [probably Alabama] and Leah gave birth to their second child, Olga Vale, in 1900. Sadly Leah died in Alabama on 13 May 1904. Travers and his girls moved soon after to New York where he became involved in the early days of Vaudeville before the film industry headed emmass across the continent to Hollywood in the 1920s. Travers married twice thereafter but no further children are known to exist from these marriages.

Koldenb√ºttel applies as Eiderstedt's most eastern village. Until the Treene's damming up in 1570 the village was suspended by Storm surges from North Sea-water flowing in the Eider and the Treene. Now there is a road at the dike's top leading from Koldenb√ºttel to Friedrichstadt The Bundesstra√üe 202 runs through the town; it connects the village with Friedrichstadt. At the Railway T√∂nning-Husum, which was opened in 1854, there was a small train station called \\"B√ºttel\\". After finishing the \\"Marschbahn\\" this breakpoint was closed down because of a central train station in Friedrichstadt. History Koldenb√ºttel goes back to an earlier settlement called \\"B√ºttel\\", which was left and colonized again 1,000 to 1,200 years ago. The name means: \\"Cold (in the sense of cooled, extinct) settlement.\\" The St. Leonhardt's church was built around the year 1200 by Frisian immigrants, which were settling at Eiderstedt around 1100. At the same place had been a sacred fountain in Pre-Christian times. The village has been documented first in the year 1352. The wooden, standalone bell steeple is the oldest of its type in Schleswig-Holstein; it has been proved that the wood used was produced in 1461. The rectory was built in 1658.

Politics Since the communal elections of 2008, the Nieblumer W√§hlergemeinschaft holds six of nine seats in the municipality council, the CDU holds three. Culture and sights Interior of St. John's church Nieblum's main attraction is the defiant church of St. John with its historically preserved graveyard. Moreover the view of Nieblum with its thatched houses and many trees is pleasant to the eye. Since the 1950s, the Ernst Schlee school of Hamburg-Klein-Flottbek had been operating a summer boarding school in Nieblum. After conversion into a public trading school, the institution was transferred to the Othmarschen high school. Notable people *Jens Jacob Eschels (1757-1842), navigator.

History  Together with S√ºddorf, Norddorf is the oldest village of the island. In 1890, Friedrich von Bodelschwingh founded a number of seaside hospices in Norddorf proper and north of it. Due to this, the place developed into a seaside resort. In 1925, great parts of the village were destroyed by a fire, so today's view of the village is dominated by mostly modern houses without thatched roofs. Today, the hospices now serve other purposes or no longer exist. During the early 20th century, the so-called Kniephafen harbour existed north of Norddorf at Amrum's vast Kniepsand beach. The port was navigable by greater vessels and it most of all served the nautical traffic between Amrum and the port of H√∂rnum on the neighbouring island of Sylt. The Kniephafen was linked to the network of Amrum's island railway. In 1938, the pier was last moved further north due to proceeding aggradation. With the adjoining of the Kniepsand beach to the belt of dunes on Amrum's western shore, the harbour had to be abandoned. Until December 31, 2006 Norddorf, together with Nebel and Wittd√ºn, formed the Amt Amrum.  Politics  Since the municipal elections of 2008, the Norddorfer B√ºrgerblock holds five of nine seats in Nebel's council, the CDU holds four.  Sights  Tourist attractions include a duck decoy south of the village, a centre for natural history with its focus on environmental protection, as well as the Kniepsand beach to the west. From Norddorf, Amrum's northernmost edge, called Odde, can be reached. An important bird area is located there, where Charadriiformes and other species of the Wadden Sea tidal flats may be observed. Guided tours are available. A belt of dunes extends north, south, and southwest of Norddorf. Amrum's highest dune (32 m), called a Siatler, can be found there. On it, there is an observation platform. Further southwest, one can find the Norddorf sector light with its Art Nouveau elements. The light was established in 1906 and serves as a navigational aid for the Vortrapptief channel. Its bearings have got a range of (white), (red) and (green).  Economy  With 422,319 lodgings booked by 43,316 guests in 2005, the municipality ranks among the top ten places of tourist importance in Schleswig-Holstein.

The bell was moreover rung in the morning and at noon and was also used as a means of alarm during storm surges. In 1882 Germany's first junior firefighters were recruited in Oevenum.

Geography left The municipality of Oldsum consists of the three hamlets of Oldsum, Klintum (Fering: Klantem) and Toftum (Fering: Taftem) which are spread over some two kilometres along a main road. The population number about 600. The landscape is marked by well-preserved thatched farmhouses. Oldsum's landmark is an ancient thatched windmill whose antecessor presumably dates back to the year 1700. Though burned down 200 years later, it was rebuilt and subsequently was in use until 1954. Since 1972 the mill is exclusively used as a dwelling house. Oldsum is situated approximately two kilometres from the western shore of the island, the northern coastline is a little closer. Oldsum adjoins S√ºderende to the south, Dunsum to the southwest and Alkersum and Midlum to the east. History Oldsum was first recorded in 1462 as Uluersum. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Oldsum, Klintum and Toftum were important whaling villages. A census in 1787 showed that a total of 211 of the inhabitants of the three places were seafarers. One of the most successful whalers, Matthias Petersen (1632‚Äì1706) lived in Oldsum proper. In his lifetime he was able to catch 373 whales, his tomb can still be visited in the graveyard of the St. Laurentii church in S√ºderende. As a part of Westerland F√∂hr, Oldsum belonged to the Royal Enclaves of Denmark and thus was a direct part of the Danish crown while Osterland F√∂hr belonged to the Duchy of Schleswig. Only when Denmark lost Schleswig to Prussia in the Second Schleswig War, Oldsum became a part of Schleswig-Holstein. Politics Since the communal elections of 2008, the Oldsumer W√§hlergemeinschaft holds eight seats out of nine in the municipality's council. The ninth seat is held by an independent contestant. Economy With the rise of tourism, agriculture began to decrease in significance. Today there are only a few scattered farmsteads. Some farms were evacuated out of the town in the 1950s and 60's and are now situated outside the village proper but still in the municipality's area. Oldsum underwent a transformation from a farmers' to an artists' village, numerous studios and galleries can now be found there. Other important economical factors are a rising number of crafts enterprises as well as retailing.

Morphology=Adult The adults have a lepturoid aspect, having like those (except for a small number of cases) a divided stridulatory area. Nevertheless, the head is extremely short, the mandibles are strongly bowed and the anterior coxae are globular. The antennae are long, nearly filiform in most of the genera, and bearing very long setae in the Malagasy genus Nethinius. Larva The major differences are in the larval morphology, because they have the prosternal skin attached to the base of the submentum, rather than with the gula such as all other Cerambycidae. For nearly all other aspects, they are very similar to the larvae of Lepturinae. Distribution This family, original from Gondwana, includes more than 300 species, widespread in all regions of the Southern Hemisphere, while much less common in the Northern Hemisphere. In particular, only a few species occur in North America and none are present in Europe. In contrast, Madagascar is extremely rich in species, especially of the endemic genus Nethinius. Biology The adults have mostly nocturnal behaviour; some species (Nethinius) may be collected beating plants where they live. The fact that several specimens have been collected with mutilated legs and antennae suggests the existence of an aggressive character and of infra-specific fights for females.VITALI F., 2006 - Contribution √† la connaissance des Nethinius malgaches (Coleoptera Disteniidae) - L'Entomologiste 62 (5-6):175-178.

Etymology This phrase is British in origin and derives from sports that use goalposts. The figurative use alludes to the perceived unfairness in changing the goal one is trying to achieve after the process one is engaged in (e.g., a game of football) has already started. Logical fallacy Moving the goalposts is an informal fallacy in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt.Clark, Jef et al. (2005). \\"Moving the goalposts,\\" Humbug! The Skeptic‚Äôs Field Guide to Spotting Fallacies in Thinking, p. 101. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the result is changed, too.Hobbs, Jeremy. \\"Moving the Goal Posts,\\" The New York Times, November 21, 2011; retrieved 2013-2-19. Use Some include this metaphor as description of the tactics of harassment. In such cases, a re-defining of another's goals may in reality be intentionally devised so as to assure that an athlete, for example, will ultimately never be able to finally achieve the ever shifting goals.Royal College of Psychiatrists, \\"On Bullying and Harassment\\" retrieved 2012-2-19. In workplace bullying, shifting the goalposts is a conventional tactic in the process of humiliation.Field, Tim. (1995). Bully in Sight: How to Predict, Resist, Challenge and Combat Workplace Bullying, p. 60. Karl Popper coined the concept conventionalist twist or conventionalist stratagem in Conjectures and Refutations with similar use as this fallacy but in the context of the falsifiability of certain scientific theories. Sports-related examples In 2009, Danish association football goalkeeper Kim Christensen was recorded on camera moving the goalposts in order to gain advantage over the opposing team. Christensen's moving the goalposts was discovered by a referee about 20 minutes into the game, but Christensen did not suffer a suspension or any fines for his actions. Deliberately moving the goalposts constitutes a professional foul in rugby football and an unfair act in gridiron football. The officials are granted carte blanche to assess whatever penalty they see fit, including awarding the score for any attempt at a goal missed or invalidating any goal scored as a result of the moved goalposts. In both rugby and gridiron, goalposts are anchored into the ground; the distance they can be moved (most easily in gridiron by pulling down on one end of the crossbar to tilt both posts either to the left or the right) is far more restricted. Inadvertently moving the goalposts in a touchdown celebration is an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty of 15 yards against the offending team. Moving goalposts is common in ice hockey, where physical contact with the posts is common. If the goalposts are knocked off their moorings in the course of play, play is stopped until the goal is put back in place. If the goalposts are deliberately moved to stop an opponent from scoring, the opponent may be granted a penalty shot; if the goaltender does so, the goaltender may be ejected from the game, a rule imposed at most levels of the game in 2014 after David Leggio deliberately moved the goalposts during a two-person breakaway, believing he would have a better chance of stopping a penalty shot.Dhiren Mahiban (November 6, 2014). Report: AHL changes rule following Leggio incident. ProHockeyTalk.com. Retrieved November 7, 2014. Leggio later used the tactic in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, where he had played since 2015; that league had not yet outlawed the maneuver, but promptly did so after Leggio's first attempt at using the tactic. The DEL instead automatically awards the goal to the opposing team. The National Hockey League approved this rule in 2019.
