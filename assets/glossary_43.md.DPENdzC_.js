Early life Camp was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the son of Anne Agnes (Barron) and Roswell Sandford Camp. His mother's family was German and Lithuanian. He received a bachelor's degree in American history and literature and a master's in journalism, both from the University of Iowa. From 1971 to 1978, Camp wrote for The Miami Herald. In 1978, he moved to Minneapolis and started writing for The Saint Paul Pioneer Press as a features reporter; in 1980 he became a daily columnist. That year, he was a Pulitzer finalist for a series of stories on Native American culture. In 1985, during the Midwest farm crisis, he wrote a series entitled \\"Life on the Land: an American farm family,\\" which followed a typical southwest Minnesota farm family through the course of a full year. For that work, he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing and the American Society of Newspaper Editors award for Non-Deadline Feature Writing. He worked part-time at the Pioneer Press in 1989 and left the next year. Camp is an avid fiction reader himself. When asked in 2018 \\"What's your favorite book of all time?\\" by the New York Times, he responded, \\"An impossible question. If you put a gun to my head‚Äîsay a .40-caliber Walther PPQ, or maybe a .45 ACP Colt Gold Cup‚ÄîI'd say The Once and Future King, by T. H. White.\\" Both weapons he mentioned make appearances in many of his novels. Camp is a personal friend and hunting companion of fellow Minnesota author Chuck Logan. Fiction writer In 1989, Camp wrote two novels that would each spawn a popular series. The Fool's Run (Kidd series) was published under his own name, but the publisher asked him to provide a pseudonym for Rules of Prey (\\"Prey\\" series), so it was published under the name John Sandford. After the \\"Prey\\" series proved to be more popular, with its charismatic protagonist Lucas Davenport, The Fool's Run and all of its sequels were published under John Sandford. In 2007, Camp started a third series (also under the name John Sandford), featuring Virgil Flowers, who is a supporting character in some of the \\"Prey\\" novels, including Invisible Prey and Storm Prey.

In the first three novels, he is a maverick detective with the Minneapolis Police Department, a lieutenant acting independently, running a network of street contacts. At the end of Eyes of Prey, he's forced to resign to avoid excessive force charges, partly due to his knowledge of the connection of a senior police officer to that case. He returns in Night Prey as a deputy chief (a political appointment), running his own intelligence unit. Beginning with Naked Prey, Davenport is an investigator for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), acting occasionally as a special troubleshooter for the governor of Minnesota in politically sensitive cases. He serves in that capacity through Gathering Prey, at the end of which he quits working for the BCA, later becoming a United States marshal. He's known for his unorthodox and manipulative behavior as a detective, reminiscent of \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan. He is not a leader, but a loner who works with a small circle of capable, straight police friends. The novel Mind Prey was sold for a TV movie, and Davenport was portrayed by Eriq LaSalle. Another of the novels, Certain Prey, was adapted into a movie in 2011 by USA Network starring Mark Harmon as Davenport. =Description= Davenport is described as a tall, slender, wide-shouldered man with a \\"permanent tan\\" that gives his very blue eyes a kind expression, contradicted by the \\"chilly\\" smile of a predator, particularly a wolverine. Dark-haired, but streaked with gray, Davenport has a face marked by a fine scar from his hairline to the right corner of his mouth (caused by a fishing hook accident) that gives him \\"a raffish air\\" and also \\"a touch of innocence, like Errol Flynn in Captain Blood\\" (Rules of Prey). In the very first Davenport book, the hero is described as \\"slender and dark- complexioned, with straight black hair going grey at the temples and a long nose over a crooked smile. One of his central upper incisors had been chipped and he never had it capped. He might have been an Indian except for his blue eyes.\\" His tooth was chipped during an ice hockey match in his youth. His amateur career had peaked as first-line defenseman for the Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota. Davenport has suffered a few bullet and knife wounds over the course of his career, and is permanently tan no more. Davenport is streetwise, has a wide network of contacts among all levels of society in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and on occasions finds solutions to criminal investigations by thinking like a criminal. He is also skilled at using computers and other technological sources of information. In recent years as a senior officer of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, he has been able to call on the services of several specialized research professionals. Beyond these things, he is lucky, a characteristic mentioned in more than one book. He is not above skirting the law and accepted procedures to move a case forward. He even uses news media contacts to leak secrets to freak out criminal suspects or motivate laggard senior officialdom. Unforeseen civilian deaths sometimes result from these schemes. Davenport is a police celebrity, having shot and killed many suspects in the line of duty. Quite apart from those deaths caused in spontaneous gunfights, Davenport has been suspected‚Äîappropriately‚Äîof engineering some outcomes so that the death of a miscreant is virtually certain. Unusually for a police officer, he has more than once been a target of assassination attempts by criminals; his numerous contacts in the media consider him a good interview, but editors persistently criticize his violence. Davenport feels no hesitation about killing defenseless criminals who present no threat to him. In the first Davenport novel, Rules of Prey, he makes a mechanical device to create the illusion that he is in a gunfight when he kills Louis Vullion, aka \\"the Maddog,\\" the criminal in that matter. He does not want Vullion to die painlessly. That was his sixth police killing. The total today is 10. While Davenport is thought of as lucky, it's a remarkable thing that any criminal who wishes him harm can find his home and attack it, even though he does not have a public phone listing. Davenport is independently wealthy, having achieved success first through the creation of Dungeons & Dragons-style role playing games. He started and later sold his own software company, Davenport Simulations, which first created personal computer games for private users, and later, emergency simulations for training police and other emergency workers. After taking the company public, he sells his personal shares and nets approximately $10,000,000. He dresses fashionably, favors European-cut clothing, and drives his personal Porsche 911 and Nissan truck or van while on duty. The Nissan was replaced by a Lexus SUV in Broken Prey. Early on, he was depicted as a womanizer, fathering a daughter, Sarah, out of wedlock from a running affair with blonde television news reporter Jennifer Carey. Sarah lives with her mother and a stepfather, and Davenport visits her frequently. As the series progresses, Davenport settles down with and eventually marries the highly paid maxillofacial surgeon Weather Karkinnen, who in Winter Prey saved his life by performing an emergency tracheotomy with what Lucas called a \\"jackknife.\\" The couple have a son, Samuel Kalle Davenport, called Sam in the novels, and in Buried Prey, Dr. Karkinnen is advanced in pregnancy with a daughter. Living with the Davenports is Letty West, a once-feral teenage girl encountered in Naked Prey. Lucas and Weather formally adopt Letty in 2008, close to the time of the Republican nominating convention in that year, an event that prompts a detailed Davenport investigation, and Letty then changes her name to Letty Davenport. Before that, however, Davenport had numerous sexual encounters with suspects, victims, and fellow officers, including Detective Sergeant Marcy Sherrill, a subordinate, and Lily Rothenburg, a detective lieutenant of the New York Police Department. By Buried Prey, Sherrill has succeeded Davenport as chief of detectives in Minneapolis, and Davenport is close to his 50th birthday. At the end of Wicked Prey (2009), he and Weather adopt Letty, now 14 and an aspiring television reporter mentored by Jennifer Carey‚ÄîDavenport's old lover, and mother of Sarah. Davenport has a reputation as a \\"gun freak\\" (Rules of Prey) and at the start of the series owns thirteen - a 9mm H&K; P7 with a 13-round magazine, a 9mm Beretta 92F, a small .25 automatic of unstated make that he wears in an ankle holster as a hideout gun, two Colt Gold Cup .45 ACP competition pistols, three .22 pistols (a Ruger Mark II, a Browning International Medalist and a left-hand bolt-operated Anschutz Exemplar) and four recovered (hence untraceable) street guns including a Charter Arms .38. In the flashback section of Buried Prey Davenport carried a Glock pistol (presumably the Glock 17) as his sidearm when in uniform and a Smith & Wesson Model 40 revolver in plain-clothes. In Rules of Prey, Davenport uses one of his street guns, a Smith & Wesson Model 39, to fabricate a self-defense justification for executing serial killer Louis Vullion. Lucas's other weapons include a Browning Citori over-and-under 20 gauge shotgun, a .243 deer rifle of unstated make and model (Chosen Prey), and a Colt Magnum Carry .357 revolver (Naked Prey). In two earlier two books, Rules of Prey and Shadow Prey, his standard sidearm is the P7, but in Eyes of Prey he later adopts a .45 Smith & Wesson of unstated model; he retains the P7 as a \\"dress gun\\" for off duty carry. In Silent Prey, he uses the Colt Gold Cup as his sidearm while in New York. As of Certain Prey onward, his usual sidearm is a customized .45 Colt Gold Cup, carried with the chamber empty; something that gives him problems when his left arm is in a cast. In Invisible Prey, he has a cache containing two \\"cold\\" pistols with magazines, a homemade silencer that fits none of his guns (he kept meaning to throw it away, but never did), an old- fashioned lead-and-leather sap, a hydraulic door-spreader that he'd picked up from a burglary site, $5,000 in $20 bills in a paper bank envelope, a pill bottle of amphetamines, a box of surgical gloves, and a battery-powered lock rake. In Buried Prey, the cache contains at least the rake along with a ring of bump keys, a small crowbar, a pair of white cotton garden gloves and a LED headlamp. By Storm Prey, he has acquired, and uses, a detachable magazine Beretta shotgun of unstated model, probably an M3P. In Stolen Prey, Lucas uses a 9mm Beretta 92F as his main sidearm, presumably because he had a cast on his left arm that would present an issue if he needed to insert a shell into the chamber of his customized .45 Colt Gold Cup. He switches back to his customized .45 Colt Gold Cup in the next book, Silken Prey. In the 28th book, Twisted Prey, Davenport has again switched sidearm, this time to the Walther PPQ pistol in .40 S&W.; He also possesses, but doesn't use, a .40 Glock of a model issued to the Marshals Service, presumably a Glock 22 or 23. He doesn't normally carry a secondary or backup firearm or the usual Marshals Service telescopic baton. Letty has two (known) weapons, both .22 rifles. One is a single-shot Harrington & Richardson in .22 Short and the other‚Äîbought for her by Lucas after the H&R; was confiscated by the police after Letty's biological mother was killed by a crooked cop who got shot by Letty before escaping‚Äîa Remington pump-action firing .22 Long Rifle. In Buried Prey she and Lucas practice shooting together with the Colt and Beretta pistols. In Stolen Prey, Letty uses Lucas's customized .45 Colt Gold Cup to kill two would-be assassins. =Personal= Davenport has a strong interest in reading, poetry, and war gaming. As the series develops, Davenport exhibits a number of anxiety disorders, including mood depression and chronic fear of flying on fixed-wing aircraft. Paradoxically, he is not afraid of helicopter flight. His best friend is Elle Krueger, a Catholic nun who is also a professor of psychology. Davenport often receives assistance from Krueger psychologically profiling criminals. Davenport refers to himself as \\"mostly a Democrat.\\" He has four children: Sarah (with reporter Jennifer Carey), Sam (with surgeon Weather Karkinnen), Letty (adopted after her mother was killed), and a newborn daughter, Gabrielle, with Weather. \\"Prey\\" author John Sandford told The New York Post in June 2002 that he first thought of Davenport as a sociopath: \\"He had a problem with women. Even when he was in a relationship, he'd [have an affair with] some [other] women. But then he changed, mellowed out ... . I want him to have a happy ending. I don't want him to wind up a bitter, lonely guy.\\" In September 2004, he told the Budapest newspaper Vas√°rnapi H√≠rek: \\"I've always thought of him as a kind of sociopath who is slightly warped. Of course, Davenport changed a lot throughout the stories, he became calmer. . . .\\" Later, the promiscuous young Davenport was presented as a married man because \\"I wanted to show that Davenport is capable of love and he doesn't just collect women, like in the beginning.\\" Both statements appear in the www.johnsandford.org website. =Kidd series= #The Fool's Run (1989), by John Camp; reissued 1996 as by Sandford #The Empress File (1991), by John Camp; reissued 1995 as by Sandford #The Devil's Code (2000) #The Hanged Man's Song (2003) Kidd also has a prominent role in Silken Prey and Extreme Prey. =Virgil Flowers series= #Dark of the Moon (2007) #Heat Lightning (2008) #Rough Country (2009) #Bad Blood (2010) #Shock Wave (2011) #Mad River (2012) #Storm Front (2013) #Deadline (2014) #Escape Clause (2016) #Deep Freeze (October 17, 2017) #Holy Ghost (October 2018) #Bloody Genius (2019) Virgil Flowers Virgil Flowers is described as tall, lean, late thirties, three times divorced, with long hair and often wears t-shirts featuring rock bands. Virgil works at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). Prior to the BCA he was in the Army and the military police, then the police in Saint Paul. Lucas Davenport, main character of the Prey series of books, recruited him into the BCA. Virgil is an avid outdoorsman who loves fishing, and is often towing his boat, even when on duty. He's also a writer for outdoor and hunting magazines, as well as a photographer. Despite working in law enforcement he often does not carry his weapon while investigating crimes, until (sometimes after!) it becomes necessary. =Singular Menace series (with Michele Cook)= #Uncaged (2014) #Outrage (2015) #Rampage (2016) =Other fiction books= *The Night Crew (1997) *Dead Watch (2006) *Saturn Run (with Ctein) science fiction (2015) ; 0-399-17695-0 =Short stories= *\\"Lucy Had a List.\\" Published in Murder in the Rough: Original Tales of Bad Shots, Terrible Lies, and Other Deadly Handicaps from Today's Great Writers (2006), a short story anthology by notable authors, the fourth title in the sports mystery series edited by Otto Penzler. =Nonfiction books= *The Eye and the Heart (1988) *Plastic Surgery (1989) *Murder in the Rough (2006)  Awards & Nominations  1986, Pulitzer Prize for Feature.

He played 41 Test matches between 1980 and 1990, as well as 53 One Day Internationals. He was the second New Zealand cricketer to score 1000 runs and take 100 wickets in Test cricket. He was the coach of the New Zealand cricket team between September 2003 and November 2008. His brother Brendon also played Test cricket, while his brothers Douglas and Mark played at first-class level. He was educated at Tauranga Boys' College and was in the 1st XI from 1973 to 1976. John Bracewell is the uncle of test representative Doug Bracewell and first-class representative Michael Bracewell. Playing career Bracewell scored 1,001 runs in Tests, and 512 in ODI matches, with late-order hard- hitting right hand batting, and took 102 Test and 33 ODI wickets with his right-arm off-breaks. He holds the record for the longest ODI career without scoring a half-century or taking a three-wicket haul. His Test career included one century ‚Äì 110 against England on 7 August 1986. He scored four first-class centuries in all as part of the 4,354 first class runs during a career for Auckland and Otago. He took 522 first class wickets. John Bracewell still has the record for the most catches taken by a substitute fielder in an ODI innings with 4 and also the only substitute fielder to take 4 catches in an ODI. Coaching Bracewell's approach to team selection has fallen under scrutiny during the 2006/2007 season. Despite levelling the home series with Sri Lanka two-all, New Zealand's top order batting has consistently displayed frailty, and this was most apparent after New Zealand compiled a dismal team total of 73 in one ODI during that series. Moreover, Bracewell has opted for a \\"rotation\\" policy within his squad for determining team selections, meaning the batting line-up has been shuffled consistently between successive ODIs. This has received criticism from local media who highlight that New Zealand Cricket is not currently afforded the luxury of a reserve pool of competitive international players, thus making the policy somewhat redundant. Bracewell also controversially called Australian Fast-bowler Shaun Tait a chucker, and copped a lot of criticism from the cricketing community and also 'revealing' that Adam Gilchrist ducked out of the One-Day match in Hobart because of family issues but shortly, Bracewell withdrew these comments and issued an official apology. Honours In 1990, Bracewell was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

Career Churchill's early work included stints on Supergirl, Uncanny X-Men as well as the Deadpool: Sins of the Past limited series, in addition to a lengthy stay on Cable, the latter gaining him (along with writer Jeph Loeb) fan acclaim. Loeb and Churchill were to later team up to produce Coven and Lionheart for Awesome Comics. He was the initial artist for the most recent spin-off of the Teen Titans comic series, Titans, (vol. 2) which features the New Teen Titans of the Marv Wolfman/George P√©rez era. In 2009 Churchill drew the \\"Code Red\\" story arc in Hulk, which introduced the Red She-Hulk. The title, inked by Mark Farmer, saw a change in his usual drawing style, the result of a shoulder injury which required surgery. In December 2010, Churchill's creator-owned comic \\"Marineman\\" launched to critical acclaim, securing an Eisner nomination for best new series 2010. The collected trade paperback of volume 1, \\"Marineman: A Matter of Life and Depth\\", was published in 2011. Churchill begins work on volume 2 of Marineman in 2013. Marineman, which Churchill writes and pencils and does the final colours, is published through Image Comics.

She was originally one of six ships ordered by the British Tanker Co., which were purchased on the stocks by the Admiralty prior to the Second World War. Aldersdale was part of convoy PQ 17 in 1942, and was damaged by bombs from three Junkers aircraft on 5 July 1942 after Convoy PQ 17 had been ordered to scatter. Aldersdale was abandoned and the drifting wreck was torpedoed and sunk by the on 7 July 1942.

She was taken over by the Admiralty on 17 September 1937 after completing her sea trials, and on 18 September 1937 sailed from Greenock bound for Abadan on the Persian Gulf on her maiden voyage. Returning to the UK in late 1937, she began to be fitted with defensive armament in January 1938, a process completed in November 1938 after returning from a voyage to Trinidad. After several more voyages between Abadan and the UK, she was in the Middle East at the outbreak of the Second World War. She passed through the Mediterranean in a convoy, and then sailed to Trinidad, and then to Freetown where she arrived in late October 1939. Returning to the UK, via Halifax, Nova Scotia, in December 1939, Aldersdale underwent repairs at Cardiff in January 1940. Aldersdale sailed to Gibraltar in February 1940, and to Trinidad in March. On her return to British waters, she was sent to Scapa Flow, and then to the Faroe Islands in April. She sustained damage from the cruiser on her arrival on 24 April 1940, and returned to the UK via Iceland. She was taken in hand for repairs on the River Clyde on 25 July 1940, with work completed on 8 August 1940. She returned to Scapa Flow in September, going on to suffer a number of collision in the later part of the year; with the on 4 October 1940, on 25 November 1940 and the Booth Line's on 22 December 1940. During this time, and into 1941 Aldersdale refuelled allied warships at Scapa Flow. On 19 April 1941 she and RFA Oligarch were allocated to Fleet Attendant Duties in Norwegian waters, with Aldersdale the initial support ship for Halcyon-class minesweepers based in the Kola Inlet as escorts for homeward-bound Arctic convoys. On 12 August 1941 Aldersdale was allocated to Operation Dervish, the first aid convoy to Northern Russia, arriving at Arkhangelsk on 31 August 1941. On 1 September 1941 she touched an uncharted shoal in Sardau Bay, Spitzbergen, before returning to the UK later that month. Aldersdale returned to Reykjavik in Convoy UR 2, where on 25 December 1941 she suffered damage to her superstructure when she was fouled by the Norwegian tanker , which had broken adrift during a squall. On 15 March 1942 she suffered further damage, this time to her bows by ice. On 31 March 1942 she joined Convoy PQ 14 assembling at Reykjavik, departing for Murmansk on 8 April 1942. On 13 April 1942 the convoy ran into heavy ice and dense fog. Aldersdale was on of 11 ships damaged by ice and forced to return to Hvalfjordur. Aldersdale was under repair on the Clyde between 3 May and 4 June 1942. She then sailed to Iceland to join convoy PQ 17 to Arkhangelsk. On 30 June she took over refuelling duties from RFA Gray Ranger, which had returned to port for repairs after a growler had split her bow open. Loss On 4 July 1942 the Admiralty was concerned that heavy German fleet units were putting to sea to attack the convoy. Convoy PQ 17 was ordered to scatter and the ships to make their way independently to Soviet ports. This left the merchants vulnerable to air and submarine attack. On 5 July Aldersdale was bombed by three Junkers aircraft from astern in position 77¬∞00N 22¬∞00E in the Barents Sea. The first two bombers scored near misses that shook the ship, after which they machine gunned the decks and superstructure. The third bomber scored a hit that seemed to lift Aldersdale out of the water. Her engines were wrecked and she began to rapidly take on water. The minesweeper attempted to take her in tow, but had to cast her off. Aldersdales crew abandoned ship, all 54 being taken off by Salamander. The drifting hulk was sighted by the U-boat U-457 two days later on 7 July. Between 11.40 and 13.00 the submarine shelled the hulk with her deck gun, firing 38 high explosive shells and 37 incendiary shells from her 88mm gun and 40 rounds from her 2cm Flak gun. U-457 then fired a torpedo into the abandoned Aldersdale. The wreck broke in two, both halves sinking within 20 minutes.

Minchinbury is located west of the Sydney central business district, in Blacktown local government area and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Minchinbury is predominantly a residential area with a small commercial/retail area in the centre and industrial/commercial zones in the westernmost part. The 2001 City of Blacktown Social Plan History Minchinbury takes its name from the property named by Captain William Minchin who was granted land in 1819 on his retirement by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. William Minchin was the Principal Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Police Fund in the colony. The Minchinbury property was largely undeveloped and primarily used to graze cattle by the Minchin family and various lessees. After the death of William in 1821, the property passed to his only daughter Maria Matilda. In 1838, Maria Matilda and her family were lost at sea, leaving no descendants of William Minchin alive today. Minchin‚Äôs brother, George, who resided in Canada, inherited the property. In 1859, George Minchin, appointed John Nodes Dickinson, an NSW Supreme Court official as trustee. In February the Minchin estate, totalling 1220 acres was sold to Dr Charles McKay, a practitioner from Kilrea in Ireland, for ¬£2100. McKay was already a landowner of 20,110 acres during the 1860s and one of the largest landowners in the area and it was under his ownership that the grape vines were first planted on the Minchinbury Estate. During the 1860s, the McKay family established a vineyard on the site as well as cultivating silkworms. By 1879 the wines from Minchinbury received three awards at the Sydney Garden Palace Exhibition. In 1881, Dr McKay listed his extensive properties in the Minchinbury area for sale, due to financial difficulties. The advertisement by Charles Moore & Co Auctioneers described the property as follows; ‚Äú‚Ä¶600 hundred acres in various sizes could be sold in sections if desirable. Minchinbury embraces 60 acres of enclosed land, and planted with about 50,000 vines in full bearing‚Ä¶A trap dike of blue metal runs through the Minchinbury from west to east which will be invaluable to parties contracting for blue metal for Sydney Streets. There is also a hill of trap tuff, the deposit from an extinct volcano. This is hard and durable stone used for some years on a portion of the Great Western Road. A tramway could be inexpensively made from the quarries to Rooty Hill Station. Fine clay for brick making and good building sandstone can also be obtained. There are three wine cellars, two sixty feet by twenty, on sixty by thirty, capable of storing one hundred thousand gallons of wine and wells, tanks and lagoons with never failing water supply.‚Äù Despite this publicity, the land did not sell until 1895 when Dr McKay was able to sell all of it to James Angus. The vineyards continued to be cultivated and produced high-quality wines. The new owner, James Angus, continued to expand the wine production, and he also established a quarry, a piggery, dairy and olive trees on the land. James Angus began to expand the winery and continued to until the sale of the property in 1913. Angus sold the vineyards and cellar complex to Penfolds Wines but retained a major portion of the estate for his family, He was killed when he was hit by a train at Rooty Hill station in 1916.Trove Minchinbury was the second vineyard bought by Penfolds in New South Wales, the first being Dalwood, near Branxton in the Hunter Valley. With properties in New South Wales and South Australia they were claimed to be the largest wine producer in the ‚ÄòBritish Empire‚Äô. Minchinbury was Penfolds‚Äô first venture into sparkling wines and it became famous for its champagne. Penfolds stopped operations at the winery in 1978. Minchinbury History Article on Blacktown City Council web site Many Streets name in Minchinbury derives from wine type, wineries, or wine regions such as Sherry, Pinot, and Barossa.

Note that \\\\mathrm{not} ~p can be different from the statement eg p of the logical negation of ~p, depending on the completeness of the inference algorithm and thus also on the formal logic system. Negation as failure has been an important feature of logic programming since the earliest days of both Planner and Prolog. In Prolog, it is usually implemented using Prolog's extralogical constructs. Planner semantics In Planner, negation as failure could be implemented as follows: :\`if (not (goal p)), then (assert ¬¨p)\` which says that if an exhaustive search to prove \`p\` fails, then assert \`¬¨p\`. This states that proposition \`p\` shall be assumed as \\"not true\\" in any subsequent processing. However, Planner not being based on a logical model, a logical interpretation of the preceding remains obscure. Prolog semantics In pure Prolog, NAF literals of the form \\\\mathrm{not}~p can occur in the body of clauses and can be used to derive other NAF literals. For example, given only the four clauses : p \\\\leftarrow q \\\\land \\\\mathrm{not}~r : q \\\\leftarrow s : q \\\\leftarrow t : t \\\\leftarrow NAF derives \\\\mathrm{not}~s, \\\\mathrm{not}~r and ~p. Completion semantics The semantics of NAF remained an open issue until 1978, when Keith Clark showed that it is correct with respect to the completion of the logic program, where, loosely speaking, \\"only\\" and \\\\leftarrow are interpreted as \\"if and only if\\", written as \\"iff\\" or \\"\\\\equiv\\". For example, the completion of the four clauses above is : p \\\\equiv q \\\\land \\\\mathrm{not}~r : q \\\\equiv s \\\\lor t : t \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{true} : r \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{false} : s \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{false} The NAF inference rule simulates reasoning explicitly with the completion, where both sides of the equivalence are negated and negation on the right-hand side is distributed down to atomic formulae. For example, to show \\\\mathrm{not}~p, NAF simulates reasoning with the equivalences : \\\\mathrm{not}~p \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{not}~q \\\\lor r : \\\\mathrm{not}~q \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{not}~s \\\\land \\\\mathrm{not}~t : \\\\mathrm{not}~t \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{false} : \\\\mathrm{not}~r \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{true} : \\\\mathrm{not}~s \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{true} In the non-propositional case, the completion needs to be augmented with equality axioms, to formalize the assumption that individuals with distinct names are distinct. NAF simulates this by failure of unification. For example, given only the two clauses : p(a) \\\\leftarrow : p(b) \\\\leftarrow t NAF derives \\\\mathrm{not}~p(c). The completion of the program is : p(X) \\\\equiv X=a \\\\lor X=b augmented with unique names axioms and domain closure axioms. The completion semantics is closely related both to circumscription and to the closed world assumption. Autoepistemic semantics The completion semantics justifies interpreting the result \\\\mathrm{not}~p of a NAF inference as the classical negation eg p of p. However, in 1987, Michael Gelfond showed that it is also possible to interpret \\\\mathrm{not}~p literally as \\"p can not be shown\\", \\"p is not known\\" or \\"p is not believed\\", as in autoepistemic logic. The autoepistemic interpretation was developed further by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988, and is the basis of answer set programming. The autoepistemics semantics of a pure Prolog program P with NAF literals is obtained by \\"expanding\\" P with a set of ground (variable-free) NAF literals Œî that is stable in the sense that : Œî = {\\\\mathrm{not}~p  p is not implied by P ‚à™ Œî} In other words, a set of assumptions Œî about what can not be shown is stable if and only if Œî is the set of all sentences that truly can not be shown from the program P expanded by Œî. Here, because of the simple syntax of pure Prolog programs, \\"implied by\\" can be understood very simply as derivability using modus ponens and universal instantiation alone. A program can have zero, one or more stable expansions. For example, : p \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~p has no stable expansions. : p \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~q has exactly one stable expansion Œî = {\\\\mathrm{not}~q} : p \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~q : q \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~p has exactly two stable expansions Œî1 = {\\\\mathrm{not}~p} and Œî2 = {\\\\mathrm{not}~q}. The autoepistemic interpretation of NAF can be combined with classical negation, as in extended logic programming and answer set programming. Combining the two negations, it is possible to express, for example : eg p \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~p (the closed world assumption) and : p \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathrm{not}~ eg p (p holds by default).

It was established in September 1994 by a merger of WorldFIP North America and the Interoperable Systems Project (ISP). Fieldbus Foundation was a not-for-profit trade consortium that consisted of more than 350 of the world's suppliers and end users of process control and manufacturing automation products.fieldbus.org Working together those companies made contributions to the IEC/ISA/FDI and other fieldbus standards development. Unlike proprietary network protocols, Foundation Fieldbus is not owned by a company, it is an open, interoperable [fieldbus] that is based on the International Organization for Standardization's Open Systems Interconnection (OSI/ISO) seven-layer communications model. The Foundation specification is compatible with the officially sanctioned SP50 standards project of the Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society (ISA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). From its inception Fieldbus Foundation had taken a leadership role in the development of fieldbus digital communications and integrated system architecture based on regional and international standards. The foundation's history was one of growth and achievement, as fieldbus-based control solutions gained widespread acceptance in the global automation marketplace. Origins of the Technology In the 1980s, considerable effort went into developing a digital communication standard for field devices. Credit is due those members of the ISA's SP50 committee who spent years defining technical requirements and building consensus for a digital fieldbus. In the interim, leading process control suppliers started work on their own proprietary digital communication standards. These multiple efforts resulted in a handful of competing protocols, none of which could work together. =Consensus in the industry= In late 1994, the path of fieldbus took a new, promising direction. Two parallel supplier consortiums‚Äìthe InterOperable Systems Project (ISP) and WorldFIP North America‚Äìmerged to form the Fieldbus Foundation. The new organization immediately brought critical mass to the effort to achieve an internationally acceptable fieldbus standard. The foundation organized development programs, conducted field trials, and established the industry's most rigorous program for testing and registration of fieldbus devices. Manufacturers, end users, academic institutions and other interested parties became members of the Fieldbus Foundation and developed open, non-proprietary specifications known as Foundation Fieldbus. This advanced digital communication solution was designed from the ground-up to support mission- critical control applications where the proper transfer and handling of data is essential. Foundation technology was created to replace incompatible networks and systems with an open, fully integrated architecture for information integration and distributed, real-time control. With Foundation technology, users gained the power to implement tightly integrated digital control based on unified system architecture and a high-speed backbone for plant operations. This, in turn, removed the previously experienced constraints on device and subsystem interoperability. Milestones The Fieldbus Foundation achieved many important milestones along the way to the maturity and success of Foundation technology. These included: * Completion of H1 draft preliminary specifications, May 1995 * Demonstration of H1 technology at Monsanto Chocolate Bayou, October 1996 * Registration of the first H1 fieldbus products, September 1998 * Completion of High Speed Ethernet (HSE) draft preliminary specifications, September 1999 * Registration of the first HSE linking devices, May 2001 * Demonstration of HSE and Flexible Function Blocks (FFBs) at ISP Lima, May 2005http://www.controleng.com/search/search- single-display/foundation-fieldbus-h1-hse-flexible-fbs-integrate-butanediol- plant/9887fb5de4.html * Completion of Foundation for SIF protocol specifications, 2005 * Demonstration of Foundation for Safety Instrumented Functions (SIF) technology at Shell Global Solutions, Amsterdam, May 2008http://www.fieldbus.org/index.php?Itemid=281&id;=452&option;=com_content&task;=view * Registration of the first H1 fieldbus cable, Oct. 2008 * Launch of collaborative initiative with ISA to implement wireless backhaul networks, Oct. 2008 * Release of SIF final technical specifications, Jan. 2009 * Announcement of first educational institutions offering certified Foundation Fieldbus training, Mar. 2009 * Fieldbus Foundation joins expanded Field Device Integration (FDI) industry initiative, Dec. 2009 * Registration of first fieldbus devices incorporating advanced field diagnostics, Nov. 2010 * Release of High Speed Ethernet Remote I/O (HSE-RIO) preliminary specification, Dec. 2010 * Registration of first hosts incorporating host profile 61b, April 2011 * Announcement of Foundation for Remote Operations Management (ROM) solution, Dec. 2011http://www.fieldbus.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=988&Itemid;=281 * Registration of first H1 isolated device couplers, Sept. 2012 * Approval of wireless backhaul architecture model developed in collaboration with ISA * First field demonstration of Foundation for ROM technology, conducted by Petrobras in Brazil, April 2013http://www.fieldbus.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1207&Itemid;=281 * Launch of Project Gemstone to make the digital fieldbus automation experience easier, May 2013 Critical to the industry's acceptance of the technology was its standardization by recognized international governing bodies. These include: * American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/International Society of Automation (ISA), September 1992 * International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), December 1999 * European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), March 2000 The IEC voted to include the Foundation H1 and HSE specifications in the IEC 61158 international fieldbus standard. The CENELEC Technical Bureau added the Foundation H1 specifications to the EN 50170 Euronorm. In addition, Foundation H1 is the only implementation of the ANSI/ISA-50.02 standard. =Foundation for Safety Instrumented Functions (SIF)= The Fieldbus Foundation‚Äôs Foundation for SIF development project achieved its first major milestone at the end of 2003 with approval of the overall system concept by T√úV Rheinland Industrie Service GmbH, Automation, Software and Information Technology, a global, independent and accredited testing agency .In early 2006, the foundation announced that T√úV had granted Protocol Type Approval for its fieldbus specifications. T√úV Type Approval helps meet the growing worldwide demand for commercial, standards-based safety instrumentation incorporating Foundation technology. Foundation for SIF technology meets the rigorous requirements of the IEC 61508 standard for functional safety of electrical, electronic and programmable electronic safety-related systems, up to, and including, Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 3. In addition, end users can build systems per the IEC 61511 standard covering SIF functional safety in the process industries (IEC 61511 is available as the ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 standard). International end user associations such as NAMUR (Germany) and JEMIMA (Japan) have voiced support for Foundation technology, and provided input from the end user community that aided in specification development. Approval and support by key international industry bodies gave users the confidence that their investments in Foundation control solutions were based on recognized global standards. =Foundation for Remote Operations Management (ROM)= One of the fastest growing segments in the world of process automation is remote operations management. As the name implies, remote operations refers to the management of automation assets that are located in or are dispersed throughout remote geographic locations where it is difficult or impossible to send personnel. This is not limited to remote offshore oil platforms and oil and gas pipelines. It can also include tank farms and terminals, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and any industry or application that requires remote access to automation assets Foundation for Remote Operations Management (ROM) is a suite of technologies and additions to the Foundation Fieldbus specification that provide for both a wireless and wired infrastructure for remote assets and applications. Foundation for ROM provides for direct access to information and diagnostics in wireless and remote I/O devices. Conversely, Foundation for ROM can take the data from those devices and place into the Foundation Fieldbus environment for data management and quality. Foundation Fieldbus is much more than just a communications protocol. The user layer allows for all kinds of flexibility and standardization of data management, and it is all built around the requirements of process automation. Foundation for Remote Operations Management provides an open path for integration of multiple wireless and wired networks, from conventional remote I/O to ISA 100.11a and WirelessHART‚Ñ¢, and enables direct access to device information and diagnostics. It extends the range and capabilities of Foundation fieldbus to encompass many more devices throughout the plant ‚Äî regardless of their communications technology. Remote I/O Integration The interface for conventional wired remote I/O and wired HART, dubbed RIO, was launched back in 2007. The HSE remote I/O (HSE RIO) specification allows end users to access high data requirement devices directly in the fieldbus host system via HSE high-speed fieldbus. The remote I/O specification allows all forms of conventional I/O to be brought into the native fieldbus environment easily. This solution makes discrete-in, discrete- out, analog-in, analog-out and Foundation H1 available over a common Ethernet network. Fieldbus Foundation released the Remote I/O portion of the specification in April 2011. Wired and WirelessHART Integration In September 2011, Fieldbus Foundation announced the preliminary specification addressing fieldbus transducer blocks for wired HART and WirelessHART devices, together with updates to the WIO System Architecture and WIO Data Structures related to the transducer block specification. The wired and WirelessHART technical specification defines a fieldbus transducer block used to represent HART devices within Foundation for ROM devices. Both wired HART and WirelessHART devices may be represented in this block. In addition, the specification describes the expected method for HART configuration tools and asset-managing hosts to access HART devices using the native HART command protocol transported through the Foundation High Speed Ethernet (HSE) network. The specification also defines structures to identify and maintain HART device status in wired multi-drop networks as well as in WirelessHART mesh networks connected to Foundation for Remote Operations Management devices. ISA 100.11a Integration The ISA 100.11a phase of the project has also made considerable progress in the integration of the ISA 100.11a wireless sensor network into the Foundation Fieldbus infrastructure. The draft preliminary specification has been completed, with preliminary specification, testing, and final specification to be completed within a year. Similar to WirelessHART devices, ISA 100.11a devices will be represented as transducer blocks in Foundation ROM devices. HSE Backhaul team In late 2008, Fieldbus Foundation and ISA entered into a cross-licensing agreement allowing the two organizations to collaborate on wireless networks. This agreement will assist the ISA100.15 working group in developing a wireless backhaul standard. Backhaul networks integrated remote locations and applications with central control facilities. The Foundation for ROM specification provides for HSE as the backhaul network for remote applications, available in both wired and wireless configurations. Future Integration of Additional Networks Foundation for ROM allows for future integration of other networks aside from ISA 100.11a, WirelessHART, and others. Future candidates include networks such as Modbus. The future potential to integrate a huge variety of networks is unlimited.

The principal objective behind setting up the autonomous district council is to empower the Indigenous people to govern themselves and also to bring all round developments of the backward people so as to protect and preserve their culture, customs, and traditions. But it actually came into being on 15 January 1982 and elected members were sworn in on 18 January 1982. Later, it was upgraded under the provision of the 6th schedule of the Indian constitution by the 49th constitution (Amendment) act, 1984; with effect from 1 April 1985. Total area The total area of the TTAADC is 7,132.56 km¬≤., which covers about 68% of the total area (10,491 km¬≤) of the state. About 70% of land under TTAADC is covered by hilly forest, whereas all the plain cultivable land including all the districts and sub-divisional headquarters are outside the purview of.TTAADC basic statestics Population Total population of 3,673,917 of the State (as per 2011 census) the total population of Scheduled Tribes is 853,920 (30.95%), out of which about 679,720 (79.59%) population are within the TTAADC area.Basic Statestics The total population of Tripura was 3,191,168 according to 2001 census. Council The TTAADC is governed by a council which has 30 members. Out of 30 members, 28 members are elected through adult suffrage, while 2 members are nominated by the governor of Tripura. Out of 28 elected seats, 25 are reserved for Scheduled Tribes. Executive committee TTAADC has a regular administrative structure. Executive committee composed of 10 members and chief executive officer (CEO) is the head of the administration. Powers Under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council is vested with two types of Powers. These are 1. legislative powers and 2. executive powers. =Legislative= The Legislative Department of the district council is headed by the chairman, who summons the meeting of the council from time to time in connection with approval of budget, discussion on bills, rules and regulations submitted by the treasury bench and passing of the same thereof. The council consists of 30 members, out of which 28 members are elected by adult franchise and 2 members are nominated by the governor of Tripura. The chairman has his own secretariat headed by the secretary to the district council. =Executive= The executive powers are vested with the executive committee, which is headed by the chief executive member, who is elected from among the Treasury Bench members. The Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India provides ample powers to the district council for self-Governance of the tribal population of the state. The district council has its own powers to appoint its own staff in terms of requirement and appointment rules. The council administration is headed by the chief executive officer and a deputy chief executive officer of TCS Grade-I and 6 executive officers, such as administration, finance, rural development, planning, development, and coordination, etc. Relationship with Panchayat Before the establishment of the district council, villages included in its jurisdiction had Gram panchayats like the rest of the state. Following the establishment of the council, Tripura Panchayat Raj Act ceased to operate in that area and there was no village level body- elected or otherwise. In 2006, the State Government decided to hold elections to the Village Councils by treating them on par with village Panchayats in other parts of the State taking the view that nothing in Sixth Schedule precludes such a course of action. The Autonomous Council is, however, as of 2009, yet to transfer any functions to these newly established Councils.

Foundation Fieldbus technology is mostly used in process industries, but has recently been implemented in powerplants. Two related implementations of Foundation Fieldbus have been introduced to meet different needs within the process automation environment. These two implementations use different physical media and communication speeds. *Foundation Fieldbus H1 - Operates at 31.25 kbit/s and is generally used to connect to field devices and host systems. It provides communication and power over standard stranded twisted- pair wiring in both conventional and intrinsic safety applications. H1 is currently the most common implementation. *HSE (High-speed Ethernet) - Operates at 100/1000 Mbit/s and generally connects input/output subsystems, host systems, linking devices and gateways. It doesn't currently provide power over the cable, although work is under way to address this using the IEEE802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) standard. Foundation Fieldbus was originally intended as a replacement for the 4-20 mA standard, and today it coexists alongside other technologies such as Modbus, Profibus, and Industrial Ethernet. Foundation Fieldbus today enjoys a growing installed base in many heavy process applications such as refining, petrochemicals, power generation, and even food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear applications. Foundation Fieldbus was developed over a period of many years by the International Society of Automation, or ISA, as SP50. In 1996 the first H1 (31.25 kbit/s) specifications were released. In 1999 the first HSE (High Speed Ethernet) specifications were released. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard on field bus, including Foundation Fieldbus, is IEC 61158. Type 1 is Foundation Fieldbus H1, while Type 5 is Foundation Fieldbus HSE. A typical fieldbus segment consists of the following components. * H1 card - fieldbus interface card (It is common practice to have redundant H1 cards, but ultimately this is application specific) * PS - Bulk power (Vdc) to Fieldbus Power Supply * FPS - Fieldbus Power Supply and Signal Conditioner (Integrated power supplies and conditioners have become the standard nowadays) * T - Terminators (Exactly 2 terminators are used per fieldbus segment. One at the FPS and one at the furthest point of a segment at the device coupler) * LD - Linking Device, alternatively used with HSE networks to terminate 4-8 H1 segments acting as a gateway to an HSE backbone network. * And fieldbus devices, (e.g. transmitters, transducers, etc.) segment diagram on flickr An explanation of how Foundation Fieldbus works and how it is used in continuous process control is in the Foundation Fieldbus Primer which may be found at the Fieldbus Inc. website.

She co-founded, choreographed and directed the American Tap Dance Foundation, known at the time as the American Tap Dance Orchestra. Bufalino wrote a memoir entitled, Tapping the Source...Tap dance, Stories, Theory and Practice and a book of poems Circular Migrations, both of which have been published by Codhill Press, and the novella Song of the Split Elm, published by Outskirts Press. She has been awarded The Flobert Award, The Tapestry Award, The Tap City Hall of Fame Award, The Dance Magazine, and the Bessie Award, all for outstanding achievement and contributions to the field of tap dance.  Early life  Bufalino was born September 7th, 1937 in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Bufalino came from a family of performers, and started dancing seriously by age five at Professor O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs Normal School of Dancing six days out of the week. She trained in numerous styles, but tap was deeply instilled in her at a young age. As heard by Bufalino in an interview, ‚ÄúWhere I come from, even if you intended a career in ballet, you studied tap first.‚Äù As a young girl, Bufalino toured with her mother and aunt in a performing act called The Strickland Sisters. The group combined music, with text and movement; Bufalino would dance while her mother and aunt sung Art Songs. At age 15, Bufalino commuted to Boston to train at Stanley Brown‚Äôs Studio in the city. While at Stanley Brown, Bufalino trained in Afro-Cuban, rhythm tap, jazz, and vaudeville styles. Bufalino stayed in Boston, and danced underaged at bars with The Bobby Clark Dancers. In addition to dancing, each night she would sneak into these clubs after class and rehearsals to listen to the New Orleans jazz and bebop improvisation of saxophone players. Hayes and Bigfords Restaurant became the scene for avant-garde communities to meet and ended up giving Bufalino her first exposure to conversations over philosophy, literature, and art. Her years in Boston shaped her style through music that she loved and experienced in an intimate way that later impacted her tap style.  Career  = New York City = Bufalino left for New York City in 1955 to scour the jazz clubs. Shortly after moving, she began dancing at Dance Craft, a dance studio owned by the famous tap dancer, Honi Coles. At age 17, Coles took on Bufalino as his prot√©g√©. Bufalino became greatly inspired by Coles‚Äô emphasis on melody and personality. She was eventually invited to perform with the Copasetics, which included tap legends such as Ernest \\"Brownie\\" Brown, Chuck Green, Jimmy Slyde and Howard ‚ÄúSandman‚Äù Sims. While training with Coles, Bufalino continued to stay active in a variety of training. She studied jazz from Matt Mattox, modern primitive and afro-cuban from Syvilla Fort, all the while being an active performer in the New York Vaudeville nightclub circuit. She became a popular Calypso artist, and in 1956 she premiered her act at Cafe Society, which led to more calypso work for the following two years. New York Cabaret laws of the 50‚Äôs changed live performance at the time, and many Cabarets ended up losing their venues. This, in conjunction with frustration over the direction of the industry, caused Bufalino to flee the confines of the city in 1965 and moved to New Paltz, NY. While in New Paltz with her husband, she raised her two children, Jebah Baum and Zachary Baum, and spent most of the late 60‚Äôs writing poetry and plays. = New Paltz and the Avant-garde = While in New Paltz, Bufalino reconnected with Ed Summerlin, long time friend and composer who collaborated with her often. Summerlin and Bufalino created projects for the National Council of Church, and was very involved in avant- garde performance art. Though this work didn‚Äôt include tap, Bufalino would put tap sounds through a synthesizer and use it in her accompaniment. This period of her life was filled with experimentation, emphasis on interpretive dance, and led to Bufalino‚Äôs curiosity in how to combine her love for tap with the artistic world of concert art. At the same time, Bufalino began teaching at SUNY New Paltz as a professor. Her connection to the university opened up opportunities for Bufalino to experiment and create modern works such as, Watch the Bouncing Ball, Diary of Samuel and Rosalie, and a film entitled, Traveling. Bufalino created a small company of dancers known as, The Dancing Theatre, and in 1978 Bufalino presented her first major showing of tap choreography at the Pilgrim Theatre titled, Singing, Swinging, and Winging. This piece consisted of three members of the company, with Honi Coles as a guest. = Resurgence of Tap = Bufalino‚Äôs career peaked during the 80‚Äôs, and she found herself involved in many different artistic endeavors that spanned all across the globe. Bufalino‚Äôs work premiered in both small jazz clubs, such as the Blue Note, and large orchestral settings. After moving back to New York City, Bufalino and Coles reconnected and began working together again. Bufalino played a key role in Coles‚Äô resurface in the tap industry in the 70‚Äôs. In the early 80‚Äôs she toured with Coles and the Copasetics internationally in London and France, including festivals produced by Avra Petrides in St. Chinian. This was Bufalino‚Äôs first exposure to any kind of art festival and led to later inspiration for tap festivals in America. In 1984, Bufalino performed Cantata and the Blues, a solo show that established her tap career further. This performance utilized counterpoint, weight, and complex rhythm. During this time, Bufalino taught at many studios in NYC and internationally. Additionally, she became heavily involved in the tap festivals (Colorado, Portland, Boston, San Francisco, Houston) around America that were gaining immense popularity at the time. These teaching experiences lead Bufalino to solidify her pedagogy and bring tap dance to people all around America. Eventually, one of her company members, Tony Waag, created Tap City, a Tap festival that brought classes, performances, and tap seminars to New York City. = American Tap Dance Orchestra = While performing at Blue Note as a soloist, touring with the Copasetics, and making appearances at tap festivals, Bufalino banded together a group of 11 dancers in 1986 to create the American Tap Dance Orchestra (later becoming American Tap Dance Foundation). The concept behind the orchestra was to use different groups of tappers to encompass the many sections of a band or orchestra. Some would be bass, others drums, with a soloist usually carrying the melody. They premiered their first work at the Statue of Liberty 4th of July Festival in Battery Park. They later premiered a three and a half minute PBS special performance, Haitian Fight Song, which launched the company into stardom. Following this performance, the company premiered other iconic works such as 42nd Street River to River and The Four Seasons [Jazz version]. Touch, Turn, Return created in collaboration with Carmen Moore premiered in the Judson Church Theater, and is considered Bufalino‚Äôs most critically acclaimed avant-garde work. From 1989 to 1995, the company also operated Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center & Inter Arts Space in New York City, and presented on-going classes, performances and related activities. This space was not only for dance, but housed poetry nights, theatrical performances, art galleries, and musical concerts. The company‚Äôs work had an iconoclastic aesthetic that put tap dance on the concert stage. Often appearing in black suits with coat tails, the dancers utilized counterpoint and cacophony in their tapping. Bufalino was very involved in arranging the composition and worked very closely with the musicians that played for their performances. As a director, she was keen on making sure the audience could hear the tappers. She was known to quiet the orchestra by muting the horns, and often played the drums herself so she could control the volume.  Legacy  Recognized as a leading exponent and innovator of jazz tap dance, Bufalino was a pioneer in putting tap dance on the concert stage and challenging the audience to sustain its attention on prolonged rhythmic composition. As a choreographer, Bufalino emphasized story telling, arrangement, choice of composition, and writing in her work. She believed that, ‚ÄúThe tap dancer should be integrated with the music.‚Äù She was influential in demanding quality microphones, wood floors, lighting, and proper technical needs for tap dancers in both their training and performances. Bufalino experienced backlash for being a white woman in the tap industry and spent her entire career getting producers and technicians to be on board with her work. Through the challenges, Bufalino‚Äôs work eventually created a pallet for how tap dance could be produced and appreciated on the concert stage. As a creator, her work pushed boundaries and blended different types of elements that were previously contrary ideals to the tap industry.

Description Gol stavkyrkje by Nicolay Nicolaysen (corrected illustration) The church has been dendrochronologically dated to from 1157 to 1216. When the city built a new church around 1880, it was decided to demolish the old stave church. It was saved from destruction by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments (Fortidsminneforeningen), which bought the materials in order to re-erect the church elsewhere. The remains of the original medieval construction were documented before transport. Original murals and medieval artifacts survived. Most of the main construction remained intact and in original form, although practically all of the exterior dates from the 1884‚Äì1885 restoration. It was acquired by King Oscar II, who financed its relocation and restoration as the central building of his private open-air museum near Oslo. Architect Waldemar Hansteen assessed the condition of the conserved parts and made a plan for restoration. The restoration was overseen by Waldemar Hansteen and was completed in 1885. In 1907, the early open-air museum, the world's first, was merged with the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History, which now manages the stave church. The church, however, is still nominally the property of the reigning monarch. In the 1980s, a modern replica has been erected in Gol as a tourist attraction in a theme park in central Gol. This replica is located some distance from the original site of the medieval church. There is also a replica in the Scandinavian Heritage Park in Minot, North Dakota and at Epcot Center in Walt Disney World in Florida.

She is the recipient of numerous literary awards and was made a Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour in 2009. Life Chedid was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 20 March 1920 to a Lebanese Christian family. She was the daughter of Selim Saab, a Maronite Christian born in Baabda, Lebanon and Alice Khoury who was born in the Greek Orthodox community of Damascus and from a Lebanese family from Baabda as well. When she was 10 years old, she was sent to a boarding school, where she learned English and French. At 14, she left for Europe. She then returned to Cairo to go to the American University. Her dream was to become a dancer. When she was 22, she married Louis Selim Chedid, a Lebanese physician from a Maronite bourgeois family in Cairo and former research director at the National Center for Scientific Research, honorary professor of the Institute Pasteur and author of several books such as The heart remains and Babel which he wrote with his wife Andree. Both her son Louis Chedid and her grandson Matthieu Chedid, also known as -M-, are popular pop and rock singers in France. She contributed song lyrics to her grandson including that of Bonoboo on the 1999 album Je dis aime. Her granddaughter √âmilie Chedid (born in 1970) is a French director, Joseph Chedid (born in 1986), also known by his stage name of Selim, is a French singer and Anna Chedid (born in 1987), also known by her stage name of Nach, is also a French singer.  Literary work  Andr√©e Chedid published her first collection of poems On the Trails of my Fancy in 1943 in Cairo. She settled in Paris with her husband in 1946 and began writing there. In addition to numerous poems and novels, she also wrote plays and children's books mainly published by the publisher Groupe Flammarion . Her poetry books were partly illustrated by the Luxembourg painter Roger Bertemes . In 1972, Chedid received the Prix de l'Aigle d'or for poetry followed by numerous other literary awards. For her books Fraternit√© de la parole and C√©r√©monial de la violence in 1976 she was awarded the Prix Mallarm√© . Her best-known work is novel L'Autre which has been translated into many languages and tells of the rescue from an earthquake spilled by an ancient Egyptian. It was made into a movie in 1991 by Bernard Giraudeau under the title L'Autre. Andr√©e Chedid was also awarded the Grand Prize of the Soci√©t√© des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques, the Grand Prize of the Soci√©t√© des auteurs, compositeurs et √©diteurs de musique (SACEM) in 1999 and the Prix Goncourt of poetry. Chedid has written twenty-three volumes of poetry, eighteen novels, more than a hundred short stories, eight plays and nine children's books.  Legacy  In an appraisal, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called her part of a \\"generation of cosmopolitan intellectuals who chose France as their new home after the war, helping the country to a literary renaissance\\". Her work questions human condition and what links the individual to the world. Her writing seeks to evoke the Orient, but she focuses more in denouncing the civil war that destroys Lebanon. She lived in France from 1946 until her death. Because of this diverse background, her work is truly multicultural. Her first book was written in English: On the Trails of my Fancy. She has commented about her work that it is an eternal quest for humanity. She died on 6 February 2011 in Paris at the age of 90. In 2012, a public library was named for her, in Paris. Biblioth√®que Andr√©e-Chedid, 36 √âmeriau street (Paris)  Tribute  Several schools in France bear her name: in Rennes, in the Villejean district, in Anstaing (North) and in Aigrefeuille- sur-Maine 9 (Loire-Atlantique).

Across millennia the erosive forces of these rivers has gradually created a multitude of red-rock canyons, such as the Quebrada de Humahuaca and the Valles Calchaqu√≠es. West of these valleys the peaks of the Andes reach heights of over and the Altiplano, an extensive 3,500-meter high plateau, dominates the landscape and continues far north into Bolivia and Southern Peru. Climate Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry and hot and classified as subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, the region is climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequentially, the vegetation will differ at these different climate types. In general, the climate can be divided into 2 main types: a cold arid or semi-arid climate at the higher altitudes and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, the region has 5 different climate types which are semi‚Äìarid (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively) and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes. The atmospheric circulation is controlled by the two semi‚Äìpermanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and a seasonal low pressure system east of the Andes (called the Chaco Low). During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic high and the Chaco low causes the low pressure system to bring northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during the summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the moisture comes from the east since the Andes block any moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Cold fronts that travel northwards to the region can produce precipitation during the summer months and is more prominent in the southern parts of the region. For example, in Tucuman Province, these cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. In contrast, during the winter months, the Chaco low attracts air masses from the South Pacific high, creating a dry and cold wind. This effect is more prominent in the winter months, when the intensity of the cold is more stronger. The Intertropical convergence zone reaches the region during the summer months, leading to low pressure, and unstable air masses due to the relatively high land temperatures compared to the sea during this season. This leads to enhanced precipitation in the form of convective thunderstorms during the summer months. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone moves northwards to Ecuador while both the South Pacific and South Atlantic high move northwards, and the Chaco low weakens, all of which result in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the predominant wind being from the west and the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean along with atmospheric circulation patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms. =Precipitation= Precipitation in the region is highly seasonal and is mostly concentrated in the summer months, during which precipitation decreases from east to west. Precipitation is distributed irregularly owing to relief. As moist air reaches the eastern slopes of the mountains, this moist air raises up vertically, cooling adiabatically, leading to the formation of clouds which generate copious amounts of rain. The eastern slopes of the mountains can receive between of precipitation a year although some places can receive of precipitation per year owing to orographic precipitation. In the south, the orographic effect is enhanced by advancing cold fronts from the south, resulting in enhanced precipitation. The high rainfall on these first slopes creates a thick jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges. Beyond the first slopes of the Andes into the valleys, the air descends vertically, warming adiabatically, creating air that is drier and warmer than on the eastern slopes. Since the mountain ranges are oriented in a north‚Äìsouth direction, increase in altitude to the west, and have a discontinuous orography, this allows valleys to have regions of relatively high precipitation in the west and drier regions in eastern parts of the valleys through orographic precipitation. In the temperate valleys, which include major cities such as Salta and Jujuy, average precipitation ranges from . For example, in the Lerma Valley which is surrounded by tall mountains (only the northeastern part of the valley is surrounded by shorter mountains), precipitation ranges from in Salta to in San Lorenzo, just away. Rainfall in the Lerma valley in Salta and in wetter valleys in Jujuy province, including its provincial capital, is mainly concentrated in the summer months and falls in short but heavy bursts. Valleys in the southern parts of the region are drier than northern valleys due to the mountains on the eastern slopes of both the Andes and the Sierras Pampeanas being taller than the ones in the north (ranging from ), presenting a significant orographic barrier that blocks moist winds from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. These valleys often receive less than of precipitation per year and are characterized by sparse vegetation adapted to the arid climate. For example, in La Rioja province, mean annual precipitation ranges from in the easternmost parts to at the foot of the Andes. Similarly in Catamarca province, the mean annual precipitation varies from in the middle of valleys between the Andes mountains to more than in the nearby mountain ranges which form the valleys. In Jujuy province, precipitation in the dry Quebrada de Humahuaca valley ranges from . A similar annual precipitation is found in the dry Calchaqu√≠ Valleys, with mean annual precipitation ranging from in Molinos to in Cafayate. Further west in the Puna region next to Bolivia, the average altitude is and the terrain is mostly desert due to the higher altitudes of the mountains on the east from both the Andes and the northwest extension of the Sierras Pampeanas, blocking most of the easterly winds from coming in. Precipitation in the Puna region averages less than a year while potential evapotranspiration ranges from a year, owing to the high insolation, strong winds, and low humidity that exacerbates the dry conditions. Owing to the low precipitation in conjunction with the extreme climatic conditions, the Puna region has a water deficit in all months of the year. Although easterly winds are rare in the Puna region, they bring 88‚Äì96% of the precipitation to the area. Snowfall is rare, averaging less than 5 days of snow per year since most of the precipitation falls in the summer in the form of rain. The southeast part of the Puna region is very arid and receives the lowest annual precipitation in the region, averaging . In the northeast part of the Puna region in Jujuy province, mean annual precipitation ranges from . Due to the aridity of these mountains at high altitudes, the snowline can extend as far up as 6,000 m above sea level. The El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation influences precipitation levels in northwest Argentina. During an El Ni√±o year, the westerly flow is strengthened while moisture content from the east is reduced, resulting in a drier rainy season. In contrast, during a La Ni√±a year, there is enhanced easterly moisture transport, resulting in a more intense rainy season. Nonetheless, this trend is highly variable both spatially and temporally. =Temperatures= Temperatures in northwest Argentina vary by altitude. In the temperate valleys which includes the cities of Salta and Jujuy, they have a temperate climate, with mild temperatures in the summer (a mean of in Salta, in Jujuy in January) and extremely dry and cool winters with regular frosts (a mean of in Salta and in Jujuy in July). The diurnal range in these cities is fairly large, particularly in the winter. In the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley in Jujuy province, north of Jujuy city, the diurnal range is large with a thermal amplitude between . A major reason for the large thermal amplitude is that during the day, there is intense radiation from the sun, causing the land to heat up while during the night, there is less radiation, causing the land to cool and temperatures to fall down. Mean temperatures in the warmest month in the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley range from in Humahuaca at the higher altitudes to in Volcan at the lower altitudes; in the coldest month, the mean temperature ranges from . The mean annual temperatures in the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley ranges from , depending on altitude. In the Calchaqu√≠ Valleys in Salta province, the climate is similar to the valleys in La Rioja province and Catamarca province, by being temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long summers, and a long frost free period which varies depending on altitude. Mean temperatures in the warmest month in the Calchaqui valleys range from at the higher altitudes to at lower altitudes; in the coldest month, the mean temperature ranges from . The mean annual temperatures in the Calchaqui valleys ranges from in La Poma at the higher altitudes to in San Carlos which lies at a lower altitude. In both the Quebrada de Humahuaca and Calchaqui valleys, winters are cold with frosts that can occur between March and September. In the valleys in the south in La Rioja province and Catamarca province along with the southwest parts of Santiago del Estero Province which is part of the arid Chaco ecoregion, the climate is mild year long in terms of temperature. Temperatures during the summer are very high, with a mean temperature of in January, the warmest month. Temperatures can exceed on an average of 20‚Äì25 days and can occasionally exceed , particularly in the central valley of Catamarca (Valle Central de Catamarca) and the valley of La Rioja Capital which lie at lower altitudes than other valleys such as Tinogasta. Winters in the valleys of La Rioja province and Catamarca province along with southwest Santiago del Estero province are mild, with a mean temperature of . Cold fronts from the south, bringing cold Antarctic air can cause severe frosts in the valleys of La Rioja province and Catamarca province. Temperatures can fall between during these cold fronts. In contrast, the Zonda wind, which occurs more during the winter months can affect these valleys in La Rioja province and Catamarca province can raise temperatures up to with strong gusts, causing possible crop damage. Further west, in the Puna region next to Bolivia, temperatures are much colder, with a mean annual temperature of less than owing to its high altitude. The Puna region is characterized by being cold but sunny throughout the year. The diurnal range is large with a thermal amplitude that can exceed due to the low humidity and the intense sunlight throughout the year. and the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures are and respectively with frosts that can occur in any month as night temperatures can regularly fall below freezing. Absolute maximum temperatures in the Puna region can reach up to while absolute minimum temperatures can fall below . In Tucuman province, the eastern parts have an average annual temperature of . Summers are hot with mean temperatures averaging between while in winter, the mean temperatures are between . Easternmost parts of the province, which borders the Chaco region are home to the highest and lowest temperatures in the province where absolute maximum temperatures can exceed while absolute minimum temperatures can reach close to owing to the accumulation of cold air that descends from the mountains. At higher altitudes, the climate is cooler with summer temperatures averaging and winter temperatures averaging . The annual temperature in the higher altitudes is between at an altitude of above sea level. Within the valleys located between the mountains, temperatures are cooler with a mean annual temperature of (summers average while winters average ) in the Tafi valley. Economy The majority of the population‚Äîand thus economic activity‚Äîof this region is concentrated in the many fertile valleys. In these valleys, the cultivation of sugarcane, tobacco, and citrus is the most important activity, along with cattle and goat raising. Important vineyards are also found in the Valles Calchaqu√≠es in the Cafayate region. Thus most economic activity is associated with agriculture, with the exception of the \\"Altos Hornos Zapla\\" steel furnace. Mining includes lithium, lead, silver, zinc and salt, and hydrocarbons extraction. Tourism Trekking in Quebrada de las Conchas. The Argentine Northwest is a popular destination for both domestic and international travelers, attracting neighboring Argentinos and vacationing Europeans alike. Some of the most popular destination are Quebrada de Humahuaca and the Cerro de los Siete Colores, Cafayate and the Valles Calchaqu√≠es, Taf√≠ del Valle, and the capital cities of the provinces: San Miguel de Tucum√°n, San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, Salta and San Salvador de Jujuy. The national parks of the region are: Barit√∫ National Park, Calilegua National Park, El Rey National Park, Los Cardones National Park and Campo de los Alisos National Park. =Cultural tourism= Besides the geography of the area, the culture is also of great interest. It is strongly influenced by Quechua and Aymara cultures, and the region is quite distinct from the more European Buenos Aires. This influence can be seen in the music, clothing and customs of the people.

It is named after Dogmael, a 6th-century saint said to have been the son of Ithel ap Ceredig ap Cunedda Wledig, and also reputedly the cousin of Saint David. The abbey was built on or very close to the site of the pre-Norman conquest clas church of Llandudoch. It was founded between 1113 and 1115 for a prior and twelve monks of the Tironensian Order. The founders were Robert fitz Martin and his wife, Maud Peverel (sister of William Peverel the younger, d.1149). In 1120 Abbot William of Tiron consented to fitz Martin's request that the priory become an abbey. Abbot Fulchard was installed by Bishop Bernard of St David's. It remained a daughter house of Tiron, probably until its dissolution. However, in 1138, the village and abbey of St Dogmaels were sacked by Gruffudd ap Cynan's sons, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr, acting with princes Anaraud and Cadell. In 1188, Gerald of Wales stayed at the abbey with Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, whilst they gathered support for the Third Crusade on their preaching tour of Wales. The earliest surviving remains date from the first half of the twelfth century. It seems that sufficient of the church was built to satisfy the immediate requirements of the monastery, but that the western part for the use of the laity, was not finished. The nave was completed in the thirteenth century, although without the intended aisles. Unusually the church lacks a west doorway, possibly because of the slope of the ground becomes steeper. The square-ended sanctuary was built over a vaulted crypt, possibly a repository for relics of St Dogmael. About the middle of the thirteenth century, the cloister was enlarged northwards; the cloister arcades were rebuilt in stone about the same time. The domestic quarters were extensively rebuilt at the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century. A new infirmary was built, followed by a chapter house In the fourteenth or fifteenth century, much of the west range was altered to provide improved accommodation for the abbot. A new wing was added for the abbot's guests. The last alteration to the church was the rebuilding of the north transept, with its elaborate fan vaulted roof. This happened in the early sixteenth century, not long before the suppression of the monastery. The lavish design indicates it may have been an individually distinct chapel, possibly built as a memorial to the founder's family, the lords of Cemais. The abbey was dissolved in 1536, along with hundreds of other houses whose annual income was less than ¬£200. By this time, there were only eight monks and the abbot. The majority of the abbey's possessions were leased to John Bradshaw of Presteigne in Radnorshire. He built a mansion, probably within the abbey precinct. Substantial parts of the church survive, including the western end wall, the north wall, northern transept. The crypt, beneath the former eastern two bays of the presbytery is preserved to the springing of the vault. Fifteenth century floor tiles remain in large areas of the nave. The abbey is Grade I listed. The abbey was known for its library. One manuscript, a 13th- century copy of Eusebius's Historia Ecclesiastica, survives and is housed in St John's College, Cambridge.

Adjacent to the abbey ruins is the parish church (Church in Wales) of St Thomas, which appears successively to have occupied at least three sites close to or within the abbey buildings. The present building is a respectable minor Victorian edifice and contains the Ogam Sagranus stone. St Dogmaels was once a marcher borough. George Owen of Henllys, in 1603, described it as one of five Pembrokeshire boroughs overseen by a portreeve.Owen, George, The Description of Penbrokshire by George Owen of Henllys Lord of Kemes, Henry Owen (Ed), London, 1892 The parish appeared (as Sct. Dogmels) on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. In the 1830s, the parish's population was 2,109, and fell into four areas: Cippyn, Abbey, Pant- y-groes and Bridgend. In 1832, boundary changes meant that a part of Pembrokeshire, including a part of St Dogmaels, was included in Cardiganshire. This was reversed by the Welsh Assembly in 2002. There are more than 30 listed buildings in the parish, including the parish church, the abbey and the mediaeval flour mill, Y Felin. In 2006, the village won the Wales Calor Village of the Year competition after beating Trefriw in the final.Calor Village of the Year Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists, stretching to include the community of Nevern.

He was \\"among the first black men to break the racial barrier by means of modern dance.\\"Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick, No Fixed Points: Dance in the Twentieth Century (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), 345. His work for the concert stage, especially Games (1951) and Rainbow Round My Shoulder (1959), has been the subject of widespread acclaim and critical attention. In addition, McKayle was the first black man to both direct and choreograph major Broadway musicals, including the Tony Award-winners Raisin (1973) and Sophisticated Ladies (1981), and he worked extensively in television and film.John Perpener, African-American Concert Dance: The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond ((Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2001), 193.Melanye P. White- Dixon, \\"McKayle, Donald,\\" in Selma Jeanne Cohen (ed.), International Encyclopedia of Dance, vol. 4 (New York: Oxford University Press 1998), 345. As a young man he appeared with some of the twentieth century's most important choreographers, including Martha Graham, Anna Sokolow, and Merce Cunningham, and in some of Broadway's landmark productions, including House of Flowers (1958) and West Side Story (1957), where he served for a time as the production's dance captain. A Tony Award and Emmy Award nominee, McKayle held an endowed chair for the last decades of his life in the Dance Department at UC Irvine, where he was the Claire Trevor Professor of Dance. He previously served on the faculties of Connecticut College, Sarah Lawrence College, and Bennington College. Early life and influences McKayle was born in New York City on July 6, 1930, and grew up in a racially mixed East Harlem community of African-American, Puerto Rican, and Jewish immigrants.Gay Morris, A Game for Dancers: Performing Modernism in the Postwar Years, 1945‚Äì1960 (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 2006), 147‚Äì165. He was the second child of a middle class, immigrant family of Jamaican descent.Elisa Davis, Transcending Boundaries?

His father worked as a maintenance man at the Copacabana nightclub before becoming a mechanic while his mother worked as a medical assistant. Growing up in an integrated neighborhood shaped McKayle's understanding of the social issues and racial prejudices in America during a time when racism and segregation was commonplace. McKayle was also influenced by his parents' liberal and activist lifestyles. He was exposed to social dance and the exuberant social atmosphere of the West Indian parties his parents attended.Donald McKayle: Heartbeats of a Dance Maker (Hightstown, NJ : Princeton Book Co., 2002). McKayle's educational experience attending a public school outside of the Harlem community also heightened his social awareness. His political beliefs were influenced by his high school English teacher Lewis Allen, also known as Abel Meeropol, author of the poem \\"Strange Fruit\\". And in high school McKayle joined the Frederick Douglass Society to learn more about African-American history and heritage, a subject that was not taught in school.Elisa Davis, Transcending Boundaries, 5‚Äì6. But it was an inspiring performance by Pearl Primus that sparked McKayle's interest in dance as a teenager. Despite his lack of formal dance training, McKayle auditioned and was granted a scholarship for the New Dance Group in 1947.Gay Morris, A Game, 152. McKayle was ambitious and eagerly took advantage of the company's formal training in modern, ballet, tap, Afro-Caribbean, Hindu, and Haitian dance forms. His instructors included modern dance pioneer Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Anna Sokolow and Karol Shook.Gregg Lizenbery, \\"McKayle, Donald,\\" in Taryn Benbow-Pfalzgraf (ed.), International Dictionary of Modern Dance (Detroit: St.James Press, 1998), 526. His noted mentors are Sophie Maslow, Jane Dudley, William Bales, and his first teacher Jean Erdman.Donald McKayle: Heartbeats. Other instructors include Mary Anthony, Pearl Primus, Jean-Leon Destine, Hadassah, and Paul Draper.Gregg Lizenbery, McKayle, 526. In less than a year, McKayle was choreographing his own complete concert dance pieces. Early choreography McKayle with the Jefferson Dancers, 1992 McKayle's early works explores the universal human condition and reflect themes of unity and community through expressive and emotional movement.Elisa Davis, Transcending, 9. At the age of 18 McKayle premiered his solo piece, Saturday's Child (1948), choreographed to the poetry of Countee Cullen. This piece depicted the reality of poverty and the suffering of the homeless. According to McKayle's autobiography, he was inducted into the Committee for the Negro in the Arts due to the repeated performance and high visibility of this piece. This organization was composed of Harlem Renaissance, leaders including Langston Hughes, and up-and-coming African-American artists and performers such as Harry Belafonte. The Committee was dedicated to changing the prejudices and widespread racism that made it difficult for African Americans in the performing arts.Gay Morris,A Game, 151. The American dance classic Games (1951) was McKayle's first major work and was responsible for launching his dance career. He combines rhythms, chants, play songs and street games to create a childhood scene dedicated solely to playtime. Inspired by childhood memories, Games explores themes of poverty and discrimination in shaping the lives and attitudes of the youth.Gay Morris,A Game, 155. Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder (1959) is also considered a masterwork that incorporates Africanist movement, rhythms, and music. Prisoners of a chain gang move powerfully across the stage creating an expressive narrative through abstract movements of physical labor. McKayle alludes to African-American dreams of freedom and equality through this image of bondage and slavery. The racial injustice and violence of the piece concludes as a chain gang member is shot and killed.Gay Morris,A Game, 155‚Äì157. Broadway/ TV/ Film McKayle's early works attracted the interest of Broadway stars, audiences, and Hollywood films. Golden Boy (1964) was his first Broadway production, followed by I'm Solomon (1969) and Dr. Jazz (1975). McKayle was the director and choreographer of Raisin (1974) and was awarded a Tony for the best musical. He was responsible for the entire concept, staging and choreography of Sophisticated Ladies (1981), which has won numerous awards. Creating choreography for celebrities led to his appearances in popular television shows such as The Bill Cosby Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. McKayle's work was broadcast on every major TV network from 1951 to 1985. He has also choreographed for films including Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1970), The Great White Hope (1972), and The Minstrel Man (1976). = Biographical Documentary film = Donald McKayle : Heartbeats of a Dancemaker Film by Joy Chong-Stannard; Victoria N Kneubuhl; Gregg Lizenbery; Marilyn Cristofori.

It began operation on October 19, 2004, as the second journal of the Public Library of Science (PLOS), a non-profit open access publisher. All content in PLOS Medicine is published under the Creative Commons \\"by-attribution\\" license. To fund the journal, the publication's business model requires in most cases that authors pay publication fees. The journal was published online and in a printed format until 2005 and is now only published online. The journal's acting chief editor is Clare Stone, who replaced the previous chief editor, Larry Peiperl, in 2018.  Aims and scope  The journal's initial aim was to provide an open-access alternative to existing top tier journals such as The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet and has concentrated on publishing papers on diseases that take the greatest toll on health globally. In 2009 the journal reaffirmed its scope and noted that it would use an evidence-based approach to give highest priority to studies on diseases and risk factors that cause the greatest burden worldwide. From the outset the journal noted that it would not be part of \\"the cycle of dependency that has formed between journals and the pharmaceutical industry\\". The journal does not publish advertisements for pharmaceutical products or medical devices and the journal's open-access license means that it cannot benefit from exclusive reprint sales.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in Index Medicus/MEDLINE/PubMed, the Science Citation Index Expanded, Current Contents/Clinical Medicine, and BIOSIS Previews. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal had a 2014 impact factor of 14.429, ranking it 7th out of 153 journals in the category \\"Medicine, General & Internal\\".  Notable articles  = Why Most Published Research Findings Are False (2005) = In 2005 PLOS Medicine published an essay by John P. A. Ioannidis entitled \\"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False\\". The essay used a simulation approach to demonstrate that for most study designs and settings it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true due to inherent biases in the way that modern science is conducted. This paper has met much approval, though Goodman and Greenland criticized it in a short comment and a longer analysis. Ioannidis has answered this critique. A profile of Ioannidis' work including a discussion of his 2005 paper appeared in the November 2010 issue of The Atlantic. = Male Circumcision for Reduction of HIV Infection Risk (2005) = The first randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of male circumcision on female to male HIV transmission was published in 2005 by Bertran Auvert and colleagues in PLOS Medicine. The Lancet a leading medical journal rejected this paper because of ethical concerns around how the trial was conducted before PLOS Medicine accepted it. The trial was stopped early by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board who advised the investigators to interrupt the trial and offer circumcision to the control group. The trial estimated that male circumcision provided protection of 60% (95% CI: 32%‚Äì76%) for female to male HIV transmission. The results of this trial along with two others led to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessing the evidence for male circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. The WHO and UNAIDS subsequently issued recommendations concerning male circumcision and HIV/AIDS including suggestions for government strategic plans, advocacy challenges and exploring the role of new technologies for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) such as Prepex and other medical devices. A number of Ministries of Health along with key stakeholders have committed to scaling up VMMC for HIV prevention in Southern and Eastern Africa. = Wyeth Ghostwriting Scandal (2009/2010) = In July 2009, a United States federal court decision resulted in the release of approximately 1500 documents detailing how articles highlighting specific marketing messages written by unattributed writers, but \\"authored\\" by academics, are strategically placed in the medical literature ‚Äì a practice known as ghostwriting. To release these documents, PLOS Medicine, represented by the public interest law firm Public Justice, and The New York Times, acted as \\"intervenors\\" in litigation against menopausal hormone manufacturers by women who developed breast cancer while taking hormones. PLOS Medicine argued that sealed documents identified during the discovery process for the court case, which demonstrated the practice of ghostwriting, should be made available to the public. The documents were initially made publicly available on the PLOS Medicine website but they are now available as part of the Drug Industry Documents Archive at the University of California, San Francisco. In 2010 PLOS Medicine published the first academic analysis of the documents by Adriane Fugh-Berman. Her article revealed that the pharmaceutical company Wyeth used ghostwritten articles to mitigate the perceived risks of breast cancer associated with menopausal hormone therapy (HT), to defend the unsupported cardiovascular ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù of HT, and to promote off-label, unproven uses of HT such as the prevention of dementia, Parkinson's disease, vision problems, and wrinkles. The article was subsequently covered by The Guardian. = Tamiflu clinical trial data sharing (2012) = In April 2012 PLOS Medicine published an article by three researchers who were involved in ongoing updates of a Cochrane Collaboration review of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza, describing their experience of trying to gain access to clinical study reports for the antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir) from the drug's manufacturer Roche. The article outlined the need for access to all clinical trial data held by pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and detailed reasons given by Roche for not sharing data on Tamiflu. In a commissioned perspective article published in the same issue of PLOS Medicine, regulators from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other national regulatory bodies outlined a shift in their stance on access to clinical trial data but also highlighted challenges that would need to be overcome. The regulators noted, \\"[w]e consider it neither desirable nor realistic to maintain the status quo of limited availability of regulatory trials data\\" and concluded, \\"[w]e welcome debate on these issues, and remain confident that satisfactory solutions can be found to make complete trial data available in a way that will be in the best interest of public health\\". The article marked a move towards the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data and led to the EMA holding a workshop to establish how this could be done. At the workshop Guido Rasi, the EMA's Executive Director, announced \\"[t]oday represents the first step in delivering our vision. We are not here to decide if we will publish clinical-trial data, only how. We need to do this in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the whole system\\". PLOS Medicine's chief editor, Virginia Barbour, was an invited speaker at the workshop representing the media.

In later life he achieved stardom as the pompous ex-serviceman Percy Sugden in Granada Television's long-running soap opera Coronation Street. Biography  Waddington played the ukulele and became a member of a group called the Blue Pencils, recruited to entertain forces during the Second World War. After the war \\"Waddy\\" became a comedian, often appearing on the same bill as Jill Summers, who would eventually play Phyllis Pearce, Percy Sugden's foil in Granada TV's Coronation Street. In 1955 Bill was chosen for the Royal Variety Performance, and when American stars such as Frankie Laine, Lena Horne, Billy Daniels and Dorothy Lamour toured Britain he was the opening comedian in their shows. His agent was Lew Grade. Waddington appeared in more than 800 variety and comedy programmes on radio, and made his mark on television, starring with Margaret Lockwood as early as 1946. In the 1970s he enjoyed a stage partnership with Sid James, only ended by James's death in 1976. He appeared as a magician in Victoria Wood's first play Talent for Granada Television in 1979. Bill played his best known role of cantankerous pensioner Percy Sugden on Coronation Street from August 1983 until quitting the serial in October 1997. He had previously appeared in a single episode in June 1978 as Eric Summers and later played the minor role of Arnold Swain's best man George Turner in three episodes of the series during 1980. Music  In 1995, he released a cover of \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\" along with the rest of the Coronation Street cast, the single reaching No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart. He had previously released his own single \\"Don't Forget The Old Folks at Christmas\\" in 1986 but this failed to chart. Personal life and death  In later life, Waddington became a brother-in-law to the Chuckle Brothers when he married their sister Sheila Elliott. Bill Waddington died at Rotherham General Hospital on the morning of 9 September 2000 at the age of 84 after a fifty-year acting career. He had been suffering from Parkinson's disease and had two daughters. He is buried at St. Peter's graveyard at Bradfield Green, near Crewe.

She is similar to Eve in the Christian tradition.  Kaliyan  As soon as Kaliyan was born in an inverted form he was presented to Shiva. The Devas asked him to request boons from Shiva. Kaliyan replied, \\"Will that fellow, by wearing a snake on his neck, and ash on forehead and seated on a skin of elephant, be ready to give me what I need?\\" With this, Kaliyan insulted Shiva. By hearing this the devas asked him, \\"Don‚Äôt insult him. He was the one who created the world and offered food for every life in the world. He was the light that was not even visible to Mayon and Nathan. (This is an allusion to when Shiva appeared in a form of endless lingam of light when there was a dispute between Mayon and Nathan as to who is the greatest and in order to subdue their pride.) He will be able to give what you claim.\\" Then Kaliyan asked, \\"If he was the one who created the world ask him to create a beautiful girl for me.\\"  Appearance of Kalicchi  Shiva queried, \\"Shall I create a girl who was in equal strength with you?\\" For this was how Kaliyan defined how his wife should be. She must be more beautiful than I am, but of half the strength. Her mouth should be beautiful. She must have breasts like palmyra nuts. Her face, vulva, eyes and vision should be beautiful. Her hips should be narrow. Her hands, legs, teeth and her walk should be beautiful. Also her thigh should be beautiful. The front of her chest and the back of her head must be beautiful. She must dress beautifully. She must be created with a sweet fragrance. She must be with a great beauty so that the Trimurti should be lascivious with her.  Birth of Kalicchi  By hearing this Shiva asked Parvathi what to do. She replied, \\"As per his deed create him a woman by take a rib-bone from him. Don‚Äôt delay.\\" Then as per the request of Kaliyan, Shiva decided to create Kalicchi. Shiva‚Äôs vision falls keely on a left rib-bone of Kaliyan, and he in his mind thinks Manmadan. The rib-bone transformed into a woman, exactly of Kaliyan's description. Her appearance created more lust in the mind of Kaliyan. As soon as Kaliyan saw her he ran and kissed her. He kept her by his side. He only cared about her and forgot all about Shiva.  See also  *Kaliyan *Ayyavazhi mythology References * G.

It is the second church on this location, the previous church was a post church (a church with earth-bound posts standing directly on the ground). There are a number of graves under the church, including those of children. It was rebuilt around 1820. In 1857 the old rooftop was taken down and a new tower was built on a reinforced construction over the ceiling. Renovation of the church was completed in 1979. Excavation uncovered artifacts including 357 coins. The oldest of the coins dates back to a period 1042‚Äì1047.

Geologically, the bed of the river and plunge pool is shale; on top of that is sandstone and the top layer is carboniferous limestone.

Access behind the falls is now prohibited.  Hardraw Scar  Hardraw Scar () is a limestone gorge located behind the Green Dragon inn at Hardraw near Hawes in the Yorkshire Dales. It is a natural amphitheatre and in September is the site of an annual brass band entertainment contest. The contest attracts bands from all over the North of England and is a popular event amongst players and audiences alike. The gorge is situated alongside the Pennine Way and also has an impressive waterfall, Hardraw Force, at the far end. Access to the gorge is via the nearby public house. In 1899, a great flood came racing over the waterfall and into Hardraw itself, ruining buildings and uprooting coffins from the graveyard. The lip of the waterfall was demolished by the force of the water and the landowner at the time (Lord Wharncliffe) got his estate manager to repair the lip and it is now held together at the top by metal stakes.  Hardraw Force and popular culture  Hardraw Force, 2004 Both J. M. W. Turner and William Wordsworth have visited the waterfall and both men stayed at the Green Dragon Inn. The falls were used as a location in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, in the scene where Maid Marian catches Robin Hood bathing under a waterfall. Hardraw Force is the setting for a brass band competition held annually on the second Sunday in September. The competition was first held in the falls' natural amphitheatre in 1884 when six bands took part; the competition lapsed in 1927 but was revived in 1976 and has gone from strength to strength since. In recent years two other musical events have started up at the falls: the Hawdraw Bash is a Folk Rock concert in early July and the Hardraw Gathering is a three-day festival of traditional music at the end of July.

It was invented in the early 18th century by Christopher Pinchbeck, a London clock and watchmaker. Since gold was only sold in 18-carat quality at that time, the development of pinchbeck allowed ordinary people to buy gold 'effect' jewellery on a budget. The inventor allegedly made pinchbeck jewellery clearly labelled as such. Pinchbeck jewellery was used in places like stagecoaches where there was a risk of theft. The original Pinchbeck was made by Christopher Pinchbeck and his decedents until the 1830s. Later dishonest jewellers passed pinchbeck off as gold; over the years it came to mean a cheap and tawdry imitation of gold.

It can alternatively be spelt Hoogli or Hugli. The district is named after the Hooghly River. The headquarters of the district are at Hooghly- Chinsura (Chuchura). There are four subdivisions: Chinsura Sadar, Serampore, Chandannagar, and Arambag.  History  The district of Hooghly derived its name from the town of Hooghly on the west bank of the Hugli River about 40 km north of Kolkata. This town was a major river port for trade in India before colonialism. The district has thousands of years of rich heritage as part of the Bengali kingdom of Bhurshut. The first European to reach this area was the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama. In 1536 Portuguese traders obtained a permit from Sultan Mahmud Shah to trade in this area. In those days the Hooghly River was the main route for transportation and Hooghly served as an excellent trading port. Within a few decades, the town of Hooghly turned into a major commercial centre and the largest port in Bengal. Later in 1579‚Äì80 Mughal emperor Akbar gave permission to a Portuguese captain Pedro Tavares to establish a city anywhere in the Bengal province. They chose Hooghly, and it became the first European settlement in Bengal. In 1599 the Portuguese traders built a convent and a church in Bandel. This is the first Christian church in Bengal known as ‚ÄòBandel Church‚Äô today. The Portuguese traders started slave trading, robbery and converting natives into Christians by pressure. At one point they stopped paying taxes to the Mughal Empire. As a result, Emperor Shah Jahan ordered the then-ruler of Bengal province, Qasim Khan Juvayni, to block the city of Hooghly. This led to a war in which the Portuguese were defeated. Among other European powers that came to Hooghly were the Dutch, the Danish, the British, the French, the Belgians and the Germans. Dutch traders centred their activities in the town Chuchura which is south of Hooghly. Chandannagar became the base of the French and the city remained under their control from 1816 to 1950. Similarly, the Danish establishment in settlement in Serampore (1755). All these towns are on the west bank of the Hooghly River and served as ports. Among these European countries, the British ultimately became most powerful. Chinsurah N.S Road A village in Hooghly Initially the British were based in and around the city of Hooghly like traders from other countries. In 1690 Job Charnock decided to shift the British trading centre from Hooghly-Chinsura to Calcutta. The reason behind this decision was the strategically safe location of Calcutta and its proximity to the Bay of Bengal. As a result, trade and commerce in the Bengal province shifted from the town of Hooghly to Calcutta. Hooghly lost its importance as Calcutta prospered. After the Battle of Buxar this region was brought under direct British rule until India's independence in 1947. After independence, this district merged into the state of West Bengal. Though the city of Hooghly is more than 500 years old, the district of Hooghly was formed in 1795 with the city of Hooghly as its headquarters. Later the headquarters shifted to the town of Chuchura. In 1843 the Howrah district was created from the southern portion of this district. And in 1872, the south-west portion of this district was merged into the Medinipur district. The last change in area occurred in 1966.  Tarakeswar Temple  The Taraknath temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva worshiped as Taraknath, is a major pilgrimage spot in the town of Tarakeswar. Built in 1729, the temple is an ‚Äòatchala‚Äô structure of Bengal temple architecture with a ‚Äònatmandir‚Äô in front. Close by are the shrines of Kali and Lakshmi Narayan. Dudhpukur, a tank to the north of the Shiva temple is believed to fulfil the prayers of those taking a dip in it. Pilgrims visit the temple throughout the year, especially on Mondays.

It is situated in the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal. History Ringebu Stave Church spire Built in the first quarter of the 13th century, the church is first mentioned in 1270, although it could be older. It was rebuilt into a cruciform church around 1630 by master-builder Werner Olsen (ca. 1600‚Äì1682) and in 1631 received its characteristic red tower. Of the original church only the nave remains, with free-standing posts in the inner area. Later restoration in 1921 brought it back a bit closer to its original shape. The church was painted in 1717, but only the lower half of the walls were done, since the ceiling at that time was lower. At one point the church was painted white within, but during the restoration work by Ragnvald Einbu in 1921 the church interior was restored to its original colouring. There have been some archaeological surveys of the ground under the church. The last one took place in 1980‚Äì1981. These surveys have resulted in the finding of about 900 old coins, mostly from medieval times, especially from the period 1217‚Äì1263. Post holes from an older church have also been found. The post church is assumed to be a forerunner of the stave church. The earth-bound posts of these churches were planted directly into the ground, and therefore they were exposed to humidity which caused them to rot over the years.

The creation of a patent pool can save patentees and licensees time and money, and, in case of blocking patents, it may also be the only reasonable method for making the invention available to the public.\\"The pooling of the patents, licensing all patents in the pool collectively, and sharing royalties is not necessarily an antitrust violation. In a case involving blocking patents such an arrangement is the only reasonable method for making the invention available to the public.\\" - International Mfg. Co. v. Landon, 336 F.2d 723, 729 (9th Cir. 1964) Competition law issues are usually important when a large consortium is formed. History One of the first patent pools, Sewing Machine Combination, was formed in 1856, by sewing machine manufacturers Grover, Baker, Singer, and Wheeler & Wilson, all accusing the others of patent infringement. They met in Albany, New York to pursue their suits. Orlando B. Potter, a lawyer and president of the Grover and Baker Company, proposed that, rather than sue their profits out of existence, they pool their patents (See also: Isaac Singer/I. M. Singer & Co). In 1917, the two major patent holders for airplanes, the Wright Company and the Curtiss Company, had effectively blocked the building of new airplanes, which were desperately needed as the United States was entering World War I. The U.S. government, as a result of a recommendation of a committee formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, pressured the industry to form a patent pool, the Manufacturer's Aircraft Association. In a more modern example, in August 2005, a patent pool was formed by about 20 companies active in the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) domain. The RFID Consortium picked Via Licensing to administer its patent pool in September 2006. Risk mitigation As in these examples many industries could not function without patent pools since the coordination costs (risk, negotiation, etc.) would otherwise be too high. Patent pools are only one example of cases where members of an otherwise competitive industry join in common cause to create some resource that is to their collective benefit. For example, the insurance industry pools claims data to collectively reduce risk; the catalog sales industry pools sales data to better model their customers; the auto industry collaborates to standardize components; and in the software industry some companies actively contribute to open-source projects. Patent pools do not eliminate risk, they only temper it. Patent holders (including other patent pools) outside the pool can still create cost and risk for the industry. While it is rare for a patent pool to indemnify licensees, a pool does help to assure a common interest will emerge should one member be accused of infringement by a third party. Flaws in the design of the pool's governance can create the risk that one member can break the common cause of the group. Examples of well-known such cases include the MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.264 video coding standards, and the DVD6C pool. The MPEG-2 patent pool has also been criticized because by 2015 more than 90% of the MPEG-2 patents will have expired but as long as there are one or more active patents in the MPEG-2 patent pool in either the country of manufacture or the country of sale the MPEG-2 license agreement requires that licensees pay a license fee that does not change based on the number of patents that have expired. National jurisdictions = United States = Since the 1990s, patent pools have been viewed by U.S. regulatory authorities in a positive light. In 1995, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released the ‚ÄúAntitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property‚ÄùAntitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property. U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, April 6, 1995. which stated that the pooling of patents may have ‚Äú‚Ä¶pro-competitive benefits‚Äù.Tirole, Josh Lerner and Jean. \\"Public Policy toward Patent Pools.\\" Innovation Policy and the Economy , 2007: 157-186. The Antitrust Division of the DOJ later issued a letter in support of the MPEG-2 pool. However, stipulations exist to ensure pools do not function anti-competitively. As required by the DOJ, patents in the pool must be essential, non-substitutable and the owners must maintain the right to individually license their patents. In addition, the DOJ may monitor the royalty rates collected by the firm.

The brown, wooden church was built in a long church style during the 12th century by an unknown architect. The church seats about 100 people. History R√∏dven Stave Church is no longer actively used and it has been owned by the Society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments since 1907, when a new R√∏dven Church was built next to this church building. Although it is a museum, it does have one worship service each year on Olsok, the eve of St. Olav's Day. According to a notice board outside the church, the nave and south porch date from the 14th century, the crucifix dates from the 13th century and the pulpit from 1712. Inside are an ornately carved crucifix and pulpit. The church is a M√∏re-type stave church due to its structure and the exterior support posts that brace the walls. During an archeological survey in 1962‚Äì1963, marks were found from posts for an older building on the same location.

Scott based his character on Andrew Gemmels, a real beggar he had known in his childhood. Along with Jonathan Oldbuck, the novel's title- character, Ochiltree is widely seen as one of Scott's finest creations.  His character  Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the novel's title, says that Ochiltree \\"has been soldier, ballad-singer, travelling tinker, and is now a beggar‚Ä¶a sort of privileged nuisance ‚Äì one of the last specimens of the old- fashioned Scottish mendicant, who kept his rounds within a particular space, and was the news-carrier, the minstrel, and sometimes the historian of the district\\". Ochiltree's great love and knowledge of the old ballads and traditions echoes Oldbuck's more scholarly antiquarian lore. They have a mutual respect and liking for each other, and between them they solve the other characters' problems and bring the novel to a happy resolution, but on the way they sometimes clash comically, Oldbuck's antiquarian fantasy and self-delusion being punctured by Ochiltree's realism and good sense. Both characters are presented as being sticklers for exactness, Ochiltree being remarkable for the accuracy of the local news he brings and for his insistence on old traditions being remembered correctly. In the first half of the novel the two are differentiated by Ochiltree's greater practical effectiveness in the help he brings to others. He could be described as a Cynic in the tradition of Diogenes, and he is at odds with modern commercial society in his traditional reliance on the support of the community at large rather than on any single patron. His overall function in the Fairport community is to bind it together.  The originals of Ochiltree  The gravestone of Andrew Gemmels The writer W. S. Crockett considered Edie Ochiltree to be more firmly based on a real-life model than any other of Scott's characters, Jonathan Oldbuck alone excepted. His original was one Andrew Gemmels, a beggar whom Scott, then a boy in Kelso, had often met. Gemmels came from the parish of Old Cumnock in Ayrshire, and he was, like Ochiltree, an army veteran who had fought at the battle of Fontenoy. Scott described him in his introduction to the 1829 edition of The Antiquary as \\"a remarkably fine old figure, very tall, and maintaining a soldierlike or military manner and address. His features were intelligent, with a powerful expression of sarcasm‚Ä¶It was some fear of Andrew's satire, as much as a feeling of kindness or charity, which secured him the general good reception which he enjoyed everywhere.\\" He prospered better than most beggars, and died, by his own reckoning, at the age of 105, leaving a small fortune to a nephew. Scott's son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart pointed out another model for Ochiltree in an anecdote concerning Sir John Clerk, 1st Bt., which was certainly the inspiration for an episode in chapter 4 of The Antiquary: > [T]he old Baronet carried some English Virtuosos to see a supposed Roman > camp; and on his exclaiming at a particular spot, \\"This I take to have been > the Praetorium\\", a herdsman, who stood by, answered, \\"Praetorium here, > Praetorium there, I made it wi' a flaughter-spade.\\" Some critics have claimed that Scott's own character can be discerned in Ochiltree, particularly in the capacity to stoically accept personal misfortunes which supported Scott in his later years.  Critical assessment  At least five reviews of The Antiquary, in the Quarterly Review, the Edinburgh Review, the Monthly Review, the Critical Review, and the British Lady's Magazine, agreed in considering Ochiltree a male version of Scott's eldritch gypsy Meg Merrilies in his previous novel Guy Mannering. The Quarterly 's reviewer, John Wilson Croker, thought the imitation improved on the original, while the Monthly thought him unforgettable and sometimes sublime, but Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh could give him only qualified approval. The Augustan Review could not accept the idea of a mere beggar expressing moral eloquence and poetic feeling, and it detected in this the influence of Wordsworth. William H. Prescott in the North American Review believed that such characters as Edie Ochiltree showed Scott to have a \\"worldly, good-natured shrewdness\\" surpassing that of Shakespeare himself. Later in the century a critic in the London Quarterly thought he ranked among \\"the most complete and remarkable characters created by Scott or any other man\\", and this opinion was echoed by many 20th-century commentators. Andrew Lang considered the treatment of the character of Ochiltree was an example of Scott's art at its very best. For Charles Harold Herford he was a great creation drawn from the heart of Scottish life. The scholar Aubrey Bell cited Ochiltree in support of his and Georg Brandes' view that Scott was one of the finest drawers of character ever to have lived. John Sutherland was unconvinced by Ochiltree's readiness to put the welfare of his betters before his own, and interpreted this as a symptom of Scott's nostalgia for the national solidarity of Britain in the 1790s, when men of all classes felt threatened by Revolutionary France. Scott's biographer Edgar Johnson acknowledged that some readers find the scenes between Ochiltree and the fraudster Herman Dousterswivel too redolent of low comedy. He himself doubted if Ochiltree's eloquence was entirely realistic in a beggar, and he also noted his tendency to be conveniently present whenever the plot needs to be moved forward. The academic Robin Mayhead however disagreed, arguing that The Antiquary does not have the conventions of the realist school; for him Ochiltree functions as an embodiment of dependability, necessary to offset the faults and fallibilities of other characters in the novel. This, rather than the attraction of Ochiltree's \\"racy vernacular\\", led Mayhead to declare himself as great an admirer as any of this character. A. N. Wilson wrote about Ochiltree's \\"strangely moving (though so stagey) wisdom\\". John Buchan noted that he was depicted with \\"minute realism\\" as a typical Scottish beggar, and yet was sometimes able \\"to speak words which, though wholly in character, are yet part of the world's poetry\\". He approvingly quoted another critic as saying that Ochiltree is the most Shakespearean figure outside Shakespeare. Hesketh Pearson also compared Ochiltree with Shakespeare's creations, and found him more realistic than any of them, and more humorous than all but Falstaff. He was, for Pearson, Scott's first great character. Henry A. Beers likewise numbered him among Scott's greatest creations, one of those who \\"brought into play his knowledge of men, his humour, observation of life, and insight into Scotch human nature\\".  Legacy  When the Scott Monument was erected in Edinburgh in the 1840s, its many figurative statues included one of Edie Ochiltree, executed by George Anderson Lawson. It shows Ochiltree with a straggly beard, a broad-brimmed hat, and a badge on his shoulder identifying him as a licensed beggar. The GCR Class 11F steam locomotive Edie Ochiltree was built for the London and North Eastern Railway in September 1924, and remained in service on the LNER and on its successor British Railways until August 1959.

It was published in 1999 by Faber and Faber. Plot summary The time is November 1899 through February 1900; the place is Ladysmith, a small railway town in the British Colony of Natal near ths border with the Boer Republics. The Boers have surprised the world with initial victories over the British Army and have now laid siege to Ladysmith. As they shell the town from surrounding hills, people die, disease is rampant, structures collapse, starvation looms, there is panic about enemy agents and yet the British muddle through. The setting of Giles Foden‚Äôs novel is historically accurate, and a number of historical figures appear as characters; for example, the Boers arrest a young reporter named Winston Churchill as he struggles to reach the besieged town, and an Indian lawyer- turned-medical volunteer named Mohandas K. Gandhi becomes more committed to his philosophy of active non-violence. The core of Ladysmith is a fictionalised version of a love story that Giles Foden found in the letters of his great-grandfather, who was a British soldier at Ladysmith. Bella, the Irish hotelkeeper's daughter, falls in love, first, with a British soldier; and later with a Portuguese barber, thus defying convention and rebelling against her father.

History  Built in 1192, the Torpo Stave Church is the oldest building within the valley and traditional district of Hallingdal. The church was dedicated to Saint Margareta. The stave church was purchased by the municipality in 1875. It was initially planned to expand it with an annex to the east, but in 1879 it was decided instead to modernize the interior with new ceiling and gallery. Following protest from the Ancient Monuments Society (Fortidsminneforeningen), the municipality decided to build a new church (Torpo Kyrkje) on the adjacent property.

During the Hundred Years War, the town was liberated from the English by French forces led by Joan of Arc on December 25, 1429. A great fire ravaged the town in 1559.

Only one genus (Polemonium) is found in Europe, and two (Phlox and Polemonium) in Asia, where they are confined to cool temperate to arctic regions; both genera also occur more widely in North America, suggesting relatively recent colonization of the Old World from North America. The family can be distinguished from most other eudicot families by the ovary made up of three fused carpels (usually with three chambers, but one chamber in some species). The members of the family have five sepals, five petals fused, and five stamens that alternate with the lobes of the corolla. For decades, most sources used a classification of the family published by Grant in 1959, but new evidence, including molecular phylogeny, veins of the corolla, pollen, and the flavonoids present, have led to reclassifications, such as the 1998 classification by Grant. It recognizes two subfamilies. The subfamily Cobaeoideae is tropical/subtropical and composed of six genera organized into five tribes. The subfamily Polemonioideae consists of 13 temperate genera. Grant divides it into three tribes, but with the disclaimer that it is not clear what the correct division is and that the genus classifications may be more useful in this subfamily.

The tunnel links Darling Harbour on the western fringe of the central business district to Rushcutters Bay in the Eastern Suburbs. The tunnel is actually two distinct tunnels and they largely follow a route underneath William Street and Park or Bathurst Streets, depending on whether it is eastbound or westbound. The tunnel is owned by the NSW Government and is operated by Transurban, who are licensed to operate the roadway until 2035. In early 2002, a year before construction began, transport planner Michelle Zeibots was quoted in local newspapers saying the tunnel would not reach its traffic targets. In December 2006, the tollway became insolvent due to low traffic volumes, accumulating debts of over A$500 million. On 20 June 2007, Leighton Contractors and investment bank ABN AMRO were chosen as preferred purchasers of the Cross City Tunnel Group for $700 million. In June 2014, the tunnel was sold again, this time to Transurban, after the new owners since 2007 went into voluntary administration. Design The tunnel in fact comprises two road tunnels ‚Äì one eastbound and one westbound ‚Äì each with two traffic lanes, in addition to a third small ventilation tunnel. The Cross City Tunnel also links with the Eastern Distributor, enabling vehicles travelling from the West to travel to the Airport and Southern Suburbs. From the Eastern Distributor Northbound, motorists have the ability to connect to the Cross City Tunnel Westbound, avoiding the CBD once again. The tunnel was Sydney's first completely electronic tollway requiring the driver to have an electronic tolling tag installed in their car or register for an electronic pass (for casual or less frequent users). History Sydney's Cross City Tunnel was predicted to fail before construction even began. In February 2002, a year before tunnelling commenced and four years before it ultimately fell into receivership due to low traffic volumes, Sydney traffic planner Michelle Zeibots told local media that the tunnel was incapable of carrying the volume of cars that the Transport Minister, Carl Scully had predicted. She said it was \\"physically impossible\\" for the tunnel to carry the predicted 95,000 cars each day. While the NRMA was enthusiastic about building the new motorway, Dr Zeibots was scathing. \\"It's not a serious transport project,\\" she said at the time. \\"The inputs and outputs just don't add up.\\" Despite the warnings of a traffic shortfall, in 2002, the government of Bob Carr awarded Cross City Motorways the contract to build, own and operate an east‚Äìwest tunnel underneath the Sydney CBD. Construction work for the Cross City Tunnel commenced in January 2003, and the tunnel was originally scheduled to open in October 2005. In April 2005 the NSW government announced that the tunnel would open four months early on 12 June 2005. The opening day was subsequently postponed due to detailed commissioning works, with the official opening going ahead on Sunday 28 August 2005. The tunnel was opened by the Premier of New South Wales, Morris Iemma, using the same pair of scissors used to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel in 1992 and the Anzac Bridge in 1995. Prior to the vehicular opening there was a charity walk-through, as is customary for new roadways in Sydney, which attracted a large number of public visitors. The first traffic passed through the tunnel late on 28 August. Later a three-week toll-free period was announced by the operators. At the same time, the operators announced a freeze on toll increases for twelve months and the fee for casual (non-electronic tag) users was waived. In February 2006, media speculation of a \\"buy-out\\" by the New South Wales government began. The rumoured price would exceed A$1 billion while the tunnel only cost A$680 million to build. The government stated no discussions had taken place, and the Cross City Tunnel Consortium stated that they were not considering selling the tunnel and were \\"in for the long haul\\". At the time the average trips per day was approximately 30,000. This was shortly followed by a report from the NSW Upper House committee headed by MP Fred Nile recommending that the toll be reduced, and surface road closures reversed. While the recommendations could not be enforced, the Cross City Tunnel Consortium did consult with the government before announcing a discount to the toll, as well as other changes on 3 March 2006. Specifically, the Consortium announced that the toll would be halved to $1.78 for three months, that some planned road closures would not be pursued, and that some existing road closures would be reversed. Two days prior to the end of the half-price toll period, the Premier of NSW, Morris Iemma, ended negotiations with the Cross City Tunnel Consortium without an agreement, announcing the immediate reversal of some road closures, contrary to the contract. In November 2006, it was reported that the motorway was in financial difficulties, and that additional equity would be required from the tunnel's investors in order to avoid placing the tunnel in administration. At the same time, it was suggested that traffic volumes of between 60,000 and 90,000 per day were needed in order for the consortium to meet the tunnel interest payments. The NSW government responded to the reports by indicating that it would not buy out the tunnel, nor assist in its financing. On 27 December 2006, a syndicate of 16 Australian and International banks appointed the insolvency firm KordaMentha as receivers and managers for Cross City Motorway Limited after the project accrued debts exceeding A$560 million. The tunnel was later sold. On 13 September 2013 the new owner of the tunnel placed itself in voluntary administration, saying that it was unable to refinance its debt due to action by the New South Wales government to claim $64 million in stamp duty on the original sale. Transurban purchased the tunnel from the managers and receivers in June 2014 for approximately $475 million. Financing and ownership The A$680 million tunnel was originally financed by a combination of international equity and both locally and internationally sourced debt. Equity of $220 million was provided by three international companies, Cheung Kong Infrastructure (50 percent), DB Capital Partners (30 percent) and Bilfinger Berger BOT (20 percent). The remaining $580 million was financed through a syndicate of Australian and international banks led by Westpac and Deutsche Bank. Usage There has been some controversy over the expected and actual usage of the tunnel during its initial operation. The number of vehicles travelling through the tunnel has been debated in the media, along with alleged discrepancies between the actual number of trips and the anticipated number of trips in the tunnel's financial projections. Tunnel operators indicated that they expected initial uptake of the tunnel to reach approximately 35,000 vehicles per day, increasing over its first year of operation to a projected 90,000 vehicles per day. Once documentation of the official projections was released, it was found that the operators projected daily traffic after six months at 85,352. Approximately one month after opening it was reported in the media that only 20,000 vehicles a day were using the tunnel, although the government and toll operators maintained that the average number of daily trips since opening was approximately 25,000. At the completion of the initial three-week toll free period, the tunnel operators announced that the daily tunnel usage had increased to 53,000 during that time. A few weeks after the toll had been reinstated, it was reported in the media that usage had dropped back to approximately 27,000, an improvement of 7,000 cars per day compared with usage prior to the toll free period. Following the toll-free period, the tunnel operator indicated that it would likely be two to three years before the tunnel reached its full potential. In March 2006, in the first few weeks after the tunnel operators announced a temporary halving of the toll, media reports indicated that usage had increased to approximately 33,000 per day. Criticisms There are a number of criticisms that have been made about the Cross City Tunnel (CCT), more so than for similar large capital works programs in Sydney, including the following: * Disruption to traffic in the CBD not using the tunnel: The CCT attracted significant media attention, as many of the diversions put in place on the streets above caused increased traffic congestion and motorist confusion. Some resentment regarding surface road changes was expressed in the media. Letters to the Editor The disruption that generated the most complaints was the reduction of William Street to one general lane, and one bus lane in each direction, that exacerbated traffic flow. The bus lanes were converted to T2 transit lanes. On 6 December 2005 the head of the CCT said under oath that the company would not seek compensation if some of the controversial road changes were undone; but on 7 December that decision was reversed. * Undisclosed contract conditions: It is generally thought that the NSW Government agreed to the lane reductions in William Street as part of the negotiations for the CCT contract. However, the government repeatedly refused to publicly table the contract, much to the dismay of the media and the NSW Auditor-General. A summary of the CCT contract was released, that contained details of additional possible road disruptions, with resultant increased traffic congestion for motorists not using the CCT. It was also revealed that 50 cents of the toll price is due to a $105 million payment that the operators had to make to the NSW Government for permission to build the tunnel. In late October 2005 after ongoing criticism, some contract terms were released to the public, but the government refused to release 3,000 pages of material. A few days after this, the head of the Roads and Traffic Authority was dismissed for failing to disclose an amendment to the contract, which allowed the toll to be increased by 15 cents. In November 2005, the ICAC was asked to investigate allegations that sensitive Cabinet documents were leaked to the CCT operator during negotiations. The ICAC found that the allegation was unsubstantiated. * Misleading signage: There were complaints in the media after the opening of the CCT about deceptive signage indicating the tunnel was the only route from Sydney eastern suburbs to cross Sydney Harbour (in particular, via the Sydney Harbour Tunnel). In response, the NRMA motoring group published a route outlining how to reach the harbour crossings while avoiding the CCT. * Toll applies in both directions: the toll for the CCT is charged in both directions, unlike other toll roads near the city centre, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and the Eastern Distributor, all of which only charge for travel in one direction. * Price of the toll: The price of the toll for a one-way trip is $4.32 with an E-tag, and $6.75 without an E-tag (westbound and eastbound) $1.87 with a tag when exiting on Sir John Young Crescent/Eastern Distributor, and $5.35 without. Some would say this is a high price for a short journey when a slightly slower but free alternative is available. Joe Tripodi, at the time Minister for Roads, pressured the CCT operators to reduce the toll, but admitted he cannot force them to do this. The CCT operators had previously ruled out a toll reduction. Additionally, the price of the toll is automatically increased by the CPI each quarter, whereas other tolls are usually increased less frequently, but in neat increments of 50 cents. * No cash payment, and higher price for drivers without an E-Tag: The CCT was the first cashless motorway in Sydney. Drivers who did not have an E-Tag and who used the tunnel had to phone the CCT operators or go the CCT website after their journey, and pay the toll, plus an additional $2.50 administration fee. Those who didn't do this received two warning letters, then a $130 fine. All other tolled roads/bridges in Sydney have subsequently adopted this model of operation. * Concerns about exhaust fumes from the tunnel: After opening, the CCT proved to be quite poorly ventilated for the expected number of vehicles, and even for the much lower number of vehicles actually using it. Currently air is released from the CCT via the single ventilation stack located between the existing Western Distributor viaducts above the eastern side of Darling Harbour. There is general unease in Sydney about exhaust stacks from any motorway, after reports in the media about people living near motorway exhaust stacks experiencing health problems. However, since the opening of the CCT there was almost no discussion of this topic, with most of the focus directed towards the issues listed above, together with general concerns regarding Public Private Partnerships (or PPPs). One of the tunnel's major shortcomings is the fact that traffic is forced straight onto suburban roads at both ends, creating additional traffic congestion at these locations. This is likely to be rectified at the Western end when construction of the M4 East Tunnels and the Rozelle Interchange are completed in 2023. In September 2005, as part of the media attention surrounding these criticisms, a local newspaper commissioned an audit of the usage of the tollway by independent surveyors who found that on a single day, around 20,000 vehicles had used the tunnel. This was countered by a spokesman for the tunnel operator, who said about 550,000 vehicles had used the tunnel in its initial operation, at an average of approximately 25,000 cars per day. In October 2005, a call centre handling calls related to the Cross City Tunnel halved its staff due to the low number of calls. In September 2006 The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the operator had not pursued for 12 months motorists who had not paid the toll (along with the M2 Hills Motorway) due to a lack of agreement on a system for passing of the details to the RTA. The Cross City Motorway subsequently promised that toll evaders will be pursued.

The group consisted of ten core members many of whom were also in the bands NT, Screw, and Anodize. Despite the popularity of the now disbanded LMF, which gained mild success in the mainstream, hip hop music remains underground, led by independent artists.

It lies about 1 km (0.6 mi) from the banks of the River Foyle and 5 km (3 mi) south of the city of Derry. It had a population of 3,381 in the 2011 Census. It is within Derry and Strabane district.  History  The village was founded in the early 17th century as part of the Plantation of Ulster, on land allocated to the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths of London. It remained a small settlement until the 1960s, until large amounts of social housing was built on adjoining townlands. Today, the village has four churches (Methodist, Independent Methodist, Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic). It also has two primary schools ‚Äì one administered by the Western Education and Library Board, one by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. Newbuildings also has a post office, community association, retail units and a wide range of housing. Newbuildings is represented in the Loyalist flute band scene by Pride of the Orange and Blue Flute Band, formed in 1979. Geography Newbuildings sits on an area of flat land between Clondermot Hill to the east and the River Foyle to the west. It is within the parish of Clondermott & Glendermott. This parish is split into a number of townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language.

The genus includes two main groups, the often brightly coloured pumpkin toadlets, and the overall brown and more frog- like flea frogs (or flea toads), which once were placed in their own genus Psyllophryne. Some pumpkin toadlets are toxic and their often bright colours are considered aposematic. At about or less in snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length, the flea frogs are some of the smallest frogs in the world. The saddleback toads live among leaf litter in the Atlantic rainforest, ranging from near sea level to an altitude of , with most species restricted to highland cloud forest. They are mostly diurnal, feed on tiny invertebrates and breeding is by direct development, with eggs laid on land and hatching into young frogs (no tadpole stage). The majority of the Brachycephalus species have only been discovered in the 21st century. Most species have tiny ranges and are seriously threatened. Appearance =Morphology and size= B. pulex is one of the smallest species in the genus; with its frog-like appearance and overall brown colour it is a typical flea frog The common name \\"saddleback toad\\" refers to the bony shields that cover their vertebrae, but these are not present in all species in the genus and their function is unclear in the species that do have them. The genus can be divided into two main subgroups: The pumpkin toadlets comprises most species in the genus. They have an overall toad-like appearance and morphology, and they mostly walk (they are unable to jump far). The second group are the flea frogs or flea toads (B. didactylus, B. hermogenesi, B. pulex and B. sulfuratus) that have an appearance and morphology that is more like leptodactylid frogs, and they are better jumpers. The name \\"flea frog\\" is also sometimes used for the unrelated Adelophryne. The skin of the saddleback toads can be rugose (bumpy) or smooth. Their toes/fingers are reduced compared to most other frogs, with typically only two to four being clearly visible on each foot/hand. Some of the bones in their skull are also reduced. Brachycephalus are very small frogs and adults range from in snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length. Females tend to be larger than males of the same species. The flea frogs or flea toads are generally the smallest at in adults, but overlapping to some extent with the smallest species of pumpkin toadlets. Adults of the pumpkin toadlets are at least , with most species about , and the largest like B. darkside and B. margaritatus at least . At , B. pulex has the smallest maximum adult size reported in the genus, while B. sulfuratus at has the smallest minimum adult size in the genus, but its maximum size surpasses that reported for a few others. This makes them the smallest frogs in the Americas, with only the northeast Brazilian Adelophryne michelin, and Cuban Eleutherodactylus iberia and E. limbatus approaching their tiny dimensions. In other continents, the only similar-sized or slightly smaller frogs are a few species in the genera Mini, Paedophryne and Stumpffia. Newly hatched saddleback toads are much smaller than the already tiny adults. For example, they are typically in B. ephippium, a species where adults are at least . =Colour and toxicity= The different Brachycephalus vary greatly in colour and this is often useful for separating the species from each other. Within each species, there are often also some individual variations, especially in the details of their pattern. The flea frogs or flea toads (B. didactylus, B. hermogenesi, B. pulex and B. sulfuratus) are well-camouflaged and overall brown, often with sections that are greyer or near-black, and sometimes with a few poorly-defined yellowish spots below. Among the remaining species in the genus, almost all have both underparts and upperparts that are at least partially yellow or orange. They are collectively known as pumpkin toadlets, which is a reference to the colour. In some species, this colour is almost uniform throughout, earning them the name Brazilian gold frog (sometimes misapplied to the all-brown flea frog B. didactylus). However, in many species the yellow or orange is partial and incomplete. On the underparts, the yellow or orange may form a spotted or mottled pattern on a dull and dark background. On the upperparts, there can be spots, mottling or patches in black, brown, greenish, whitish or reddish. This results in some species where most but not all of the upperparts are yellow or orange and others where only small sections are yellow or orange. Two particularly dull-coloured species, B. brunneus and B. curupira, are overall brown, while a few others are essentially all-brown or greenish above (sometimes with whitish on the mid- back), limiting yellow or orange to the underparts. In species where known, including ones that are bright orange-yellow as adults, the newly hatched juveniles are mostly brown overall and may have white markings below. The bright yellow, orange or reddish colours of many species in this genus are generally considered aposematic (warning colours), but toxicity has only been studied in a few species. The brightly coloured B. ephippium and B. pernix have tetrodotoxin and similar toxins in their skin and organs, whereas B. nodoterga, which has a much more subdued colouring but still with some yellow- orange, appears to be non-toxic. It is unknown how certain Brachycephalus species attain the strong neurotoxins, but they are possibly absorbed from the small invertebrates they eat, as known from some poison dart frogs and mantella frogs, or produced by bacteria inside their body. At least two brightly coloured species, B. ephippium and B. pitanga, have bones that are fluorescent, which is visible through the skin of the toadlet when exposed to UV light. It was initially speculated that the fluorescent colour also is aposematic or that it is related to mate choice (species recognition or determining fitness of a potential partner), but later studies indicate that the former explanation is unlikely, as predation attempts on the toadlets appear to be unaffected by the presence/absence of fluorescence. Voice and hearing Unique among all animals, B. pitanga and at least one other pumpkin toadlet species are deaf to their own advertising calls Although not very loud for a frog/toad (even relative to their tiny size), Brachycephalus are most often located by their call. The primary calls are by adult males, but females and young may also call. A single square meter (slightly more than 10 sq ft) can host as many as five calling males, and at a single location one may hear tens of males at once. Males will defend their small territory from other males, but in most cases voice or visual displays are sufficient and fights are avoided. The advertising calls by males are performed either from a hidden or an exposed position. Whether a species is dull or brightly coloured does not accurately predict if it prefers an exposed or hidden calling position. In addition to advertising calls, there are aggressive calls directed towards other males when close. The calls of the different species differ to various extent in frequency, speed, structure and other features. Peculiarly, at least the brightly coloured pumpkin toadlets B. ephippium and B. pitanga are unable to hear the frequency of their own advertising calls, as their ears are underdeveloped. Instead their communication appears to rely on certain movements like the vocal sac that inflates when calling, mouth gaping and waving of their arms. It is speculated that their calling is a vestigiality from the ancestral form of the genus, whereas their reduced hearing ability (they do have some hearing ability in frequencies outside their call) is a novel change in these species. Sounds make them more vulnerable to predators, but there has likely been little direct evolutionary pressure to lose it because of their toxicity. Unlike B. ephippium, B. pitanga and some others, many species in the genus always call from a hidden position, making any signalling by movements inefficient, and it is likely they can hear their own calls. Direct studies of the medium-brightly coloured (mostly dull above, bright below) pumpkin toadlet B. actaeus and the dull-coloured flea frog B. hermogenesi strongly suggest that they are able to hear their own calls. Behavior B. leopardus pair in amplexus Saddleback toads live in the leaf litter on forest floors, but on occasion may move to higher perches up to off the ground. During dry conditions, both sexes tend to stay hidden in the leaf litter and there is little noticeable activity, but during the wet season and high humidity the males and in some species also females may move to the top of the leaf litter. In some species, they often take up quite conspicuous positions during this time. Overall the saddleback toads are mostly active during the day, but some activity also occurs during the night and some species possibly are mostly nocturnal. =Breeding= In general, saddleback toads are reported to use axillary or nearly axillary amplexus where a male uses his front limbs to grab a female at her front limbs. However, whereas most frogs typically only use one technique, at least B. ephippium will use two, beginning with an inguinal amplexus (where the male holds the female around the lower waist, just in front of her hindlimbs) and only later changing to a nearly axillary position. Based on the few species where the breeding behavior is known, the female saddleback toad lays about five or less yellow or yellow-white eggs, which are relatively large compared to the size of the adult. They are deposited in a hidden location (for example, under leaf litter or a tree log) on land. The female rolls them until they are covered in particles, making them almost indistinguishable from the soil where they have been laid, but it may also help to preserve their water content. After about two months, they hatch into juvenile toads/frogs. There is no tadpole or other aquatic stage. =Feeding= Relatively little is known about the feeding behavior of saddleback toads, but they will take a wide range of minute invertebrates. They are known to feed on insects (among others, ants, springtails, true bugs, beetles, grasshoppers and flies) and their larvae, mites, spiders, pseudoscorpions, millipedes, snails and isopods. Conservation status Only 11 species of saddleback toads have been officially rated by the IUCN, all between 2004 and 2010, with 3 species listed as least concern (not threatened) and the remaining data deficient (insufficient data for rating them). Since then, many new species have been recognised and more data has become available for evaluating their conservation status. In a review in 2019 that included all species recognised up until then and used IUCN's definitions, 10 species were data deficient, 5 least concern, 10 vulnerable, 5 endangered and 6 critically endangered. Two of the data deficient species, B. atelopoide and B. bufonoides, have not been recorded since their original scientific descriptions a century ago and they are unknown in life. The three flea frogs B. didactylus, B. hermogenesi and B. sulfuratus and the pumpkin toadlet B. ephippiumsi are relatively widespread in both distribution and altitude range (lowlands to about ), although it is possible that the last of these actually is a species complex. Each of the remaining species of Brachycephalus are only known from seven or less locations and many at only one or two locations covering less than at a very narrow altitude range. These are typically in cloud forest on sky island mountaintops and most species have completely separate distribution, isolated from each other by valleys and unsuitable habitat. Where found, they can however be common, sometimes even abundant. Although some of the range- restricted species have well-protected distributions in reserves, many of the species do not. Their small distributions make them highly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation from climate change (changing temperature and rain patterns), fire, grazing by livestock, and deforestation for tree extraction and to make room for plantations, farming and cattle ranching. Classification and discovery =Family= Brachycephalus lacks a Bidder's organ, but were historically included in the true toad family Bufonidae, where one of the defining features is its presence. Brachycephalus was subsequently placed in Atelopodidae or Brachycephalidae, with the latter being the generally accepted treatment in recent decades. Initially some authorities placed numerous genera in Brachycephalidae, while others limited it to only contain the genus Brachycephalus. Genetic studies have shown that most of these genera belong in other families, but the‚Äîin morphology quite different‚Äîgenus Ischnocnema is a close relative of Brachycephalus and they belong together as the only members of Brachycephalidae. =Genus and species groups= Phylogenetic relationship of four pumpkin toadlet species showing that colours alone are not a good indicator of relatedness Within Brachycephalus, there are two rather distinctive groups: the typical members are the pumpkin toadlets, while the remaining four species are the flea frogs or flea toads (B. didactylus, B. hermogenesi, B. pulex and B. sulfuratus). Until 2002, the latter group, which is relatively widespread, was regarded as a separate genus, Psyllophryne, but it is now considered a synonym of Brachycephalus. The pumpkin toadlets, which largely are restricted to highlands and foothills, can be further divided into two subgroups: the southern B. pernix subgroup (Paran√° and Santa Catarina) and the northern B. ephippium subgroup (S√£o Paulo and north). Among the pumpkin toadlets, colours alone are not a good indicator of phylogenetic relationships. For example, the brown B. curupira is closely related to the golden B. izecksohni and the brown B. brunneus is closely related to the golden B. leopardus, but these species pairs are more distant from each other. =Species= B. hermogenesi, one of the species initially placed in the flea frog genus Psyllophryne The first species, Brachycephalus ephippium, was already described by Johann Baptist von Spix in 1824, but originally in the genus Bufo. Two years later the genus Brachycephalus was coined by Leopold Fitzinger. In 1920, four additional \\"variants\\" were described by Al√≠pio de Miranda-Ribeiro, but in 1955 a review did not recognise them, arguing that they were synonyms of B. ephippium. Another species, B. didactylus, was described in 1971 by Eug√™nio Izecksohn, but placed in its own genus Psyllophryne. As a consequence, B. ephippium was the only widely recognised species in the genus; it was the pumpkin toadlet. In 1990, B. nodoterga (one of the variants that had been described in 1920) was instated as a valid species, bringing the number of generally recognised Brachycephalus species to two. Starting in 1998, this changed dramatically. Since that year, there has been a couple of years at most between the description of new species and some years where several were described, peaking at eight species in 2015 alone. Additionally, the three remaining variants that had been described in 1920 were instated as valid species in 2010 and the former Psyllophryne species were moved into Brachycephalus in 2002. , there were 36 recognised species of Brachycephalus. The many recently discovered species have mostly been the result of scientists visiting isolated highland peaks, so-called sky islands that are separated from each other by valleys. Although now generally recognised, the distinction of some of these recently described species has been questioned by some authorities since they often have been separated mainly by colour and skin texture, features that can be variable in frogs/toads.

It is the first film in the Trancers series. Thomerson plays Jack Deth, a Philip Marlowe-esque police detective from the 23rd century who travels to the 1980s to bring his old nemesis to justice. The film portrays a unique method of time travel: people can travel back in time by injecting themselves with a drug that allows them to take over the body of an ancestor. Plot Jack Deth is a police trooper in the 23rd century who has been hunting down Martin Whistler, a criminal mastermind who uses psychic powers to turn people into mindless \\"trancers\\" and carry out his orders. Deth can identify a tranced individual by scanning them with a special bracelet. All trancers appear as normal humans at first, but once triggered, they become savage killers with twisted features. Before he can be caught, Whistler escapes back in time using a drug-induced time-traveling technique. Whistler's consciousness travels down his ancestral bloodline, arrives in 1985, and takes over the body of a Los Angeles police detective named Weisling. Once Deth discovers what Whistler has done, he destroys Whistler's body‚Äîeffectively leaving him trapped in the past with no vessel to return to‚Äîand chases after him through time the same way. Deth ends up in the body of one of his ancestors: a journalist named Phil Dethton. With the help of Phil's girlfriend‚Äîa punk rock girl named Leena‚ÄîDeth goes after Whistler, who has begun to \\"trance\\" other victims. Whistler plots to eliminate the future governing council members of Angel City (the future name of Los Angeles), who are being systematically wiped out of existence by Whistler's murder spree of their ancestors. Deth arrives too late to prevent most of the murders and can only safeguard Hap Ashby, a washed-up former pro baseball player, who is the ancestor of the last surviving council member, Chairman Ashe. Deth is given some high-tech equipment, which is sent to him in the past: his sidearm (which contains two hidden vials of time drugs to send him and Whistler back to the future), and a \\"long-second\\" wristwatch, which temporarily slows time, stretching one second to ten. The watch has only enough power for one use, but he later receives another watch. During the end fight with Whistler, one of the drug vials in Jack's gun breaks, leaving only one vial to get home. Jack is forced to make a choice: kill the innocent Weisling (who is possessed by the evil Whistler), or use the vial to send Whistler back to 2247, which would strand Jack in the present. Jack chooses to inject Weisling with the vial, saving the lieutenant's life but condemning Whistler to an eternity without a body to return to. Jack decides to remain with Leena in 1985, although observing him from the shadows is McNulty, his boss from the future, who has traveled down his own ancestral line, ending up in the body of a young girl.

Variety described it as having a similar premise to The Terminator but falling short of that film. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times instead called it \\"a textbook example of efficient, effective exploitation film making\\".  Sequels  The film received a direct-to-video sequel in 1991, titled Trancers II: The Return of Jack Deth. Additionally, Trancers: City of Lost Angels is chronologically set between the first and second films. The twenty-minute short was a part of the unreleased 1988 anthology film, Pulse Pounders, but was released separately on DVD in 2013. The film has since started a franchise of six main films.

History  Hedalen Stavkyrkje. S√∏r-Aurdal The first reference to the church is in 1327. The original church was a much smaller single nave church built second half of the 12th century. The west entrance remains from the original church. The front portal is one of the oldest and most richly ornamented in the country. It takes the form of three winged dragons, one on each side of the arch and pilasters of the entrance and one above, all elaborately intertwined in a tendril and leaf pattern. The remodelling and expansion of original building into a cruciform church is believed to have been completed in 1699, although some sources claim 1738. Restoration work was done during 1902 under direction of architect Carl Berner (1877‚Äì1943). During the restoration work, the previous sacristy was replaced with a new choir, and the new parts were enclosed in an ambulatory. This was a small reconstruction to add a new ridge turret (Norwegian:takrytter).  Interior  Within the church there is also a reliquary, made of wood in the shape of a miniature church (called a chasse) with gilt-brass mountings and with scenes from the BibleI.e., Christ in Glory, his betrayal and crucifixion and the women at his tomb and the three kings presenting their gifts to the Virgin and Child and the martyrdom of Thomas Becket.Many such reliquaries were made in western Europe from 1170 to 1220 when the martyred archbishop's cult was at its height. Like the stave churches themselves the reliquary is ornamented with dragon-heads on its gables, a feature which several Norwegian medieval reliquaries share and which might have been originally inspired by similar dragon-heads on the silver gilt reliquary of St. Olav on the enshrined on the high altar of the Nidaros Cathedral.This reliquary is considered to be the best of its type to survive and replicas of it are displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, in the Museums of Cultural History and of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and in the Cultural History Collection of the Bergen Museum in Bergen.Further evidence of the popularity of the cult of Thomas Becket in Valdres might be seen from the St. Thomas Church in the Filefjell mountain pass between Valdres and Sogn. The chasse from this church is in the Bergen Museum, but is in a more ruinous condition than the chasse in Hedalen. This chasse also has dragonheads and has five arches piecing its lower side, a feature it shares with the representation of a chasse in the S√∏r-Aurdal coat of arms. This reliquary was the principal source of inspiration for coat of arms of S√∏r- Aurdal. Another source of inspiration for this coat of arms was the Reinli stave church. Also preserved in the church is the wooden litter for bearing this reliquary in processions, as well as a brass censer with Limoges enamel and a wooden pax-board. The soapstone baptismal font, with its conical wooden lid, is of gothic style and is still in use. On a special mount on the wall of the church is a statue of the Virgin Mary, crowned and dressed in a golden robe lined with vair and holding the similarly crowned and robed Christ Child enthroned on her lap. The statue dates from the early 13th century as does the wooden tabernacle in the form of a church. Hedal church was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary and this statue originally stood on the principal altar in the apse in front of a polytych painted with scenes of her life, which could be closed over it during times of fasting. This polytych was repainted in the Baroque period and now forms the altarpiece, in front of which is displayed a medieval crucifix of Christ on the cross in the shape of a stylized tree of life. Both the statue of the Virgin and Child and the crucifix are among the more beautiful works of medieval art to survive from the Norwegian Middle Ages. The Virgin and Child statue was restored by the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History in 1990. After much discussion over whether it should remain in its collection, it is back in the church placed on a special mount. There was also a replica made at the same time as its restoration. It is placed on display if weather conditions makes the original's safe storage necessary.

The island is situated approximately off the southwest coast of Cambodia. There are no permanent civilian inhabitants living on the island. The Cambodian military maintain a base with a sizable number of personnel. The Khmer word Koh (), means 'island', Tang can be loosely translated to \\"legend\\".  Geography  The island is rock fringed with its highest point at its northern extremity. Two shallow coves press into the eastern and western neck of its northern plateau. The eastern cove has a long shallow coral sand beach. The small islet Koh Mul/Tuich lies about to the East and Koh Domloung (potato) island about to the South. The islets Koh Tee Mui ( off) and Koh Tee Bpi ( off) complete the Koh Tang archipelago. History =Koh Tang massacre= In May 1975, Khmer Rouge troops landed on nearby Th·ªï Chu Island and kidnapped 513 Vietnamese civilians (almost the entire population of Th·ªï Chu) to Koh Tang, where they were forced to do hard labor until they were all executed. =Mayaguez Incident= Assault on Koh Tang during the rescue of the SS Mayaguez The island is the site of the last combat action of the Vietnam War and the only ground combat between U.S. forces and the Khmer Rouge. On May 15, 1975, U.S. Marines on board U.S. Air Force helicopters landed on Koh Tang in the hope of freeing the crew of the SS Mayag√ºez which had been captured by Khmer Rouge gunboats on May 12, 1975. The crew of the Mayaguez was not on Koh Tang, but had been taken to the Cambodian mainland and were released during the rescue operation. In the course of the operation the Khmer Rouge shot down three CH-53 helicopters on or near Koh Tang and 15 Marines and Air Force crewmen were killed and another three Marines were inadvertently left behind and later executed. An estimated 13-25 Khmer Rouge were killed during the battle. =Capture of the Foxy Lady= On the evening of August 13, 1978 the Foxy Lady, a Chinese sailing junk which had been blown off course while sailing from Singapore to Bangkok, was discovered taking shelter on the western side of Koh Tang by Khmer Rouge gunboats. The gunboats fired on the Foxy Lady killing Canadian crewman Stuart Glass. The other two crewmen, Englishman John Dewhirst and New Zealander Kerry Hamill dived into the water and were picked up by the Khmer Rouge boats. Dewhirst and Hamill were later transported to S-21 prison in Phnom Penh where they were tortured and forced to write confessions. Dewhirst was executed in late August and Hamill was executed in October 1978.

It was followed by two official sequels, the console and computer title Mighty Bomb Jack, and the arcade game Bomb Jack Twin and Bomb Jack II, which was licensed for home computers only. Gameplay Arcade version, round 1 Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \\"P\\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct scheme of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all). There is a special bonus for collecting 21 to 23 lit bombs in a row, out of the 24 bombs of each round.

Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Bomb Jack on their May 15, 1984 issue as being the third most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Crash magazine gave the Sinclair ZX Spectrum version a 92% rating with the comment \\"A great arcade conversion, don't miss it\\", while Zzap!64 was less enthusiastic for the Commodore 64 version giving it 47%. Commodore User gave the Amiga version 6 out of 10 citing that the Amiga should be well capable of doing better on a then four- year-old arcade game. The Spectrum version of the game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Green Beret. Legacy =Sequels= Bomb Jack II is a licensed follow-up developed for 8-bit home computers by the British games publisher Elite Systems in 1986. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Leaderboard. The music featured was the theme from the ThunderCats animation - as odd a choice as that may seem, this is because the game was originally meant to be a tie-in for that series, but was reskinned to follow on from Bomb Jack. Mighty Bomb Jack was released in 1986. The game was largely identical to the original game in almost all factors, except that the same screen layouts from the first game in the same sequence were now linked in a map-like continuous form by scrolling passages. Mighty Bomb Jack got less favorable reviews than the original game. Bomb Jack Twin was released in 1993 by NMK.

The 'School for Aboriginal Children' was relocated to this institution in 1823, however by 1833 it had been abandoned. In the short time it existed, 'Black's Town' stamped its name on the road from Prospect to the institution. The railway station was named for the road and the settlement around Blacktown railway station and the whole district became known as Blacktown. Walter Lamb (1825-1906) established a cannery, fruit preserving works and a coursing (greyhound racing) track on his property Woodstock. The area was initially known as Woodstock, but when a post office was established in 1889, there was confusion over this Woodstock and a railway station on the Blayney-Harden line, also called Woodstock. Coursing in England was conducted at Plumpton, so that name replaced Woodstock. Geography Located on the Cumberland Plain, Plumpton is a generally flat suburb and is rectangular in shape, bordered by Jersey Road to the north, the Westlink M7 motorway to the east, Woodstock Avenue to the south and Pringle Road to the west. The suburb is primarily residential, with a small commercial area based on the Plumpton Marketplace shopping complex on the northern edge of the suburb.

Solovar is a sentient gorilla and the progressive leader of a race of gorillas that first appeared as supporting characters of Flash. Solovar made his live appearance on the third season of The Flash voiced by Keith David and portrayed in CGI. The character returned in the sixth season. Publication history Solovar first appeared in Flash #106 and was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino. Fictional character biography For many years, Solovar is the leader of Gorilla City, a hidden city of hyper-intelligent gorillas. Renowned for his wisdom and psychic powers, he is virtually unchallenged, except by the villainous Gorilla Grodd. This rivalry is so great that, after Solovar is captured by humans (playing dumb to keep his identity and origin secret), Grodd follows him to Central City to learn the secrets of Solovar's force-of-mind powers. He succeeds in this, but the Flash captures him after Solovar escapes and tells the Flash of Grodd. The Flash helped the gorilla leader escape and became the first human to learn of the city's existence, and its location. This leads to a rivalry between Grodd and the Flash, as well as an alliance between the Flash and Solovar.Flash vol. 1 #106, 1959 Flash has helped to defeat Grodd many times. Under Solovar's guidance, Gorilla City is a technological utopia. Eventually, he decides his people can no longer use their science to hide from the human world. Believing that the world's ecological and political problems cannot be solved by ignoring them, he opens his city's borders to the world and asks for membership in the United Nations. He advocates peace ‚Äî among the gorillas and with humans ‚Äî and is behind two diplomatic overtures to the human world. The second tour of the U.S., sadly, is cut short by his assassinationJustice League of America Annual #3, 1999 by a lethal car bomb. While a mysterious group calling itself the Human Supremacy Movement takes credit for the act, it is quickly made clear to the reader that Solovar's assassination at the hands of human racists is in fact a ruse concocted by the Simian Scarlet, a group of gorillas within Gorilla City seeking to overthrow the ruling council (the manipulators, however, are themselves being manipulated by Gorilla Grodd). Solovar is briefly succeeded by his nephew, Ulgo. With tensions between humans and gorillas rising, the JLA is invited to Gorilla City to assist in a diplomatic mission, only to fall victim to an ambush. In the heat of battle, the gorilla army tests its new weapon on the heroes, a \\"gorillabomb\\" that transforms humans into gorillas. While the JLA retreat to their moonbase to find a cure, Prince Ulgo appears before the United Nations to formally declare war on the human race. However, he promises, there will be no bloodshed in the battle, and he makes his point by detonating a gorillabomb in the auditorium. With the entire UN assembly transformed both mentally and physically into gorillas, the JLA act swiftly to minimize damage and loss of life. Alas, saving the delegates uses up their only chance to change back into humans, and so our transformed heroes must remain in their simian forms until they can find another way to return to normal. Not that they are allowed much time to do this; as the Martian Manhunter telepathically learns, the gorillas are strategically targeting several places around the globe, including Themyscira (Wonder Woman's homeland), Atlantis (Aquaman's kingdom), Central City, Bl√ºdhaven (a suburb of Batman's Gotham City), Metropolis (where Superman lives, one of the largest cities in the DC Universe), and low Earth orbit (Green Lantern's). The heroes split up and set out to neutralize the gorilla army, end the human-gorilla war, and find a way to return to normal. Once the JLA have achieved their goals, Ulgo is later succeeded by Solovar's son, Nnamdi. During the Blackest Night, Barry Allen raced to Gorilla City to seek aid from Solovar, not knowing of his death. Finding the city ravaged, Allen assumed Grodd had attacked, only to discover Solovar had been reanimated as a Black Lantern. Barry managed to temporarily stop him by dragging his corpse through the air at superspeed while leaving it outside the protective aura his body generated when he took passengers, reducing Solovar's Black Lantern self to dust when he could not cope with the friction that he was being subjected to.Blackest Night: The Flash #1 =The New 52= Solovar, in the new universe, is the founder and first ruler of Gorilla City, regarded as the Forefather of his species. He, his herd and his family had been around during the apex of the Mayan civilization just moments before its abrupt destruction by a metaphysical force. As the Speed Force destroyed the ancient culture in a blare of lightning, that same bolt of energy struck him and a few other apes within the vicinity, creating the first few in a new generation of superintelligent gorillas who would come to found the hidden nation of Gorilla City.The Flash (vol. 4) #14 (February 2013) Powers and abilities Solovar possesses similar physical and mental abilities akin to Gorilla Grodd stemming from the same meteorite that evolved them and the rest of their brethren.Flash Vol 2 #69 (oct, 1992) Though not as significantly developed as his evil counterpart, Solovar is a gifted mentalist in his own right. As well as an able bodied political activist being king of his own highly advanced civilization and an accomplished diplomat with savvy knowledge of world affairs.DC Comics Encyclopedia #1 Other than that, Solovar like all apes of gorilla city, boasts an accomplished intellect knowing the workarounds of all his nations advanced science and technology. Being a contributing pioneer to its development himself. He also boasts the augmented physical abilities of all Super Apes of his homeland, he also has vastly augmented physical abilities. During the events of the Blackest Night the deceased king Solovar is reanimated by a Black Power Ring and gifted with all the abilities that come with being a Black Lantern, such as accelerated regeneration, emotional reading and consumption by removing the hearts of the living, simulation of old powers from his previous life and the typical functions allotted by a Power Ring.Blackest Night: The Flash #1-3 (2010) Within the DCnU reboot, Solovar was the first among his lineage of apes touched by The Light. Solovar naturally possesses a greater physical and mental constitution greater than humans and most of his fellow apes.

Solovar lead a troop of gorillas in Bwunda. He and his mate Boka had a son, Nnamdi. In 2008, he, along with most of his troop, was captured by the Brain and Ultra-Humanite. The adult gorillas were surgically enhanced to increase their intelligence. They also received telepathic abilities as a side-effect, a fact they kept secret from their captors. The troop's children were held hostage, forcing the adults to serve their captors at Gorilla City. They were later given Kobra-Venom injections. At Ultra-Humanite's command, Solovar, Gorilla Grodd and several Kobra-Venom enhanced gorillas ambushed the Team and Wolf. They seized the Team and gave them inhibitor collars. They did not catch Miss Martian, or Wolf. Solovar and Grodd brought them to Brain. Via handsigns, he informed Ultra-Humanite and Brain that they could not find Miss Martian. Brain gave them infrared goggles to search for her. Solovar and Grodd found Miss Martian as she woke up, and Grodd demanded her help. Solovar, Grodd, Boka and Primat held a telepathic conference with Miss Martian, during which they explained the history of their troop and Gorilla City, and asked for her team's help to liberate them. Solovar decided to trust M'gann despite her not being the Team's leader as the gorillas had assumed. They returned Miss Martian to the physical world, reuniting her with Wolf. Later, Solovar telepathically sent Grodd confirmation that Miss Martian had rescued the gorilla children. When Robin escaped from captivity in the main hut, Grodd wanted to kill him to prevent him disrupting the gorillas' plan, but Solovar instructed him to adapt instead. Solovar arrived at the main hut after the Brain called for reinforcements against the now free Team, along with Malavar, Djuba, a number of Shadow guards and Miss Martian, who pretended to be his unconscious prisoner. The Team and the gorillas then attacked their captors; Solovar disarmed Monsieur Mallah, and chided Superboy for calling the gorillas monkeys. Facing defeat, the Brain activated the base's self-destruct system, and Gorilla City was swiftly evacuated. Solovar happily reunited with his mate and son at the gorilla's safe haven, reporting that everyone had escaped the city safely. He thought the troop might build its own Gorilla City. =Scooby-Doo Team-Up= Solovar appears in the Scooby-Doo Team-Up story titled \\"The Ghost of Gorilla City.\\" He helps Mystery Inc. by helping them escape from the zombies and deal with Ghost-rilla.Scooby-Doo Team-Up #15.

The two would worked on a means of pruning the population of the human race to a more manageable size via the works of Professor Anthony Ivo. In other media =Television= * Solovar first appeared in Challenge of the Super Friends, voiced by Michael Rye.

In the episode \\"The Brave and the Bold\\", he's pursuing Gorilla Grodd to stop from launching nuclear missiles from Central City. With the help of the Flash (Wally West) and Green Lantern, he eventually took Grodd back to Gorilla City. * David Ogden Stiers reprised his role of Solovar in Justice League Unlimited.

This version is an albino gorilla who is gruff but wise, benevolent, valiant and honorable as Gorilla City's king. He is seen in the episodes \\"Attack on Gorilla City\\" and \\"Attack on Central City\\". Although initially suspicious of Team Flash, he grew to trust them after seeing Barry Allen's mercy and bows for it. When Flash and his friends are caught trespassing while searching for Harry Wells on Earth-2 and are accused of being spies, Solovar and his advisor Grodd arrange for Solovar himself to fight the Flash in single combat, though Grodd secretly asks Barry to kill Solovar, deceiving Team Flash into thinking that he intends to attack Central City. Solovar's superior strength and tactics overwhelm the Flash until crippling Solovar by phasing a hand through his chest but Barry does not kill him. Afterwards, Grodd declares himself Gorilla City's new king, manipulating events from the beginning in order to exact revenge on human society. Solovar is recruited by Barry to stop Grodd's army by reclaiming his throne in battle. Solovar is persuaded by the Flash not to kill Grodd after defeating his opponent in combat. Afterwards, Solovar and his gorillas return to Earth-2 while the Flash hands Grodd over to A.R.G.U.S. In the episode \\"Grodd Friended Me,\\" Flash got trapped in Grodd's mind and found a gatekeeper to the exit who is a mental copy of Solovar who wouldn't even let Barry get out. Both Flash and Grodd had to work together to defeat the Solovar copy. =Video games= * Solovar is featured in Justice League Heroes, voiced by Nick Jameson.

He first appears in Gorilla City, having deposed Gorilla Grodd before Lex Luthor's team arrive seeking Grodd's aid. It turns out Grodd asked Luthor to meet there without explaining the situation so as to make sure Solovar couldn't deduce Grodd's plan by reading Luthor's mind. Grodd then attacks and challenges Solovar for the throne. With Luthor's help, Grodd is victorious and reclaims Gorilla City.

The film's plot revolves around Kiss, who use their superpowers to battle an evil inventor (Abner Devereaux, played by Anthony Zerbe) and to save a California amusement park from destruction. NBC aired the film at the height of Kiss' popularity in the United States. Due to the film's poor acting and semi-comedic script, most Kiss fans disliked the film. Despite the film's poor quality, it has attained cult film status. The members of Kiss themselves despised the film for making them appear buffoonish. For years after its airing, no one who worked for the group was permitted to mention the film in their presence.Lendt, C.K. Kiss and Sell: The Making of a Supergroup, Billboard Books, 1997. Plot At Magic Mountain, Abner Devereaux, the park's engineer and the creator of a series of animatronic attractions, is not pleased that his works are being overshadowed by an upcoming concert by Kiss. Calvin Richards, the park's owner, explains that the concert will generate much-needed revenue to make up for the quality control problems that have plagued Deveraux's creations. Melissa, a park guest, becomes concerned when her boyfriend Sam Farrell, a park employee and assistant to Devereaux, has gone missing. Meanwhile, three punks sabotage one of the rides and Deveraux is blamed for the incident. Melissa goes to Devereaux's underground laboratory, which was the last place Sam was seen. Devereaux dismisses her after explaining that he has not seen Sam, but after she leaves the lab, he reveals that Sam has been placed under mind-control through the use of an electronic device on his neck. The three punks enter the Chamber of Thrills, where they fall into traps set by Devereaux. Richards fires Devereaux for his erratic behavior and disregard for the guests' safety; because of this, Devereaux swears revenge upon Richards, the park, and Kiss‚Äîall of whom he blames for his misfortune. Shortly after Kiss' first concert at the park, Devereaux attempts to discredit them by unleashing a robotic copy of Gene Simmons to wreak havoc on the park and the security guards. The band is questioned the next day, but no action is taken. Melissa seeks help from the band to find Sam, unaware that the security pass she received from Devereaux is a tracking device. Devereaux has Sam break into the band's lair and steal their talismans, but the plan is foiled due to the force field on the talismans' case. Kiss sneak into the park to confront Devereaux, fighting off Devereaux's animatronic white monkeys in the process. Meanwhile, Sam manages to steal the talismen and delivers them to Devereaux, who then neutralizes Kiss with a ray gun. Kiss, having lost their powers, are imprisoned in the underground lab. Devereaux then sends his robotic Kiss copies in place of the real Kiss in order to ruin their concert and incite a riot. The real Kiss manage to retrieve their talismen, thereby regaining their powers. They escape and quickly head to the stage where they defeat the imposters and save the concert. After the show, Kiss, Melissa and Richards confront Devereaux in the underground laboratory, only to discover that he has frozen in a catatonic state, seemingly revealing himself as the namesake \\"phantom\\" of the park. Paul Stanley removes the mind-control device from Sam's neck, returning him back to normal.

Development Kiss' commercial popularity was at its peak by 1978. The group's gross income in 1977 totaled $10.2 million. Creative manager Bill Aucoin felt, however, that the cycle of album releases and touring had taken Kiss as far as they could go, and that it was time to elevate the group's image to the next level. He formulated a plan to cast Kiss as superheroes, a process that began with the 1977 release of a Kiss comic book. The band agreed, and plans were developed for a Kiss film. Production Filming for Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park began in May 1978,\\"KISS Chronology/Timeline\\" . The KISSFAQ. Retrieved June 30, 2006. and it was produced by Hanna-Barbera, known primarily for cartoons. Most of the movie was filmed at Magic Mountain in California, with additional filming taking place in the Hollywood Hills. Much of the production was rushed, and the script underwent numerous rewrites. All four members of Kiss were given crash courses on acting. Prior to completing the script, screenwriters Jan Michael Sherman and Don Buday spent time with each Kiss member, in an effort to get a feel for how they each acted and spoke. Frehley, known for his eccentric behavior, said little to the pair but \\"Ack!\\" As a result, Frehley was not originally given any lines, except to interject \\"Ack!\\" at various points. In the first draft of the script, Frehley was described as \\"monosyllabic and super-friendly. Communicating largely through gestures and sounds, Ace might be best described as an other-galactic Harpo Marx.\\"Hicks, L. Wayne. \\"KISS meets the Phantom\\". TVparty. Retrieved July 27, 2006. Upon learning of his lack of dialogue, Frehley threatened to leave the project. Soon after, lines were written for him. The band, none of whom had any prior acting experience, had difficulty adjusting to the demands of filming. Frehley and Criss, in particular, became increasingly frustrated with the long periods of downtime normally associated with movie-making. They were both also dealing with increasing levels of substance abuse. Criss' dialogue in the film had to be over-dubbed by well-known voice actor Michael Bell (who had worked with producer Joseph Barbera on a number of past projects), as he refused to participate in post-production. The only time Criss' actual voice is heard in the movie is during an acoustic performance of \\"Beth.\\" (Criss denies this story, stating that he \\"went to all the looping.\\") This is disputed by Paul Stanley in the KISS home video \\"X-treme Close Up\\". Where he explains in detail production and post-production. On May 27, the last day of filming, Criss and tour manager Fritz Postlethwaite were involved in a serious car accident. Postlethwaite suffered burns but soon returned to work for Kiss. Criss' injuries were minor.Gooch, Curt and Jeff Suhs. KISS Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History. Billboard Books, 2002. On a few occasions, Frehley left the set during filming due to arguments with the film's director. In one scene that Frehley abandoned, his African American stunt double can be clearly seen instead. The concert depicted in the film was recorded in the parking lot of Magic Mountain on May 19, 1978, in front of a crowd of 8,000 people. Tickets for the concert were given out by local AM radio station KTNQ which was where \\"The Real\\" Don Steele was a disc jockey. This is also the same radio station where Kiss made an appearance as DJs on Steele's radio program the previous year while in town to record Alive II at The Forum. The group performed a full concert, which was followed by lip-synched performances of some songs. \\"Rip and Destroy\\", an altered version of \\"Hotter than Hell\\" that was featured in the movie, was not performed during the concert. Music The film's music in the European release was purely performed by Kiss. Release and reception Prior to the film's airing, a private screening was held for Kiss, as well as their management and friends. Despite the positive reactions from all in attendance, Kiss hated the film for the buffoonish way it made them appear. For years after its airing, no one who worked for the group was permitted to mention the film in their presence. In 1979, AVCO Embassy Pictures released Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park in cinemas outside the United States, with translations of the title Attack of the Phantoms. In some countries‚ÄîItaly, in particular‚Äîthe film was simply titled Kiss Phantoms. The theatrical release featured a vastly different version of the film, with several scenes that did not appear in the original television airing added to the cut. The overseas film's overall soundtrack also differed from the original‚Äîmuch of the Hanna-Barbera fight music was replaced by music from the band's own catalog, primarily from their four solo albums. In some edits, the promotional videos for \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" and \\"Sure Know Something\\" were also edited into the film. In recent years, Kiss' public statements concerning the film have been a mixture of bemusement and disgust. On VH1's When Kiss Ruled the World program, Gene Simmons stated that, \\"It's a classic movie... classic movie if you're on drugs,\\" while Ace Frehley said that \\"I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning of the moment to the end\\" In an early-1990s Sterling-McFadden magazine interview, Simmons compared the film to the infamous B-movie classic Plan 9 from Outer Space, joking that the two films would make a perfect drive-in double feature. In the years since its initial airing, Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park has achieved cult status, mainly among Kiss fans. The European edit of the film (which removes most of Ace Frehley's dialogue) is available on DVD as part of Kissology Volume Two: 1978‚Äì1991, a collection of concerts and television appearances. Previously, availability was limited to two brief VHS releases in the 1980s and a laserdisc release in 1991. In 2005, distributor Cheezy Flicks attempted to release the original TV film version of the film on DVD, but due to legal issues, the disc was quickly pulled. Thus making those that do own copies of it before it got pulled wind up owning something rare and very hard to find. In Australia, the film, titled Kiss and the Attack of the Phantoms, was initially popular. Free tickets to the movie could be obtained by cutting 20 diamond shaped coupons from an Ice confectionary cup called an \\"Icee\\" and pasting them onto a printed sheet. Today the film remains at cult status. The most noticeable difference in the Australian release was the inclusion of \\"New York Groove\\" as background music during the Gene Simmons night rampage through the park. Frehley later stated that he had tons of fun while shooting the movie. See also *Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery, a 2015 animated film that shares similar plot points.

Rafida referred to those Kufans who deserted and refused to support Zayd, who had a policy not to condemn the first two Rashidun Caliphs, saying he never heard his family call them bad names. Zayd ibn Ali considered Ali the most supreme after Muhammad, but refused to condemn the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar for diplomatic purposes in his uprising to increase his support according to shia sources. He viewed the caliphate of Abu Bakr & Umar as a test from God to see if people would reject Ali's authority once again according to shia sources. The meaning of the term went through several changes over time. According to Zaydi sources, the term used by Zayd ibn Ali against some Kufans was not related to their rejection of the Abu Bakr & Umar, but it was for their rejection of Zayd ibn Ali's claim to Imamate because they considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the Imam instead. > He said: \\"Allah is Most Great! I swear by Allah, you all are the Rafidites > mentioned by the Messenger of Allah in his statement:((After me there will > be a people who will reject the jihad with the good of the Ahl al-Bayt and > they will say that there is no commanding the good or forbidding the evil! > They will mimic in the religion and follow their whims ‚Ä¶)).\\" During the time of the Umayyad and Abbasid Sunni leaders, it became a popular pejorative term for Twelvers, intended to recall their rejection of the first Sunni Rashidun, namely Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman. In modern times, the term rafida is primarily used in Salafi jihadism such as ISIS to justify their execution of Shias. There is much debate of the exact origin of rafida. One example of an early instance is from the Ma·∏•ƒÅsin of A·∏•mad ibn Mu·∏•ammad Barqƒ´, who died in 888 CE. A section of the Ma·∏•ƒÅsin reveals occasions of the use of rafida ascribed to Ja'far al-Sadiq: > A man came to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq saying that someone had warned him > against becoming a Rafidhi and Imam Ja'far replied \\"By Allah, this name > which Allah has granted you is excellent, as long as you follow our teaching > and do not attribute lies to us.\\" Muhammad al-Baqir also mentioned an > instance when he pointed at himself stating \\"I am one of the Rafidha.\\" Mughira ibn Shu'ba is said to have coined the term rafida against those who had rejected him.Wasserstrom, Steve. History of Religions, Vol. 25, No. 1 (Aug., 1985), pp. 1‚Äì29 Others refer to another historical text for its origin. Ja'far al-Sadiq believed that rafida was an honorific given first by God and preserved in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament: he mentioned that there were 70 men among the people of Pharaoh who rejected him and his ways and rather joined Moses, and God called those 70 men Rafida. They were referred to in the army of Moses as al-Rafida because they rejected the Pharaoh and were intense in their worship and their love for Moses, Aaron, and their offspring. Al-Sadiq further states that Allah revealed to Moses, \\"Establish this name for them in the Torah, for I have named them with it and gifted it to them.\\" He extends the usage of the word to include the Shi'a of the family of Muhammad. The Twelvers believe that after the death of Muhammad, they were the only ones who rejected evil, making them the successors of the original Rafida._Kohlberg, E. \\"al-Rafida or al-Rawafid.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. They considered their rejection of evil to be leaving the power of Zayd ibn 'Ali and staying true to the ways of Ali. However, the term does not appear in the Qur'an. There are also those who insist that rafida was mentioned in the original texts, but the enemies later deleted the context that included rafida. Usage Rumi (Mawlana) in his Masnavi (Title of the Story in Book V, poem 844) refers to the inhabitants of Sabzawar (in present-day Iran) as Rafizis among whom one cannot find a person named Abu Bakr. This is from the earliest extant copy of the Masnavi, dated 677 H Gh (1279 Gregorian) which is considered the most reliable by, e.g., B. Forouzanfar and R.A. Nicholson. The fourteenth-century Sunni traveler Ibn Battuta used it in his description of the Alawis, considered by many as a ghulat sect, during his visit to Syria in 1326.Gibb, H.A.R., 'The Travels of Ibn Battuta, Hakluyt, (1999) v.1, p.93 The term continues to be used in this way today.Nasr, Vali, Shia Revival, Norton, (2006) p.53 Rafida was also sometimes used to indicate extremists and ash-Shi'i for moderates.Abrahamov, Binyamin.Arabica, T. 34, Fasc. 1 (Mar., 1987), pp. 80-105Madelung, Wilferd. Islamic Legal Orthodoxy: Twelver Shiite Responses to the Sunni Legal System by Devin J. Stewart. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 120, NO. 1 (Jan.- Mar., 2000), pp. 111-114 At certain points, the Shi'i decided to turn this negative term that was being used against them daily and turn it into something positive. The Shi'is sometimes designated themselves as Rawafid, which is someone who refuses; it's also a derogatory term applied by the Sunnis to describe the Shi'is who refused to accept the early caliphates. They decided to refer to themselves a Rawafid since it gave them a sense of pride because the revolted against Umayyad tyranny.\\"Rawafid.\\" In The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Ed. John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. . Through the years, Rafida was transformed within the Shi'i world from an abusive nickname into a name signifying special praise, making it a positive term. Not only did they use the word as honorific amongst the community, they furthered the positive term by writing it into ancient history stories where they had always rejected evil, not turned towards evil. As defined by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, the Shia first developed Kaysanism, which in turn divided into three major groupings known as Fivers, Seveners and Twelvers. The non-Zaydis are called \\"Rafida\\" by the Zaydis, when they were separated from the rest of the Shia.Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, Kƒ±sas-ƒ± Enbiy√¢, vol. II, page 12. Current In their ongoing campaign to unseat the government of Iraq and the government Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well Syrian opposition rebels frequently uses the term \\"rafidah\\" to refer to Shia Muslims. Alawaites, are referred to as 'Nusayri'. In the 13th edition of the ISIS magazine Dabiq the feature article is entitled, The Rafidah: From Ibn Saba‚Äô to the Dajjal and contains, \\"pages of violent rhetoric directed against Shiites\\" who it claims are, \\"more severely dangerous and more murderous...than the Americans\\". The article justifies the killing of Shia Muslims, who ISIS claim are apostates In Saudi Arabia today, Shias are referred to as Rafidha. In Iraq, anti-Shi'a material is still surfacing.Jones, Toby. Middle East Report, No. 237 (Winter, 2005), pp. 20-25 A discourse was released after improvement by the name of \\"The Rafida in the Land of Tawhid\\", which included orders by a member of the Higher Council, to kill Shias. Until 1993, schoolbooks in Saudi Arabia openly denounced the Shia Islam and referred to the Shi'as rafida in the books.Prokop, Michaela. International Affairs, Vol. 79, No. 1 (Jan., 2003), pp. 77-89 The curriculum was changed after protests and rafida is no longer used in the text books; the Islamic Shi'a beliefs are still however denounced in the books.

He is one of three players to score a century in both his first class and Test debuts. He was the first player to captain three Australian states having captained New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland during his career. As NSW captain, he won the Sheffield Shield in 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86 and the McDonald's Cup in 1984‚Äì85.He is the nephew of New South Wales first-class cricketer Walter Wellham. Early life Welham was born in Marrickville, New South Wales and attended Ashfield Boys High School. Career After scoring two centuries for New South Wales in the 1980‚Äì81 Sheffield Shield, including 100 against Victoria on his first-class debut, Wellham was selected for the Australian team to tour England in 1981. On tour, Wellham scored 135 not out against Northamptonshire and was chosen to make his Test debut in the sixth Test at The Oval. Wellham scored 24 and 103, thus becoming the 12th Australian batsman to score a century on Test debut. Wellham's century was criticised by some commentators for being too slow and costing Australia a chance of victory. After scoring his first 80 runs in under 90 balls, Kim Hughes sent a runner onto the field to tell Wellham to take his time as the series had already been lost and the result didn't matter. Wellham's 103 took 221 balls and he was on 99 for 25 minutes. He was dropped from both the Test and state teams in the next season, but returned in 1983‚Äì84 as captain of New South Wales, winning the first of two consecutive Sheffield Shields that year and a McDonald's Cup in 1984‚Äì85. Wellham was recalled to the Australian team for the final Test of the 1985 Ashes tour and again for the final Test of the 1986‚Äì87 Ashes series scoring just 36 runs in these two matches. Wellham played 9 of his 17 one day international matches in the 1986‚Äì87 World Series Cup, the highlight being 97 against England at Sydney in a match more famous for batsman Allan Lamb hitting Bruce Reid for 18 runs in the final over to win the match. At first-class level, Wellham scored 8662 runs at an average of 42.25 and scored 16 centuries. In 1987‚Äì88, Wellham moved to Tasmania for the 1988‚Äì89 season and captained the side for three seasons. In 32 matches for Tasmania, Wellham scored 1629 runs at an average of 39.73 scoring 15 fifties but no centuries. At the start of the 1991‚Äì92 season, Wellham moved to Brisbane to take up a teaching position with the Anglican Church Grammar School. He joined the Eastern Suburbs club and was selected for Queensland. Wellham scored 873 runs at 58.20 including two centuries, his best run-scoring season since 1982‚Äì83. On 11 December 1992, Wellham captained Queensland for the first time, thus becoming the first player to captain three Australian states. He captained Queensland in 8 first-class matches that season including their loss to NSW in the Sheffield Shield final. Wellham played three more matches for Queensland in 1993‚Äì94 before retiring from first-class cricket. Character Wellham had a reputation as an astute captain, having led NSW to consecutive Sheffield Shield titles in the 1980s. Post-cricket career Wellham previously served as Deputy Principal (Academic) at Anglican Church Grammar School. He has been appointed as Principal of Caloundra City Private School, commencing 2013.City Observer, 24 May 2012. He received a PhD from Deakin University in 2009.

Formation The party was formed at the height of the First World War, by the Liberal Unionist peer Lord Ampthill, Sir Richard Cooper and Sir Henry Page Croft. Its members took a particularly xenophobic line on the war and were also strongly opposed to the sale of honours. This was reflected in their aims, as outlined in the party's manifesto: *The abandonment of sectarian, class or sectional interests in favour of a \\"national\\" policy. *\\"Complete victory in the war and after the war\\" *The provision of adequate men and munitions to win the war. *\\"The eradication of German influence\\" *What they termed \\"honest politics\\" *Unity between employer and employed *Maximum production from the farms and factories of the United Kingdom, with \\"fair wages\\" for the workers and \\"fair profits\\" for the employers *Maintenance of the unity of the British Empire *A social policy that would ensure \\"a contented, patriotic race\\". *A process to allow for the demobilisation of soldiers and sailors and their reintegration into civilian life. Membership Several Conservative MPs joined the party, including Col Richard Hamilton Rawson, Alan Burgoyne, Douglas George Carnegie, Cooper, Croft, Viscount Duncannon and Rowland Hunt. At its peak in 1917, the party had seven MPs and eleven peers.Rubinstein, pp. 134‚Äì5 The newly formed party sought to widen its membership to include \\"men and women from all parties, not only in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, but throughout the British Empire\\". Liberal Unionist Party MP Edward Fitzroy and former Liberal MPs Edmund Broughton Barnard and Thomas Kincaid-Smith also joined, as did John Jenkins, the former premier of South Australia. The party was supported by the trade unionist Joseph Havelock Wilson of the National Democratic and Labour Party, though he was never formally a member, as well as the economists William Cunningham and Herbert Foxwell.Rubinstein, p. 139. Rubinstein gives \\"H.F. Foxwell\\", but this is probably an error for \\"H.S.\\" Activities The National Party held public meetings and petitioned the Prime Minister Lloyd George. Its policies included raising the conscription age to fifty and introducing conscription to Ireland, the closing of German banks and businesses in the UK, the internment of enemy aliens, a guaranteed price for home-grown cereals, protectionism for British industry and counter air-raids against German towns. The close links the National Party alleged to exist between heads of companies and government departments which gave them contracts were attacked. In June 1918 its headquarters in King Street, London, and a number of regional offices were raided by military officers and government officials when the party came into possession of leaked documents. The National Party had policies to help the working class because \\"if you wish for a patriotic race, you must aim at a contented people, reared under healthy conditions...and with full scope for advancement\\". One of its slogans was \\"no restriction in wages in return for no restriction of output\\". Occasionally, it co-operated with the National Democratic and Labour Party. It published National Opinion from 1918 until 1923.F. W. S. Craig, Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections Whilst it encouraged working-class support, the party had a core of wealthy and upper-class members. The initial signatories of the declaration were heavily drawn from the aristocracy, senior businessmen, and the professional officer class, with very little working-class representation.Rubinstein, p. 137 Relationship with the Tariff Reform League At the 1917 annual general meeting of the Tariff Reform League, a protectionist organisation linked with a faction of the Conservative Party, an attempt was made to merge the league with the National Party. This led to angry scenes, and the motion was eventually withdrawn. The chairman of the League, Lord Duncannon, resigned and announced he was joining the new party. Islington East by-election The National Party's first electoral contest was in October 1917, when a by-election was called due to the death of the sitting member of parliament for Islington East. There was a political truce between the parties of the wartime coalition government, and the seat was expected to be filled without a contest. However, the party nominated Edmund Broughton Barnard, chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board to oppose the government candidate, Edward Smallwood. A third candidate, A Baker, was supported by the right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing and the Vigilante Society. The party did poorly, Barnard finishing in a distant third place with 513 votes (10.8%). The party held its inaugural meeting two days later and the president, Lord Beresford, declared himself \\"delighted\\" with the result which \\"would have the effect of putting more grit into those who were fighting\\" for the party. Proposed co-operation with the Labour Party The National Party leadership were implacably opposed to the two main parties in parliament: the \\"defunct\\" Conservatives and the \\"discredited\\" Liberals. Instead they sought to make an alliance with the Labour Party, which they saw as \\"the great party that was coming\\". They recognised that the five million working-class men under arms deserved improved conditions and status, and wished to \\"see what they could do to assist Labour\\". They also sought to make an alliance with the Merchant Seamen's League, supporting their aims of exacting punishment from the Germans for sinking ships in contravention of international law. 1918 general election Most of the party's members rejoined the Conservatives before the 1918 general election. Its remaining 23 candidates ran against the Lloyd George Coalition, two of whom were elected: Croft and Cooper. The candidates were supported by the Earl of Bessborough, his son the Lord Duncannon, the Lord Leith of Fyvie and the Duke of Somerset. The party received an aggregate total of around 94,000 votes, more than twice the number of votes taken by the fascist New Party in the 1930s.Rubinstein, pp. 135‚Äì6 =List of candidates= * Bethnal Green North East ‚Äî Lieut.

The sitting member for Ludlow, Rowland Hunt, had joined the National Party in 1917 but had rejoined the Conservatives by the time of the election, as had Edward FitzRoy in South Northamptonshire. Richard Hamilton Rawson, the National member in Reigate, died shortly before the election, in October, and the party did not stand a candidate in this seat. The party did not stand a candidate in Manchester Rusholme, but put up a candidate for the subsequent 1919 Manchester Rusholme by-election. Roger Bowan Crewdson took only 4% of the vote. Its final contest was the 1920 Dartford by-election, where Reginald Applin stood as a joint candidate with the Independent Parliamentary Group, and took 10.9% of the vote. The 25 results include 12 where the candidates forfeited their deposits by failing to win an eighth of the vote, costing ¬£1500 in total in 1918 this equates to ¬£ in , when adjusted for inflation. Disbandment In April 1921 the National Party was disbanded but was revived under the new name of the National Constitutional Association, led by Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill.Kenneth Lunn, Traditions of Intolerance, p.159 It held conventions and co-operated with the 4th Marquess of Salisbury to help end the Lloyd George Coalition.

After the election of Stephen B√°thory as king of Poland, Dudith left Krak√≥w and went to Wroc≈Çaw and later to Moravia, where he supported the Bohemian Brothers. Dudith maintained a correspondence with famous Anti-trinitarians such as Giorgio Blandrata, Jacob Paleologus and Fausto Sozzini. Mih√°ly Bal√°zs, an expert on Central-European Anti- trinitarianism, affirms that Paleologus in Krak√≥w lived in Dudith's house and left there to go to Transylvania. The theories of Blandrata, Sozzini and Ferenc D√°vid had a great influence on him. Nevertheless he always remained an Erasmian humanist, who condemned religious intolerance whether from Protestants or Catholics. Dudith died in 1589 in Wroc≈Çaw and was buried in the Saint-Elizabeth Lutheran Church.

It was written by journalist Richard Preston, also author of the best-selling book The Hot Zone (1994), about ebolavirus outbreaks in Africa and Reston, Virginia and the U.S. government's response to them. The book is primarily an account of the Smallpox Eradication Program (1967‚Äì1980), the ongoing perception by the U.S. government that smallpox is still a potential bioterrorism agent, and the controversy over whether or not the remaining samples of smallpox virus in Atlanta and Moscow (the \\"demon\\" in the freezer) should be finally destroyed. However, the writer was overtaken by events‚Äîthe 9/11 attacks and the anthrax letter incidents (called \\"Amerithrax\\"), both in 2001‚Äîand so much of the book interweaves the anthrax investigation with the smallpox material in a manner some critics have said is \\"awkward\\"\\"Scary stuff, but here's where 'Demon' gets klutzy. Boxed in by the competition‚Äîwhich has already covered a lot of this ground‚ÄîPreston is forced into massive temporal jumps. After the anthrax attacks on Sen. Tom Daschle's office in October 2001, he flashes back to a 1970s smallpox outbreak in Germany. Then to the prehistoric origins of the virus.

Then it's off to an examination of the Soviet bio-weapons program in 1989.\\" Fierman, Daniel, \\"Review: Gripping book about smallpox\\". Entertainment Weekly. October 7, 2002. and somewhat \\"disjointed\\".According to the book's author, there was a mistaken assumption in some reviews regarding why 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax events were in a book primarily devoted to smallpox. The author's website explains it: (see About Richard Preston a few paragraphs before the end of this long, but enlightening, webpage)\\"At its worst, the book sometimes feels disjointed, as if Preston is trying to weave several excellent but separate short stories into the whole cloth of a novel.\\" Walter, Chip, \\"The Demon in the Freezer by Richard Preston\\", Review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sunday, November 24, 2002. Synopsis * Section 1, \\"Something in the Air\\", begins with a day-by-day account of the anthrax letter attacks in Florida and Washington, D.C., for the period 2 to 15 October 2001. Robert Stevens, a photo retoucher for the tabloid The Sun, was a victim and US Senator Tom Daschle was an intended victim. The facts of the FBI, the CDC and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) are detailed. * Section 2, \\"The Dreaming Demon\\", looks back to an outbreak of smallpox at St Walburga Hospital in Meschede, Germany. The successful efforts organized by local public health authorities and the WHO‚Äîincluding a textbook example of ring vaccination containment‚Äîare described. * Section 3, \\"To Bhola Island\\", describes the varieties and evolution of poxviruses and the history of smallpox in particular. The story of the SEP (Smallpox Eradication Program, referred to throughout as \\"the Eradication\\"), led by DA Henderson and others is recounted. The more personal story of physician, counterculture figure, and future virtual community pioneer Lawrence Brilliant is told as his Indian guru, Neem Karoli Baba, exhorts him in 1970 to join the SEP and \\"go eradicate smallpox\\". (Brilliant ended up fighting the outbreak at the Tatanagar Railway Station in Bihar.) Finally, the Maximum Containment Facility (MCF) of the CDC in Atlanta is described. * Section 4, \\"The Other Side of the Moon\\", begins with an account of the 1989 defection to the United Kingdom of Vladimir Pasechnik, the first Soviet bioweaponeer to flee to the West. Pasechnik described Biopreparat, the Soviet biological weapons program, to MI6, including their genetically modified, antibiotic resistant plague and their smallpox program at the site known as Vector. The fact that the Russians had ICBMs armed with both plague and smallpox is revealed. Various biological weapon facilities in Russia and Iraq are described. Finally, the history and work of the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Infections is related. This group of the WHO has been hotly debated since 1980 over the fate of the remaining samples of smallpox in the last two official repositories. DA Henderson has been in favor of destruction, while US Army scientist Peter Jahrling has been against it on the basis that further research is needed since smallpox almost certainly exists (he believes) outside of the repositories. * Section 5, \\"A Woman with a Peaceful Life\\", tells the story of USAMRIID microbiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Lisa E. Hensley, who was originally recruited to do Ebola work. A January 2000 accident in the AA4 \\"Hot Suite\\" that Hensley experienced, along with the protocols that followed it, is described. The efforts of USAMRIID scientists to get approval to do smallpox research on animals is described including the FDA's \\"animal efficacy rule\\" and the WHO General Assembly's provisional permission to do research for three years (1999‚Äì2002). A \\"Monkey Cabinet\\" is designed at USAMRIID and CDC for use in the possible investigation of the question of whether animals can be infected with smallpox. The development of a lethal, genetically engineered mousepox virus (the Jackson-Ramshaw virus) and its implications for bioterrorism are described. Finally, the \\"awakening\\" of the smallpox at the CDC's MCF West in 2001 by US Army investigators to induce smallpox disease in monkeys for the first time is dramatically recounted. * Section 6, \\"The Demon's Eyes\\", continues the story of the induction of smallpox disease in monkeys at the CDC in 2001. It was determined that the Harper strain of smallpox kills monkeys slowly while the India strain kills them quickly. This was the first time that smallpox had ever been shown capable of infecting non-humans. Of eight monkeys infected, seven died‚Äîsix of hemorrhagic smallpox and one of the classic pustular type. There follows a discussion of the need and justification for animal-use smallpox experiments. The emergency evacuation of the Army workers in the MCF West on 9/11 is described. * Section 7, \\"The Anthrax Skulls\\", relates the atmosphere at the Department of Health and Human Services and their actions at the time of the 9/11 attacks. The story of the Amerithrax investigations is picked up again in day-by-day detail for the period 16 to 25 October 2001. The response by the FBI, HHS, DOJ, CIA and the White House are detailed. Actions at USAMRIID and USAMRMC are also described. (USAMRIID became the FBI's reference lab for forensic evidence related to the bioterror incident.) The events leading to Dr. Steven Hatfill becoming a DOJ \\"person of interest\\" are related. Finally, the indignation of Alfred Sommer, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, at the news of the Army animal smallpox experiments is described as well as a reiteration of DA Henderson's opposition to the same. * Section 8, \\"Superpox\\", begins with a description of an attempt at replication of the Jackson-Ramshaw virus at a lab at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine by Mark Buller working for USAMRIID. The potential for a similarly engineered \\"super-smallpox\\" virus for use by a terrorist is examined. The procedure for the transfection of an interleukin-4 gene into a mousepox virus is described. Finally, an unusual artifact‚Äîthe preserved arm of a three- or four-year-old child with classic smallpox lesions, discovered in 1999 and now housed at USAMRIID‚Äîis described. This leads the author to muse that \\"the dream of the total eradication had failed\\", because although we could eradicate smallpox from nature, \\"we could not uproot the virus from the human heart\\".

The station is owned and operated by iHeartMedia and licensed by the (U.S.) Federal Communications Commission to broadcast from Cocoa Beach, Florida (though the studio is located in Maitland, Florida). WTKS-FM's transmission tower is in Bithlo, Florida. Programming Most of the programs are designed to appeal to young adults. The nights and weekend programming is alternative rock. Over the past six years, parent iHeartMedia has picked shows from this station to be a part of XM Radio's Extreme XM channel 152.. WTKS broadcasts an urban contemporary format, branded as 104.5 The Beat, on its HD2 subchannel, which is also simulcast on translator W283AN 104.5 FM Altamonte Springs. History 104.1 FM began operations in 1962 as WRKT-FM with an automated jazz format, and was the sister station to WRKT (now WKQK). The station was owned by C. Sweet Smith. In 1967, the station changed formats to progressive rock with the new calls WKPE; the station was initially automated, but eventually added more live announcers. WKPE reverted to the WRKT calls in 1977 with a Top 40 format as \\"Rocket 104,\\" then shifting its format to Adult Contemporary in 1980. Guy Gannett purchased WRKT-FM in 1981 with the intent of upgrading the 30,000-watt station to 100,000 watts from a new tower near Bithlo and serve the Orlando market. The calls were changed that year to WSSP. A beautiful music format was planned, but WSSP initially adopted a country format as Brevard's Stereo Country 104. The country format was a temporary measure until the upgrade of the station's signal could be finalized. The move to Bithlo was completed in 1985, and WSSP became beautiful music WSSPer 104 (\\"whisper\\"). For a number of years, \\"WSSPer\\" was one of the most popular radio stations in Orlando, often ranking as the #1 station 12+ in the market and posting shares as high as 17% in certain dayparts. However, by the early 1990s, the station's ratings were down, and WSSP switched to a Hot AC format as WZTU, U104.1, on May 3, 1991, in the hopes of raising ratings and revenue. \\"U104.1\\" failed miserably. Later that year, Gannett sold its radio stations in Orlando and Miami to concentrate on its television properties. WZTU was acquired by Paxson Communications Corporation, headed by Lowell \\"Bud\\" Paxson (founder of the Home Shopping Network and later PAX TV). Paxson switched WZTU to CHR as WHVE \\"One Hundred- Four One, The Wave\\", at 7:45 a.m. on May 29,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-05-29.pdf but despite the programming expertise of Bill Pasha of WAPE-FM in Jacksonville, ratings and revenues did not increase; the station came in 14th place in its first ratings book. \\"The Wave\\" format was dropped on August 17, 1992, after only just three months. WHVE then changed its calls to WWNZ-FM, and began simulcasting WWNZ's talk format, though it would air a few separate shows. Paxson sold WWNZ-FM to Press Broadcasting, which also owned WKCF, in 1993. In May of that year, Press Broadcasting initiated the WTKS calls and the \\"Real Radio\\" format, which was talk shows during the week (including Howard Stern from May 1994 through February 2004) and alternative rock on the weekend. Real Radio was created by Sabo Media CEO Walter Sabo for Press Broadcasting. The station was sold back to Paxson in 1996 and then came under the umbrella of Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 1997. On June 21, 2007, Clear Channel announced the request of transfer for their entire Orlando cluster into the Aloha Station Trust upon the consummation of the impending company buyout. WTKS held an annual \\"Kicks for Guns\\" program in association with the Orlando Police Department where citizens could exchange guns, no questions asked, for shoes. The program made international headlines when the 2007 exchange managed to net a surface-to-air rocket launcher. WTKS-HD2 originally aired a simulcast of WFLF, and their HD3 subchannel aired a simulcast of WYGM. WTKS stopped simulcasting WYGM on their HD3 subchannel on May 6, 2012, with the WYGM simulcast moving to WJRR-HD2, resulting in the demise of \\"Channel X\\". On February 12, 2014, the WFLF simulcast moved from W283AN 104.5 to W273CA 102.5 (displacing smooth jazz), and WTKS-HD2 flipped to its current urban format as \\"The Beat\\", filling the void after long-time urban station WJHM flipped to Top 40 the previous day. =Previous shows= SBK Live originally aired from 7:00pm to 11:00pm Monday through Friday.

They support the German Humanist scholar Johann Reuchlin and they mock the doctrines and modes of living of the scholastics and monks, mainly by pretending to be letters from fanatic Christian theologians discussing whether all Jewish books should be burned as un-Christian or not.  Background  The work was based upon the real-life public dispute between German humanist Johann Reuchlin and certain Dominican friars, especially the formerly Jewish convert Johannes Pfefferkorn who had obtained Imperial authority from Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I to burn all known copies of the Talmud in 1509. The title is a reference to Reuchlin's 1514 book Epistolae clarorum virorum (English: Letters of famous/bright men) which provided a collection of letters to Reuchlin on scholarly and intellectual matters from eminent German humanists such as Ulrich von Hutten, Johann Crotus, Konrad Mutian, Helius Eobanus Hessus, and others, to show that his position in the controversy with the monks was approved by the learned. The Latin adjective obscurus (\\"dark, hidden, obscure\\") is the opposite of clarus (\\"bright, famous, obvious\\") used in the title of Reuchlin's book.  Structure and presumptive authors  Most of the letters found in Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum are addressed to Hardwin von Gr√§tz in Deventer and contain mock accusations against him, such as allegation that he had been intimate with Johannes Pfefferkorn's wife (Letter XII) and that Gratius had defecated his pants in public (letter XL). The letters profess to be written by certain ecclesiastics and professors in Cologne and other towns of Germany. Gr√§tz had made himself odious to the liberal minds of the time by what they saw as his arrogant pretension, his determined hostility to the spirit of the age, and his lax morality. The first issue of the work contained 41 letters, but more were added later. The collection was published anonymously, and the authorship has been a fertile subject of controversy, but the main portion of the letters are attributed to the humanists Crotus Rubeanus a.k.a. Johannes J√§ger, who is said to have originated the idea and the title; Ulrich von Hutten, who contributed mainly to the second volume; Erasmus; and Reuchlin. The work is credited with hastening the Protestant Reformation.  Bans and papal excommunication  The book was banned in many places, and in regard of the rise of Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation, Pope Leo X excommunicated the authors, readers, and disseminators of the Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum in 1517, by citing the fact that the discussed matter of burning all Jewish books, especially the Talmud, had never been held as a majority view among Christian scholars.  Legacy  The modern term obscurantism derives from the title of this work. As the theologians in the book intended to burn \\"un-Christian\\" works, Enlightenment philosophers used the term for conservative, especially religious enemies of progressive Enlightenment and its concept of the liberal spread of knowledge.

Watchdog journalism usually takes on a form of beat reporting about specific aspects and issues  Role  In the course of their work, watchdog journalists gather information about wrongdoings of people in power and deliver it to the publicCoronel, S. S. (2008): The Media as Watchdog, Harvard. so the public can understand what happens in society and stop wrongdoings. To do their job, maintaining a certain distance from people in power is necessary to challenge the actions of people in power. Watchdog journalism is different from propagandist journalists, who often report articles from a government's perspective. Due to watchdog journalism's unique features, it also often works as the fourth estate. The general issues, topics, or scandals that watchdog journalists cover are political corruption and any wrongdoings of people in power such as government officials or corporation executives. One of the important things that watchdog journalists have to do is uncover hidden evidence about wrongdoings. = Three dimensions of operationalization = The role of the press to be a \\"watchdog\\" and monitor a government's actions has been one of the fundamental components of a democratic society. Ettema and Glasser (1998) argue that watchdog journalism's most important role is that their ‚Äústories implicitly demand the response of public officials.‚Äù Playing a role as a Fourth Estate, watchdog journalism is able to force governments to meet their obligations to the public by publicizing several issues such as scandals, corruption, and failure to address needs of the public. Mellado (2015) identified and developed three dimensions of operationalization of the watchdog role: the intensity of scrutiny, journalistic voice, and the source of news event. *Intensity of scrutiny: Watchdog journalism has a few levels of scrutiny in terms of its reporting style. First of all, at the lowest level, questions and interrogations are a key way to investigate people with power. At a next level, denunciation is still not necessarily needed. But it is consisted of more obvious and somewhat aggressive questions and interrogations. Lastly, the highest level of scrutiny involves the strategy which is designed for people who are investigated to confess their wrongdoing. So at this level, a variety of evidence of wrongdoing is ready to be used. *Journalistic voice: Watchdog journalism needs a few types of voices which are required to address the scrutiny. Specifically, journalists' own voice or a third party's voice is the most general type. In the case of a detached orientation of watchdog journalism, it is likely to use a third party's voice to question, criticize, and denounce wrongdoings what people with power do rather than using journalists' voices. *Source of news event: There is a specific type of event that watchdog journalism is interested in to question, criticize, and denounce. Specifically, not only corruptions of the relationship between people with power and media, but also issues about judiciary processes or external investigations are likely to be handled by a detached orientation of watchdog journalism. = Predictors of watchdog role performance = Depending on the differences in a social and organizational level, a performance of the journalistic role also changes. In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism. *Democracy: Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence. Also, a low level of press censorship, state intervention, and institutional control are ensured at the same time. *Audience orientation: Audience orientation is one of the factors that affects the performance of journalistic roles. For instance, in China, market newspapers are more likely to play a role as the watchdog journalism than an official newspaper, which is supposed to publicize corruptions of people with power such as how they misuse existing policy or law, does At this point, there is a huge difference in reporting styles between popular press and elite press. *Media political leaning: The political orientation of the journalism is closely associated to the performance of the watchdog role. To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do. In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals. *News beats: The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization. For instance, based on what Reich (2012) found, journalists who deal with political issues are highly likely to act as watchdogs than ones who cover business issues. Similar tendency appears in other countries including China, Chile, and Spain. To be specific, in these countries, watchdog journalism can be found in the field that covers the political scandals, while business and economy journalists are less likely to act as watchdog. = Detached watchdog = Detached watchdog journalism, one of the four identified journalism cultures, puts emphasis on neutrality, fairness, objectivity, and impartiality. This is the most familiar and pervasive type of a few forms of watchdog journalism. Detached watchdog refers to observing issues in a detached manner. So it pursues a different approach in scrutinizing wrongdoings and publicizing them to the public from what interventionist approach does. In addition this is the reason why characteristics including neutrality, fairness, objectivity, and impartiality are important. But it does not mean that watchdog journalists do not take a skeptical and critical action. The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland. In the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny. Since the detached watchdog journalism generally consists of third parties (or sources) that question, criticize, and denounce wrongdoings, it tends to play a passive role in terms of investigating people in power. In this regard, one of the characteristics that distinguishes between detached and the other type of approaches named interventionist watchdog journalism is the type of event that journalists handle. The type of event that prompts the journalists to act as a watchdog to scrutinizing people in power by questioning and criticizing is different based on the approaches. Within liberal media systems, the phenomenon that journalists are highly likely to take the detached approach of the watchdog journalism can be often seen because of liberal media systems‚Äô a few unique features such as the factuality and objectivity. = Indicator of detached orientation and operationalization = * Questioning by sources: People other than journalists can question people in power by expressing opinions and giving statements or quotes. * Criticism by sources: People other than journalists can criticize those with power can through expressing negative opinions or giving a statement or quote. * Denunciation by sources: People other than journalists can provide a testimony or an evidence about something that people with power do and say. * External investigation: Corruptions, scandals, or issues of people in power are often scrutinized and covered by the news media even though journalists do not handle them directly. * Questioning by the journalist: Journalists can work as a watchdog by checking the legitimacy and integrity of people in power's action. * Criticism by the journalist: The journalists are allowed to judge and condemn what people in power do by making assertions. * Denunciation by the journalist: The journalists can denounce and accuse something that is hidden illegally by people in power by making assertions. * Reporting of conflict: The journalists can bring a source, an institution, or people in power that have to be scrutinized to the table.  In practice  The logo of the Washington Post Historically, a lot of examples have proven that watchdog journalism has the power to dislodge corrupt people in power from their positions. One of the most famous examples is how coverage of the Watergate scandal, done by watchdog journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, led to resignation of the U.S President Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974. Bob Woodward, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post = Washington Post's coverage of Watergate scandal = The Watergate scandal was one of the biggest political scandals in the United States. It involved Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former FBI and CIA agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the Watergate Office Building, Washington D.C. What they were trying to do was to plant a bug for Richard Nixon‚Äôs winning the re-election in exchange for receiving the cash. After 5 perpetrators were arrested, several revelation and investigation were progressed until 1973 and it made the House decide to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The Oval Office tapes, the significant evidence of the Watergate scandal, revealed that Nixon tried to cover up what he did to win the re-election such as breaking-in and using federal officials. As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee. He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974. Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post = The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal = The case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there‚Äôs the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon‚Äôs re-election committee. In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post‚Äôs investigative journalists named Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein played a really important role. They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named Judy Hoback Miller. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon‚Äôs re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy. The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn‚Äôt reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein. Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly. And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr. = Crisis in watchdog journalism = University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo Journalism‚Äôs role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living. However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power. To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an Associated Press's research which was conducted through data gathered by the University of North Carolina. And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. University of Notre Dame seal In addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community. Based on the research conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Notre Dame, it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people‚Äôs wages and in payrolls. People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces. For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told. An extreme example is provided by the City of Bell scandal: Bell, California is a modest income community of roughly 37,000 in Los Angeles County. In 1999 or shortly thereafter the local newspaper died. In 2010 the Los Angeles Times found that the city was near bankruptcy in spite of having atypically high property tax rates. Part-time city council members collected almost $100,000 a year. The Chief of Police's salary was over $450,000, roughly double that of the Los Angeles Chief of Police, whose department included almost 10,000 officers vs. 48 for Bell. The city manager made almost $800,000, almost double that of the President of the United States.

Production resumed in 2017 with the introduction of a limited-edition electric-powered Type 506. Types 501, 502 and 505 The original design of the ƒåezeta is unique amongst scooters. It is unusually long for a two-wheeled vehicle at and has a distinctive torpedo-shaped body with full-length running boards and a long seat that lifted to reveal a substantial luggage compartment, using space that in most scooters is occupied by the fuel tank. This made the ƒåezeta ideal for two people and popular with young Czechs and their lovers. The front mudguard is fixed to the body and fully streamlined into the leg shields. The fuel tank is positioned above the front wheel, with the headlight fitted into a recess and a luggage rack on the flat top surface. The scooter was originally powered by the 175 cc ƒåZ two-stroke single-cylinder motorcycle engine, giving a top speed of and fuel economy of 3.2 litres/100km. The engine was modified for the enclosed scooter by having a drive pulley on the crankshaft driving a fan by means of a Vee belt. There were four foot- operated gears. The original petrol versions were given type numbers that indicate their features. The first production started with Type 501, then with advancements like a starter motor the Type 502 was later released. The 501 model, built from 1957 to 1959, had the rear wheel supported on one side only and suspended by a rubber block. The later 502 model had a full fork with motorcycle shock absorbers. These types contain sub-types to further indicate their features, for example Type 502/00 is a 12V model with electric starter, and a Type 502/01 is a 6V model with foot-crank starting. A three-wheeled utility version, the Type 505 (or 'rickshaw'), was built starting in 1960. This vehicle used mechanical components and front bodywork from the 502. A popular sidecar was also produced, though in limited numbers ‚Äì approximately 900 in total ‚Äì by Drupol in Sti≈ô√≠n near Prague. This was sold as the 'Druzeta', the name coming as a combination of the two companies' names. N-Zeta A New Zealand assembled N-Zeta scooter In New Zealand a local company, JNZ Manufacturing Ltd assembled the 'ƒåezeta' under the name 'N-Zeta'. The point of New Zealand production was to avoid the duties placed on imported motor vehicles. Duty could be minimised by assembling locally, and using New Zealand parts wherever possible. The company apparently achieved 25% New Zealand manufacture by value, with tyres, seat, trim, lights, controls etc. and produced 4,000 scooters during the early 1960s.Could the iconic N-Zeta scooter return with electric power?, Paul Owen, Stuff.Co.NZ, 09:51, Apr 25 2017, retrieved 19 October 2018 Type 506 ƒåezeta 506 prototype (2015) The Czech company ƒåezeta Motors s.r.o. was launched in 2013 for the development of an electric ƒåezeta ‚Äì called the 'Type 506' ‚Äì by British expat Neil Eamonn Smith. He stated the company's mission was to \\"build the world's most desirable scooter\\". The Type 506 was developed from 2013-2017. The bike was constructed with a steel and aluminium frame and composite bodyshell to save weight. Local engineering companies and the Czech Technical University in Prague partnered with ƒåezeta to develop advanced technologies for the throttles, battery, and ECU-CAN system. The final production scooter honoured the classic iconic design and sported up to 11kW power and a 8.5kWh Panasonic battery to give it the best speed () and range () of any A1 scooter in the world. Pre-orders began in March 2017, the 60th anniversary of ƒåezeta. On 15 September 2017, the Czech Ministry of Transport confirmed the homologation of the Type 506 as the country's first serial-production electric vehicle. Production began in April 2018 in Prostejov in the historic Wikov factory. It is planned to make 60 of the 'first series' of the Type 506. In Summer 2018 the company completed one of the Czech Republic's most successful crowdfunding campaigns, raising 20m Czech Koruna (approx 800,000 euro) in just 10 days. These funds financed the launching of production of the Type 506. The company planned to start a project to build a second-series Type 506 in 2020-21. Smith states that this will be aimed at a premium mass-market with a price -40% lower than the first-series, and able to compete with Vespa's electric scooter. In October 2020, the company was offered for sale. Smith stated he had been convinced by the company's co-owners that it would be in the best interests of the company to sell it to a stronger partner who has the resources to realise its potential. https://www.autorevue.cz/cezeta-je-oficialne-na-prodej- elektricka-prasata-hledaji-nove- majitele?fbclid=IwAR0GZSCdkpFxPCQ19TG7YCKKiMGPmhgzIVSanWGT4XQ0cEb-l700izJODPI See also *List of motorcycles by type of engine *List of motorcycles with sidecars References External links * ƒçezeta motors s.r.o. company website - www.cezeta.com * ƒçezeta type 506 review on BBC autos - www.bbc.com/autos/story/20151231-electric-power-for-an-icon-of-the-atomic-age Category:Motor scooters Category:Electric motorcycles Category:Electric scooters Category:Scooter manufacturers ","title":"ƒåezeta"},{"id":"2526986","title":"Isotopes of rhodium"},{"id":"2526988","title":"Isotopes of ruthenium"},{"id":"2526990","title":"Isotopes of technetium"},{"id":"2526992","title":"Isotopes of molybdenum"},{"id":"2526996","text":"Barren Island is an island located in the Andaman Sea. It is the only confirmed active volcano in South Asia, and the only active volcano along a chain of volcanoes from Sumatra to Myanmar. It is a part of the Indian Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and lies about northeast of the territory's capital, Port Blair. History An illustration of the island in 1789 The first recorded eruption of the volcano dates back to 1787. Since then, the volcano has erupted more than ten times, with the most recent one being in 2017. After the first recorded eruption in 1787, further eruptions were recorded in 1789, 1795, 1803-04, and 1852. After nearly one and half century of dormancy, the island had another eruption in 1991 that lasted six months and caused considerable damage. The 1991 eruption was particularly harmful to the island's fauna. A team from the Geological Survey of India visited Barren Island on 8‚Äì9 April 1993 to assess the impact of the eruption on the distribution, habit, and abundance of animal species. The report found that the eruption had reduced the number of bird species and their population. The team only observed 6 of the 16 known species of birds on the island. The Pied Imperial Pigeon (Ducula bicolor) was the most abundant among the 6 species observed. In a survey conducted at night, the team spotted one rat species (Rattus rattus) and 51 species of insects from eight orders. The report also noted that the volcano was still emitting gas at the time. There were eruptions in 1994-95 and 2005-07, the latter considered to be linked to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. A lighthouse that was established in 1993 was destroyed by the recent eruptions. A team from the National Institute of Oceanography spotted the volcano erupting on 23 January 2017. Abhay Mudholkar, the head of the team, said, \\"The volcano is erupting in small episodes of about five to ten minutes. During the day, only ash clouds were observed. However, after sundown, red lava fountains were spewing from the crater into the atmosphere and hot lava flowed streaming down its slopes.\\" Based on Argon- argon dating of samples from Barren Island it is now established that the oldest subaerial lava flows of the volcano are 1.6 million years old and the volcano is located on an oceanic crust which is roughly 106 million years old.Ray et al., Bull Volcanol 77: 57, 2015 All recorded eruptions lie on the low end of the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The 2017 eruption was recorded as a 2 on the index. Geography This volcanic island stands in the midst of a volcanic belt on the edge of the Indian and Burmese tectonic plates. Narcondam Island is a dormant volcano in the area, apart from volcanic seamounts like Alcock and Sewell. All the historical and recent eruptions (1789 and after) are confined within and around an active polygenetic cinder cone in a wide caldera that was formed by the Pleistocene collapse of a primitive cone of a stratovolcano. The remnant of the primitive volcanic cone forms a precipitous cliff around the island (commonly referred to as caldera wall), with a break towards the west. The highest elevation on the island is , with most of the primitive volcano underwater (standing on the seafloor below sea level). The island is in diameter, with a total surface area of . Biodiversity True to its name, it has large areas of barren landscape. It is uninhabited by humans, though it has a small population of goats. Also birds, bats like flying foxes and a few rodent species such as rats are known to survive the harsh conditions. Tourist Attractions The waters surrounding Barren Island are reputed to be among the world's top scuba diving destinations. Major attractions here are the crystal clear visibility, Manta Rays, interesting basalt formations, topography of past lava flows and fast growing coral gardens. This dive destination is remote but can be accessed by either a live aboard ship or with scuba-operators based at Havelock Island.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Scuba-dive-at-an-active- volcano-on-Barren-Island-in-Andamans/articleshow/25837581.cms Administration It belongs to the North and Middle Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Modules based on EnOcean technology combine micro energy converters with ultra low power electronics, and enable wireless communications between batteryless wireless sensors, switches, controllers and gateways. In March 2012, the EnOcean wireless standard was ratified as the international standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10. The standard covers the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) layers 1-3 which are the physical, data link and networking layers. The energy harvesting wireless modules are manufactured and marketed by the company EnOcean which is based in Oberhaching, Germany. EnOcean offers its technology and licenses for the patented features within the EnOcean Alliance framework. Technology EnOcean technology is based on the energetically efficient exploitation of slight mechanical motion and other potentials from the environment, such as indoor light and temperature differences, using the principles of energy harvesting. In order to transform such energy fluctuations into usable electrical energy, electromagnetic, solar, and thermoelectric energy converters are used. EnOcean-based products (such as sensors and light switches) perform without batteries and are engineered to operate maintenance-free. The radio signals from these sensors and switches can be transmitted wirelessly over a distance of up to 300 meters in the open and up to 30 meters inside buildings. Early designs from the company used piezo generators, but were later replaced with electromagnetic energy sources to reduce the operating force (3.5 newtons), and increase the service life to 100 operations a day for more than 25 years. Indoor Light Converter for Solar Energy Harvesting EnOcean wireless data packets are relatively small, with the packet being only 14 bytes long and are transmitted at 125 kbit/s. RF energy is only transmitted for the 1's of the binary data, reducing the amount of power required. Three packets are sent at pseudo-random intervals reducing the possibility of RF packet collisions. Modules optimized for switching applications transmit additional data packets on release of push-button switches, enabling other features such as light dimming to be implemented. The transmission frequencies used for the devices are 902 MHz, 928.35 MHz, 868.3 MHz and 315 MHz. Ultra Low Power DC/DC Converter for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting On May 30, 2017 EnOcean unveiled a series of light switches utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy radio (2.4 GHz). Application examples One example of the technology is a battery-free wireless light switch. Advantages are that it saves time and material by eliminating the need to install wires between the switch and controlled device, e.g., a light fixture. It also reduces noise on switched circuits, as the switching is performed locally at the load. Other lighting applications include occupancy sensors, light sensors and key card switches. Furthermore, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) applications such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, CO2 sensors, metering sensors already use EnOcean‚Äôs energy harvesting wireless technology. Company EnOcean GmbH is a venture-funded spin-off company of Siemens AG founded in 2001. It is a German company headquartered in Oberhaching, near Munich, which currently employs 60 employees in Germany and the USA. It is a technology supplier of self-powered modules (transmitters, receivers, transceivers, energy converter) to companies (e.g. Siemens Building Technologies, Distech Controls, Zumtobel, Omnio, Osram, Eltako, Wieland Electric, Pressac, Peha, Thermokon, Wago, Herga), which develop and manufacture products used in building automation (light, shading, hvac), industrial automation, and automotive industry (replacement of the conventional battery in tyre pressure sensors). The company won the Bavarian Innovation Prize 2002 for its technology, the award \\"Technology Pioneer 2006\\" by the World Economic Forum, the \\"Top-10 Product for 2007\\" award by Building GreenBuildingGreen Top-10 Product for 2007' and was among the global cleantech 100 in 2011.\\"The Guardian Global Cleantech 100\\" In November 2007, MK Electric, the manufacturer of consumer electrical fitments in the UK, adopted EnOcean technology for a wireless switches. In April 2012, EnOcean wireless technology was ratified as the international wireless standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 Information technology - Home Electronic Systems (HES) - Part 3-10: Wireless Short-Packet (WSP) protocol optimized for energy harvesting - Architecture and lower layer protocols. Alliance A group of companies including EnOcean, Texas Instruments, Omnio, Sylvania, Masco, and MK Electric formed the EnOcean Alliance in April 2008 as a non-profit, mutual benefit corporation. The EnOcean Alliance aims to internationalise this technology, and is dedicated to creating interoperability between the products of OEM partners, in order to bring about the existence of a broad range of interoperable wireless monitoring and controlling products for use in and around residential, commercial and industrial buildings. For this the EnOcean Alliance has drawn up the application level protocols are referred to as EEPs (EnOcean Equipment Profiles). Together with the three lower levels of the international wireless standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 the Alliance lay the foundation for a fully interoperable, open wireless technology. More than 250 companies currently belong to the EnOcean Alliance. The headquarters of the organization is in San Ramon, California. Market research company WTRS estimated that EnOcean module shipments might reach $1.4B in 2013. Software automation EnOcean is newly supported by Fhem and ago control. Fhem and ago control are GPL licensed software suites for house automation. They are used to automate some common tasks in the household like switching lamps, shutters, heating, etc., and to log events like temperature, humidity, and power consumption. Both run as servers that are controlled via web front-end, telnet, command line, or TCP/IP directly.

There is also a very vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art scene, as well as cinema and photography. For a history of Persian visual art up to the early 20th century, see Persian art, and also Iranian architecture. The Persian Fine Arts =The Persian rug= From the yarn fiber to the colors, every part of the Persian rug is traditionally handmade from natural ingredients over the course of many months. The art of rug weaving in has its roots in the culture and customs of its people and their instinctive feelings. Weavers mix elegant patterns with a myriad of colors. The Iranian carpet is similar to the Persian garden: full of florae, birds, and beasts. The colors are usually made from wild flowers, and are rich in colors such as burgundy, navy blue, and accents of ivory. The proto-fabric is often washed in tea to soften the texture, giving it a unique quality. Depending on where the rug is made, patterns and designs vary. And some rugs, such as Gabbeh, and Gelim have a variations in their textures and number of knots as well. Out of about 2 million Iranians who work in the trade, 1.2 million are weavers producing the largest amount of hand woven artistic carpets in the world. exported $517 million worth of carpets in 2002. The exceptional craftsmanship in weaving these carpets and silken textile thus caught the attention of the likes of Xuanzang, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, and Jean Chardin. =Painting and miniature= Mullahs in the royal presence. The painting style is markedly Qajari. Oriental historian Basil Gray believes Iran (Persia) \\" has o unique [sic] art to the world which is excellent in its kind\\". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting. Paintings of the Qajar period, are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by Reza Abbasi. Masters such as Kamal-ol-molk, further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when \\"Coffee House painting\\" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like. =Pottery and ceramics= Pottery Vessel, Fourth Millennium BC. The Sialk collection of Tehran's National Museum of Iran. Prominent archeologist Roman Ghirshman believes \\"the taste and talent of this people [Iranians] can be seen through the designs of their earthen wares\\". Of the thousands of archeological sites and historic ruins of Iran, almost every single one can be found to have been filled, at some point, with earthenware of exceptional quality. Thousands of unique vessels alone were found in Sialk and Jiroft sites. The occupation of the potter (\\"kuzeh gar\\") has a special place in Persian literature. =Music= During the course of Iran's recorded history, a unique distinctive music developed accompanied by numerous musical instruments, several of which came to be the first prototypes of some modern musical instruments of today. The earliest references to musicians in Iran are found in Susa and Elam in the 3rd millennium BC. Reliefs, sculptures, and mosaics such as those in Bishapur from periods of antiquity depict a vibrant musical culture. Persian music in its contemporary form has its inception in the Naseri era, who ordered the opening of a \\"House of Crafts,\\" where all master craftsmen would gather for designing instruments and practicing their art. =Literature= Iran is filled with tombs of poets and musicians, such as this one belonging to Rahi Mo'ayeri. An illustration of Iran's deep artistic heritage. Persian literature is by far the most stalwart expression of the Iranian genius. While there are interesting works in prose, it is poetry where the Iranian literature shines at its most. Flourishing over a period of more than a millennium, it was esteemed and imitated well beyond the confines of the Iranian homeland. The literature of Iran's direct and recently lost territories in the Caucasus (most notably Azerbaijan), as well as Turkey and indirectly the Mughal Empire developed under its influence. Some notable Iranian poets are: Ferdowsi, Khayyam, Hafiz, Attar, Sa'di, Nizami, Sanai, Rudaki, Rumi, Jami, Nima Yushij and Shahriar. =Environmental design= Architecture The architecture of Iran is one with an exceedingly ancient Persian tradition and heritage. As Arthur Pope put it, \\"the meaningful Impact of Persian architecture is versatile. Not overwhelming but dignified, magnificent and impressive\\". Persian gardens The tradition and style in the garden design of Persian gardens (Persian ÿ®ÿßÿ∫ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å) has influenced the design of gardens from Andalusia to India and beyond. The gardens of the Alhambra show the influence of Persian Paradise garden philosophy and style in a Moorish Palace scale from the era of Al-Andalus in Spain. The Taj Mahal is one of the largest Persian Garden interpretations in the world, from the era of the Mughal Empire in India. *Examples: see Category: Persian Gardens =Calligraphy= Persian calligraphy has several styles. Seen here is a \\"shekasteh\\" manuscript dated 1894, by Seyed Ali Akbar Golestaneh (ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿπŸÑ€å ÿß⁄©ÿ®ÿ± ⁄ØŸÑÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸá). A follower of the style of Darvish, his contemporaries were Mirza Hasan Isfahani (ŸÖ€åÿ±ÿ≤ÿß ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßÿµŸÅŸáÿßŸÜ€å), Mirza Kuchek Isfahani (ŸÖ€åÿ±ÿ≤ÿß ⁄©Ÿà⁄Ü⁄© ÿßÿµŸÅŸáÿßŸÜ€å), and Mohammad Ali Shirazi (ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿπŸÑ€å ÿ¥€åÿ±ÿßÿ≤€å). After his death, the Shekasteh style fell into stagnation until it was revived again later on in the 1970s. Says writer Will Durant: \\"Ancient Iranians with an alphabet of 36 letters, used skins and pen to write, Instead of earthen tablets\\". Such was the creativity spent on the art of writing. The significance of the art of calligraphy in works of pottery, metallic vessels, and historic buildings is such that they are deemed lacking without the adorning decorative calligraphy. Illuminations, and especially the Quran and works such as the Shahnameh, Divan Hafez, Golestan, Bostan et al. are recognized as highly invaluable because of their delicate calligraphy alone. Vast quantities of these are scattered and preserved in museums and private collections worldwide, such as the Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg and Washington's Freer Gallery of Art among many others. Styles: * Shekasteh * Nasta'liq *Naskh *Mohaqqaq =Tilework= The tilework is a unique feature of the blue mosques of . In the old days, Kashan (kash + an which literally means \\"land of tiles\\") and Tabriz were the two famous centers of Iranian mosaic and tile industry. =Cinema= With 300 international awards in the past 25 years, films from Iran continue to be celebrated worldwide. Few of the best known directors are Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Majid Majidi. A sample of Tabriz rugs Persian Silk Brocade. Persian Textile (The Golden Yarns of Zari - Brocade). Silk Brocade with Golden Thread (Golabetoon) =Metalwork (Ghalam-zani)= Iranian new Astrolabe Luristan bronzes, probably from around 1000-650 BCE, are a distinctive group of small objects decorated with figures of animals and human in inventive and vigorous poses. Khatam- kari An example of \\"khatam-kari\\" Delicate and meticulous marquetry, produced since the Safavid period: at this time, khatam was so popular in the court that princes learned this technique at the same level of music or painting. In the 18th and 19th centuries, katahm declined, before being stimulated under the reign of Reza Shah, with the creation of craft schools in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. \\"Khatam\\" means \\"incrustation\\", and \\"Khatam-kari\\" (), \\"incrustation work\\". This craft consists in the production of incrustation patterns (generally star shaped), with thin sticks of wood (ebony, teak, ziziphus, orange, rose), brass (for golden parts), camel bones (white parts). Ivory, gold or silver can also be used for collection objects. Sticks are assembled in triangular beams, themselves assembled and glued in a strict order to create a cylinder, 70 cm in diameter, whose cross-section is the main motif: a six-branch star included in a hexagon. These cylinders are cut into shorter cylinders, and then compressed and dried between two wooden plates, before being sliced for the last time, in 1 mm wide tranches. These sections are ready to be plated and glued on the object to be decorated, before lacquer finishing. The tranche can also be softened through heating in order to wrap around objects. Many objects can be decorated in this fashion, such as: jewellery/decorative boxes, chessboards, cadres, pipes, desks, frames or some musical instruments. Khatam can be used on Persian miniature, realizing true work of art. Coming from techniques imported from China and improved by Persian know-how, this craft existed for more than 700 years and is still perennial in Shiraz and Isfahan. Mina-kari An example of Meenakari from Iran. Enamel working and decorating metals with colorful and baked coats is one of the distinguished courses of art in Isfahan . Mina, is defined as some sort of glasslike colored coat which can be stabilized by heat on different metals particularly copper. Although this course is of abundant use industrially for producing metal and hygienic dishes, it has been paid high attention by painters, goldsmiths and metal engravers since long times ago. In the world, it is categorized into three kinds as below: #painting enamel #Charkhaneh or chess like enamel #Cavity enamel. What of more availability in Isfahan is the painting enamel of which a few have remained in the museums of Iran and abroad indicting that Iranian artists have been interested in this art and used it in their metal works since the Achaemenian and the Sassanid dynasties. The enamels being so delicate, we do not have many of them left from the ancient times. Some documents indicate that throughout the Islamic civilization of and during the Seljuk, Safavid and Zand dynasties there have been outstanding enameled dishes and materials. Most of the enameled dishes related to the past belong to the Qajar dynasty between the years 1810‚Äì1890 AD. There have also remained some earrings. Bangles, boxes, water pipe heads, vases, and golden dishes with beautiful paintings in blue and green colors from that time, Afterwards, fifty years of stagnation caused by the World War I and the social revolution followed. However, again the enamel red color, having been prepared, this art was fostered from the quantity and quality points of view through the attempts bestowed by Ostad Shokrollah Sani'e zadeh, the outstanding painter of Isfahan in 1935 and up to then for forty years. Now after a few years of stagnation since 1992, this art has started to continue its briskness having a lot of distinguished artists working in this field. To prepare an enameled dish, the following steps are used. First, choose the suitable dish by the needed size and shape which is usually made by a coppersmith. Then, it is bleached through enameled working which is known as the first coat. It is then put into a seven hundred and fifty degree furnace. At this stage, the enameled metal will be coated with better enamels a few more times and again reheated. The dish is then ready to be painted. The Isfahanian artists, having been inspired by their traditional plans as arabesque, khataii (flowers and birds) and using fireproof paints and special brushes, have made painting of Isfahan monuments such as step, the enameled material is put into the furnace again and heated at five hundred degrees. This causes the enameled painting to be stabilized on the undercoat, creating a special \\"shining\\" effect. Most of today's enamel workings are performed on dishes, vases, boxes and frames in various size. =Relief and sculpture= The Qajarid reliefs of Tangeh Savashi were made by order of Fath Ali Shah. Relief carving has a history dating back thousands of years, especially in rock reliefs. Elamite reliefs are still to be found in Iran with Persepolis being a mecca of relief creations of antiquity. =Other handicrafts= *Galesh *Giveh *Iranian Termeh *Persian Jewels *Ghalamkar See also *Azerbaijani art *Culture of Iran *Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization *Graffiti in Tehran *International rankings of Iran *Iran's House of Art *Iranian modern and contemporary art *List of Persian painters *Persian theatre *Qajar art *Safavid art  Gallery  File:ŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπ ⁄©ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜ15.jpgIranian Architecture, Jameh Mosque of Kerman File:ŸÜŸÇÿßÿ¥€åÿÆÿ∑.jpgCalligram File:Parthian Man Statue, National museum of Iran.jpgParthian Man Statue, National museum of Iran File:ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ ÿ¨ŸÖÿ¥€åÿØ 1.jpgAchaemenid Architecture File:ÿ®ÿßÿ∫ ÿØŸÑ⁄Øÿ¥ÿßÿå ÿ¥€åÿ±ÿßÿ≤ 1.jpgPersian gardens, Delgoshah Garden File:Shazdeh Mahan Garden, Kerman, Iran (42852081561).jpgPersian Gaedens, Shazdeh Garden File:ŸáŸÜÿ± ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≤ŸÜÿØŸàÿ≤€å ÿ≤ŸÜ ÿ®ŸÑŸà⁄Ü.jpgalt=Suzani (textile)Suzan Doozi File:Kirmanrug.jpgKerman Carpet File:Laver Kirman ‚ÄúTree of Life‚Äù, 4ft 4in x 7ft 0in.

This is opposed to a black route, which is a route that is illegal in both ends. Also common in telecom (especially VoIP) is the term grey route, which defines a route that is legal for one country or the party on one end, but illegal on the alternative end. An example of the white/grey/black trichotomy is often seen in telecom routes from the United States to India. In India, a telecom oligopoly is granted to a few large corporations. Hence, all legal (\\"white\\") telecom traffic to the country is subject to the rates imposed by these corporations. To overcome this restriction for the purpose of achieving lower costs for consumers, and to make a profit in the process, many small parties set up VoIP routers in homes and offices around India. Telecom traffic from other countries is sent to these VoIP routers via IP and terminated to the local Indian PSTN. This process is illegal in India (\\"black\\"), but completely lawful in the USA (\\"white\\"). A route like this, white on one end and black on the other is said to be \\"grey\\". SIM boxes A \\"SIM box\\" is an unofficial voice over IP gateway which uses multiple mobile telephones and SIM cards for PSTN connectivity, while connecting to the Internet by conventional means. These are normally operated clandestinely in third-world calling destinations as the \\"black\\" end of a \\"grey route\\" where conventional private branch exchange lines (such as T-carrier primary rate interface) are not available to VoIP operators due to a hostile local regulatory environment. In India, for instance, an Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity as voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following E.164 numbering is prohibited in India. By using licensing restrictions and regulations to ensure that the interconnection between the PSTN/PLMN network and Internet is not permitted, the government in India delivers a lucrative monopoly to International Long Distance (ILD) service providers licensed under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act as the only carriers officially allowed to carry international long distance traffic into India.

Anderson - with which Schoendeorffer was embedded. Two decades later, a sequel was released as Reminiscence. Background In summer 1966, France Soir news magazine director and French public channel ORTF producer Pierre Lazareff proposed that war reporter and director Pierre Schoendoerffer complete the \\"unachieved\\" war documentary Schoendoerffer began in 1954. Back in May 1954, Schoendoerffer was covering the First Indochina War for the French army's cinematographic service SCA. At the siege of Dien Bien Phu, he filmed the battle between the French Union forces and the Viet Minh, but his reels were captured when he surrendered to the enemy. After French forces departed from Vietnam in 1956, the United States increased their support for the south, culminating in full scale military intervention and the Vietnam War. Arguing that \\"the war was the same, the French only switching with the Americans\\", Lazareff convinced the French veteran to return to Vietnam as a kind of second chance to complete his war documentary. Premise The French war cameraman and First Indochina War veteran Schoendoerffer (38), already famous for his celebrated masterpiece The 317th Platoon (1965), returns to Vietnam. On 1 August 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division (United States) is sent to South Vietnam. The following year in September, Schoendoerffer joins it and follows a 33-man platoon of GIs led by Black West Pointer Lieutenant Joseph B. Anderson (24) until October 1966. Reception Anderson Platoon was screened in more than 20 countries and won several prizes, including an Oscar on April 10, 1968, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. *1967: Prix Italia for Original Dramatic Program *1968: Emmy Award for the Best Documentary Film of 1967 *1967: Academy Award for Documentary Feature *1968: Merit Award (BBC) =Anderson's comments= Some time after the film was released, Captain Joseph B. Anderson, Jr., the leader of the unit of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division after whom the film is named, commented on the film (and on his other experiences in Vietnam and in the military, in general) in Wallace Terry's book Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans (1984). He observed, on page 227: On page 230, Captain Anderson discuses the death from friendly fire of a white soldier named Shannon, from California, who is introduced in the film at approximately 6'50\\". Anderson states: \\"I did write a letter to his folks, telling them he did an exceptionally good job. I did not describe the circumstances under which he was killed, because we were directed not to put those kinds of details in letters whatever the case may be.\\" He continues: \\"The film describes the grenade as an enemy grenade. Which is not the real circumstances.\\" On page 233, Captain Anderson notes: \\"I spent my last months in the base camp at An Khe, an aide to the commanding general.

Educated in medicine, Goldstein studied under Carl Wernicke and Ludwig Edinger where he focused on neurology and psychiatry. His clinical work helped inspire the establishment of The Institute for Research into the Consequences of Brain Injuries. Goldstein was forced to leave Germany when Hitler came to power because of his Jewish heritage. After being displaced, Goldstein wrote The Organism (1934). This focused on patients with psychological disorders, particularly cases of schizophrenia and war trauma, and the ability of their bodies to readjust to substantial losses in central control. His holistic approach to the human organism produced the principle of self actualization, defined as the driving force that maximizes and determines the path of an individual. Later, his principle influenced Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. He was the co-editor of Journal of Humanistic Psychology.  Background  = Early life = Goldstein was born into an agnostic family of nine children. Goldstein's father was a successful owner of a lumberyard. Although not formally educated, Goldstein's father held scholarship in high regard. He felt that a good education was the most proper way to prepare for life, and because of this, ensured that all his sons obtained university degrees. As a child, Goldstein was described as being shy, quiet, and bookish amidst his bustling surroundings. His love of reading earned him the nickname of \\"Professor\\" at the public school he attended in Kattowitz. The Goldstein family relocated to metropolitan city of Breslau after a few years, where Goldstein attended the Humanistische Gymnasium. After graduation, Goldstein planned to study philosophy at the university level. His father did not approve of this venture, as he considered it an unprofitable art, and sent Goldstein to work at a relative's business. = Academic career = After a short period working at that business, Goldstein's father acquiesced and allowed him to enroll at Breslau University. Goldstein stayed there for only one semester before he transferred to the University of Heidelberg where he was able to pursue the study of philosophy and literature. One year later Goldstein made his way back to Breslau where he studied medicine, much to his father's satisfaction. Under the instruction of Carl Wernicke, Goldstein focused his study on neurology and psychiatry. Goldstein obtained his medical degree at the age of 25.Harrington, Anne. \\"American National Biography Online: Goldstein, Kurt.\\" American National Biography Online: Goldstein, Kurt.

After a stint in K√∂nigsberg, Goldstein returned to work with Edinger in 1914 at the Neurological Institute in Frankfurt as first assistant. Their goal was to investigate comparative neuroanatomy and neuropathology. After Edinger's death in 1918, Goldstein became acting director of the Neurological Institute. In July 1922, he was appointed associate professor for Neurology and director of the Neurological Institute.Benzenh√∂fer, Udo. \\"Kurt Goldstein - ein herausragender Neurologe und Neuropathologe an der Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main\\" Benzenh√∂fer, U., Ehrlich, Edinger, Goldstein et al.: Erinnerungsw√ºrdige Frankfurter Universit√§tsmediziner.

Perls married Laura Posner in 1930. They would go on to become the co-developers of Gestalt therapy. Goldstein's research and theory had a considerable influence on the formation of this new psychotherapy. Later that year, Goldstein accepted a position at the University of Berlin. = Professional career = Between 1906 and 1914, Goldstein worked in a psychiatric clinic in K√∂nigsberg. Here he realized that the patients were not receiving adequate treatment. During World War I, Goldstein took advantage of the large number of traumatic brain injuries at the clinic, and established The Institute for Research into the Consequences of Brain Injuries in close cooperation with , a gestalt psychologist. The collaboration between the two resulted in 16 papers, the most notable of which reported on a case of visual agnosia. Goldstein served as the director of the clinic until 1930. It was there that he also developed his theory of brain-mind relationships. He applied the figure-ground principle from perception to the whole organism. In this application, the whole organism existed as the ground for the individual stimulus that formed the figure. This idea became an early criticism of the simple behavioral stimulus-response- theory. When Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933, Goldstein, was arrested and imprisoned in a basement. After a week, he was released on the condition that he would agree to leave the country immediately and never return. For the next year Goldstein lived in Amsterdam, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, and wrote his classic The Organism. Goldstein immigrated to the United States of America in October of 1934 and became a citizen in April 1941.Benzenh√∂fer, Udo, Hack-Molitor, Gisela: Zur Emigration des Neurologen Kurt Goldstein. Ulm 2017, esp. pp. 49, 77. Web. 2017-8-17 He worked at the Psychiatric Institute in New York City, Montefiore Hospital as attending neurologist and made connections with Columbia University in New York. Between 1940 and 1945, Goldstein worked at the Tufts Medical School in Boston as the clinical professor of neurology. In 1946 he returned to New York City, where he established a private practice. While in the United States, Goldstein coined the phrase \\"self actualization\\". Goldstein met American psychologist Abraham Maslow, who was at Brandeis University. Maslow became influenced greatly by Goldstein's ideas, particularly self-actualization. Later, this principle would become a fundamental concept in Maslow's \\"Need - Hierarchy Theory of Motivation\\". Self-actualization was an essential component to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, but differed from Goldstein's original concept. Maslow described self-actualization as realizing one's full potential and seeking personal growth. Maslow felt that self-actualization would only be met if all fundamental needs had been satisfied first.  Holistic approach  Goldstein's holistic approach is described in his book, The Organism. Rather than looking at certain phenomena, such as the patellar reflex, as singular events, Goldstein tried to understand them as components of a holistic organism. Although he believed it was possible that reflexes could exist by themselves, Goldstein's approach postulated that they always exist in concurrence with another process in the body. While hitting the kneecap with a rubber hammer or testing the pupillary response might seem to be a simple example of an isolated reflex, Goldstein argued that a holistic approach would be necessary to fully understand what the body is experiencing. In an excerpt from The Organism, he writes: > If, in examining a man's pupillary reflex, we obtain a relatively constant > contraction of the iris, this is possible only because the individual, so to > speak, surrenders his eye to us and completely foregoes the usual act of > seeing, i.e. the visual prehension of some environmental feature. Of course, > it is true that in real vision the diameter of the pupil changes according > to the amount of light on the seen object. But it certainly is not true that > the same light intensity will produce the same contraction when it affects > the organ in isolation (as in the reflex examination), and when it acts upon > the eye of the person who deliberately regards an objects. Although it is > not easy to prove this experimentally, one only needs to contrast the > pupillary reaction of a man looking interestedly at a brightly illuminated > object with the reaction of an eye which has been exposed \\"in isolation,\\" to > the same light intensity. The difference in pupillary reaction is > immediately manifest. Goldstein asserts that when greeted with a scientific phenomenon within an organism, humans instinctively dissect the situation in an attempt to understand it better. Yet, in doing so, they miss the essence or intrinsic nature of the organism. Rather than attempting to understand facets of a situation, Goldstein believes it is essential to understand the situation in which the phenomenon arose. To illustrate this idea, Goldstein gives the example of a person first learning how to ride a bicycle. Initially, the person will attempt various motions in an attempt to succeed. While some motions fail to manifest in success, eventually the individual will understand how to coordinate their body in respect to the bicycle, and ride it successfully. While a smoothly propelled bicycle may signify accomplishment, looking at the coordinated movements of the learner and the smile that results is also another sign. Thus, when looking at a single aspect of a phenomenon instead of the whole, Goldstein argues one misses the true nature of the phenomenon.  Methodology  Goldstein developed an approach whereby a situation or phenomenon is analyzed holistically, rather than simply looking at an isolated event. First, when observing a situation, interpretations should be taken in as a whole without giving special preference toward one part of the phenomenon. When describing the phenomenon, attention should not be diverted to one aspect of the phenomenon that may be of interest. The holistic approach calls instead for the phenomenon to be described from all angles without bias toward one part. Lastly, Goldstein argues that one must consider each and every phenomenon in reference to the entire situation.  Major contributions to psychology  = Schizophrenia = Although trained as a medical doctor, Goldstein pioneered many important advances in psychology. As an early pioneer of neuropsychology, he studied the effects of brain damage on abstraction abilities. His work lead him to conclude that although physical areas of the brain, such as the frontal lobes and the subcortical ganglia, may be damaged, psychological trauma was a more pressing concern.Goldstein, G. (1990a). Contributions of Kurt Goldstein to neuropsychology. The Clinical Neuropsychologist, 4(1), 3‚Äì17.Goldstein, K. (1939). The significance of special mental tests for diagnosis and prognosis in schizophrenia. American Journal of Psychiatry, 96(3), 575‚Äì588. His conclusions on schizophrenia emphasized the disease as a protective mechanism against anxiety rather than an organic defect. = War trauma = Following the research of German neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, on war-related trauma, Goldstein focused upon understanding the trauma of soldiers returning from duty in World War I. At the time, physicians thought soldiers were merely faking symptoms in order to receive a pension after the war and there was little research to prove otherwise. Goldstein and his team attempted to look at this from a holistic perspective by theorizing that all neural networks were interconnected and thus, connected to the outside world. Therefore, any trauma one receives from the war would directly impact the neural networks.Kurt Goldstein: Zur Theorie der Funktion des Nervensystems. In: European Archives of Psychiatry and Neurosciences 74 (1925b), I. 1, pp. 375-376. Goldstein later attempted to rehabilitate patients suffering from war trauma. At the time, suffering veterans were placed in penitentiaries and asylums. Goldstein attempted to bring back normal function of patients by introducing multidisciplinary care teams consisting of medical, orthopedic, physiological, and psychological personnel, as well as a school facility to provide workshops for patients. His efforts resulted in successful rehabilitation of many soldiers: 73% of patients were able to return to their old jobs while only 10% remained hospitalized.Harrington, Die Suche nach Ganzheit, p. 282.Goldstein, Kurt et al.: Psychologische Analysen hirnpathologischer F√§lle auf Grund von Untersuchungen Hirnverletzter.

The Zuidas is also known as the 'Financial Mile'. It lies between the rivers Amstel and Schinkel along the ringway A10. The greatest influences for the development of the Zuidas are La D√©fense in Paris and Canary Wharf in London. In size it can best be compared with the Noordruimte/Espace Nord in Brussels. In the future, the local Amsterdam Zuid railway station, in planned to become the second main station in Amsterdam. It is expected to become 5th busiest passenger station in the Netherlands, with connections to Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, and Paris by high-speed rail, the Thalys. It will also connect to the German high-speed network, the ICE, via Utrecht and Arnhem. The journey from the Zuidas to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol takes approximately 8 minutes. Future development could include an underground line directly to the airport. Another high-speed link has been proposed by a consortium of companies between Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Amsterdam Zuid and the city of Almere. The Zuidas already has good underground connections to other business areas with the Circle Line. With the completion of the North South line, the Zuidas has an even better connection to the city center. The city council is not only investigating expanding the underground network to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol but also upgrading the hybrid metro/light rail line that stops at Amsterdam Zuid. Large multinationals such as ABN-Amro and Akzo Nobel have their headquarters in this new area. Between 1998 and 2004, the World Trade Center Amsterdam was renovated and expanded. The main infrastructural axis (Ring-A10) is scheduled to be tunnelled, transforming the entire area. This would add an estimated ‚Ç¨2 billion to the cost of the plan.

Prospect is located 32 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. One of the oldest suburbs in Sydney, Prospect takes its name from the prominent nearby landmark of Prospect Hill - from the top of which people could get a prospect of (see a great distance) the surrounding countryside. Initially a settlement for emancipated convicts, it later became a village.Crittenden, V., On the track of Watkin Tench in MARGIN: Life & Letters in Early Australia, July‚ÄìAugust 2003 issue. Since colonisation, settlers cleared larger areas of land to raise livestock, build churches, inns, schools, shops and a large reservoir.Jones, R., Firestick farming in Australian Natural History, 16, (September 1969), pp 224-228 Naturalist Charles Darwin visited Prospect in January 1836, to observe the geology.Darwin, C., Notes on the Geology of places visited during the Voyage, p 814 quoted in Mindat: Prospect, New South Wales by Keith Compton, http://www.mindat.org/article.php/1623/%3Cl+id%3D146488%3EProspect%3C_l%3E%2C+%3Cl+id%3D66%3ENew+South+Wales%3C_l%3E History Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Prospect was inhabited by different groups of the Darug people including the Warmuli. The Aboriginals there were of the woods culture. As European settlement expanded, the aboriginal people's ability to pursue their traditional lifestyle, which was already severely limited, disappeared. Prospect Hill had been the frontier, which was the first, and perhaps only, area where large scale organised resistance by aboriginal people took place.Flynn, M., Holroyd History and the Silent Boundary Project, Holroyd City Council, August 1997. Lieutenant Watkin Tench most likely named Prospect Hill in April 1790. In July 1791, thirteen grants of land at Prospect were made to emancipated convicts.Caley, G., (Currey, C., ed.) Reflections on the Colony of NSW, Landsdowne Press, Melbourne, 1966.Tench, W., A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales, London, G. Nicol and J. Sewell, 1793. In January 1794 David Collins reported that the Prospect Hill farmers were the most productive in the colony.Britton (ed), Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney 15 May 1788 in Historical Records of New South Wales Vol 1 Part 2: Phillip 1783-1792, Sydney, 1892. Prospect became the boundary between colonists and indigenous Australians. Hostility grew until by 1797, where a state of guerrilla warfare existed between indigenous people and the settler communities at Prospect and Parramatta. The aboriginal people were led by their leader, Pemulwuy, a member of the Bidjigal tribe who occupied the land.Willey, K., When the sky fell down : the destruction of the tribes of the Sydney region, 1788-1850s, Collins, Sydney, 1979 Pemulwuy was the main leader of raids against the colony in the 1790s. In 1797 the war escalated; his guerrillas started regular raids on settlements in the Parramatta and Prospect Hill areas. British military expeditions failed to locate and capture Pemulwuy.Collins, D., An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Vol. 1, Cadell and Davies, London, 1798. Shortly after 1808, William Lawson was appointed aide-de-camp to George Johnston, was granted at Prospect and built a large house there, which he named Veteran Hall. In the 1880s most of the property was submerged in what is now Prospect reservoir.although Veteran Hall itself was well above the water level. In 1912 it was used by the army and many of the larger rooms subdivided, giving rise to a myth that it had been a \\"forty-roomed mansion\\" in Lawson's time. The house was demolished in 1926. On 30 January 2004 the eastern part of Prospect, which includes the quarry gap, became a new suburb called Pemulwuy containing the new housing estates of Lakeside and Nelson's Ridge and the industrial area within the oval-shaped ridge of Prospect Hill. So most of Prospect Hill is no longer within the suburb of Prospect.Geographical Names Board of New South Wales Quarrying companies gradually took over more and more of Prospect Hill, mining the dolerite for use as roadstone until it was almost all gone and much of the hill with it. The Prospect quarry, which is now part of Pemulwuy, is formed by an intrusion of dolerite rock into Ashfield Shale. At least seven different rock types occur in the intrusion. The material is predominantly coarse grained picrite with olivine-dolerite and dolerite.Mindat: Prospect, New South Wales Quarrying in the area last occurred in 2007. In the early 2010s, the 330ha quarry gap was transformed into light industry area. Prospect Highway now winds through the gap.Sydney's Forgotten Quarry Railways - Oakes, John pp9-27 Historic Prospect Quarry to become warehouse distribution centre and employ 1000 people by The Daily Telegraph  Heritage listings  Prospect has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Upper Canal System * Great Western Highway: Veteran Hall Remains * Ponds Road: St Bartholomew's Anglican Church and Cemetery * Reservoir Road: Former Great Western Road Alignment, Prospect * Reservoir Road: Prospect Reservoir * East Of Reservoir: Prospect Reservoir Valve House * 385 Reservoir Road: Royal Cricketers Arms Inn * 23 Tarlington Place: Prospect Post Office * Clunies Ross Street: Prospect Hill * Reservoir Road: Prospect Hill ReservoirProspect Hill Reservoir (Elevated) (WS 0095) Geography The quarried hill today, with dolerite intrusion on sandstone. Philip Gidley King mentions that the landscape of Prospect is \\"a very pleasant tract of country, which, from the distance the trees grew from each other, and the gentle hills and dales, and rising slopes covered with grass, appeared like a vast park. The soil from Rose Hill to Prospect-Hill is nearly alike, being a loam and clay.\\" The tree cover was mainly the eucalypts, grey box and forest red gum. Spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) is also known to have occurred in the Prospect area.Jones, R., Mindjongork: Legacy of the firestick, Australian National University, 1995. =Climate= Prospect has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Summer weather is warm to hot, and may be humid or dry. Although a fair amount of rain is spread throughout the year, late winter and early spring are fairly dry, whilst late summer through to early winter are relatively wet. The suburb gets 104.2 clear days annually, with the most sunniest days being in August (13.2) and least in February (5.0 days). Prospect is usually a few degrees warmer than the Sydney CBD on most spring and summer days. In a few cases there has been a +10 degree differential (this is mostly when northwesterlies bring hot winds from the desert that raise temperatures up to +40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F). However, Prospect is usually a few degrees cooler on most nights of the year, because of its distance from the coast. The highest temperature recorded at Prospect was 45.1 ¬∞C (113.2 ¬∞F) on 7 January 2018. The lowest temperature recorded was ‚àí0.8 ¬∞C (30.6 ¬∞F) on 30 June 2010.http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/month/nsw/archive/200611.sydney.shtml Landmarks St Bartholomew's * Prospect Hill, Pemulwuy, is visible from many locations. It is a noticeable landmark of historical importance in the early settlement history of New South Wales and the suburb of Prospect takes its name from the hill. The hill was composed mainly of dolerite intruded into the Sydney Basin rocks during the Jurassic period although most of the dolerite has been quarried away.http://australianmuseum.net.au/The-Sydney-Basin * Prospect reservoir in Prospect Nature Reserve, located within the Western Sydney Parklands, is a water storage reservoir located at the headwaters of Prospect Creek.

The Royal Cricketers Arms building is of Victorian and Georgian design, being a two-storey brick and timber building set on a random rubble foundation stone wall on a sloping site. Transport Prospect is adjacent to the Great Western Highway and the M4 Motorway, providing road access to the western sections of the city and eastward to the Sydney CBD. Prospect Highway links Prospect to central Blacktown. Blacktown railway station provides access to the Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink networks, especially Sydney Trains' North Shore & Western Line. Several bus companies offer connecting services between Prospect and Blacktown, via Blacktown Road.

The name JAWA was established by concatenating the first letters of Janeƒçek and Wanderer. In the past, especially in the 1950s, JAWA was one of the top motorcycle manufacturers and exported its 350 into over 120 countries. The best known model was the 350 P√©r√°k and in the 1970s the 350 Californian. It appeared in the typical black and red coloring from Californian beaches to New Zealand.Jawa Californian je zp√°tky. Retro z gar√°≈æe se povedlo After 1990, there was a significant loss of production. A successor company was formed in 1997 in T√Ωnec nad S√°zavou, continuing the name as JAWA Moto.

Although he didn't have any experience with motorcycles, he was familiar with production techniques. Janeƒçek chose between the Austrian double piston two-stroke motor of Puch, the Berlin two-stroke of Schliha, and the new Wanderer 500 cc. Janeƒçek chose the Wanderer. Because of the collapse of the German motor industry, Wanderer had already decided to stop the production. This is because they didn't think it would be profitable to directly compete with BMW. The first model was introduced on October 23, 1929. This was a 500 cc 4-cycle engine with 12 kW of power (18 hp) and fuel consumption of 6 liters per 100 km. Although priced highly, through the first years (and several constructional fixes) this motorcycle was successful and was considered reliable. = 1930s = Due to the economic recession of the early 1930, a cheaper and simpler motorcycle was needed. Year 1932 marked the introduction of JAWA 175, with its 3.6 kW engine. This light (70 kg) machine was capable of speeds up to 80 km/h and fuel consumption of 3.5 liters per 100 km. The first year of production was an immediate success, selling over 3000 of the JAWA 175, almost three times the number of the 500 cc model over three years of production. The production of this model was finally stopped 1946. In 1938 JAWA was the first to offer test rides during exhibition show. This test motorcycle was a custom JAWA 175 equipped with dual handlebars, second pair being in the back for the instructor. Over the years total of 27,535 units of the JAWA 175 were built. It had a high demand. = 1940s = The company founder Franti≈°ek Janeƒçek died. Post-war production of JAWA 250/350 motorcycles restarted, and production of the JAWA 350 Ogar motorcycle began. = 1950s = Motorcycles produced in the 1950s include the 250, 350/353-k√Ωvaƒçka, and 350/354-K√Ωvaƒçka, 500 OHC and the 50 Pion√Ωr and Jawetta mopeds. A powerful 2-stroke motorcycle known as the JAWA 250/350 with the compact engine, rear wheel suspension and many other innovations was exported to more than 120 countries worldwide. It was one of the most successful models of JAWA. = 1960s = In the early 1960s, Jawa invented as the first in the world an automatic clutch for motorcycles. The automatic centrifugal clutch was designed for Jawa 250/559 and 350/360. Because the clutch has been patented worldwide by Jawa and it was copied in the Honda 50 Cub motorcycle, Honda had to retreat, pay a fine and pay a license fees from each motorcycle sold. * 1962, Amalgamation with ESO in production of JAWA speedway motorcycles * 1963, Closure of JAWA plant in Prague ‚Äì Pankr√°c * 1964, Start of production in new plant at T√Ωnec nad S√°zavou * 1964, Production of millionth JAWA brand motorcycle * 1965, Start of production of JAWA 350 Automatic motorcycles * 1966, Start of production of JAWA 350 Californian (type 363) motorcycles * 1967, Start of production of JAWA 90 (cross, trail, roadster) * 1967, Start of production of JAWA 50 Mustang (type 23) = 1970s = * 1970, Start of production of JAWA 250/350 √ö≈ò motorcycles * 1972, jawa 250cc in market (Indian) * 1970, Start of production of JAWA 350 Bizon motorcycles * 1974, Start of production of JAWA 350 (type 634) motorcycles * 1976, Production of two millionth JAWA brand motorcycle = 1980s = * 1984, Start of production of JAWA 350 (type 638) motorcycles * 1987, Production of three millionth JAWA brand motorcycle = 1990s = * 1991, Start of production of JAWA 350 (type 640) motorcycles * 1994, Start of production of JAWA 250 (type 593) motorcycles * 1994, Start of production of JAWA 50 (type 585, 586) motorcycles * 1997, Founding of the company JAWA Moto spol. s r. o. * 1998, Start of production of JAWA 125 Travel motorcycles * 1998, Joining with MOTOUNION, take-over of bike MUC 125 Dandy production * 1998, Start of production of JAWA 125 Dandy motorcycles * 1999, Start of production of JAWA 100 (type 587) motorcycles = 2000s = * 2004, Start of production of JAWA 650 (type 836) and JAWA 650 Classic motorcycles * 2005, Start of production of JAWA 650 Style motorcycles * 2006, Start of production of JAWA 650 Dakar motorcycles * 2008, Start of production of JAWA 250 Travel motorcycles = 2010s = * 2011, Start of production of JAWA 660 Sportard motorcycles (successor to 650 Dakar) * 2013, Start of production of JAWA 350/634 Retro motorcycles * 2017, Start of production of Jawa 350 OHC and JAWA 660 Vintage * Developing of JAWA 1000/1200 motorcycles  Other activities  = JAWA automobiles = In 1934 Jawa introduced its first car, the Jawa 700, which was based on the DKW F2. Produced was overall 1,002 vehicles. The sports car special Jawa 750 was built only in six pieces for the 1000-mile Czechoslovakian race in 1933-35. It is a legend in the history of domestic motor sports. In 1937, the modified Jawa 600 Minor was introduced, which replaced JAWA 700. Production continued in limited numbers throughout WWII, and some were assembled in the immediate postwar period.\\"New Czech Car Is Built\\", August 1946, Popular Science drawing of unique features of Minor automobile Over 14,000 vehicles were produced and more than half were exported abroad. The successor was Aero Minor, that was however manufactured by Aero and not by Jawa, from 1946 to 1952. File:Jawa 700.jpgJawa 700 File:Jawa 750 (2).jpgJawa 750 File:Classic Moto Show (55).JPGJawa 600 Minor = JAWA mopeds = Under the name Jawa were in foreign markets sold a variety of mopeds with two-stroke engines. In Czechoslovakia (and foreign markets after 1989), these mopeds were known as Babetta. The mopeds were produced since 1970 in Slovakian Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica and Kol√°rovo. It was the first company to include electronic ignition on mopeds. In the first half of the 1990s, sales and exports gradually began to decline and the production of all Babetta types was definitely discontinued in 1999. File:Babetta 207.300.jpgJawa 207 File:Babetta.jpgBabetta 210 = JAWA in India = Licensed Indian Jawa 250/353 \\"A\\" Type Ideal Jawa India Ltd based in Mysore was an Indian motorcycle company, which produced licensed Jawa motorcycles beginning in 1960 under the brand name Jawa and from 1973 as Yezdi. The company stopped production in 1996. Jawa motorcycles have a cult following to this present day. Earlier models were manufactured in Czechoslovakia and bore the CZ Jawa emblem on the side of the fuel tank. The locally manufactured models always had O within the Jawa emblem. The Jawa 250 Type 353/04 designated as 'A' Type, Yezdi 250 'B' Type, Jawa 350 type 634 Twin and Yezdi 250 Monarch models are driven to this day in various parts of the country. Jawa and Yezdi bikes, especially the ones with fuel tank paddings and ignition systems on the fuel tank are now collectors items. In October 2016, Mahindra & Mahindra, through its subsidiary Classic Legends Private Limited (CLPL), signed a licensing deal to launch motorbikes under the JAWA brand name in India and some other East Asian countries.http://www.team- bhp.com/news/mahindra-launch-jawa-branded-bikes-india In November 15, 2018, the Classic Legends launched three motorcycles in India: Jawa 300, Jawa 42 and Jawa Perak. They are manufactured in Pithampur. The Jawa 300 is inspired by the company‚Äôs popular classic Jawa 250, while the Jawa 42 is a more modern and urban offering. The Jawa Perak, however, is a completely different model, a custom bobber motorcycle. Jawa 300 and Jawa 42 share the same technical specifications - 293cc (20,4 kW), front disc, rear drum, single channel ABS, fuel injection system, liquid cooled engine with radiator and kerb weight of 170 kg. In terms of appearance, classic Jawa has more of chrome while the Jawa 42 has a modern feel to attract younger riders. It is a competitor to the Royal Enfield bikes in Indian markets. Jawa Perak has 334cc (22,3 kW) engine. Indian customers' interest in new machines exceeded all expectations. The originally planned production capacity was not enough, the production line was therefore doubled at about 30,000 motorcycles a year and the start of serial production had to move on to later. JAWA Motorcycles (Classic Legends) inaugurated the first Jawa dealership in December 2018 in the Pune region of Maharashtra. They launched an initiative #ForeverHeroes to lend a helping hand to the children of martyrs, by auctioning the first 13 motorcycles from its production batch. This fundraiser was a first-of-its-kind event which helped Jawa raise a staggering Rs 1,49,25,000 from just 13 bikes. The entire amount received in the fundraising auction will be utilized towards education for the children of martyrs of the Indian Armed Forces.Jawa Motorcycles Hand Over Proceeds Of The ‚ÄòForever Heroes‚Äô Initiative To The Flag Day Fund Indian Jawa 300 will be sold in the Czech Republic from autumn 2020, under the name Jawa 300 CL. Jawa 42 should also be imported here over time.  Racing  Racing bike Jawa 350/673 V4 Historically JAWA had been very active in racing, and by far the most active East-European manufacturer in mechanical sports. In track racing JAWA sustained a presence in the World Championship until the mid- sixties with respectable performances considering their limited budget. In Motocross the firm built an impressive record before its four-stroke engines became superseded by two-stroke engines. In speedway racing, dirt track racing and ice racing where four-stroke engines were still at an advantage, the firm remained a dominant force. The separate factory where these competition motorcycles were built became a separate company following the privatizations of the 1990s with the fall of Communism. Speedway World Champions who have ridden successfully on Jawa bikes include Ivan Mauger, Barry Briggs, Ove Fundin, Ole Olsen, Michael Lee, Tony Rickardsson and Kelvin Tatum.  Recent information  JAWA models in 2011 Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the dismantling of the communist bloc, the Jawa consumer motorcycles and the Speedway competition bikes were divided into separate companies. In the nineties, JAWA Speedway bikes were successful, while the Jawa company has struggled. As of 2006 the JAWA mostly produced bikes similar to Honda 250 cc, 125 cc and 50 cc motorcycles and large bike with a 650 cc Rotax engine (this engine can be also found in BMW F650 series). Most sold is the iconic 350 cc two-stroke twin, which is almost mechanically unchanged since the 1970s but very reliable, currently are successfully sold mainly to the countries of Latin America. The large bike with 650 cc Rotax engine was coming in three different variations. JAWA 650 classic was a retro bike with classic proportions. JAWA 650 Style was aimed for city streets and finally JAWA 650 Dakar was a full-scale enduro bike similar to Honda XL Transalp. The Jawa 660 was the successor to the Jawa 650, it was sold between 2011-2018. Currently models (2020) sold by the JAWA company are: Jawa 350/640 - two-stroke engine Style/Military/Retro and four-stroke engine Jawa 350 OHC (meets the EURO IV standards).

For a number of years, it was named Amsterdam Zuid WTC, in reference to the neighbouring World Trade Center Amsterdam. During 2006, in conjunction with the rapid development of the area surrounding the station, the station was enlarged and the reference to the WTC was formally dropped from the name. During 1978, Amsterdam Zuid station opened on a strategic rail route commonly known as the Zuidtak and formed the heart of the modern Zuidas business district, which houses several large banks, accounting and legal firms, as well as being the main public transport gateway for the VU University campus located just south of the station. Over time, the station has played an increasingly important role in Amsterdam's transport strategy and passenger numbers have grown extensively since its opening. To cope with its high patronage, Amsterdam Zuid has been extended and additional services put on; it has effectively replaced the older Amsterdam Centraal station as the capital's main station for direct trains. During the 2010s, as a means of allowing for further development at the station, a large expansion plan was proposed for Amsterdam Zuid. During December 2014, an agreement for this expansion plan, which has been referred to as the Zuidasdok project, was signed by various public bodies, authorising it to proceed. The publicly funded project has an estimated cost of approximately ‚Ç¨1.9 billion; this price tag means it shall be one of the biggest infrastructure projects ever performed in the Netherlands to date. Having received political backing, construction commenced in 2019 and is scheduled for completion around 2028. History Amsterdam Zuid station is located in the borough of Amsterdam-Zuid in the city Amsterdam, Netherlands. It lies on the strategic rail route known as the Zuidtak (\\"south branch\\"), which was completed in 1993, and connects Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in the west to Weesp, in the east via Duivendrecht. During 1978, the station was opened; over the following decades, Amsterdam Zuid was determined to be the fastest growing station in the Netherlands. As a result, the station was extended during 2006, and has gradually played an increasingly important role in the city's transport strategy. It has replaced the older Amsterdam Centraal station as the capital's main station for direct trains to various destinations located to the north and east of the country. The station is also on HSL-Zuid, a dedicated high-speed line designed for long distance and international traffic, which was built between 2000 and 2007.\\"HSL ZUID, AMSTERDAM-ROTTERDAM(-ANTWERP), THE NETHERLANDS(-BELGIUM).\\" omegacentre.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk, December 2014. In the long-term, it has been anticipated that at some point in the future Amsterdam Zuid will be served by long-distance trains traversing HSL-Zuid.\\"Amsterdam Zuid Station Expansion.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 19 May 2018. Since 2006, Utrecht and other cities south of Amsterdam have also been served via Amsterdam Zuid. In that year, the Utrechtboog flyover was completed; as a result of this additional infrastructure, changes at Duivendrecht are no longer necessary for passengers from Schiphol to Utrecht and beyond. These routes from Schiphol therefore bypass the congested lines serving Central Amsterdam, allowing faster connections between Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and cities in the north and east of the country (Leeuwarden and Enschede, among others). Amsterdam Zuid is currently served by 3 lines of the Amsterdam Metro and the Tram line 5, as well as by buses. Since July 2018 Amsterdam Zuid is also the southern terminus of the North/South metro line. In May 2008, tram line 5 which used to stop at the station was moved to the Strawinskylaan, where the bus services stop. This is so that the new metro line 52 building works could take place here. The number of train services to handle passenger demands has been progressively increased over time. However, the official long-term projections of future passenger numbers have been reported to be expected to increase to an extent to which the station's current facilities shall be insufficient to properly accommodate the corresponding traffic. While heavy demands would naturally necessitate a further expansion of the station, it lies directly between the south-bound lanes of the A10 motorway ring road and several high-rise office complexes, which leaves no space for conventional surface expansion. Expansion plans Following studies into various alternative means to providing greater capacity at Amsterdam Zuid, it was determined that the best likely option would involve the rerouting of the adjacent part of the A10 ring road. During December 2014, an agreement between the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region and the Province of North Holland was signed to cover the proposed expansion work, which is referred to as the Zuidasdok project. The programme is to be jointly executed by Rijkswaterstaat, the City of Amsterdam, ProRail, the Province of North Holland and Amsterdam Region Transport. The project carries an estimated cost of approximately ‚Ç¨1.9 billion, which makes it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the history of the Netherlands so far. It is being publicly funded by a combination of the Dutch State, the City of Amsterdam, Vervoerregio Amsterdam, and the Province of Noord-Holland, along with additional investments that are being made by the Dutch Railways (NS). During March 2017, a contract to perform the design and construction of the Zuidasdok project was awarded to ZuidPlus, a joint venture between Fluor, Heijmans and Hochtief.\\"Zuidasdok Contract Awarded to ZuidPlus.\\" tunnelingonline.com, 17 March 2017.Niehe, Pien. \\"Zuidasdok officially awarded to joint venture Fluor, Heijmans, HOCHTIEF.\\" Arup, 28 February 2017. The consortium's architectural design team includes Team V Architecture, Zwarts & Jansma Architects and Bosch Slabbers Garden & Landscape Architects. Engineering firm Technolution is to perform system engineering, as well as to provide systems for control and monitoring purposes, including the user interface for the tunnel installation. Rijkswaterstaat has been engaged by ProRail and the municipality of Amsterdam for the purposes of managing the project's procurement. Being sufficiently financed and having received political acceptance, construction activities is anticipated to commence during 2019 and is scheduled for completion in 2028.\\"Amsterdam Zuid.\\" ns.nl, Retrieved: 19 May 2018. Under the Zuidasdok project, the planned approach for redirecting the southern section of the A10 current traversing the site is to build a series of new tunnels to carry the motorway through instead, thereby opening up the surface space required to develop a high-quality and compact intermodal transport terminal around the existing Amsterdam Zuid station.\\"Zuidasdok final contract awarded to ZuidPlus.\\" Zwarts & Jansma Architects, Retrieved: 19 May 2018. The stated aims of the expansion programme are the improvement of traffic flow within the station, the location's transformation into a modern transport hub for the city, and the stimulation of new urban developments in and around neighbouring districts. Various elements of the local public transport infrastructure are to be redeveloped to better accommodate these aims and the station's overall purpose. As envisioned, the expanded station shall feature a light and elegant design intended to blend well with its surroundings. Various modifications are to be made as to enable faster transfers between the numerous train, metro, tram and bus services running through the station. The Minerva Passage, which links the northern and southern part of Amsterdam's Southern Axis, will be widened while a new underpass, known as the Britten Passage called after Benjamin Britten, shall also be constructed. The project will also create additional space adjacent to the station to house new bus and tram stops, bicycle parking facilities, and lots for taxis and park & ride facilities to enable quick and comfortable transfers. All of the existing mainline platforms are to be widened and covered with new roofs. In addition, the dedicated metro platforms currently located east of Minerva Passage are to be repositioned to a central location between the (future) Britten and the Minerva passageways to improve passenger flow distribution across the passages. The new area of station will include the construction of four sets of mainline tracks, as well as additional space being reserved for the future installation of a further two sets of tracks. Upon completion, it shall be served by four separate metro tracks, including the double tracks used by the Noord / Zuid metro line.

Biography =Career= In 1997, Roussel took part in the FIFA World Youth Championship. In the season that followed the tournament, he was promoted to the Gent senior team. Roussel signed a season-long loan deal for Premiership club Coventry City on 12 October 1999. He made his debut on 16 October, during the 4‚Äì1 win over Newcastle United, coming on as a late substitute for Gary McAllister. On 22 November 1999 he scored his first goal for the club, a header against Aston Villa at Highfield Road. Having impressed during his initial loan spell, Coventry signed Roussel in January 2000 for a fee of ¬£1.2 million, despite \\"substantial\\" bids from Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur. He finished his first season in the Premiership with six goals, including two goals in the 3‚Äì2 defeat to Manchester United in February 2000. Roussel also formed a successful strike partnership with young Irishman Robbie Keane. However, the following season he began to struggle on the goalscoring front, owing partly to injury setbacks. Midway through January 2001, with Coventry struggling in the league, a number of bids were made for Roussel's services, including one from Wimbledon. After refusing to sign for Wimbledon, he criticized the Coventry board for trying to use him as a makeweight in a deal to bring John Hartson to the club. He was particularly critical of the club's chairman Bryan Richardson for forcing through the Wimbledon transfer, accusing him of not repaying the loyalty Roussel himself had shown in signing permanently for the club, despite interest from \\"several classier clubs.\\" Roussel would however later describe his time at Coventry as \\"the best part of my career.\\" He was eventually sold a few weeks later to the First Division club Wolves, in a ¬£2 million deal. Generally disappointing at Molineux, he left after 18 months, having scored two goals in twenty five appearances. He was loaned out for the 2002-03 season to his hometown club Mons, who had recently been promoted to the Belgian Pro League. He finished the season as the division's joint top scorer with Wesley Sonck; both players scored 22 goals. His goalscoring form attracted interest from bigger clubs in the league and he signed for Genk in 2003. His reputation in Belgian football increased and he made his first appearance for the Belgium national team in 2003. After just one season at Genk, in which he scored on thirteen occasions, he moved on again, this time signing for Rubin Kazan in Russia. He never felt at home in Russia and returned to Belgium to play for Standard Li√®ge. At Standard he struggled to break into the first team and after two unsuccessful years at the club he signed for Zulte Waregem. His time there was again short-lived and a year later he signed for Italian Serie B club Brescia. Roussel soon found himself frozen out at Brescia, and the club became open to offers for him. In August 2007, he spent a week on trial with Scottish Premier League club Dundee United but returned home without signing the agreed loan deal. He instead chose to return to his former club R.A.E.C. Mons, where he signed a three-year contract. On 25 November 2010, Roussel agreed with Dutch side HSV Hoek to play in the Topklasse. In August 2011 he moved to RUS Beloeil in Belgium. On 13 February 2015, Roussel announced his retirement from football at the age of 37. Outside football Roussel has a son Cameron (born 2001) with former girlfriend Kirsty Wood. Following his retirement from football, Roussel began a career in real estate.

Hundreds were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly, and while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference. Boundaries and formation Mill Creek Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies north and east of White Clay Creek and west of Red Clay Creek. Its western boundary follows a portion of the 12 mile arc drawn around the town of New Castle. It was formed from Christiana Hundred in 1710 and was named for Mill Creek that flows through its center. Development Excepting large areas along Red Clay Creek and White Clay Creek preserved in parks or large estates, this area is now mostly suburban with extensive commercial and residential development. The southern portion was developed in the mid-twentieth century, with the northern portion developed more in the later decades. A portion of the city of Newark, the Hockessin, North Star, and Pike Creek Census Designated Places (CDP) and the communities of Marshallton, Milltown and Stanton are in Mill Creek Hundred. Geography Important geographical features, in addition to Red Clay Creek, White Clay Creek and Mill Creek, include Pike Creek, Muddy Run, and Turkey Run. It is mostly in the piedmont region, but the southern portion is below the eastern Fall Line and on the coastal plain. Transportation Important roads include portions of the Kirkwood Highway (Delaware Route 2), the Old Capital Trail, Lancaster Pike (Delaware Route 48), Newport-Gap Pike (Delaware Route 41), the Old Wilmington Road, Limestone Road (Delaware Route 7), Paper Mill Road (Delaware Route 72), and the old main highway between Wilmington and Baltimore, now Newport-Stanton Pike and Christiana-Stanton Road (Delaware Route 7). A portion of the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, now CSX Transportation's Philadelphia Subdivision crosses through Stanton, the Wilmington and Western Railroad runs along Red Clay Creek to Hockessin, and the Pomeroy and Newark Railroad once ran along White Clay Creek.

The plot follows a traveling magician named Albert Vogler, whose allegedly supernatural live shows are challenged by the skeptical population of a small village. Blending elements of psychological drama and horror, the film was distantly inspired by G.K. Chesterton 's play Magic, which Bergman numbered among his favourites. Bergman staged a theatre production of \\"Magic\\" in Swedish at one point. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 31st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot Albert Vogler is a magician who leads a troupe of performers, known as Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater, who claim to possess supernatural abilities. Among them are Albert's grandmother, Granny Vogler; his wife Manda, who performs in costume as a man under the alias Mr. Aman; his charismatic assistant, Tubal; and their driver, Simson. Albert proclaims to have discovered animal magnetism. After leaving a show in Copenhagen, the group travel by carriage through the wilderness into Sweden, and hear screams emanating from the woods. They find an ill man lying on the ground nearby, who introduces himself as Johan Spegel, a former vaudevillian. The troupe decide to bring him along with them, and he becomes progressively ill. Albert keenly observes Johan as he apparently dies in the carriage. The troupe arrive in a village and are met by Consul Egerman who, along with his wife Ottilia, is interested in the occult. Tubal informs Egerman and his associates that Albert is mute, and the townsmen question the nature of their magic show based on the advertisements promoting it. Dr. Vergerus, the Minister of Health, accuses Albert of practicing quackery and pseudoscience; the men privately plan to wager on Albert's abilities. Later, the troupe have dinner with Sara and Sanna, two servants who are enthralled by their presence, and Tubal peddles love potions made by Granny. The head cook, Sofia, is impervious to Tubal's bravado, but finds him attractive and solicits him for sex. As a storm brews, Sanna grows frightened of the group after Granny tells her she is a witch who is 200 years old. Meanwhile, Simson flirts with Sara, and the two drink the aphrodisiac potions together before having sex. Ottilia approaches Albert and tells him that she believes in his powers, and that her husband and the other townsmen criticize him only because they do not understand him. She further explains that she hopes he can make contact with her deceased daughter. After Ottilia leaves, Albert is visited by Johan, who did not die. Johan laments his \\"unused\\" life to Albert before again dying in his arms; Albert conceals his body in a hidden compartment of a large trunk. Egerman observes the exchange from the shadows and is shaken by it, unsure if he has witnessed an apparition. Dr. Vergeru approaches Manda in her room, her masculine disguise removed. She tells him the troupe are fleeing from the authorities, and admits that the group's entire act is a fraud. Albert listens to their conversation before entering the room, and assaults Vergeru when he goads him. Albert removes his wig, and Manda comforts him, recounting their travails on the road, the home they left behind, and his decision to disguise himself as a mute. The following morning, the troupe perform a magic show for the townspeople. Tubal asks Henrietta Starbeck, the wife of the Police Superintendent, to be a volunteer in the show; apparently using magnets, Manda elicits cruel admissions from Henrietta about her husband, publicly humiliating him. Next, Engelson volunteers Antonsson, the stableman, for a trick in which Albert apparently manipulates his body. During the performance, Albert collapses and dies, and Antonsson flees in horror, later committing suicide. Albert's body is placed in his trunk‚Äîwhich, unbeknownst to Vergerus, also contains Johan's body‚Äîand brought to the attic for an autopsy. After Vergerus performs a full autopsy, he is terrified when Albert emerges from the shadows, alive. Vergerus demands to know whose body he has performed an autopsy on. Albert responds that it was a \\"poor actor\\"‚Äîit was in fact Johan, who was also in the trunk. Angered, Vergerus remarks the troupe's performance as \\"miserable,\\" but pays Albert for the entertainment. Manda has Simson hitch their horses so the troupe can leave, but Tubal tells her he wishes to stay with Sofia. Granny also tells Manda she will no longer join them, and plans to live the remainder of her years with the funds she has saved by selling her potions. Upset over Simson's departure, Sara asks Albert and Manda if she can join them, to which they agree. Before they can depart, Albert and Manda are escorted back into the house by police officers. They initially believe they are to be charged with crimes, but, to their surprise, the Police Superintendent Starbeck notifies them that the king wishes to have them perform at the Royal Palace. Shortly after, Albert, Manda, Simson, and Sara depart for Stockholm. Cast Reception The Magician has a unanimous approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Don Druker of the Chicago Reader called it \\"one of Bergman's most tightly structured and frightening films.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"A thoughtful (and too-long underrated) portrait of a man who is part- faker, part-genius.\\" Woody Allen, shortly after Bergman died in 2007, included The Magician as one of the five films by the Swedish director that he would most recommend to individuals unfamiliar with the filmmaker.

In the visual arts he has been cited as a contemporary to the 'Young British Artists', and had his artwork exhibited internationally. As a novelist he has created fiction for both children and adults, and has had particular success and recognition as a children's author. In the field of cinema he is perhaps best known for his award-winning screenplay for the 1990 film The Krays (1990), a biopic about the Kray twins which was directed by Peter Medak. As a film-maker in his own right he is recognised for creating a loose trilogy of horror films; The Reflecting Skin (1990), The Passion of Darkly Noon (1995) and Heartless (2009) for which he has acquired a cult following. As a playwright he has been cited as a pioneer of 'In-yer-face theatre', with his debut play The Pitchfork Disney (1991) considered by many to be a seminal work in the development of the style, with one critic even dubbing it \\"the key play\\" of the 1990s. A great number of his plays for adults have been perceived as controversial, being met with both condemnation and high acclaim upon their initial reception. As a writer for the stage he is also recognised for creating an ongoing series of plays for young people (The Storyteller Sequence) and has written theatrical works for children and family audiences. As a songwriter he has created songs for his cinematic and theatrical works, frequently collaborating with composer Nick Bic√¢t. He and Bic√¢t have also formed a music group called Dreamskin Cradle with singer Mary Leay. Ridley has also written songs for composer Anna Meredith, particularly operatic work. Ridley is also a poet, photographer, and performance artist and has written drama for radio. Although Ridley creates stories through a wide range of media he dislikes his work being categorised by the medium in which it is told, often referring to them belonging to each other as \\"different peaks of the same mountain.\\"  Biography  Ridley was born in Bethnal Green, in the East End of London, where he lived and worked for the majority of his life until moving to Ilford. Ridley studied painting at Saint Martin's School of Art and his work has been exhibited throughout Europe and Japan. He started as both a performance artist and the creator of a long sequence of charcoal drawings called The Epic of Oracle Foster. One drawing from this sequence, \\"Corvus Cum\\", portraying a man ejaculating a black bird, was exhibited at the ICA in London while Ridley was still a student and ‚Äì with calls for it to be displayed behind a curtain ‚Äì became a cause c√©l√®bre. Ridley also started his own theatre group as a student, acting in many of the productions, and made several short art films. Work in Literature Ridley has written three books for adults; Crocodilia (1988), In the Eyes of Mr. Fury (1989), and Flamingoes in Orbit (1990).

He also has written two short stories for younger children, Dreamboat Zing (1996) and The Hooligan's Shampoo (1996). Work in Cinema After graduating from St Martins Ridley created the short film Visiting Mr Beak (1987), which starred the veteran actor Guy Rolfe. He later created a short film for Channel 4 called The Universe of Dermot Finn (1988), which featured renowned actress Sheila Hancock, and was officially selected for the Cannes Film Festival, where it was a critical success and went on to receive theatrical distribution. While still a student at St Martins Ridley wrote a screenplay for The Krays (1990), which was directed by Peter Medak, and starred real life brothers Gary Kemp and Martin Kemp, who previously were recognised for their band Spandau Ballet. Ridley has also directed three feature films from his own screenplays: The Reflecting Skin (1990) winner of 11 international award, The Passion of Darkly Noon (1995) winner of the Best Director Prize at the Porto Film Festival, and Heartless (2009). Ridley's third film as writer-director, Heartless, premiered at the Frightfest horror film festival in London in August 2009. The film stars Jim Sturgess, Cl√©mence Po√©sy, Noel Clarke, Eddie Marsan, Luke Treadaway, Ruth Sheen and Timothy Spall, and was released in the UK in May 2010.

Ridley was one of 25 contemporary British writers asked to contribute a scene to NT25 Chain Play, celebrating 25 years of the Royal National Theatre in London. Work in Music Ridley's output as a lyricist has produced a wide range of songs, a number of which have featured in a variety of his plays, films, and novels. While still a student Ridley participated in music by creating work with a band called Haunted Staircase (who released their double-sided record Flutters in the early 1980s), and also worked as a DJ at a nightclub. As a songwriter he has regularly collaborated with the composer Nick Bic√¢t. For Ridley's film The Passion of Darkly Noon they created two songs: \\"Look What You've Done\\" (sung by Gavin Friday), and \\"Who Will Love Me Now?\\" (sung by PJ Harvey), the later of which was voted as BBC Radio 1's Best Film Song of 1998; and was later covered by the techno/house band Sunscreem as Please Save Me, whose cover entered the UK top 40 chart, became a cult hit in clubs, and featured in the film South West 9. For his film Heartless Ridley and Bic√¢t created ten songs (performed by Mary Leay, Joe Echo, and lead actor Jim Sturgess). In 2010 Ridley and Bic√¢t formed the music group 'Dreamskin Cradle' (with singer Mary Leay). The group's first album Songs from Grimm (2014) consisted of twelve songs inspired by female characters in Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and was released on all major download sites. Some songs from the album were performed as part of a live performance called Grimm Tales which was developed by the St Paul's Institute, and featured readings from the actress Jeany Spark, reflections from Canon Edmund Newell, and extracts from Brothers Grimm fairy tales adapted by poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy. Dreamskin Cradle have also released two singles: Fade and Float (written for Ridley's stage play Tender Napalm), and Ladybird First (written for Ridley's stage play Dark Vanilla Jungle).

Fixed- pattern noise (FPN) is the term given to a particular noise pattern on digital imaging sensors often noticeable during longer exposure shots where particular pixels are susceptible to giving brighter intensities above the general background noise. Overview FPN is a general term that identifies a temporally constant lateral non-uniformity (forming a constant pattern) in an imaging system with multiple detector or picture elements (pixels). It is characterised by the same pattern of 'hot' (brighter) and cold (darker) pixels occurring with images taken under the same illumination conditions in an imaging array. This problem arises from small differences in the individual responsitivity of the sensor array (including any local postamplification stages) that might be caused by variations in the pixel size, material or interference with the local circuitry. It might be affected by changes in the environment like different temperatures, exposure times, etc. The term \\"fixed pattern noise\\" usually refers to two parameters.Electronic Shuttering for High Speed CMOS Machine Vision Applications http://www.automaatioseura.fi/jaostot/mvn/mvn2007/parameter.html One is the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU), which is the offset from the average across the imaging array at a particular setting (temperature, integration time) but no external illumination and the photo response non-uniformity (PRNU), which describes the gain or ratio between optical power on a pixel versus the electrical signal output. The latter is often simplified as a single value measured at e.g. 50% saturation level, implying a linear approximation of the not perfectly linear photo response non-linearity (PRNL). Often PRNU as defined above is subdivided in pure \\"(offset) FPN\\" which is the part not dependent on temperature and integration time, and the integration time and temperature dependent \\"DSNU\\". Sometimes pixel noiseCommercial Sensor Survey Radiation Testing Progress Report http://trs- new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/40825/1/08-22.pdf as the average deviation from the array average under different illumination and temperature conditions is specified. Pixel noise therefore gives a number (commonly expressed in rms) that identifies FPN in all permitted imaging conditions, which might strongly deteriorate if additional electrical gain (and noise) is included. Recent uses for PRNU include measures to fighting motion picture piracy. In practice, a long exposure (integration time) emphasizes the inherent differences in pixel response so they may become a visible defect, degrading the image. Although FPN does not change appreciably across a series of captures, it may vary with integration time, imager temperature, imager gain and incident illumination, it is not expressed in a random (uncorrelated or changing) spatial distribution, occurring only at certain, fixed pixel locations.  Suppression of FPN  FPN is commonly suppressed by flat-field correction (FFC) that uses DSNU and PRNU to linearly interpolate and reduce the local photo response (non-uniform PRNL) to the array average. Hence, two exposures with an equal illumination across the array are necessary (one without light and one close to saturation) to obtain the values. Note that this correction usually is very sensitive to modifications of the system parameters (i.e., exposure time, temperature). The main challenge is to generate a flat field illumination for short time exposures and wavelengths, to avoid speckle (in monochromatic light conditions) and statistical fluctuations of the light stream that become most obvious at short integration times. Many patents and methods exist to reduce or eliminate fixed pattern noise in digital imagers . Specific for the suppression of \\"offset FPN\\" as defined above, on-chip techniques for suppression exist, such as correlated double sampling.

JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3041904. and also as poetry that takes jazz music, musicians, or the jazz milieu as its subject. Some critics consider it a distinct genre though others consider the term to be merely descriptive. Jazz poetry has long been something of an \\"outsider\\" art form that exists somewhere outside the mainstream, having been conceived in the 1920s by African Americans, maintained in the 1950s by counterculture poets like those of the Beat generation, and adapted in modern times into hip-hop music and live poetry events known as poetry slams. Aesthetics Poets have been drawn to jazz by the oral roots and oral power of jazz music, and often they recite their verses. They have come in search of the body, of rhythm and of sound, refugees from the printed page, seeking a popular voice and public ear denied to poetry of the page. In his book Digitopia Blues ‚Äì Race, Technology and the American Voice, poet and saxophonist John Sobol argues that jazz was a transformative vehicle for African-American self-empowerment whose dominant characteristic and purpose was a search for mastery of a language of power, undertaken by a historically enslaved oral people denied access to words of power. Sobol believes that poets who have felt constrained by the hegemony of the literate tradition have grasped an essential kinship with jazz as a realm of masterful oral power and have sought to mimic or recreate jazz modalities in their poetry, thus earning the description 'jazz poetry'. The Harlem Renaissance Early jazz poetry did not mimic the sounds and improvisational spirit of jazz. Instead, it heavily referenced the musical form with allusions made to musicians, instruments, and locations key to the burgeoning jazz scene. Poets including Vachel Lindsay (who actually abhorred the \\"primitive\\" sound of jazz music) and Mina Loy wrote poetry in this vein. It was with the advent of the Harlem Renaissance that jazz poetry developed into what it is today. Poets such as Langston Hughes incorporated the syncopated rhythms and repetitive phrases of blues and jazz music into their writing. Many Harlem Renaissance writers were deeply concerned with racial pride and with the creation of purely African-American poetry. Since jazz music was an important part of African-American culture at the time, Hughes and others like him adapted the musical genre to create their own, singularly African-American voices that could easily be distinguished from the work of white poets. Many of Hughes' poems, such as \\"The Weary Blues\\", sound almost exactly like popular jazz and blues songs of the period, and vice versa. His work is also highly evocative of spirituals. Bebop and the beat generation As members of the Beat generation began to embrace aspects of African-American culture during the 1950s, the art of jazz poetry shifted its focus from racial pride and individuality to spontaneity and freedom. In this case, both jazz poetry and jazz music were seen as powerful statements against the status quo. Jack Kerouac would often have musical accompaniment for his poetry readings. His colleague, musician and composer David Amram, would often play the piano or bongos as Kerouac read. Amram later wrote of their work together: > We never once rehearsed. We did listen intently to one another. Jazz is all > about listening and sharing. I never drowned out one word of whatever Jack > was reading or making up on the spot. When I did my spontaneous scatting > [...] he would play piano or bongos and he never drowned out or stepped on a > word or interrupted a thought that I or anyone else had when they joined us > in these late night-early morning get-togethers. We had mutual respect for > one another, and anyone who joined us received the same respect. We almost > never used a microphone. Most of the time, there weren't any available!David > Amram: Poetry and All That Jazz at allaboutjazz.com Lawrence Ferlinghetti had a similar collaboration with saxophone player Stan Getz. Beat poet Bob Kaufman was said by some to be the greatest jazz poet ever to have lived, with the exception of Langston Hughes.Article from the Beat Museum website Kaufman paid homage to jazz in poems such as \\"O Jazz O\\" and \\"Morning Joy.\\" His work is notable for its syncopated rhythms, surreal imagery, and a quality of alienation stemming from his own life as a drifter and a jailbird. In the 1960s, Beat poet LeRoi Jones renamed himself Amiri Baraka and revived the idea of jazz poetry as a source of black pride. Baraka was a cultural nationalist who believed that \\"Black People are a race, a culture, a Nation\\".Amiri Baraka: Biography and Historical Context Elements of jazz show up often in Baraka's work, such as syncopation and repetition of phrases. Gil Scott-Heron, often seen as one of the founding fathers of rap music, also used many of the artistic devices of jazz poetry in his spoken- word albums of the 1970s and 1980s.

It may refer to education provided by a church or religious organization, for instruction in doctrine and faith, or for education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or moral aims, e.g. in a school or college. The term is often known as religious studies. England Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the state education system in England. Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines. Religious Education in England is mandated by the Education Act 1944 as amended by the Education Reform Act 1988 and the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life, and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve. Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of collective worship, of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year. Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some \\"schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship\\" due to what they thought was \\"a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship\\" although Smalley noted that \\"there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed.\\" The National Union of Teachers suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools. Each government jurisdiction in England has a Local Agreed Syllabus which serves as a mandate for the scope and sequence of subject teaching for each Key Stage, and possibly for each school year; use of the syllabi is only mandated for certain types of schools, such as Voluntary Controlled schools. Voluntary Aided and independent schools are free to outline their own course of study; the schools most likely to actually use the syllabi maintained schools and Voluntary Aided nondenominational schools. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects. France In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education: √©ducation civique, juridique et sociale, ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education. Ireland In Ireland religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes. Israel Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.A. Maoz, \\"Religious Education in Israel\\", 83 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p. 679-728. Japan The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion. In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called in primary school, where the purpose is to teach moral values rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated secular stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts. Lebanon Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by \\"ethics\\" classes. Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens. Malaysia The Malaysian education system makes Moral Studies compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in Islamic Studies lessons. There are special religious classes Kelas Aliran Agama in normal schools in addition to government-funded religious schools Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama and Sekolah Agama Bantuan Kerajaan. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the \\"Moral\\" subject, primarily due to the strict exam- oriented marking-schemes. Norway  Article 2 of the Constitution of Norway mandates Evangelical-Lutheran parents to provide a religious upbringing for their children. With the revision of the Constitution in 2012, this mandate was removed. In the education system, religious education is found in a subject now labeled KRLE (Christianity, religion and ethical education). A minimum of 50% of the subject should be on Christianity, yet preaching has been disapproved since 1969. Scotland  In Scottish state schools, Religious Education is called Religious and Moral Education from ages 5 to 14, and Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies from 14 to 18. The majority of state schools in are non-denominational, but as a result of the Education Act 1918, separate denominational state schools were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are Roman Catholic but there are also a number of Scottish Episcopal schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then, the Catholic schools are fully funded by the Scottish Government and administered by the Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, which also appoints a chaplain to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school. South Africa The South African National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the public school curriculum. The policy does not apply to private schools.  Middle East  The majority of middle eastern countries provide compulsory religious studies in both private and public schools. The religious studies in private schools can be based on the religious beliefs of the student and can be complied with by the school.

The song's lyrics about \\"cop killing\\" provoked much controversy and negative reactions from political figures of the time, such as President George H. W.

Ice-T has also credited the Talking Heads song \\"Psycho Killer\\" with partially inspiring the song. \\"Cop Killer\\" was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at the 1991 Lollapalooza tour, before it had been recorded in a studio.

Shortly after the release of Body Count, a jury acquitted the officers and riots broke out in South Central Los Angeles. Soon after the riots, the Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas (CLEAT) launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. Reaction Following its release, the song was met with strong opposition, with critics ranging from President George H. W. Bush to various law enforcement agencies, with strong demand for the song's withdrawal from commercial availability, citing concerns of promoting anti-police sentiment. Conversely, Ice-T defended the lyrical content of the song as did various other proponents who did not believe that the song posed any risk and remained in support of the song continuing to be released and sold. =Criticism and controversy= CLEAT (Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas) called for a boycott of all products by Time Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores.Deflem, Mathieu. 2020. \\"Popular Culture and Social Control: The Moral Panic on Music Labeling.\\" American Journal of Criminal Justice 45(1):2-24 (First published online July 24, 2019). Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. In an article for The Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs such as \\"Cop Killer\\", writing that \\"Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message ... Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right.\\" Some critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Dennis R. Martin (Former President, National Association of Chiefs of Police) argued that: =Defense of the song= Others defended the album on the basis of the group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the 1991 film, New Jack City. Many people from the music world and other fields were supportive of the song. For example, in direct response to the criticism made by Dennis Martin above, Mark S. Hamm and Jeff Ferrell argued the following: Ice-T stated of the song, \\"I'm singing in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality. I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut\\", in reference to Bowie's song \\"Space Oddity\\". In a July 1992 editorial in The Wall Street Journal defending his company's involvement with the song, Time Warner co-CEO Gerald M. Levin repeated this defense, writing that rather than \\"finding ways to silence the messenger\\", critics and listeners should be \\"heeding the anguished cry contained in his message\\". The National Black Police Association opposed the boycott of Time Warner and the attacks on \\"Cop Killer\\", identifying police brutality as the cause of much anti-police sentiment, and proposing the creation of independent civilian review boards \\"to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers\\" as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count \\"to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. ... Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others.\\" =Further controversy and decision to withdraw song= Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President Quayle branded \\"Cop Killer\\" \\"obscene\\", and President Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. Body Count was removed from the shelves of a retail store in Greensboro, North Carolina, after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in Auckland, arguing that \\"Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here\\", before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, in an effort to get it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act 1963. This was the first time in twenty years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music. After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song \\"Cop Killer\\" to be \\"not exhortatory\\", saw the album as displaying \\"an honest purpose\\", and found Body Count not indecent. At the July 1992 annual shareholders' meeting for Time Warner, actor Charlton Heston, who was a minor Time Warner shareholder, was given the opportunity to address the crowd, and, in a well publicized speech, recited lyrics from both \\"Cop Killer\\" and another song from Body Count, \\"KKK Bitch\\" ‚Äì which namechecked Tipper Gore herself ‚Äì in an attempt to embarrass company executives into dropping the album.Winning the Cultural War (speech transcript), Charlton Heston, February 16, 1999 Some death threats were sent to Warner Bros. Records executives, and some stockholders threatened to pull out of the company. According to his 1994 book The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T decided to remove the song from the album of his own volition. Eventually, the album was re-issued with \\"Cop Killer\\" removed. Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued \\"Cop Killer\\" as a free single. Ice-T left the label in 1993, following additional disputes over his solo album Home Invasion. The performer stated of the controversy that \\"When I started out, [Warner] never censored us. Everything we did, we had full control over. But what happened was when the cops moved on Body Count they issued pressure on the corporate division of Warner Bros., and that made the music division, they couldn't out-fight 'em in the battle, so even when you're in a business with somebody who might not wanna censor you, economically people can put restraints on 'em and cause 'em to be afraid. I learned that lesson in there, that you're never really safe as long as you're connected to any big corporation's money.\\" Warner Bros. Records chairman Mo Ostin said in a 1994 interview with the Los Angeles Times, \\"(Time Warner) got so thin-skinned after the incident at the shareholders' meeting. In the end, Ice-T decided to leave because he could not allow tampering with his work. And I can't blame him‚Äîconsidering the climate.\\" Expressing regret at the circumstances leading to Ice-T's departure, Ostin praised him as \\"a terrific artist who spoke the truth\\". The studio version of \\"Cop Killer\\" has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on the 2005 release Body Count: Live in LA. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song \\"still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself, 'Man, that was 17 years ago', but I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it too and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU.\\" Covers *Australian comedy show The Late Show featured a sketch in 1992 with vocal quartet The Kinsmen doing a smooth jazz parody of \\"Cop Killer\\". *Soundgarden covered \\"Cop Killer\\" at a few live shows, including Lollapalooza '92 at which it was introduced as a \\"politically incorrect song\\". *Argentinean alternative metal band A.N.I.M.A.L. recorded a Spanish version of the song included in their 1998 album, Poder Latino. *Boston-based hardcore band Our Lives featuring members of the band Vanna covered \\"Cop Killer\\" on a split EP with New York City band Kills and Thrills. *Sludge metal band The Body released a cover of \\"Cop Killer\\" as a single in 2005.

Born in Shiness, Lairg, Sutherland, Scotland, he was the son of Captain Donald Matheson.Mackenzie, Alexander History of the Mathesons with Genealogies of the Various Families (1900) He attended Edinburgh's Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh. He and William Jardine went on to co-found the Hong Kong-based trading conglomerate Jardine Matheson & Co. that became today's Jardine Matheson Holdings. China and Hong Kong After leaving university, Matheson spent two years in a London agency house before departing for Calcutta, India and a position in his uncle's trading firm, Mackintosh & Co. p. 39 In 1807, Matheson was entrusted by his uncle with a letter to be delivered to the captain of a soon-to-depart British vessel. He forgot to deliver the missive and the vessel sailed without it. Incensed at his nephew's negligence, the uncle suggested that young James might be better off back in Britain. He took his uncle at his word and went to engage a passage back home. However, a chance encounter with an old sea captain instead led to Matheson departing for Canton (Guangzhou). Matheson first met William Jardine in Bombay in 1820.Maggie Keswick (ed) The Thistle and The Jade. A Celebration of 175 years of Jardine Matheson. Frances Lincoln Publishers 1982 The two men later formed a partnership which also included Hollingworth Magniac and Daniel Beale. At first the new firm dealt only with trade between Canton, Bombay and Calcutta, at that time called the \\"country trade\\" but later extended their business to London. In 1827 Alexander Matheson lent James a small hand press for the printing of the Canton Register which James founded as the first English language news sheet in China,Blake, Robert. Jardine Matheson Traders of the Far East. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1999 p. 222 which was edited by William Wightman Wood, an American from Philadelphia who would later work for rival trading house Russell & Co. On 1 July 1832, Jardine, Matheson and Company, a partnership, between William Jardine, James Matheson as senior partners, and Hollingworth Magniac, Alexander Matheson, Jardine's nephew Andrew Johnstone, Matheson's nephew Hugh Matheson, John Abel Smith, and Henry Wright, as the first partners was formed in Canton, and took the Chinese name 'Ewo' (ÊÄ°Âíå \\"Yee-Wo\\" Literally Happy Harmony). The name was taken from the earlier Ewo Hong founded by Howqua p. 122 Online version at Google books which had an honest and upright reputation. In 1834, Parliament ended the monopoly of the British East India Company on trade between Britain and China. Jardine, Matheson and Company took this opportunity to fill the vacuum left by the East India Company. With its first voyage carrying tea, the Jardine ship left for England. Jardine Matheson began its transformation from a major commercial agent of the East India Company into the largest British trading Hong, or firm, in Asia from its base in Hong Kong. p. 6 Jardine wanted the opium trade to expand in China and despatched Matheson to England to lobby the Government to press the Qing government to further open up trade. Matheson's mission proved unsuccessful and he was rebuked by the then British Foreign Secretary the Duke of Wellington. In a report, Matheson complained to Jardine over being insulted by an \\"arrogant and stupid man\\". Matheson expressed his views plainly, contemporaneously describing, \\"... the Chinese [as] a people characterised by a marvelous degree of imbecility, avarice, conceit and obstinacy...\\" Matheson returned to Asia in 1838 and the following year Jardine left for England to continue lobbying. Jardine's lobbying efforts proved more effective than his partner's and he succeeded in persuading the new British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston to wage war on Qing China. The subsequent First Opium War led to the Treaty of Nanking which allowed Jardine Matheson to expand from Canton to Hong Kong and Mainland China. After Jardine died a bachelor in 1843, his nephews David and Andrew Jardine assisted James Matheson in running the Hong as Tai-Pan. Matheson retired as Tai-Pan during the early 1840s and handed over to David Jardine, another nephew of Jardine. =Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in China= On 29 November 1834, Matheson became chairman of the newly formed \\"Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in China\\". The committee members represented a wide section of the business and missionary community in Canton: David Olyphant, William Wetmore, James Innes, Thomas Fox, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, Karl G√ºtzlaff and John Robert Morrison. John Francis Davis, at that time chief superintendent of British trade in China, was made an honorary member.  Return to Scotland  Lews Castle, Isle of Lewis In 1844 Matheson bought the Scottish Isle of Lewis for over half a million pounds and built Lews Castle, near Stornoway, clearing more than 500 families off the land by arranging their emigration to Canada. He went on to become the Governor of the Bank of England and the second largest landowner in Britain. In 1845, he began a programme of improvements on the island, including drainage schemes and road construction. He increased the programme during the Highland Potato Famine and by 1850 had spent ¬£329,000 on the island. Between 1851 and 1855 he assisted 1,771 people to emigrate. When in London Matheson lived at 13 Cleveland Row. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1846. As a result of his actions during the Highland Potato Famine, Matheson was awarded a baronetcy in 1851. He became Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashburton from 1843 to 1852 on the death of William Jardine (the previous incumbent) and for Ross and Cromarty from 1852 to 1868. He led an active public life into his eighth decade, and for many years served as chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.DNB: \\"Matheson, Sir (Nicholas) James Sutherland\\" His nephews succeeded him as directors of Jardine Matheson and Matheson & Company. Matheson died in 1878 at the age of 82 in Menton, France. He had married on 9 November 1843 Mary Jane Perceval the daughter of Michael Henry Perceval (1779‚Äì1829), illegitimate son of assassinated British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, Commissioner of the Port of Quebec from 1826 and a member, from Spencer Wood, of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. The Mathesons had no children and the baronetcy became extinct. The Lewis estate passed to his widow and subsequently to his nephew Donald and great-nephew Colonel Duncan Matheson. His widow erected a memorial to him in the grounds of Lews Castle. He left ¬£1,500 to help pay for the construction of the harbour at Port of Ness.Second Annual Report of the Fishery Board of Scotland 1883 Appendix E No. 1 James Matheson Memorial.jpgJames Matheson Memorial built in 1880 in Stornoway Castle Grounds refurbished in 2006 Cemetery in Lairg Scotland with James Matheson's tomb in background.JPGJames Matheson's Tomb in Lairg Scotland James Matheson's tomb at cemetery in Lairg, Scotland.JPGPoppy Wreath in James Matheson's Tomb in Lairg Scotland References ;Bibliography * External links * *Overview of Sir James Matheson *The Opium Wars: how Scottish traders fed the habit from The Scotsman *Sir James Matheson a 19th century improver with links to references for further study Category:1796 births Category:1878 deaths Category:People from Sutherland Category:People educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Scottish businesspeople Matheson, James, 1st Baronet Category:Jardine Matheson Group Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Ross-shire Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Ashburton Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:UK MPs 1841‚Äì1847 Category:UK MPs 1852‚Äì1857 Category:UK MPs 1857‚Äì1859 Category:UK MPs 1859‚Äì1865 Category:UK MPs 1865‚Äì1868 Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Smugglers ","title":"James Matheson"},{"id":"2527150","text":"Ma Hada La Hada is Najwa Karam's seventh studio album.

In the reign of Queen Victoria, display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned this fig leaf and kept it in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitaries: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth. Mercury holding the caduceus in the Vatican, with a fig leaf placed over the genitalia. The fig leaf was placed there under the more \\"chaste\\" Popes; later, most such coverings were removed. The expression \\"fig leaf\\" is widely used figuratively to convey the covering up of an act or an object that is embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance, a metaphorical reference to the Biblical Book of Genesis in which Adam and Eve used fig leaves to cover their nudity after eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.. WikiSource. \\"...and they sewed fig leaves and made themselves waist-belts\\" Some paintings and statues have the genitals of their subjects covered by a representation of an actual fig leaf or similar object, either as part of the work or added afterward for perceived modesty. History In Ancient Greek art, male nakedness, including the genitals, was common, although the female vulval area was generally covered in art for public display. This tradition continued in Ancient Roman art until the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, when heroic nudity vanished. During the Middle Ages, only the unfortunate (most often the damned) were usually shown naked, although the depictions were then often rather explicit. Adam and Eve were often shown wearing fig or other leaves, following the Biblical description. This was especially a feature of Northern Renaissance art. From about 1530, the developing reaction to Renaissance freedoms and excesses that led to the Council of Trent also led to a number of artworks, especially in churches or public places, being altered to reduce the amount of nudity on display. Often, as in the famous case of Michelangelo's The Last Judgement, drapery or extra branches from any nearby bush was used. This has been dubbed the \\"fig leaf campaign\\". For free-standing statues this did not work well, and carved or cast fig leaves were sometimes added, such as with the plaster copy of Michelangelo's David displayed in Victorian era London. The Adam and Eve panels on the Ghent Altarpiece, already equipped with fig leaves by Jan van Eyck, were simply replaced with 19th-century panels copying the figures but clothed. Many of these alterations have since been reversed, damaging some of the statues. Modern day Sandow portrays The Dying Gaul, a pose taken from an ancient Roman sculpture. Eugen Sandow, often considered the first modern-day bodybuilder, was an admirer of the human physique. In addition to strongman sideshows, he performed \\"muscle displays\\" by posing in the nude ‚Äî save for a fig leaf that he would don in imitation of statues he had seen in Italy as a boy. Metaphorical use The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, by Masaccio, before and after restoration. It was painted in 1425, covered up in 1680, and restored in 1980. The expression fig leaf has a pejorative metaphorical sense meaning a flimsy or minimal cover for anything or behaviour that might be considered shameful, with the implication that the cover is only a token gesture and the truth is obvious to all who choose to see it. A metaphorical fig leaf is something visible but innocuous, as against a coverup in which the existence of something may be entirely hidden. In the context of negotiation, an offer might be characterized as a \\"fig leaf\\" if that offer is actually a ploy to conceal a sinister plan.

Riverstone is located north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the Blacktown and Hawkesbury local government areas; parts of the Greater Western Sydney region. Originally settled in 1803 as part of a government stock farm, Riverstone is one of the oldest towns in Australia. As at the 2016 census, Riverstone had an estimated population of 7,247. History Prior to settlement and colonisation of Australia, the area that was to become known as Riverstone was inhabited by the Darug tribe. Most of these people died due to introduced diseases following the arrival of the First Fleet, and the remainder were largely relocated to government farms and a series of settlements. The Sydney Cove region originally settled in 1788 turned out to be unsuitable for farming, and after a number of years of near- famine in the colony, efforts were made to relocate food production inland to hopefully more climatically stable regions. In 1803 a government stock farm was established in what was to become the Riverstone/Marsden Park area, on the basis of the abundant water supply and good grazing land there. In 1810 Lieut- Col Maurice Charles O'Connell was granted 2,500 acres (10 km¬≤) of land in the district, which he named \\"Riverston Farm\\", after his birthplace in Ireland. (The \\"e\\" at the end first appeared on railway timetables in the 1860s, an apparent misprint that has become the accepted spelling, although the name is still pronounced as though the \\"e\\" is not present). Originally, beef cattle farmed in the area were driven overland to the Hawkesbury River for transport by sailing ship to the convict settlement at Sydney Cove. The construction of the Sydney to Richmond Railway line in the 1864 both eliminated the need for this and opened up the region to non-rural development. An important meatworks was established there in 1878, undergoing various stages of rebuilding and expansion until it closed permanently in 1992. In 1970, a major fire at the Riverstone Meatworks killed six men, who were attempting to lead the animals to safety. In 1988, as part of a Federal Government programme to commemorate the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia, a heritage museum was established in the old Masonic hall.  Heritage listings  Riverstone has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Riverstone Parade: Riverstone railway station * West Parade: House * Railway Terrace: *Riverstone Railway Station *Riverstone railway station Developments Riverstone Terrace In the 1880s O'Connell's widow subdivided and sold off most of the original grant, and a pattern of intersecting streets was laid out, mostly named after famous streets in London (e.g. Piccadilly Street, Gladstone Parade etc.). A substantial railway station, churches and other infrastructure were also constructed. The presumption was that Riverstone was set to become an important regional centre but this did not actually happen. Most of the allotments were eventually taken up for suburban housing but a few of the original 1880s blocks remain vacant to the present day. Riverstone terrace, erected in 1883, is a curious relic of the anticipated 19th century population boom. It was meant to be the first of a row of high-density terrace housing units that would run the length of Garfield road. However this single block and the small unit next to it were the only ones ever built. For many years the sight of a high density inner-city housing block situated in an empty country paddock remained a bizarre local landmark. Riverstone remained a small country town until the beginning of the 21st century when the current housing boom swallowed it up as part of the urban sprawl. Large areas of former farmland have recently (2014) also been released for housing in Riverstone and surrounding suburbs. On its northern side Riverstone still has a large and thriving industrial area. Poultry farming and intensive market gardening are also still important activities in the area. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,247 people in Riverstone. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.5% of the population. * 74.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 2.0%, Philippines 1.8%, England 1.8% and New Zealand 1.4%. * 78.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Maltese at 1.5%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 29.5%, No Religion 20.7% and Anglican 18.7%. Schools Riverstone features two public schools: Riverstone High School and Riverstone Public School. It also has three private schools: St Johns Catholic Primary School (Est 1882), Norwest Christian Collegehttp://www.norwest.nsw.edu.au/ (1980) (formerly known as Coverdale Christian School) andhttp://marsdenpark.acc.edu.au/ Australian Christian College.

Riverstone railway station is on the Richmond branch of the North Shore & Western Line on the Sydney Trains network, between Blacktown and Richmond. From dawn to about 9pm, commuter trains to Sydney leave at approximately 30 minute intervals, in most cases coinciding with the arrival of a train from Sydney. They stay for two minutes because the next station, Vineyard, is single platform. After that they shift to an hourly schedule. Depending on the hour, train services running through Riverstone offer a varying number of \\"limited stops\\" to the Sydney CBD and the majority then continue over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to the North Shore line and Hornsby or Berowra. Apart from the city stations, transfer to most other lines is easily made at Strathfield, Redfern or Parramatta, and other stops that offer fewer choices. The peak-hour journey from Riverstone to Central takes a little over an hour, and another 20 minutes to the popular destination of Chatswood. Buses at Riverstone are run by Busways with route 757 that goes to Mount Druitt and 747 to Marsden Park and Rouse Hill. Developments at the Garfield Rd traffic lights adjacent to the Railway Station have caused massive traffic disruptions.http://rouse-hill-times.whereilive.com.au/news/story/outrage-at- riverstone-lights/ Riverstone is one of the few suburbs left in the Sydney region with a level crossing with old-fashioned boom gates. This view looking west onto the undeveloped flood-prone paddocks is popular with Sydney film and TV commercial makers as a stand-in for a small country railway station. The final parting scene in the film Beneath Clouds was shot there. The M7 Motorway can be accessed by the Richmond Road ramp to provide faster access from Riverstone to the City. Riverstone and surrounding suburbs have a continuous motorway link to Sydney Airport via the Lane Cove Tunnel. Tallawong Metro Station is located just 10 minutes by car from Riverstone's CBD.  National Broadband Network (NBN)  Riverstone was named as one of the second release sites in the rollout of the optical fibre National Broadband Network. As of March 2014 most of the Riverstone residential streets were fitted with the NBN cable.

It continually monitors the most current asteroid catalog for possibilities of future impact with Earth over the next 100+ years. Whenever a potential impact is detected it will be analyzed and the results immediately published by the Near Earth Object Program. However, several weeks of optical data are not enough to conclusively identify an impact years in the future. By contrast, eliminating an entry on the risk page is a negative prediction; a prediction of where it will not be. Scientists warn against worrying about the possibility of impact with an object based on only a few weeks of optical data that show a possible Earth encounter years from now. Sometimes, it can't even be said for certain what side of the Sun such an object will be at the time of the listed virtual impactor date. Most objects on the Sentry Risk Table have an observation arc of less than 14 days and have not been observed for years. Sentry Risk Table Plot of orbits of known potentially hazardous asteroids The Impact Risk page lists a number of lost minor planets that are, for all practical purposes, permanent residents of the risk page; their removal may depend upon a serendipitous rediscovery.

Numbered notable objects with observation arcs of several years include: (29075) 1950 DA, 99942 Apophis, 101955 Bennu, and (410777) 2009 FD. Notable asteroids removed from Sentry in the last few years include (most recently removed listed first): , , , , , , , , 367943 Duende, and . The diameter of most near-Earth asteroids that have not been studied by radar or infrared can generally only be estimated within about a factor of 2 based on the asteroid's absolute magnitude (H). Their mass, consequently, is uncertain by about a factor of 10. For near-Earth asteroids without a well-determined diameter, Sentry assumes a generic albedo of 0.15. In August 2013, the Sentry Risk Table started using planetary ephemeris (DE431) for all NEO orbit determinations. DE431 (JPL small-body perturber ephemeris: SB431-BIG16) better models the gravitational perturbations of the planets and includes the 16 most massive main-belt asteroids. JPL launched major changes to the website in February 2017 and re-directed the classic page on 10 April 2017.  Numbers  there are over 23,000 near-Earth objects of which roughly 1023 near-Earth asteroids are listed on the risk table. About 95% of the objects on the risk table are too small to qualify as a potentially hazardous object because the objects are less than roughly 140 meters in diameter, or have an absolute magnitude fainter than 22. , only around 38 objects on the risk table are large enough to qualify as a PHO. Roughly 700 of these risk-listed near-Earth asteroids are estimated to be about the size of the Chelyabinsk meteor (H>26), which killed no one but had 1,491 non-direct injuries; or smaller. More than 2,490 asteroids have been removed from the risk table since it launched in 2002. The only two comets that briefly appeared on the Sentry Risk Table are 197P/LINEAR (2003 KV2) and 300P/Catalina (2005 JQ5).  Scout  Sentry's little brother Scout scans recently detected objects on the Minor Planet Center's NEO Confirmation Page with designations that are user-assigned and unofficial as they have not been confirmed by additional observations. The impact risk assessment is rated on a scale of 0‚Äì4 (negligible, small, modest, moderate, or elevated). Scout is used to help identify imminent impactors.

Her dancing career ended abruptly when she was stricken with polio in Copenhagen during the company's European tour in 1956. Eventually regaining most of the use of her arms and torso, she remained paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of her life. Biography Le Clercq was the daughter of Jacques Le Clercq, a French intellectual, as well as French teacher at Queens College in the 1950s and his American wife, Edith (n√©e Whittemore); she studied ballet with Mikhail Mordkin before auditioning for the School of American Ballet in 1941, where she won a scholarship. When Le Clercq was fifteen years old, famed choreographer George Balanchine asked her to perform with him in a dance he choreographed for a polio charity benefit. In an eerie portent of things to come (Le Clercq would contract polio at twenty-seven and never recover mobility in her legs), he played a character named Polio, and Le Clercq was his victim who became paralyzed and fell to the floor. Then, children tossed dimes at her character, prompting her to get up and dance again. Le Clercq was considered Balanchine's first ballerina: she was trained in his style from childhood and she was one of his most important muses, together with dancers like Maria Tallchief and, later on, Suzanne Farrell. During Le Clercq's tenure with the company, Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Merce Cunningham all created roles for her. Years later, after being stricken with polio, she reemerged as a dance teacher and as one student recalled, \\"used her hands and arms as legs and feet.\\"Dance Magazine Le Clercq's life and career are profiled in the 2013 documentary film, Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq. Novelist Varley O'Connor created a fictional account of the relationship between Tanaquil LeClercq and George Balanchine in The Master's Muse (Scribner 2012). =Personal life= Tanaquil Le Clercq was the fourth and last wife (1952‚Äì1969) of George Balanchine, the pioneer of American ballet. He obtained a quick divorce from her to woo Suzanne Farrell (who refused Balanchine's marriage proposal and went on to marry another Balanchine dancer, Paul Mejia).

As of June 2019, Schofield Gardens has an average gross yield 3.9% - 0.1% higher than that of Greater Sydney (3.8%). Demographics As at the 2016 Census, Schofields had an estimated population of 4,983. In 2001, Schofields had an estimated population of 3,012. Over the 15 year period, Schofield's population increased by 65.4%. The suburb is on the rural-urban fringe of Sydney, and is expanding rapidly. It is in the NSW Government's North West Growth Area. Schofields has numerous housing developments underway, which are expected to provide over 2,950 new homes. Schofields is a mostly Catholic area (30.8%). The second largest religion is No Religion (17.7%). The most spoken language in Schofields is English, with Hindi being the second most spoken language at 3.7%. The majority of people from Schofields identified as Australian (21.3%), followed closely by English (20.4%). The third largest ancestry was Indian at 8.4%. History Wyndham College, Nirimba, Schofields. John Schofield (1803‚Äì1884) was transported from England to the Colony of New South Wales for stealing when he was just 17 years old. At the time he was a silk weaver from Cheshire. He was transported aboard HMS Minerva in 1821 and was assigned to work for Thomas Harley, a free-settler, on his farm at . In 1828, Schofield was granted a Ticket of Leave, which allowed him to live freely within the district of Parramatta. In 1829, he married Bridget Harley, the daughter of his former employer. Schofield then rented Gillingham Farm, located near the Eastern Creek. The Schofields delivered eight offspring; five males and three females. In 1841, Schofield bought three blocks of land along the Windsor Road. Unfortunately, due to falling wool prices and a general state of depression in the colony, Schofield became bankrupt in 1843. New government concessions introduced a few years later allowed Schofield to buy of land around the area now known as Schofields in 1845. In 1849, Schofield and two of his sons, William and Samuel, sailed to California in the hope of finding gold. He returned in 1850 with some gold, but their ship, the Rosetta Joseph struck land and became ship wrecked. Aboard life-boats and in very rough seas, the passengers were rescued at after ten days. Schofield and his sons returned to their farm with enough gold to pay off most of his debts. Just before Christmas in 1851, Bridget Schofield died. The discovery of gold in New South Wales and a rise in the economy provided Schofield with enough money to pay off his mortgage and develop his keen interest in horseracing. The railway line from to opened in 1864 and passed through Schofield's land. In 1872, a stopping place was recognised on Schofield's land and a small platform made from railway sleepers was built after that to make boarding the train safer. This platform was known as Schofield's Siding. The name changed over the years to Schofields. In his later life, Schofield set up a sawmill beside the railway line and used the trees from his paddocks in Schofields to supply timber for housing. John Schofield died in 1884. Parks, recreation and essential services Schofields Park, on Station Street, is the home of the Riverstone Schofields Junior Soccer Football Club and Schofields Cricket Club. The village also has a Community Hall that can be hired out for parties and is also regularly used by the local Church Group on Sunday mornings. The village also has a NSW Rural Fire Service brigade, known as Schofields Bush Fire Brigade. They regularly attend house fires, car accidents, bush fires and most other emergencies in the area that require fire brigade attendance. A Woolworths Supermarket recently opened up across the road from the new Schofields railway station. The suburb is also home to the former Schofields Aerodrome and HMAS Nirimba. Transport Schofields railway station is on the Richmond branch of the T1 North Shore & Western Line and T5 Cumberland Line of the Sydney Trains network.

This invention, protected by German patent 141,029 in 1902, had a profound influence on the production of margarine and vegetable shortening. Early life and education His father, Julius Normann, was the principal of the elementary school and Selekta in Petershagen. His mother was Luise Normann, n√©e Siveke. Normann attended primary school from 31 March 1877. At Easter of his sixth grade he moved to the Friedrichs Gymnasium in Herford. After his father applied for a teacher's job at the municipal secondary school in Kreuznach, Wilhelm changed to the Royal Secondary School in Kreuznach. He passed his examinations and left school at the age of 18. Career Normann began work at the Herford machine fat and oil factory Leprince & Siveke in 1888. The founder of that company was his uncle, Wilhelm Siveke. After running a branch of the company in Hamburg for two years, he started studying chemistry at the laboratory of Professor Carl Remigius Fresenius in Wiesbaden. From April 1892 Normann continued his studies at the department of oil analytics at the Berlin Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor D. Holde. From 1895 to 1900 he studied chemistry under supervision of Prof. Claus and Prof. Willgerod and geology under supervision of Prof. Steinmann at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg. There he received his doctorate in 1900 with a work about Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis der Reaktion zwischen unterchlorigsauren Salzen und prim√§ren aromatischen Aminen (\\"Contributions to the knowledge of the reactions of hypochlorite salts and primary aromatic amines\\"). In 1901 Normann was appointed as correspondent of the Federal Geological Institute. Primary work From 1901 to 1909 he was head of the laboratory at Leprince & Siveke, where conducted investigations of the properties of fats and oils. In 1901 Normann heard about Paul Sabatier publishing an article,Chemiker-Zeitung, 25, Nr. 13, S. 136 (1901) in which Sabatier stated that only with vaporizable organic compounds it is possible to bind catalytic hydrogen to fluid tar oils. Normann investigated and disproved Sabatier's assertion. He was able to transform liquid oleic acid into solid stearic acid by the use of catalytic hydrogenation with dispersed nickel. This was the precursor of saturated fat hardening. On 27 February 1901 Normann invented what he called fat hardening, which was the process of producing saturated fats. On 14 August 1902 the German Imperial patent office granted patent 141,029 to the Leprince & Siveke Company, and on 21 January 1903 Normann was granted the British patent, . During the years 1905 to 1910 Normann built a fat hardening facility in the Herford company. In 1908 the patent was bought by Joseph Crosfield & Sons Limited of Warrington, England. From the autumn of 1909 hardened fat was being successfully produced in what in a large scale plant in Warrington. The initial year's production was nearly .

From 1911 to 1922, Normann was scientific director of √ñlwerke Germania (Germania Oil Factory) in Emmerich am Rhein, which was established by the Dutch J√ºrgens company. From 1917, Normann built a fat hardening factory in Antwerp for the margarine company SAPA Societe anonyme des grasses, huiles et produits africaines, which operated in India. He served as technical director by order of the Belgian Colonial Society. On 25 April 1920 he filed for German patent 407180 Verfahren zur Herstellung von gemischten Glyceriden (Procedure for the production of mixed glycerides), which was approved on 9 December 1924.German Patents On 26 June 1920 the Firma Oelwerke Germania and Dr Wilhelm Normann filed for German patent 417215, Verfahren zur Umesterung von Fettsaurestern. (Procedure for the transesterification of fatty esters), which was approved on 27 September 1925. From 1924 to 1927 Normann was a consultant for fat hardening facilities for foreign companies. On 30 October 1926 Normann and the Volkmar Haenig & Comp, Metallochemische Werk Rodlebe company filed for German patent 564894, for Elektrisch beheizter Etagenroester (Electrically heated esters), approved 24 November 1932. On 14 May 1929 he applied for German patent 582266, Verfahren zur Darstellung von Estern (Procedure for the representation of esters), which was approved on 11 August 1933. Personal life Normann married Martha Uflerb√§umerMartha Uflerb√§umer(picture, lower right) of Herford on 12 September 1916. On 1 January 1939 Normann retired, and he died on 1 May 1939 after an illness in the K√ºchwald Hospital in Chemnitz. He was entombed on 5 May 1939 in the family grave at the old cemetery on Hermannstrasse in Herford.

Origin The author of the first six volumes of Studies in the Scriptures, Charles Taze Russell, reported that he did not write them \\"through visions and dreams, nor by God's audible voice,\\" but that he sought \\"to bring together these long scattered fragments of truth\\". The first volume was written in 1886. Originally titled The Plan of the Ages as part of a series called Millennial Dawn, it was later renamed The Divine Plan of the Ages. The name of the series was changed to Studies in the Scriptures in 1904 in order to clarify their nature as biblical textbooks. Purpose Chart from Divine Plan of the Ages, Studies in Scriptures Vol 1.The series was written as a Bible study aid. The intention was that by studying the Bible topically, rather than verse by verse, details of God's purpose might become clearer. The series progresses from elementary topics, such as the existence of God and promoting the Bible as God's word, to deeper subject matter throughout the series. Contents # The Divine Plan of the Ages (1886)--elementary topics and attempts to show God has a clear purpose for mankind; # The Time is at Hand (1889)--an interpretation of biblical chronology, keys to time prophecies, the second advent of Christ, and the identification of the Antichrist; # Thy Kingdom Come (1891)--describes biblical prophecies in further detail, along with the fate of Israel and information on the Great Pyramid of Giza as being built under God's direction. The section on Pyramidology was influenced by the theories of Charles Piazzi Smyth, who also helped review it; # The Day of Vengeance (1897), later renamed The Battle of Armageddon--suggests causes of the dissolution of the present order, with the biblical remedy as God's kingdom; # The At-one-ment Between God and Man (1899)--discusses the nature of humanity, the work of redemption, and the Holy Spirit; # The New Creation (1904)--discusses the seven days of creation found in Genesis, and the duties and personal responsibilities of a Christian. Viewpoint and theology The series was criticized by some early 20th century ministers as an attempt to replace the Bible. Russell's view was that whilst the Bible had been studied by different methods, topical study was the best approach. In addition to other material, the six volumes contain commentary about biblical events and expressions. Russell did not claim infallibility, but declared that God's plan of salvation could not be understood independently from his writings. He stated, \\"if he then lays [the Studies in the Scriptures] aside and ignores them and goes to the Bible alone, though he has understood his Bible for ten years, our experience shows that within two years he goes into darkness.\\" Studies in the Scriptures claimed to represent that humankind had reached the end of the current era, and that Jesus would soon separate the wheat from the weeds. The Finished Mystery Russell had stated an intention to write a seventh volume of Studies, which would be a commentary on the books of Ezekiel and Revelation, as early as 1906. Following Russell's death in 1916, a seventh volume--entitled The Finished Mystery--was published in 1917 and advertised as his \\"posthumous work\\". This seventh volume was a detailed interpretation of the books of Ezekiel and Revelation, as well as the Song of Solomon. An advertisement for the book in Zion's Watch Tower called it \\"the true interpretation\\",(The Finished Mystery, 1917, p. 334) and it was promoted as being \\"of the Lord‚Äîprepared under his guidance.\\"(The Finished Mystery, 1917, p. 126) Immediate controversy surrounded both its publication and content. It was soon established that it was largely written and compiled by two of Russell's associates, Clayton J. Woodworth and George H. Fisher, and edited by Russell's successor, Joseph Franklin Rutherford. Withdrawal The abandonment of several core doctrines under Rutherford's presidency prompted the Watch Tower Society to cease publication of all seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures in 1927, although the books were still being sold door-to-door in 1929. Other publications of Jehovah's Witnesses, including Jehovah's Witnesses‚ÄîProclaimers of God's Kingdom (their official history) and Revelation--Its Grand Climax at Hand (their exposition of the Book of Revelation) make reference to Studies in the Scriptures. The six volumes of Studies in the Scriptures authored by Russell are still published by independent groups within the Bible Student movement.

It faces North and effectively divides the commercial and business areas of the city centre. It is a Grade A listed building. History The White Linen Hall, or the alt=A black and white photograph, showing a stately-looking two- storey building with white walls, extending out of shot to the left and right, with an arched cart entrance at the centre. A modest clocktower rises above the entrance, and the building is surrounded by neat shrubbery and iron railings. A wide street crosses left-right outside of the fence, with a handful of horse-drawn carts and pedestrians in 19th-century clothing. The site now occupied by Belfast City Hall was once the home of the White Linen Hall, an important international Linen Exchange. The street that runs from the back door of Belfast City Hall through the middle of Linen Quarter is Linen Hall Street.The Linen Hall Library, one of Belfast's oldest cultural institutions, that occupies a site in Donegal Square North in front of today's City Hall, started life within the walls of the White Linen Hall. Plans for the City Hall began in 1888 when Belfast was awarded city status by Queen Victoria. This was in recognition of Belfast's rapid expansion and thriving linen, rope-making, shipbuilding and engineering industries. During this period Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the most populous city in Ireland. Belfast Corporation used their profits from the gas industry to pay for the construction of the Belfast City Hall. The building, which was designed by Sir Alfred Brumwell Thomas in the Baroque Revival style, was built in Portland Stone at a cost of ¬£369,000 and opened on 1 August 1906. Local firms H&J; Martin and WH Stephens were among the companies involved in the design and construction. The city hall in Durban, South Africa is almost an exact replica of Belfast's City Hall. It was built in 1910 and designed by Stanley G. Hudson, who was inspired by the Belfast design. The Port of Liverpool Building, designed by Sir Arnold Thornely and completed in 1913, is another very close relative.Brett, C. E. B. Buildings of Belfast 1700‚Äì1914. Belfast: Friar's Bush Press, 1985; p. 65. On 1 August 2006 the City Hall celebrated its centenary with a \\"Century of Memories\\" exhibition and family picnic day. On 3 December 2012, the City Council voted to limit the days that the Union Flag flies from City Hall to no more than 18 designated days. Since 1906, the flag had been flown every day of the year. The move was backed by the Council's Irish nationalist Councillors and by its Alliance Party Councillors. It was opposed by the unionist Councillors, who had enjoyed a majority on the council until the Northern Ireland local elections of 2011. On the night of the vote, unionist and loyalist protesters tried to storm the City Hall. They held protests throughout Northern Ireland, some of which became violent.\\"Violence in Belfast after council votes to change Union flag policy\\" BBC News 3 December 2012 Retrieved 5 December 2012 Exterior The grounds of City Hall: in the background are the dome at Victoria Square Shopping Centre and the Belfast Wheel. The hall features towers at each of the four corners, with a lantern-crowned green copper dome in the centre. The pediment sculpture is by F. W. Pomeroy, assisted by local carver J. Edgar Winter, and features on the reverse side of the current series of ¬£10, ¬£20, ¬£50 and ¬£100 sterling banknotes issued by the Northern Bank. Interior The interior has a number of notable features including the Porte-Coch√®re and Grand Entrance, the Grand Staircase, the Reception Room and the Banqueting Hall. The roof above the Banqueting Hall was destroyed during the Belfast blitz on the night of 4/5 May 1941 and had to be rebuilt. Carrara, Pavonazzo and Brescia marbles are used extensively throughout the building as are stained glass windows featuring among others the Belfast Coat of Arms, portraits of Queen Victoria and William III and shields of the Provinces of Ireland. There is also a stained glass window commemorating the 36th (Ulster) Division. Grounds and public memorials The Cenotaph in Belfast The memorial to Sir Edward Harland, the former head of the Harland and Wolff shipyard and Lord Mayor of Belfast, was sculpted by Sir Thomas Brock and unveiled by the Earl of Glasgow on 23 June 1903. The statue of Queen Victoria also by Brock was unveiled by King Edward VII on 27 July 1903. The Titanic Memorial in Belfast was dedicated in June 1920. The grounds also house Northern Ireland's main war memorial, the Garden of Remembrance and Cenotaph, unveiled in 1929. There is also a granite column dedicated to the American Expeditionary Force, many of whom were based in Belfast prior to D-Day, unveiled in 1943. A memorial to Leading Seaman James Magennis VC, made from Portland stone and bronze, was erected in the grounds in October 1999. On 3 January 2006 Belfast City Councillors ratified a plan to erect a statue to the late Belfast footballer George Best in the grounds of the City Hall. Following approval from the Best family, the George Best Memorial Trust was created in December 2006. The trust's patron David Healy contributed ¬£1,000 to the estimated total cost of ¬£200,000. In October 2007 a 60-metre Ferris wheel was constructed in the grounds, giving passengers panoramic views above the city. The wheel had 42 air-conditioned capsules, which could hold up to six adults and two children. The wheel finally closed at 6:00 pm on 11 April 2010 and was removed during May 2010.Belfast City Council In 2008, the Imjin River Memorial was relocated here when the St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena closed.

To its south are the suburbs of Piscinola-Marianella, Miano and Secondigliano. It was built during the second half of the twentieth century.  History  Scampia was built as a bedroom suburb in the 1960s. The area was mostly developed in the 1970s and 1980s with huge, high-rise residential blocks, in particular after the 1980 earthquake with construction of housing in the area called \\"167\\" for displaced Neapolitans.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1534251/Police- powerless-against-Naples-mafia-drug-gangs.html Huge apartment complexes, wide boulevards and a massive park were built, without commercial districts or entertainment venues. Many people, however, were not placed in Scampia because of the problems caused by the earthquake. They occupied house in different buildings of the neighbourhood, in particular many houses in the \\"Vele\\". That was especially due to the Camorra crime syndicate, that took control of the \\"Vele\\" and turned them into their own space in which drug could be sold or hidden from the police. Large metal gates on some of the walkways and stairs in the blocks of flats have been put there, not by the council, but by the Camorra itself, so they can be locked by drug pushers as they flee the police.Weekends turn bloody in Naples mafia war, The Guardian, December 18, 2004In Naples, a Mob Family Feud, The Washington Post, February 8, 2005 With over 50% unemployment, the area had in fact a very high crime rate, with heroin and cocaine sold, and used openly, in the streets.Mafia vice blights Naples school, BBC News, November 30, 2004 Scampia was also the territory of the Di Lauro clan, which controlled the drug trade and most other illegal activities in the area.

It was named for the triangular shaped buildings, reminiscent of a sail, as they are wide at the base and narrowing as they rise. They are similar to Marina Baie des Anges in Villeneuve-Loubet, France. Built as a result of Law 167, which was passed in 1962, the Sails of Scampia were designed by Franz Di Salvo. Le Vele di Scampia, cultura e progetto in AA.VV. Francesco Di Salvo. Opere e progetti, (pp. 69‚Äì82) Le Vele di Scampia, una storia lunga 54 anni nel cuore di \\"Gomorra\\", La Repubblica, 11 March 2016 They were part of a project which also included development of the city of Naples to the east, in Ponticelli. They best represent Di Salvo's style of architectural design. Di Salvo first designed low-cost housing in 1945. He worked in collaboration with other architects, to design the District of Cesare Battisti Poggioreale, which represented the paradigm of a \\"new way of thinking\\" about social housing. After years of continuous design experiments, the task of establishing a large apartment complex in Scampia was entrusted to the Cassa del Mezzogiorno. The design followed the housing unit principles articulated by Le Corbusier for the design of public housing. He was influenced by the trestle structures proposed by Kenz≈ç Tange.Ghirardo, Italy: Modern Architectures in History, pp. 163‚Äì64 Di Salvo proposed a plan for the district which was based on two building types: a \\"tower\\" and \\"tent\\". The tent type provides the dominant impression of sails. The buildings were designed following the idea of existenzminimum (subsistence dwelling): the dwellings themselves were deliberately minimal, with many shared exterior spaces where life would take place. This was done with the specific aim of reconstructing the spirit of Naples's alleys and courtyards, crowded but congenial, in an apartment building. This philosophy additionally reduced construction costs; The article, written by an author who has discussed crime in Naples extensively, details the history and decline of the Vele and construction was skimped as funds were stolen, and the works were not finished. = Decline = Originally, the complex consisted of seven massive apartment blocks, and housed from 40,000 to 70,000 people, although a real headcount was never conducted. Three of the seven blocks have been demolished, but some 40,000 people still live in the damaged structures. The idea behind the project was to provide a huge public housing project, where hundreds of families could socialize and create a community. The design included a public transportation rail station, and a large park area between the two buildings. The planners wanted to create a small city model with large parks, playing fields, and other facilities. However, various causes have led to what is now regarded as a ghetto. Right after the earthquake in 1980, many families in the area were left homeless. Many of these families without shelter started to occupy the apartments illegally. Tolerated and ignored by the government, more people started to occupy the buildings including criminals. Things were made worse by the total lack of police presence, resulting in drug trafficking, illegal street racing, gangs, and fencing operations. Roberto Saviano wrote the book Gomorrah about organised criminality by the Camorra (the Neapolitan mafia)‚Äîwith the Vele playing a big part‚Äîand discussed the Vele and their decline and criminality extensively in a long article about the demolition of the last of the sails in 2020. The first police station for the area was established in 1987, fifteen years after people began occupying the apartments. = Demolition = Following continuous protest by the residents who felt that their extensive problems could not be fixed, the intention to demolition of the complex was announced in 2016. In 2019 residents began moving into new apartments built nearby, the apartments empty and bricked up awaiting demolition. One tower may be left as offices or a museum. Demolition, after being held up by the discovery of asbestos, started on 20 February 2020.  Perspectives on Scampia  In 2008, with the help of European funds, many projects were presented with the intention of retrain the area. First of all, one of the headquarters' of the Medical Department of the University \\"Federico II\\" will be opened in November 2019. Moreover, in 2010 many military forces have been placed outside the subway station of \\"Piscinola\\" and also in the vicinity of the \\"Vele\\" in order to offer more security to the area. In 2016 many residents that lived in the \\"Vele\\" started being placed in the new buildings erected in an area close to the station, in order to carry on the project of demolishing them, in order to also eliminate the symbol of Camorra. The project that has allowed this relocation has been actually named \\"Restart Scampia\\".  In popular culture  Scenes from the movie Gomorrah were filmed in the neighbourhood in 2008.Streets of 'Gomorrah', Newsweek magazine issue dated December 22, 2008 Moreover, the homonym TV series Gomorrah (2014) was also based on the same book written by Roberto Saviano and it was directed by Stefano Sollima. Many scenes, especially episodes of season two, were filmed in different Scampia's buildings. It also includes actors who actually live in Scampia, like Christian Giroso.

The association \\"Vo.di.Sca\\" (Voci di Scampia, in English: Scampia's Voices), created by Rosario Esposito La Rossa, a writer, editor and bookseller born in Scampia, and Maddalena Stornaiuolo, has moved the neapolitan publishing company \\"Marotta&Cafiero; editori\\" from Posillipo to Scampia, turning it into an independent and open-source publishing house. It publishes books printed on recycled paper with non-polluting ink having the license \\"Creative Commons\\" and produced from the bottom. It is, in fact, the first cooperative made by young people in the northern area of Naples. This publishing house has also embraced the field of music with the recording label \\"Marotta&Cafiero; Recorder\\", which has published more than 10 CDs and a vinyl. In 2013 \\"Marotta&Cafiero;\\" becomes a book store with the name \\"Marotta&Cafiero; Store\\". It was placed in the \\"Teatro Bellini\\" and it has been managed only by women.

Originally known as Township D, it was established in 1792. In 1800, it became part of Carleton County and was incorporated as a township in 1850. The first settler in the township was Jehiel Collins, from Vermont, who settled in an area near the Ottawa River which later became part of Bytown. Over the years, parts of Nepean Township were annexed by the expanding city of Ottawa. The original town hall of the township of Nepean was located in Westboro, which became part of Ottawa in 1949. A new town hall was built in Bells Corners in 1966. Nepean was incorporated as a city in 1978 and became part of the amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2001. Nepean Township took its name from Sir Evan Nepean, British Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1782 to 1791. According to the Canada 2001 Census, the Township (original boundaries) had a population of 339,708. The 1850 boundaries of Nepean Township were the Ottawa River on the north, the Rideau River on the east, approximately along where Bankfield Road and Brophy Drive are today on the south, and approximately where Eagleson Road, March Road, and Hertzberg Road are today through to Shirleys Bay on the west. The township included much of what is now Ottawa, all of the former City of Nepean, and parts of the former City of Kanata. To the west of Nepean Township was Goulbourn and March Townships, to the east Gloucester Township, and to the south North Gower Township.

The BIT index is based upon the premise that GDGT-4 (also known as crenarchaeol) is derived from marine-dwelling Thaumarchaeota and branched GDGTs are derived from terrestrial soil bacteria. When BIT values exceed 0.4, a deviation of >2 ¬∞C is incorporated into TEX86 SST estimates. However, isoprenoidal GDGTs can be synthesised in the terrestrial environment and can render BIT values unreliable (Weijers et al., 2006; Sluijs et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2012). A strong co-variation between GDGT-4 and branched GDGTs in modern marine and freshwater environments also suggests a common or mixed source for isoprenoidal and branched GDGTs (Fietz et al., 2012). =Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM)= The Methane Index (MI) was proposed to help distinguish the relative input of methanotrophic Euryarchaeota in settings characterised by diffuse methane flux and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) (Zhang et al., 2011). These sites are characterised by a distinct GDGT distribution, namely the predominance of GDGT-1. -2 and -3. High MI values (>0.5) reflect high rates of gas-hydrate-related AOM. =Degradation= Thermal maturity is only thought to affect GDGTs when temperature exceed 240 ¬∞C. This can be tested using a ratio of specific hopane isomers. Oxic degradation, which is a selective process and degrades compounds at different rates, has been shown to affect TEX86 values and can bias SST values by up to 6 ¬∞C.

During the early Eocene, TEX86 values indicate warm high southern hemisphere latitude SSTs (20-25 ¬∞C) in agreement with other, independently derived proxies (e.g. alkenones, CLAMP, Mg/Ca). During the middle and late Eocene, high southern latitude sites cooled while the tropics remained stable and warm. Possible reasons for this cooling include long-term changes in carbon dioxide and/or changes in gateway reorganisation (e.g. Tasman Gateway, Drake Passage).

It is the IP-specific form of multicast and is used for streaming media and other network applications. It uses specially reserved multicast address blocks in IPv4 and IPv6. Protocols associated with IP multicast include Internet Group Management Protocol, Protocol Independent Multicast and Multicast VLAN Registration. IGMP snooping is used to manage IP multicast traffic on layer-2 networks. IP multicast is described in . IP multicast was first standardized in 1986.RFC 988 Its specifications have been augmented in RFC 4604 to include group management and in to include administratively scoped addresses. Technical description =Overview= IP multicast is a technique for one-to-many and many-to-many real-time communication over an IP infrastructure in a network. It scales to a larger receiver population by requiring neither prior knowledge of a receiver's identity nor prior knowledge of the number of receivers. Multicast uses network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network (typically network switches and routers) take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers such that messages are sent over each link of the network only once. The most common transport layer protocol to use multicast addressing is User Datagram Protocol (UDP). By its nature, UDP is not reliable‚Äîmessages may be lost or delivered out of order. Reliable multicast protocols such as Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) have been developed to add loss detection and retransmission on top of IP multicast. Key concepts in IP multicast include an IP multicast group address,RFC 5771 a multicast distribution tree and receiver driven tree creation.RFC 1112 An IP multicast group address is used by sources and the receivers to send and receive multicast messages. Sources use the group address as the IP destination address in their data packets. Receivers use this group address to inform the network that they are interested in receiving packets sent to that group. For example, if some content is associated with group \`239.1.1.1\`, the source will send data packets destined to \`239.1.1.1\`. Receivers for that content will inform the network that they are interested in receiving data packets sent to the group \`239.1.1.1\`. The receiver joins \`239.1.1.1\`. The protocol typically used by receivers to join a group is called the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). With routing protocols based on shared trees, once the receivers join a particular IP multicast group, a multicast distribution tree is constructed for that group. The protocol most widely used for this is Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM). It sets up multicast distribution trees such that data packets from senders to a multicast group reach all receivers which have joined the group. There are variations of PIM implementations: Sparse Mode (SM), Dense Mode (DM), source- specific multicast (SSM) and Bidirectional Mode (Bidir, or Sparse-Dense Mode, SDM). Of these, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed ; SSM and Bidir are simpler and scalable variations developed more recently and are gaining in popularity. IP multicast operation does not require an active source to know about the receivers of the group. The multicast tree construction is receiver driven and is initiated by network nodes which are close to the receivers. IP multicast scales to a large receiver population. The IP multicast model has been described by Internet architect Dave Clark as, \\"You put packets in at one end, and the network conspires to deliver them to anyone who asks.\\" IP multicast creates state information per multicast distribution tree in the network. If a router is part of 1000 multicast trees, it has 1000 multicast routing and forwarding entries. On the other hand, a multicast router does not need to know how to reach all other multicast trees in the Internet. It only needs to know about multicast trees for which it has downstream receivers. This is key to scaling multicast-addressed services. In contrast, a unicast router needs to know how to reach all other unicast addresses in the Internet, even if it does this using just a default route. For this reason, aggregation is key to scaling unicast routing. Also, there are core routers that carry routes in the hundreds of thousands because they contain the Internet routing table. =Routing= Each host that wants to be a receiving member of a multicast group (i.e. receive data corresponding to a particular multicast address) must use IGMP to join. Adjacent routers also use this protocol to communicate. In unicast routing, each router examines the destination address of an incoming packet and looks up the destination in a table to determine which interface to use in order for that packet to get closer to its destination. The source address is irrelevant to the router. However, in multicast routing, the source address (which is a simple unicast address) is used to determine data stream direction. The source of the multicast traffic is considered upstream. The router determines which downstream interfaces are destinations for this multicast group (the destination address), and sends the packet out through the appropriate interfaces. The term reverse path forwarding is used to describe this concept of routing packets away from the source, rather than towards the destination. A number of errors can happen if packets intended for unicast are accidentally sent to a multicast address; in particular, sending ICMP packets to a multicast address has been used in the context of DoS attacks as a way of achieving packet amplification. On the local network, multicast delivery is controlled by IGMP (on IPv4 network) and MLD (on IPv6 network); inside a routing domain, PIM or MOSPF are used; between routing domains, one uses inter-domain multicast routing protocols, such as MBGP. The following are some common delivery and routing protocols used for multicast distribution: * Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) * Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) * Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) * Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) * Multicast BGP (MBGP) * Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) * Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) * GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP) * Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) =Layer 2 delivery= Unicast packets are delivered to a specific recipient on an Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 subnet by setting a specific layer 2 MAC address on the Ethernet packet address. Broadcast packets make use of a broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). IPv4 multicast packets are delivered using the Ethernet MAC address range 01:00:5e:00:00:00‚Äì01:00:5e:7f:ff:ff (with an OUI owned by the IANA). This range has 23 bits of available address space. The first octet (01) includes the broadcast/multicast bit. The lower 23 bits of the 28-bit multicast IP address are mapped into the 23 bits of available Ethernet address space. This means that there is ambiguity in delivering packets. If two hosts on the same subnet each subscribe to a different multicast group whose address differs only in the first 5 bits, Ethernet packets for both multicast groups will be delivered to both hosts, requiring the network software in the hosts to discard the unrequired packets.RFC 1112 Section 6.4 For IPv6 multicast addresses, the Ethernet MAC is derived by the four low-order octets OR'ed with the MAC 33:33:00:00:00:00, so for example the IPv6 address FF02:DEAD:BEEF::1:3 would map to the Ethernet MAC address 33:33:00:01:00:03.RFC 2464 If a switch does not understand multicast addresses then it will flood that traffic to all the members of a LAN; in this case the system's network card (or operating system) has to filter the packets sent to multicast groups they are not subscribed to. There are switches that listen to IGMP traffic and maintain a state table of which network systems are subscribed to a given multicast group. This table is then used to forward traffic destined to a given group only to a limited set of hosts (ports). This process of listening to the IGMP traffic is called IGMP snooping. Additionally, some switches with layer 3 capabilities can act as an IGMP querier. In networks where there is no router present to act as a multicast router, a switch with IGMP snooping querier enabled can be used to generate the needed IGMP messages to get users to subscribe to multicast traffic. =Wireless considerations= 802.11 wireless networking uses the same range of MAC addresses as wired Ethernet to map IP multicast addresses. However, an 802.11 wireless network handles multicast traffic differently, depending on the configuration of delivery traffic indication message (DTIM), and beacon interval settings. If no stations within the basic service set are in power save mode, multicast packets are sent immediately when they arrive. If there are one or more stations in power save mode, access points then only deliver multicast traffic after each DTIM interval and transmit at one of the supported rates in the basic rate set. In most wireless access points, default configuration for this interval is either 102.4 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 1) or 204.8 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 2) and the transmit rate is either 1 Mbit/s or 6 Mbit/s, depending on the operating band and protection mode. The DTIM and beacon interval settings can be adjusted to improve multicast performance in wireless networks. Unlike Ethernet, most traffic in 802.11 is sent reliably using ACKs and NACKs so that radio interference doesn't cause unbearably high packet loss. However, multicast packets are sent once and are not acknowledged, so they are subject to much higher loss rates. There are various methods for coping with this, such as choosing to unicast multicast data repeatedly to each client, or requesting ACKs from each client. Some methods require only modification on the access point, and are supported in some enterprise-class devices, while other improvements would require modifications to clients, and therefore have not seen widespread adoption.  Secure multicast  IP multicast is an internet communication method where a single data packet can be transmitted from a sender and replicated to a set of receivers. The replication techniques are somewhat dependent upon the media used to transmit the data. Transmission of multicast on an inherent broadcast media such as Ethernet or a satellite link automatically allows the data packet to be received by all the receivers directly attached to the media. In contrast, transmission of multicast on media that is point-to-point or point-to- multipoint requires the packet to be replicated for each link. The replication process should occur in an optimal manner where a distribution tree is built within the network. The packet can be replicated at each of the branches in the tree. This mitigates the requirement for the sender to replicate the packet once for each recipient. The use of IPsec as a communication link requires a point-to-point connection establishment. Usually, the security is required from sender to receiver which implies the sender must replicate the packet on each of the secure connections - one for each receiver. As the number of receivers grows, the sender must scale by replicating the packet to each of the receivers. The processing load placed on the sender can be high which limits the scalability of the sender. A new method was required to securely transmit multicast and this was referred to as Secure Multicast or Multicast Security. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a new Internet Protocol (IP) to securely transmit multicast traffic across a packet network. The protocol definition was developed in the Multicast Security Workgroup and led to several Request for Comments (RFC) that are now used as standards for securing IP multicast traffic. The protocol allowed a sender to encrypt the multicast packet and forward it into the packet network on the optimal distribution tree. The packet may be replicated at the optimal locations in the network and delivered to all the receivers. The receivers are capable of decrypting the packet and forwarding the packet in the secure network environment. The sender of a multicast packet does not know the potential receivers; therefore, the creation of pair-wise encryption keys (one for each receiver) is impossible. The sender must encrypt packets using a shared key that all the legitimate receivers use to decrypt the packets. The security of the system is based on the ability to control the distribution of the keys only to those legitimate receivers. For this, the IETF created the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) protocol defined in RFC-6407. The protocol allows the sender and receiver to join a key server where policies and keys are encrypted and distributed to the members of the secure multicast group. The key server can authenticate and authorize senders and receivers into a specific group where the shared key is used to encrypt and decrypt traffic between members of the group. Reliable multicast Multicast, by its very nature, is not a connection-oriented mechanism, so protocols such as TCP, which allows for retransmission of missing packets, are not appropriate. For applications such as streaming audio and video, the occasional dropped packet is not a problem. But for distribution of critical data, a mechanism is required for requesting retransmission. One such scheme, proposed by Cisco, is PGM (originally Pretty Good Multicasting, but changed for trademark reasons to Pragmatic General Multicast), documented in RFC 3208. In this scheme, multicast packets have sequence numbers and when a packet is missed a recipient can request that the packet be re-multicast with other members of the Multicast group ignoring the replacement data if not needed. An expanded version, PGM-CC, has attempted to make IP Multicasting more \\"TCP friendly\\" by stepping the entire group down to the bandwidth available by the worst receiver. Two other schemes documented by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are: the standards-track protocol NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM), documented in RFC 5740 and RFC 5401, and the protocol File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE), documented in RFC 6726. Open-source, in addition to proprietary, implementations exist for these. Other such protocols exist, such as Scalable Reliable Multicast, and are defined by a variety of sources. Such protocols vary in the means of error detection, the mechanisms used in error recovery, the scalability of such recovery and the underlying ideas involved in what it means to be reliable. A list of reliable multicast protocols from the ACM SIGCOMM Multicast Workshop, August 27, 1996, documents a number of approaches to the problem. Independent groups like the Internet Protocol Multicast Standards Initiative (IPMSI) have claimed that the lack of a truly scalable Secure Reliable IP Multicast protocol like the proposed Secure Multicast for Advanced Repeating of Television (SMART) have hampered the adoption of IP Multicast in inter-domain routing. The lack of a widely adopted system that has AES level security and scalable reliability have kept mass media transmissions of sporting events (like the Super Bowl) and/or breaking news events from being transmitted on the Public Internet. Reliable IP Multicasting protocols, such as PGM and SMART, are experimental; the only standards-track protocol is NORM (the standards-track revision of RFC 3941 is specified in RFC 5401, the standards-track revision of RFC 3940 is specified in RFC 5740). Multicast-based protocols Since multicast is a different transmission mode from unicast, only protocols designed for multicast can be sensibly used with multicast. Most of the existing application protocols that use multicast run on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). In many applications, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used for framing of multimedia content over multicast; the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) may be used for bandwidth reservation in a network supporting multicast distribution. Multicast DNS (mDNS) can be used to resolve domain or host names without a dedicated DNS server by using multicast. Deployment IP multicast is widely deployed in enterprises, commercial stock exchanges, and multimedia content delivery networks. A common enterprise use of IP multicast is for IPTV applications such as live television distribution and televised company meetings. In the hospitality industry IP multicast has become common for IPTV distribution in hotels, and in the retail sector IP multicast is now widely used for TV distribution and video advertising applications. Pay-TV operators and some educational institutions with significant on-campus student housing have deployed IP multicast to deliver one-way streaming media such as high- speed video to large groups of receivers. Additionally, there have been some uses of audio and video conferencing using multicast technologies. These are far less prevalent and are most often relegated to research and education institutions, which often have a greater degree of network capacity to handle the demands. Some technical conferences and meetings are transmitted using IP multicast. Until recently many of the sessions at the IETF meetings were delivered using multicast. Another use of multicast within campus and commercial networks is for file distribution, particularly to deliver operating system images and updates to remote hosts. The key advantage of multicast boot images over unicasting boot images is significantly lower network bandwidth usage. IP multicast has also seen deployment within the financial sector for applications such as stock tickers and hoot-n-holler systems., a IP hoot-n-holler provider. While IP multicast has seen some success in each of these areas, multicast services are generally not available to the average end-user. There are two major, related, factors for this lack of widespread deployment. First, forwarding multicast traffic imposes a great deal of protocol complexity on network service providers. Second, core network infrastructure exposes a far greater attack surface, with particular vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. The large state requirements in routers make applications using a large number of trees unable to work while using IP multicast. Take presence information as an example where each person needs to keep at least one tree of its subscribers, if not several. No mechanism has yet been demonstrated that would allow the IP multicast model to scale to millions of senders and millions of multicast groups and, thus, it is not yet possible to make fully general multicast applications practical. For these reasons, and also reasons of economics, IP multicast is not, in general, used in commercial Internet backbones. RFC 3170 (IP Multicast Applications: Challenges & Solutions) provides an overview of deployment issues. History =Development= IP multicasting was first developed by Steve Deering while at Stanford University for which he received the IEEE Internet Award.. The MBONE was a long-running experimental approach to enabling multicast between sites through the use of tunnels. While the MBONE is no longer operational, there is renewed interest in tunneling multicast traffic once again in order to make the service available to a wide array of end users. =CastGate= CastGate was an attempt from the ETRO-TELE research group at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to adopt IP multicast on the Internet. Presentation at NORDUNET Conference Although multicast would have allowed an Internet user to receive rich media and other content without placing a high burden on the net, it was still unavailable to most Internet users. The CastGate project tried to fix this by allowing end users to connect through an automatically configured IP tunnel over networks which did not natively support IP multicast. The idea was that if more users have multicast capability, more content providers would see the benefit of streaming content over multicast. The hope was if enough content providers and users used this service, then more Internet service providers would enable IP multicast natively to their customers. CastGate supplied a software client for both Microsoft Windows and Linux to connect to the CastGate tunnel network. It also supplied tools to add tunnel servers and tools to receive Session Announcement Protocol announcements from the multicast network with video and audio streams. The project maintained a web site through 2007. =Commercial deployment= Starting in 2005,. the BBC began encouraging UK-based Internet service providers to adopt multicast- addressable services in their networks by providing BBC Radio at higher quality. than is available via their unicast-addressed services. This has also been supported by a variety of commercial radio networks, including BBC, GCap Media, EMAP and Virgin Radio. The German public-service broadcasters ARD. and ZDF and the Franco-German network Arte offer their TV program multicasted on several networks. Austrian Internet service provider Telekom Austria offers its digital subscriber line (DSL) customers a TV set-top box that uses multicast addressing in receiving TV and radio broadcasts. In Germany, T-Home, a brand of Deutsche Telekom, offers a similar service.

Ethel also features in a 1988 EastEnders special episode, entitled \\"CivvyStreet\\", set on Albert Square during World War II, in which she is played by Alison Bettles. Ethel is an EastEnders original character and in the early years she can always be found wandering the neighbourhood with her adored pug Willy. She and Dot Cotton (June Brown) are lifelong friends, and although they wind each other up, they are completely dependent on each other. Ethel trusts Dot so much that she even asks her to help her die in 2000 after she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Storylines = Backstory = left Ethel Skinner is one of the original characters that appears in the first episode of EastEnders in 1985 and her early history is depicted in the 1986 authorised novel The Flower of Albert Square, which directly contradicts the later EastEnders flashback episode, \\"CivvyStreet\\". In the novel, Ethel grows up with her family in Beckton, which is bombed during the war, killing her parents and leading her to live with her uncle and aunt in Hackney. She later meets William (Ian Brimble) and moves to Albert Square after the war, after he proposes. However, in the television episode, Ethel is said to have lived in Albert Square for most of her life, remaining there through the war and witnessing the death of her entire family, who are killed by a doodlebug. This tragic event sends a young Ethel into shock and subsequently she develops eccentric behaviour. She begins dressing outrageously, wearing garish make-up, flirting with anyone in trousers, and knocking back gin, traits that lasts well into her old-age. In a 1986 episode of EastEnders, Ethel says she had an argument with her father during the war and left home, saying she would never return as long as he was there; she returned the next day and both her parents had been killed by a doodlebug. Ethel never recovers from William's death and names her pug dog after him, Willy. Ethel has surviving extended family, including her husband's nephew Eddie Skinner, who appeared at her funeral, staying in Walford for a few months afterwards. Eddie also has a daughter called Kerry Skinner. = 1985‚Äì1997 = Ethel had never had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her surrogate child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance to see if she can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened to stand up to the over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last. Ethel lives above Dr. Harold Legg's (Leonard Fenton) surgery and works as the cleaner in the pub. She is somewhat of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is always the first to point out the malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly. Ethel has several romances with senior bachelors on Albert Square. Her ex-boyfriend from the war years, Ernie Mears (Ken Wynne), returns to Albert Square in 1985 and proposes to her. However, the offer is conditional. Ernie is allergic to dogs and Willy, Ethel's constant companion for the past 9 years, would have to go. Ethel seriously considers Ernie's offer but gently declines. In 1988 she finds romance again with a friend of Dr. Legg's, Benny Bloom (Arnold Yarrow). Dot loathes Benny and does everything she can to talk Ethel out of dating him. Ethel and Benny discuss marriage, which Ethel agrees to, mainly to spite Dot, who calls her a silly fool for wanting to remarry at her time of life. However, after discovering pets aren't allowed in the manor where Benny lives, the engagement was called off, once again because of Willy. A few months later Ethel hears news that Benny has died and has left her ¬£2000, although his daughter, Margaret Stone (Valerie Bell) tries to contest the will for a while. In August 1989, Ethel meets a new love interest named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites her to go on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Dor√©) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'. In 1992, Ethel's adored pug Willy succumbs to old-age and she has to make the heart-breaking decision to put him down. Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently. She is seen occasionally however, usually when a big event is occurring or to celebrate Christmas and New Year with her old friends on the Square. After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing. = 2000 = A very frail Ethel returns to Albert Square in 2000, arriving unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel had run away from her retirement village and had decided that she was going to come back to the square, to live in the place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity. Ethel has been storing her morphine tablets for many weeks and it is her plan to take an overdose before the pain becomes too unbearable. However, before being able to execute her plan, she becomes too weak and is unable to administer the drugs without Dot's assistance. Dot is devastated and initially refuses to help Ethel, as to help another take their own life goes completely against her strict Christian principles. Dot spends many agonising weeks wrestling with her conscience, but she eventually agrees to grant her old friend's final wish. On the night of her 85th birthday (it was actually her 86th, but she'd always lied about her age), after a celebratory party at The Vic, Ethel decides that this was to be her last night. After blowing out the candles of her birthday cake and bidding Dot an emotional farewell, Ethel takes the pills, aided by Dot, and dies peacefully in her sleep. Creation and development Ethel Skinner was the second out of the original twenty- three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith (the first to be created was Lou Beale). Ethel was based on an elderly woman that Smith had encountered in a pub in Hackney. She had bright ginger hair, a face plied with make-up, she laughed a lot and was obviously \\"the life and soul of the party\\". She also had a little dog, Willie, who she dressed in a red ribbon, tied in a neat bow on its head. Smith felt that a character like this would be an excellent inclusion to the show. Ethel's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. :\\"Most of her money goes on food for her dog, Willie, a Yorkie, and booze for herself. She has a hopeless memory for actual facts but can tell endless stories about pre-war London, her childhood, and, above all, the war. She does miss the friendliness of the old East-end... She has false teeth and red hair: those are the two things you most notice about her - then the dog... Her greatest joy is telling fortunes, cards, tea-cups and palm-reading. \\"I've got the gift she says... Born in 1920, in Camden Town... left home, aged 16, to work for a posh Hackney family, as a general undermaid... Ethel came home one day to find her street destroyed by a doodlebug. Her parents had been in the house... Ethel met William, a docker, and they married when Ethel was 25... Ethel and William had no children... As a youngster, Ethel would have been a page three girl, a real pin-up.\\" (page 52) Gretchen Franklin was the first actress that Smith and Holland had in mind for the role. An experienced actress with a long career in show-business, Franklin was considered to be ideal casting, so she was offered the part. Ethel became a popular and well-loved character from very early on in the series. Ethel was a gossip who did not always get her facts right, and this was often used for comic effect, as was her use of malapropisms. She became famous for owning a pug named Willy. Ethel's famous lines being either, \\"Where's my Willy?\\" or, in a double entendre, \\"Has anyone seen my Willy\\". It was originally intended for Ethel's dog to be a Yorkshire Terrier, but as no suitable Yorkie could be found, a pug was used instead. Over the seven years they worked together Willy (the actor) and Franklin became very attached to each other.\\"Walford Gazette interview with Gretchen Franklin\\", Walford Gazette. URL last accessed on 24 October 2006. So much so that Franklin even tried to buy Willy at one stage, commenting: \\"I tried to buy him from the BBC but he's too valuable now, he earns a bomb in personal appearances.\\" Franklin was heart-broken in 1992 when the producers made the decision to retire Willy. On-screen Willy became ill and had to be put down. However just over two weeks after his last appearance on the programme the dog who played Willy died. Franklin has commented: \\"A woman stopped me in the street and said: 'It was like him committing suicide. When he knew he wasn't wanted on that programme no more, he just turned over and died.'\\"\\"Gretchen Franklin\\", Telegraph. URL last accessed on 24 October 2006. Ethel's friendship with Dot Cotton (June Brown) was another enduring relationship that lasted throughout the characters time in the show and today they are remembered fondly by fans as being an incomparable double-act.\\"Remembering EastEnders' Ethel\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 24 October 2006. Their arguing and obvious differences were often used for comic effect in many scenes. However, in episode 248 of the show the audience were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps second two-hander episode. The episode was aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies (although Dot was Ethel's junior by twenty years or so), and was scripted as a mini-play about nostalgia and growing old. Some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace. The episode gave Franklin and June Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show. The character of Ethel initially remained on the show for 12 years, although her appearances towards the end became more widely spaced and she only returned to the show intermittently. Off-screen Gretchen Franklin retired, however 3 years after her last brief appearance Ethel was reintroduced to the show for one final and highly controversial storyline. The storyline involved her old friend Dot helping her to commit suicide. When Ethel Skinner became ill in September 2000, she asked Dot to help her when the time finally came for her to pass away. Dot had to make a decision that went against her moral and religious beliefs. In the end Dot decided that friendship was more important and so she helped Ethel die peacefully. Written by Simon Ashdown and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a touching scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot \\"you're the best friend I ever had\\". The finishing touch was the use of an alternative end title music, replacing the dramatic drum beats with a war time orchestral piece. The ramifications of this storyline were immense for the character of Dot, and the consequences of her actions were examined in detail - which included a crisis of faith. Such was the controversy surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot as part of their new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton's character is guilty of murder.\\"Pro-Life Times: November 2000\\", Society for the Protection of Unborn Children.

Ethel's euthanasia is considered to be one of the most moving storylines ever featured in EastEnders and it was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of over 4,000 readers.\\"\\"Soap deaths poll\\", Manchester Showbiz.

Age  Ethel's original character outline states that she was born in 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel came back to Walford to die in 2000, she revealed to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years. She was actually 86, not 85 (the character was aged two years, in a dramatic technique known as SORAS making her birthday fall in 1914). Ethel died on what she claimed was the night of her 86th birthday in September 2000, and although Dot knew very well her birthday was in February, she organised a party at Ethel's request to give her one last 'birthday' before she died. 19 February is also the day that EastEnders was first broadcast. Reception Ethel's death was voted the fourth most emotional moment in television entertainment in a 2010 poll of 3,000 British people conducted by Freeview HD.

High values mean low temperatures. Confounded by ice volume - more ice means higher values. Ocean water is mostly H216O, with small amounts of HD16O and H218O. In Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) the ratio of D to H is and 18O/16O is . Fractionation occurs during changes between condensed and vapour phases: the vapour pressure of heavier isotopes is lower, so vapour contains relatively more of the lighter isotopes and when the vapour condenses the precipitation preferentially contains heavier isotopes. The difference from SMOW is expressed as :\\\\delta\\\\ce{^{18}O} = 1000 \\\\times \\\\left[\\\\ce{\\\\frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}}\\\\Bigg/\\\\left(\\\\ce{\\\\frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}}\\\\right)_\\\\ce{SMOW} - 1\\\\right]; and a similar formula for Œ¥D. values for precipitation are always negative. The major influence on is the difference between ocean temperatures where the moisture evaporated and the place where the final precipitation occurred; since ocean temperatures are relatively stable the value mostly reflects the temperature where precipitation occurs. Taking into account that the precipitation forms above the inversion layer, we are left with a linear relation: : \\\\delta\\\\ce{^{18}O} = aT + b which is empirically calibrated from measurements of temperature and as a = for Greenland and for East Antarctica. The calibration was initially done on the basis of spatial variations in temperature and it was assumed that this corresponded to temporal variations (Jouzel and Merlivat, 1984). More recently, borehole thermometry has shown that for glacial-interglacial variations, a = (Cuffey et al., 1995), implying that glacial-interglacial temperature changes were twice as large as previously believed. =Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca= Magnesium (Mg) is incorporated into the calcite shells (tests) of planktic and benthic foraminifera as a trace element. Because the incorporation of Mg as an impurity in calcite is endothermic, more is incorporated into the growing crystal at higher temperatures. Therefore, a high Mg/Ca ratio implies a high temperature, although ecological factors may confound the signal. Mg has a long residence time in the ocean, and so it is possible to largely ignore the effect of changes in seawater Mg/Ca on the signal. Strontium (Sr) incorporates in coral aragonite, and it is well established that the precise Sr/Ca ratio in the coral skeleton shows an inverse correlation with the seawater temperature during its biomineralization. =Alkenones= Distributions of organic molecules in marine sediments reflect temperature. =Leaf physiognomy= The characteristic leaf sizes, shapes and prevalence of features such as drip tips (‚Äòleaf or foliar physiognomy‚Äô) differs between tropical rainforests (many species with large leaves with smooth edges and drip tips) and temperate deciduous forests (smaller leaf size classes common, toothed edges common), and is often continuously variable between sites along climatic gradients, such as from hot to cold climates, or high to low precipitation.Bailey, I.W. & Sinnott, E.W. 1916. The climatic distribution of certain kinds of angiosperm leaves. American Journal of Botany 3, 24 - 39. This variation between sites along environmental gradients reflects adaptive compromises by the species present to balance the need to capture light energy, manage heat gain and loss, while maximising the efficiency of gas exchange, transpiration and photosynthesis. Quantitative analyses of modern vegetation leaf physiognomy and climate responses along environmental gradients have been largely univariate, but multivariate approaches integrate multiple leaf characters and climatic parameters. Temperature has been estimated (to varying degrees of fidelity) using leaf physiognomy for Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic leaf floras, principally using two main approaches:Greenwood, D.R. 2007.

Canonical Correlation Analysis is used combining 31 leaf characters, but leaf margin type represented a significant component of the relationship between physiognomic states and temperature. Using CLAMP, MAT is estimated with small standard errors (e.g. CCA ¬± 0.7‚Äì1.0 ¬∞C). Additional temperature parameters can be estimated using CLAMP, such as the coldest month mean temperature (CMMT) and the warmest month mean temperature (WMMT) which provide estimates for winter and summer mean conditions respectively. =Nearest living relative analogy / coexistence analysis= Certain plants prefer certain temperatures; if their pollen is found one can work out the approximate temperature. =13C-18O bonds in carbonates= There is a slight thermodynamic tendency for heavy isotopes to form bonds with each other, in excess of what would be expected from a stochastic or random distribution of the same concentration of isotopes. The excess is greatest at low temperature (see Van 't Hoff equation), with the isotopic distribution becoming more randomized at higher temperature. Along with the closely related phenomenon of equilibrium isotope fractionation, this effect arises from differences in zero point energy among isotopologues. Carbonate minerals like calcite contain CO32‚àí groups that can be converted to CO2 gas by reaction with concentrated phosphoric acid. The CO2 gas is analyzed with a mass spectrometer, to determine the abundances of isotopologues. The parameter Œî47 is the measured difference in concentration between isotopologues with a mass of 47 u (as compared to 44) in a sample and a hypothetical sample with the same bulk isotopic composition, but a stochastic distribution of heavy isotopes. Lab experiments, quantum mechanical calculations, and natural samples (with known crystallization temperatures) all indicate that Œî47 is correlated to the inverse square of temperature. Thus Œî47 measurements provide an estimation of the temperature at which a carbonate formed. 13C-18O paleothermometry does not require prior knowledge of the concentration of 18O in the water (which the Œ¥18O method does). This allows the 13C-18O paleothermometer to be applied to some samples, including freshwater carbonates and very old rocks, with less ambiguity than other isotope-based methods. The method is presently limited by the very low concentration of isotopologues of mass 47 or higher in CO2 produced from natural carbonates, and by the scarcity of instruments with appropriate detector arrays and sensitivities. The study of these types of isotopic ordering reactions in nature is often called \\"clumped-isotope\\" geochemistry.

Early years Dragon was born in Antioch, California, the son of Rose and Frank Dragon, who were Italian immigrants.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XCX5-G6Ghttp://alumni.umassband.com/america- the-beautiful-the-story-behind-the-band-classic/ He attended Antioch High School and, while a student there, composed a song for the school. Forward, Antioch! was performed between acts of a school play on February 28, 1930. (A newspaper article erroneously identified the composer as \\"a high school girl, Carmen Dragon.\\") Film He was very active in pop music conducting and composed scores for several films, including At Gunpoint (1955), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Night into Morning (1951), and Kiss Tomorrow Good- bye (1950). With Morris Stoloff, he shared the 1944 Oscar for the popular Gene Kelly/Rita Hayworth musical Cover Girl, which featured songs by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. He made a popular orchestral arrangement of \\"America the Beautiful\\" and also re-arranged it for symphonic band. In his obituary published March 29, 1984, the New York Times noted: \\"In 1964 he won an Emmy for producing the Glendale Symphony Orchestra Christmas Special on NBC.\\" Dragon appeared as himself in the 1979 film The In-Laws as the conductor of the fictitious Paramus Philharmonic Orchestra. Radio Dragon conducted the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra, and they performed on The Standard School Broadcast, broadcast on NBC radio in the western U.S. for elementary schools from 1928 through the 1970s.The Standard School Broadcast website The show was sponsored by the Standard Oil Company of California (now the Chevron Corporation), but other than the name there were no commercials. The program featured a high quality introduction to classical music for young people growing up in the 1940s and early 1950s. In the summer of 1947, Dragon and Frances Langford had a program on NBC. Langford sang, accompanied by Dragon and his 25-piece orchestra. The show began June 5 and ran for 13 weeks as a summer replacement for George Burns and Gracie Allen's program. Dragon also hosted a regular classical music radio show broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network well into the 1980s. Dragon's concert band arrangement of America the Beautiful is played by bands across the country in concerts of patriotic music. Personal appearances By May 1935, Dragon had his own orchestra. A Santa Cruz, California, newspaper reported about the San Jose State freshman dance, \\"The dancers will travel over the world with the orchestra of Carmen Dragon furnishing the appropriate music of each locality.\\" A couple of months later, a Fresno, California, newspaper contained an advertisement promoting \\"Carmen Dragon, Ace Stanford Band, The Sensation of the Coast.\\" Recording Dragon made a series of popular light classical albums for Capitol Records during the 1950s with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Some of these recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Recognition Dragon has a star in the Radio section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Located at 6104 Hollywood Boulevard, it was dedicated September 7, 1989. An elementary school is named after the composer in Antioch, California.

The unit's main responsibility is to both investigate and take steps to prevent fraud, along with a wide range of other fraudulent crimes which require specialist knowledge and training to investigate. The unit was previously known as the Fraud Squad, or by its previous Specialist Operations designation, SO6. History Formed in 1946, the unit was originally known as Metropolitan and City Police Fraud Department or \\"C6 Branch\\". It was the first integrated cross-border, co-operative unit set up jointly between London's two police services; the City of London Police due to their expertise in business and stock market fraud, and the Metropolitan Police with their investigative experience. The increasing complexity of business fraud as time progressed, and hence the lessened chances of securing a successful prosecution, saw the implementation of the Serious Fraud Office in 1987. Due to the Serious Fraud Office making C6 obsolete, the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police reverted to having their own Fraud Squads. The MPS' was then called SO6. Staffed by about 140 detectives, specialised teams within the Squad included the Commercial Crimes Intelligence Bureau, a Financial Investigations Unit, the Fraud Prevention Office, a Surveillance Unit, a Crime Management Unit and a fledgling Computer Crime Unit. In October 2000, the Fraud Squad was renamed Economic and Specialist Crime as part of the Specialist Crime Directorate, and its remit was expanded substantially to cover a wider range of financial and economic crime and fraud. Several other autonomous units, such as the Arts and Antiquities Squad, were merged with the new unit. The Proactive Money Laundering Investigation Team, formed in 2003, has a remit to deal with high- level money laundering, and also are active in removing substantial amounts of criminal cash from the organised criminal networks working in and around London.

The cartridges drip into the chamber below, where tubes collect the effluent. A vacuum port with gauge is used to control the vacuum applied to the chamber. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is an extractive technique by which compounds that are dissolved or suspended in a liquid mixture are separated from other compounds in the mixture according to their physical and chemical properties. Analytical laboratories use solid phase extraction to concentrate and purify samples for analysis. Solid phase extraction can be used to isolate analytes of interest from a wide variety of matrices, including urine, blood, water, beverages, soil, and animal tissue. SPE uses the affinity of solutes dissolved or suspended in a liquid (known as the mobile phase) for a solid through which the sample is passed (known as the stationary phase) to separate a mixture into desired and undesired components. The result is that either the desired analytes of interest or undesired impurities in the sample are retained on the stationary phase. The portion that passes through the stationary phase is collected or discarded, depending on whether it contains the desired analytes or undesired impurities. If the portion retained on the stationary phase includes the desired analytes, they can then be removed from the stationary phase for collection in an additional step, in which the stationary phase is rinsed with an appropriate eluent. Many of the adsorbents/materials are the same as in chromatographic methods, but SPE is distinctive, with aims separate from chromatography, and so has a unique niche in modern chemical science. SPE and chromatography SPE is a method of chromatography, except in the broadest, simplest sense. It is an extractive technique, a solid-liquid extractive technique‚Äîtaking advantage of large differences in the Keq, or equilibrium constant, of mixture components between the solid phase and the mobile phase resulting, for a well-designed and executed separation, in a bulk separation of one or more of the mixture components so that it is significantly enriched as a result of the rapid extractive procedure. Granted many of the adsorbents/materials are the same as in chromatographic methods, and when these materials are packed into long columns‚Äîsuch that the number of theoretical plates increases by orders of magnitude as a result‚Äîthe same materials result in chromatographic separations of components with even small difference is their Keq between phases. Even so, grey line that it might be that divides SPE and chrom, the distinctives are clear enough to say that SPE is an extractive technique, with theory, procedures, and aims separate from chromatography, and so with a unique niche in modern chemical science. Normal phase SPE procedure A selection of solid phase extraction cartridges, available in many sizes, shapes, and types of stationary phase. A typical solid phase extraction involves five basic steps. First, the cartridge is equilibrated with a non-polar or slightly polar solvent, which wets the surface and penetrates the bonded phase. Then water, or buffer of the same composition as the sample, is typically washed through the column to wet the silica surface. The sample is then added to the cartridge. As the sample passes through the stationary phase, the polar analytes in the sample will interact and retain on the polar sorbent while the solvent, and other non- polar impurities pass through the cartridge. After the sample is loaded, the cartridge is washed with a non-polar solvent to remove further impurities. Then, the analyte is eluted with a polar solvent or a buffer of the appropriate pH. A stationary phase of polar functionally bonded silicas with short carbons chains frequently makes up the solid phase. This stationary phase will adsorb polar molecules which can be collected with a more polar solvent. Reversed phase SPE Reversed phase SPE separates analytes based on their polarity. The stationary phase of a reversed phase SPE cartridge is derivatized with hydrocarbon chains, which retain compounds of mid to low polarity due to the hydrophobic effect. The analyte can be eluted by washing the cartridge with a non-polar solvent, which disrupts the interaction of the analyte and the stationary phase. A stationary phase of silicon with carbon chains is commonly used. Relying on mainly non-polar, hydrophobic interactions, only non-polar or very weakly polar compounds will adsorb to the surface. Ion exchange SPE Ion exchange sorbents separate analytes based on electrostatic interactions between the analyte of interest and the positively or negatively charged groups on the stationary phase. For ion exchange to occur, both the stationary phase and sample must be at a pH where both are charged. =Anion exchange= Anion exchange sorbents are derivatized with positively charged functional groups that interact and retain negatively charged anions, such as acids. Strong anion exchange sorbents contain quaternary ammonium groups that have a permanent positive charge in aqueous solutions, and weak anion exchange sorbents use amine groups which are charged when the pH is below about 9. Strong anion exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly acidic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest; to recover a strong acid a weak anion exchange cartridge should be used. To elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent, the stationary phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes the charge of either the analyte, the stationary phase, or both. Once the charge is neutralized, the electrostatic interaction between the analyte and the stationary phase no longer exists and the analyte will elute from the cartridge. =Cation exchange= Cation exchange sorbents are derivatized with functional groups that interact and retain positively charged cations, such as bases. Strong cation exchange sorbents contain aliphatic sulfonic acid groups that are always negatively charged in aqueous solution, and weak cation exchange sorbents contain aliphatic carboxylic acids, which are charged when the pH is above about 5. Strong cation exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly basic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest; to recover a strong base a weak cation exchange cartridge should be used. To elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent, the stationary phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes ionic interaction between the analyte and the stationary phase. Cartridges The stationary phase comes in the form of a packed syringe- shaped cartridge, a 96 well plate, a 47- or 90-mm flat disk, or a microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) device, a SPE method that uses a packed sorbent material in a liquid handling syringe.M. Abdel-Rehim, AstraZeneca Application ‚ÄúSyringe for solid phase microextraction‚Äù, Current Patents Gazette, week 0310, WO 03019149, p. 77, (2003). These can be mounted on its specific type of extraction manifold. The manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several SPE media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously. In a standard cartridge SPE manifold up to 24 cartridges can be mounted in parallel, while a typical disk SPE manifold can accommodate 6 disks. Most SPE manifolds are equipped with a vacuum port, where vacuum can be applied to speed up the extraction process by pulling the liquid sample through the stationary phase. The analytes are collected in sample tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary phase. Solid phase extraction cartridges and disks are available with a variety of stationary phases, each of which can separate analytes according to different chemical properties. Most stationary phases are based on silica that has been bonded to a specific functional group. Some of these functional groups include hydrocarbon chains of variable length (for reversed phase SPE), quaternary ammonium or amino groups (for anion exchange), and sulfonic acid or carboxyl groups (for cation exchange). Solid-phase microextraction Solid-phase microextraction (SPME), is a solid phase extraction technique that involves the use of a fiber coated with an extracting phase, that can be a liquid (polymer) or a solid (sorbent), which extracts different kinds of analytes (including both volatile and non- volatile) from different kinds of media, that can be in liquid or gas phase. The quantity of analyte extracted by the fibre is proportional to its concentration in the sample as long as equilibrium is reached or, in case of short time pre-equilibrium, with help of convection or agitation.

Portrayed by Vicky Entwistle, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 January 1997. On 2 August 2010, it was announced that Entwistle had quit her role as Janice after 14 years on the show and would depart in 2011. She made her final appearance on 25 March 2011 after she leaves Weatherfield with her new boyfriend Trevor Dean (Steve Jackson) to go travelling around the world. Storylines Janice first appears in January 1997 as a new machinist at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) garment factory \\"Underworld\\". In July 1997 she returns along with husband Les (Bruce Jones), daughter Toyah (Georgia Taylor) and stepdaughter Leanne (Jane Danson). She is consistently rude to her various managers at the factory. She breaks up with Les after having an affair with Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale) late in 2001, who is seeing Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) at the time. Les is so upset that he attempts suicide on New Year's Day, and while driving him to hospital, they collide with another car. Les survives with minor injuries but Dennis is badly injured and later dies in hospital. Janice is left devastated by Dennis's death. In March 2004, Janice sneaks into the storeroom at the factory for a crafty cigarette but drops the cigarette when caretaker Harry Flagg (Iain Rogerson) locks her in, a fire starts. Just before the whole room burns down, factory manager Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt) comes to her rescue - and as a result of the fire, she ends up in hospital and Nick is sacked by Mike. Janice later becomes involves with police officer, Mick Hopwood. When Mick and Les get into a fight, Les is unfairly imprisoned and Janice splits up with Mick. A later attempt at reconciliation with Les fails as a result of interference from Cilla Brown (Wendi Peters). In the summer of 2005, Janice discovers, to her horror, that she has nits. Drunkenly, she asks friend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) to shave her head. When she sees her bald head in the mirror, she is appalled. A couple of weeks later, she has a mud fight with resident Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) on the Red Rec after Claire calls her a \\"pug faced scumbag\\". In early 2006, Janice and Leanne are involved in a car accident, when Danny (Bradley Walsh) does not ask Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to perform a full service on the car. They crash into Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) front wall. Since then, Janice and Sally Webster become rivals as Janice feels that Sally and her daughter, Rosie, look down their noses at her. The rivalry comes to a head on 27 February 2006, when Janice is sacked by Danny Baldwin, and shortly after, she is punched by nemesis Sally, in the middle of the Rovers Return Inn. She leaves the Street in shame. However, it was reported in December 2005,Digital Spy that despite original plans for her to be written out of the series, Vicky Entwistle's contract was renewed. She goes to stay with Toyah in London in March 2006, but returns by April, telling Leanne that life in London was not any better than life in Weatherfield. She then helps Leanne as she discovers Mike's original will, that Leanne's boyfriend Danny does not know about. In January 2007, Janice's heating breaks down and she calls plumber Roger Stiles (Andrew Dunn) to fix it, who arrives late. After socialising a bit, Roger asks Janice to go with him to France for a few months, which she accepts. She returns in March and Roger returns in June. She subsequently finds out that her stepdaughter Leanne is a prostitute; after everyone finds out, Janice gets into a catfight with co-worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). Janice pleads with her to give up her work, but Leanne initially refuses as it is too lucrative. Eventually she admits that she can not continue and moves in with Janice. Janice and Roger reconcile, and Roger gives Leanne a loan for the restaurant she plans to open but his lack of money means he struggles to pay his rent, so he moves in with Janice. Leanne's restaurant burns down in April 2008. A few weeks later, Paul tells the police he and Leanne set the place on fire for insurance money. Janice is furious with Leanne for lying to her. In September 2008, Janice and Leanne discover that one of the Lottery syndicate tickets for Underworld is a winner, to the tune of almost ¬£25,000. Spotting an opportunity, Leanne persuades Janice that they should keep the money and claim the winnings by setting up a bogus bank account in Rosie Webster's (Helen Flanagan) name. However, Rosie has vanished, worrying her parents and when they learn of the lottery win, the police stop looking for Rosie, believing that she has absconded with the cash. Unable to live with her guilty conscience, Janice eventually comes clean on 8 October 2008 and is arrested while at work in the factory. The factory girls also tell Roger about the scam and he leaves Janice, disgusted at her behaviour. Janice is left on the Street in tears as Roger drives away. Leanne sees her from her upstairs window and callously just shuts the blind. In November, Janice stands trial for the scam alone, having agreed to keep Leanne's name out of it and is sentenced to community service, much to the disgust of her colleagues. She starts her work placement at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital in December and is initially delighted to discover that her supervisor is Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), whom she sees as a pushover. However, she is proven wrong as Emily is very strict. On 29 December, she goes for a cigarette outside the hospital and meets Mike Scott (Anthony Bessick). He tells her he is in for a chest infection, downgraded from pneumonia. She tells him about her community service, and they laugh over their shared misfortune. Janice then goes back to work, but that night her friends tell her that she has been beaming the whole time she has been out with them, which suggests that she still has Mike on her mind. Mike reappears on 30 January 2009, when he and Janice chat. However, he keels over and collapses. Janice gets help for Mike but later discovers that he has died, following an operation one week before. Mike's wife, Laura, is grateful that Janice was with him when he died. After this, Janice decides that she wants to become a nurse, despite ridicule from her friends, but her new boss, Luke Strong (Craig Kelly), sends her on a first-aid course in March 2009 and makes her the factory first-aider. Janice's skills come in useful when Joshua Peacock (Benjamin Beresford) collapses after swallowing a bee at the Street's summer fete. He is later rushed to hospital and recovers. Janice later tells Kelly that she does not want to be a nurse any more from the horror that Joshua could have died. In January 2010, Trevor Dean, a local dustman, provokes Janice by refusing to empty her rubbish bin. In protest, she jumps onto the side of his bin lorry and holds on as he drives down the street. Later, the pair become friends, and after telling Trevor she is looking for a lodger, he agrees to move in with her. Janice is very attracted to him but he starts dating her boss, Carla Connor (Alison King). Janice is disappointed when Trevor later leaves Weatherfield after breaking up with Carla. On 6 December 2010, a tram crashes onto the cobbles, following an explosion at 'The Joinery' Bar. Janice puts her first aid training to use, helping the injured in the Rovers. She also witnesses stepdaughter Leanne's wedding to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), which takes place in hospital as he was injured in the disaster. In January 2011, Janice meets a man called Gaz at a singles night in the Rovers who invites her to go on holiday with him. However, she is too drunk to board the flight and returns later that evening. At this time, Chris Gray (Will Thorp) has paid an associate to rob Janice's flat, hoping to cause trouble for Streetcars; he is disturbed by her entry and runs off but knocks Janice to the ground and is left shaken. In the weeks following the burglary, Janice becomes very nervous of living alone and eventually gives up her flat, moving in with workmate Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). In March 2011, with Underworld struggling to remain afloat, Janice says the wrong thing once too often, when she tries to convince her co-workers to go on strike, and Carla sacks her. Janice is pleasantly surprised when she bumps into Trevor again. He tells her that he is only staying briefly as he is leaving to go on a world trip and suggests Janice go with him, a few days later. Now unemployed and with Leanne happily married to Peter, she agrees. After saying goodbye to Leanne, Janice's co-worker Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston) spots her and tells the locals so they go outside to wave her off. Janice spots them coming out of the Rovers, so they drive into a puddle soaking all her friends and she shouts \\"Losers\\" as she drives off into the distance with Trevor. In July 2011, Leanne received a phonecall from Janice to wish her happy birthday and tell her that she is currently working at a hotel in France. On this day, Leanne finds out that newcomer Stella Price (Michelle Collins) is her birth mother but decides not to tell Janice because she has been more of a mother to her than Stella ever was. In an episode on 22 January 2014, Janice was mentioned by Leanne the episode after Hayley Cropper's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) death. Leanne mentioned her when asking \\"Should I ring Janice, to tell her about Hayley?\\". She was also mentioned by Leanne Battersby that she had sprained her ankle by falling off a ladder. Creation =Background= The mid 1990s were a time of big change behind-the-scenes at Coronation Street. The long-running serial was being regularly beaten in the ratings by rival soap EastEnders. A new producer, Brian Park, was brought in to revitalise the soap in 1997. Dubbed \\"the axeman\\", Park was responsible for culling 8 long-running and established characters, as well as giving the go- ahead for more controversial and sensationalist storylines, aimed at attracting a younger audience. He also introduced various new characters, among them were the Battersby family. Dubbed the \\"family from hell\\", the Battersbys were Janice and her husband Les, living with him and his daughter Leanne and a daughter of her own, Toyah, who was the result of a short-lived relationship Janice had with Ronnie Clegg (Dean Wiliamson) when she was 16. Although not above occasional law-breaking, Janice was nowhere near as anti- social as Les. =Casting= Auditions were held for the part of Janice Battersby with actress Vicky Entwistle going on to secure the role. In 2005 after 8 years in the show the character of Janice was axed by producer Tony Wood along with characters Sunita Alahan and Jessie Jackson. However a few weeks after the axing, a last-minute decision was made and the character was given a reprieve by the newly drafted producer Steve Frost. Of this decision the soaps spokesperson said: \\"The new producer has talked to Vicky Entwistle and asked if she would like to stay with the programme. Janice is a very popular character, but ultimately it was the producer's own decision to keep her on, prompted by the great new storylines the character can play out.\\" Development Janice is a very larger than life character and is not afraid of confrontation with other people. ITV publicity describes the character along with her former husband as 'Weatherfield's answer to Wayne and Waynetta Slob' but did stress that her character has shown her softer side in certain storylines such as Toyah's rape and proved she actually does have morals when she tried to stop Leanne's prostititution. Her manager at Underworld from 2004 to 2006, Danny Baldwin, had his own nickname for her: \\"Lippy\\" because of her loud mouth and answering back. An inside spokesperson for Coronation Street said of Janice's character in 2005 that: \\"She is well loved for being such a feisty character who can get quite nasty at times.\\". In other media Janice's recognisable appearance and loud mouth tendencies led to her being spoofed on ITV TV show 2DTV.

Schools Nearby schools include Falcon College, a renowned secondary school for boys and Mzingwane High School, recently a well-performing government school. Also nearby, is the Roman Catholic mission school known as Sacred Heart Girls School, a boarding secondary school. This school was founded in 2014 and is run by the Sisters Of The Precious Blood who fall under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bulawayo, and came mainly from Germany shortly after the second World War.

Founded in 1979, it is the resident theatre company at the SBW Stables Theatre in Kings Cross. The current Artistic Director is Declan Green, who took up the position in 2020 from Lee Lewis. Previous Artistic Directors include Sam Strong (2010‚Äì2013), Nick Marchand (2006‚Äì2010), David Berthold (2003‚Äì06), Ros Horin (1992‚Äì2003), Ian Watson and the original Artistic Director, Peter Kingston. History Founded in 1979 its original founders were Peter Carmody, Penny Cook, Eadie Kurzer, Jenny Laing-Peach, and Rosemarie Lenzo. The organization held their first meetings in Laing-Peach‚Äôs cottage in Griffin Street, Surry Hills. Their first project was to present the Irish play The Ginger Man by J.P. Donleavy at the Kirk Gallery in Cleveland Street, Surry Hills on 6 April, 1979. The first Artistic Director was Peter Kingston who served until the appointment of Ian B Watson in 1988. For the 1984 season the Company was awarded The Sydney Critic's Circle Award for \\"the most significant contribution to theatre that year.\\"The Currency Press Current Theatre Series publication for 'Morning Sacrifice' by Dymphna Cusack (1986 Currency Press Pty Ltd) In 1986 The SBW Foundation Purchased the Stables Theatre and offered the company a lifetime rent-free lease. The theatre focuses on \\"all-Australia\\" talent and works. Cate Blanchett and Jacqueline McKenzie began their professional careers at Griffin. The films Lantana, The Boys, and The Heartbreak Kid (which later spun off into the television series Heartbreak High) were based on plays produced by Griffin.

He is the goalkeeping coach at Hebei China Fortune and the Wales national team. Early life As a child, Roberts attended Ysgol Thomas Elis and Holyhead County School. Career =Early career= Roberts first became involved in football with Bodedern before joining Holyhead United Juniors at the age of twelve. After impressing one of the club's scouts, he was offered a trial with Chelsea but was forced to cancel after picking up an injury. Instead he was recommended to Queens Park Rangers by Brian Law at the age of sixteen. =Queens Park Rangers= He progressed through the ranks at Loftus Road, making his debut against Coventry City in December 1987. He served as understudy to David Seaman during his early years with the club before taking over as the club's first choice goalkeeper after a number of years competing with Jan Stejskal, following the departure of Seaman in 1990. A broken finger sustained in a match against Ipswich Town in January 1998 saw Roberts fall out of favour with the club, resulting in a move to Millwall at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. In 2003, he was given a testimonial match by QPR. =Retirement and return= Roberts played just eight times at The New Den when he suffered a recurrence of his finger injury which forced him to end his League career. He spent seven months away from football, returning in 1999 with non-League side St Albans City, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Slough Town. He later moved to the United States with the Atlanta Silverbacks, where he spent three months before returning to England. While playing in America, Roberts began wearing a splint inside his glove to solve his finger injury problem. =Dagenham & Redbridge= In 2000, Roberts joined Dagenham & Redbridge, managed by his former St Albans boss Garry Hill. Whilst playing for the club, Roberts became only the second goalkeeper ever to score a goal in an FA Cup tie when he scored against Basingstoke Town in a fourth qualifying round tie in October 2001. Remaining the club's first choice goalkeeper since his arrival, Roberts broke the appearance record at the club and was handed a testimonial match against West Ham United in 2007. Roberts also holds the record for the only goalkeeper ever to be sent off in the FA Cup in the opposing area when he was red carded after a clash with Peter Clarke during a 5‚Äì2 defeat to Southend United in the third round of the FA Cup on 5 January 2008. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, Roberts was part of the side that achieved promotion to The Football League after finishing as champions of the Conference National, having missed out on two previous occasions, on goal difference to Boston United in the 2001‚Äì02 season before losing the Conference play-off final to Doncaster Rovers the following year. To return to The Football League, Roberts was forced to repay part of his ¬£150,000 compensation package originally given to him on his retirement from professional football in 1998. Helping the club avoid relegation before reaching eighth position the following year, he made his 400th appearance for the club against Accrington Stanley on 21 February 2009 and signed a new one-year contract at the end of the season. He took up the option of a further one-year contract with Dagenham in June 2011. Roberts announced his second retirement before a pre-season friendly before West Ham United, on 26 July 2011. It came after Roberts made over 400 appearances for the Daggers between the years of 2000 and 2011 scoring one goal against Basingstoke Town in the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup in 2001, he still remains the one of three goalkeeper to have scored in the FA Cup being the second to Alan Cooling of Hampton in 1977, also he is the only goalkeeper to be sent off in the opposing box also in the FA Cup, this was against Southend United in 2008 after a foul on Peter Clarke. International career Roberts had previously been capped at under-18 level for Wales before earning his first cap for the under-21 side on 5 December 1990 in a 0‚Äì0 draw with England. His performance in the match earned him his first call-up to the senior side one month later. During his career, he won two full international caps as a substitute in matches against Republic of Ireland on 17 February 1993 and San Marino on 31 August 1996, as well as being selected 30 times as backup goalkeeper to Neville Southall. He also became the first Welshman to be capped at both full and semi-professional level as he helped his country win the non-league 'Home International' series twice. Honours ;Dagenham & Redbridge *Conference National Winner: 1 ::2006‚Äì07 *Football League Two Play- Off Final Winner: 1 ::2009‚Äì10 Non-playing roles Roberts combined goalkeeper duties at Dagenham & Redbridge with a coaching role at Queens Park Rangers, and then at Arsenal, whom he joined as assistant goalkeeping coach in 2008‚Äì09. He moved to Swansea City as first-team goalkeeping coach in June 2015. In August 2016, he became goalkeeping coach for the Wales national team, where he worked under Chris Coleman. He combined the role with his Swansea job. In June 2018, he left Swansea to join Coleman at Hebei China Fortune.

This protects the pipe from freezing. Electric heat tracing, heat tape or surface heating, is a system used to maintain or raise the temperature of pipes and vessels using heat tracing cables. Trace heating takes the form of an electrical heating element run in physical contact along the length of a pipe. The pipe is usually covered with thermal insulation to retain heat losses from the pipe. Heat generated by the element then maintains the temperature of the pipe. Trace heating may be used to protect pipes from freezing, to maintain a constant flow temperature in hot water systems, or to maintain process temperatures for piping that must transport substances that solidify at ambient temperatures. Electric trace heating cables are an alternative to steam trace heating where steam is unavailable or unwanted.Paul R. Smith, ed. Facilities engineering and management handbook : commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings,McGraw Hill,2001 chapter 5 pages 5-198 through 5-201 Development Electric trace heating began in the 1930s but initially no dedicated equipment was available. Mineral insulated cables ran at high current densities to produce heat, and control equipment was adapted from other applications.James Bilbro et al, Electric trace heating -state of the art, Paper 69 TP 20-IGA,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY AND GENERAL APPLICATIONS, JULY/AUGUST 1969 pages 476-480 Mineral-insulated resistance heating cable was introduced in the 1950s, and parallel-type heating cables that could be cut to length in the field became available. Self-limiting thermoplastic cables were marketed in 1971.Ted Hammack and Stephen Kucklinca, Self-Limiting Electrical Heat Tracing:New Solution to Old Problems , IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications March/April 1977 Control systems for trace heating systems developed from capillary filled-bulb thermostats and contactors in the 1970s to networked computerized controls in the 1990s, in large systems that require centralized control and monitoring. One paper projected that between 2000 and 2010 trace heating would account for 100 megawatts of connected load, and that trace heating and insulation would account for up to CAD $700 million capital investment in the Alberta oil sands.Derek Brooks et al., Reducing the total Cost of Ownership of Electric Heat Tracing Systems in Northern Alberta International standards applied in the design and installation of electric trace heating systems include IEEE standards 515 and 622, British standard BS 6351, and IEC standard 60208.Chet Sandberg et al, Electrical Heat Tracing:International Harmonization Now and in the Future, IEEE Industry Standards Magazine, May/June 2002 pages 50-56 Uses The most common pipe trace heating applications include: * Freeze protection * Temperature maintenance * Snow Melting On Driveways Other uses of trace heating cables include: * Ramp and stair snow / ice protection * Gulley and roof snow / ice protection * Underfloor heating * Door / frame interface ice protection * Window de-misting * Anti-condensation * Pond freeze protection * Soil warming * Preventing cavitation * Reducing Condensation On Windows =Freeze protection= Every pipe or vessel is subject to heat loss when its temperature is greater than ambient temperature. Thermal insulation reduces the rate of heat loss but does not eliminate it. Trace heating maintains the temperature above freezing by balancing heat lost with heat supplied. Normally, a thermostat is used to energise when it measures temperature falling below a set temperature value - usually between 3 ¬∞C and 5 ¬∞C and often referred to as the 'setpoint'. The thermostat will de-energise the trace heating when it measures temperature rising past another set temperature value - usually 2 ¬∞C higher than the setpoint value. =Gutter and roof de-icing= Placement of heat trace cable on roofs or in gutters to melt ice during winter months. When used in gutters the cable is not meant to keep the gutters free of ice or snow, but only to provide a free path for the melted water to get off the roof and down the downspout or drain piping. =Temperature maintenance= Hot water service piping can also be traced, so that a circulating system is not needed to provide hot water at outlets. The combination of trace heating and the correct thermal insulation for the operating ambient temperature maintains a thermal balance where the heat output from the trace heating matches the heat loss from the pipe. Self- limiting or regulating heating tapes have been developed and are very successful in this application. A similar principle can be applied to process piping carrying fluids which may congeal at low temperatures, for example, tars or molten sulfur. Hit-temperature trace heating elements can prevent blockage of pipes. Industrial applications for trace heating range from chemical industry, oil refineries, nuclear power plants, food factories. For example, wax is a material which starts to solidify below 70 ¬∞C which is usually far above the temperature of the surrounding air. Therefore, the pipeline must be provided with an external source of heat to prevent the pipe and the material inside it from cooling down. Trace heating can also be done with steam, but this requires a source of steam and may be inconvenient to install and operate. In laboratories, researchers working in the field of materials science use trace heating to heat a sample isotropically. They may use trace heating in conjunction with a variac, so as to control the heat energy delivered. This is an effective means of slowly heating an object to measure thermodynamic properties such as thermal expansion. =Anti-cavitation purpose= As heating a thick fluid decreases its viscosity, it reduces losses occurring in a pipe. Therefore, the net positive suction head (pressure difference) available can be raised, decreasing the likelihood of cavitation when pumping. However, care must be taken not to increase the vapour pressure of the fluid too much, as this would have a strong side effect on the available head, possibly outweighing any benefit.  Types  = Constant electric power \\"series\\" = A series heating cable is made of a run of high- resistance wire, insulated and often enclosed in a protective jacket. It is powered at a specific voltage and the resistance heat of the wire creates heat. The downside of these types of heaters is that if they are crossed over themselves they can overheat and burn out, they are provided in specific lengths and cannot be shortened in the field, also, a break anywhere along the line will result in a failure of the entire cable. The upside is that they are typically inexpensive (if plastic style heaters) or, as is true with mineral insulated heating cables, they can be exposed to very high temperatures. Mineral insulated heating cables are good for maintaining high temperatures on process lines or maintaining lower temperatures on lines which can get extremely hot such as high temperature steam lines.right Typically series elements are used on long pipe line process heating, for example long oil pipe lines and quay side of load pipes on oil refineries. = Constant wattage = A constant wattage cable is composed of multiple constant electric power zones and is made by wrapping a fine heating element around two insulated parallel bus wires, then on alternating sides of the conductors a notch is made in the insulation. The heating element is then normally soldered to the exposed conductor wire which creates a small heating circuit; this is then repeated along the length of the cable. There is then an inner jacket which separates the bus wires from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this system over series elements is that should one small element fail then the rest of the system will continue to operate, on the other hand damaged sections of cable (usually 3 ft span) will stay cold and possibly lead to freeze ups un said section. Also, this cable can be cut-to-length in-field due to its parallel circuitry, however, due to the circuit only running to the last zone on the cable, when installing on site you normally have to install slightly beyond the end of the pipe work. When installing constant wattage, or any heat tracing cable, it is important to not overlap or touch the cable to itself as it will be subject to overheating and burnout. Constant wattage cable is always installed with a thermostat to control the power output of the cable, making it a very reliable heating source. The disadvantage of this cable is that most constant wattage cables do not have soldered connections to the bus wires but press on type contact and are therefore more prone to have cold circuits due to loose connections caused by cable manipulation and installation. =Self regulating= Self-regulating heat tracing tapes are cable whose resistance varies with temperature - low resistance for temperatures below the cable set point and high resistance for temperatures above the cable set point. When the cable temperature reaches the set point the resistance reaches a high point and resulting in no more heat being supplied. These cables use two parallel bus wires which carry electricity but do not create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow so the cable is inherently power saving and only delivering heat and power where and when required by the system. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. The benefits of this cable are the ability to cut to length in the field. It is more rugged, and much more reliable than a constant wattage cable; it cannot over-heat itself so it can be crossed over, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating and constant wattage heating cables have specific maximum exposure temperature, which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to higher inrush currents on cold starting up similar to an induction motor, so a higher rated contactor is required.  Power supply and control  Trace heat cables may be connected to single-phase or (in groups) to three-phase power supplies. Power is controlled either by a contactor or a solid-state controller. For self-regulating cable, the supply must furnish a large warm-up current if the system is switched on from a cold starting condition. The contactor or controller may include a thermostat if accurate temperature maintenance is required, or may just shut off a freeze-protection system in mild weather. Electrical heat tracing systems may be required to have earth leakage (ground fault or RCD) devices for personnel and equipment protection. The system design must minimize leakage current to prevent nuisance tripping; this may limit the length of any individual heating circuit. Control system The three phase systems are fed via contactors similar to a three phase motor 'direct on line' starter which is controlled by a thermostat somewhere in the line. This ensures that the temperature is kept constant and the line does not overheat or underheat. If a line becomes frozen because the heating was switched off then this may take some time to thaw out using trace heating. This thawing out is done on the three phase systems by using an 'auto transformer' to give a higher voltage, and consequently higher current, and make the trace heating elements a bit hotter. The boost system is usually on a timer and switches back to 'normal' after a period of time.

He was professor of English Literature and Creative Writing at Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee. He also taught in the MA program at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. Early Life  Behr was born into a family of farmers in the district of Oljorro, Arusha, Tanzania, then still Tanganyika. After the nationalisation of white-owned farms during the implementation of President Julius Nyerere's Ujamaa Policy of African Socialism in 1964, the family emigrated to South Africa. Here the family defined themselves as Afrikaners, with the Behr children attending Afrikaans language schools and the conservative Dutch Reformed church.Vliesa, Andrew van der. \\"An Interview with Mark Behr\\", Safundi: The Journal of South African and American Studies, Volume 12, Issue 1, 2011, pages 1-26, 13 January 2011.

Between ages ten and twelve Behr attended the Drakensberg Boys' Choir School, a private music academy in the Drakensberg Mountains of KwaZulu-Natal. After matriculation from Port Natal High School, an Afrikaans language school in Durban, he was, like most other young white South African men of his age, conscripted into the South African Defence Force, and he served in the Angolan War, becoming a junior officer in the Marine Corps.  Academic study and political development  After leaving the South African Defence Force, Behr attended Stellenbosch University in the Western-Cape Province of South Africa. It was during this period (1985‚Äì1989) that Behr's creative work was first published; several poems appeared in the university's annual magazine, \\"Die Stellenbosse Student\\". While a student there, Behr became an agent for the South African apartheid government, which was committed to monitoring the activities of students on university campuses to prevent political insurrection. Having graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in English and Politics, Behr proceeded to read for an Honors degree in Politics. After a year with IDASA (the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa) Behr became a Research Fellow and lecturer at the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo, Norway, and began to travel between Europe, South Africa, and the United States. He enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in the United States where he studied with Joseph Buttigieg, the translator of Antonio Gramsci's Prison Notebooks. Behr graduated from Notre Dame with Master's degrees in International Peace Studies in 1993, Fiction Writing in 1998, and English Literature in 2000.  Writing awards  Behr's first published novel, The Smell of Apples (1995), appeared first in Afrikaans in 1993 (as Die Reuk van Appels). The book garnered significant recognition in the form of the M-Net Award, one of South Africa's most prestigious literary prizes, as well as the Eugene Marais and the CNA Debut Literary Awards in South Africa, and the Betty Trask Award for the best first novel published in the United Kingdom in 1996. The novel was also short-listed for both the Steinbeck and Guardian Literary Awards. In 1997 the novel received the Art Seidenbaum Award from the Los Angeles Times. The attention attracted by the success of this book compelled Behr to speak publicly about his spying. In 1996, at a Cape Town conference on Truth and Reconciliation, he used his podium as keynote speaker to discuss his history in the South African military and his campus spy status. In 2000, Behr's second novel, Embrace, was published. Its mixed reviews may reflect enduring anxieties regarding Behr's student political activities. Praised by Felice Picano in the Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide for its epic quality, universal reach and insistence on complexity it was reviled in The Sunday Times by Tim Trengrove Jones as a \\"baggy monster of overstated anxiety.\\" Embrace was short-listed for The Sunday Times Award in South Africa and the Encore Award in the United Kingdom. At the end of 2009 Behr published his third novel Kings of the Water. Kate Saunders in The Times reviewed it as: \\"Superbly written, thoughtful and unflinching, this terrific novel explores the mentality of the Afrikaner male ‚Äì with wonderfully poetic use of the Afrikaans language.\\" Novelist Christopher Hope, reviewing for The Guardian (January 2010), noted the spirit of Chekov's \\"The Cherry Orchard\\" and called the novel \\"one of the most moving to come out of South Africa in many years.\\" Behr also wrote short stories and essays.\\"Rhodes Professor Mark Behr Pays Tribute to Legacy of Nelson Mandela\\" , Rhodes College News, 10 December 2013.

His father had been put to death by the French in 1343 on the suspicion of having willingly given up the city of Vannes to the English. Biography Olivier de Clisson was born on 23 April 1336 at the Ch√¢teau de Clisson in Brittany. =Clisson family context= Olivier's father chose the camp of Charles de Blois and the King of France in the Breton War of Succession and was the military commander defending the city of Vannes when the English besieged it in 1342. His father was captured by the English and imprisoned, but was released after a relatively low ransom was paid. Because of the amount, the King of France, Philip VI and his advisers suspected Clisson of conspiring with King Edward III. After a peace treaty was signed, his father was invited to Paris for a tournament, but was arrested, tried and executed by beheading on 2 August 1343. This expeditious execution shocked the nobility as the evidence of guilt was never made public. Moreover, the notion of betrayal does not refer in the same way for nobles of that time: they claimed the right to choose whom to honor. Olivier IV's body received additional posthumous humiliation: his body was hanged by the armpits at the gallows at Montfaucon in Paris, and his head was piked at the Sauvetout gate of Nantes. Coat of arms of the House of de Montfort =Formative years on the seas and in England= Olivier's mother, Jeanne de Clisson n√©e de Belleville, swore Olivier and his brother Guillaume to avenge their father. She raised funds for an army to attack troops loyal to France, stationed in Brittany. Eventually she armed ships and started a piratical war against French ships. These ships were eventually lost and Jeanne with her two sons set adrift for five days. Guillaume died of thirst, cold and exhaustion. Olivier and his mother were finally rescued and taken to Morlaix by Montfort supporters. It was after these events that Olivier was taken by his mother to England in his youth. Hereafter, he was raised in the court of King Edward III alongside John IV de Montfort, a future claimant of the Ducal throne of Brittany. Olivier's mother Jeanne, eventually married her fourth husband, an English military commander of King Edward III. =Breton War of Succession= After ten years in England, Olivier, then twenty-three, accompanied King Edward III and John IV de Montfort at the head of a Breton-English force to Brittany in 1359 as part of a guerilla campaign near Poitou. Olivier V de Clisson depicted on his tomb Basilique Notre Dame du Roncier, Josselin, Brittany. Treaty of Br√©tigny Under the reign of the new King, John II \\"The Good\\" of France, Olivier was reconciled to the French Crown in 1360 as part of the Treaty of Br√©tigny, drafted on the 8th of May. Officially ratified on the 24th of October of that year, this treaty, which had been renamed the Treaty of Calais, sought to defuse sources of conflict between France and England, opening a nine-year truce between the two Kingdoms. As a part of its pursuit to eliminate the reasons for the two countries' animosity, such as the grievances Olivier's family had against the French Monarchy, this treaty, in an attempt to rectify these wrongs, posthumously reinstated the honour of Olivier's father, allowing his relatives to regain the rights and privileges their family's nobility had once provided them. First marriage In the same year, Olivier also married and Chateaubriant, heiress of the family Laval, and granddaughter of the Duke Arthur II. He therefore became first cousin of both Ducal claimants: * John IV de Montfort and * Joan, Duchess of Brittany, wife of Charles de Blois, This also made Olivier a relative of the King of France. This alliance opened up new political possibilities. The marriage produced two daughters: * Beatrice of Laval, lady Villemomble * Margaret War continues In 1363 Olivier was still on the side of the Breton-English Montfortists and one of the commanders of the Montfort troops who failed to take Nantes, but managed to hold B√©cherel. Capture of the French king In 1364 several months after the accession of another French king, Charles V, John IV took advantage of the troubled situation in France since the capture of King John II the Good and was assisted by the English under John Chandos, the commander who had decided the battle of Poitiers. Death of Charles de Blois In 1365 John IV besieged the city of Auray. The two opposing Breton armies clashed under the walls of the city on 29 September. Monfortistes were entrenched there and John IV attempted to overcome the numerical inferiority of his army by attacking the Breton-French camp by surprise. The Breton-English commander, however, adopted a proposal from Olivier and waited for the Breton-French army to climb a slope leading to Auray. They managed to divide the troops of Charles de Blois and were fought separately. Isolated from the bulk of his army, Charles de Blois was surrounded and killed in the melee, while Bertrand du Guesclin, the French Commander, was captured but released later with a ransom in 1365. The Breton War of Succession ended with this battle and Olivier had played an important role. Olivier was however injured and lost the use of one eye, earning him the nickname \\"the one-eyed man of Auray\\". First Treaty of Gu√©rande The widow of Charles de Blois, Joan, Duchess of Brittany, acceded to these events, and peace talks between the houses of Blois and Montfort started. John IV was nicknamed the Conqueror and was recognized as the only Duke of Brittany. Olivier, while nursing his injury learnt that John IV had given the English commander, John Chandos, the G√¢vre castle and forest, a reward Olivier coveted for his loyal service. Olivier expressed his displeasure at the new Duke, but this did not change the matter. Olivier evidently raged \\"I would rather give myself to the devil than have an English neighbor\\" A fortnight later, the G√¢vre castle was surprisingly burnt down. In response to this, Duke John IV confiscated the lordship of Ch√¢teauceaux from Olivier. In 1366 Olivier was sent to Paris as the Breton ambassador to ensure that Charles V, King of France, complied to the guarantees of the status of an independent Brittany. On 22 May Olivier was received with great fanfare in Paris. =Battle of Castile= In 1367 Olivier participated, with the English General Robert Knolles under command of the Black Prince, at the battle of N√°jera (Castile) and faced troops commanded by the French Constable du Guesclin. The French lost this battle and du Guesclin was captured for the second time. =Change of allegiances= In the spring of 1369, Olivier advised the French King in planning a possible invasion of England, to avoid the winter storms of the Channel given the weakness of the French fleet. In August of the same year, Olivier failed to take Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte for the English, since he was forced to decamp and to negotiate on behalf of Duke John IV with King Charles V. King Charles V apparently secured the full services of Olivier at this stage by paying him with properties in Normandy. It is with these lands that Olivier exchanged for the lordship of Josselin with the Count of Alen√ßon, his cousin in 1370. A few months later, Olivier formalised his change of allegiance, by signing a charter establishing the suzerainty of the King of France over Josselin, even though it was located in the heart of Brittany. For his part, Duke John IV expressed his displeasure with Olivier in this regard.Coat of arms of France Entrance gate of Clisson's residence, rue des Archives, Paris, with plaque. Having acquired the lordship of Josselin, Olivier began to build Josselin Castle in 1370, an imposing new fortress with eight towers.[http://www.chateaujosselin.com/castle-middle-ages.html History at chateaujosselin.com In the same year, he joined Bertrand du Guesclin, the constable of France, and followed him in campaigns against the English, including the Siege of Brest in 1373. In 1370 King Charles V requested Olivier to plunder English-controlled southwest France. On 23 October, Olivier allied now with du Guesclin, by the oath of Pontorson, defeated the English at the Battle of Pontvallain, The oath between the new allies stated that the benefits of any gains would be shared. This alliance was indicative of the general state of vassalage links of the era, leading to situations where these links were intertwined and inextricable, each becoming free to choose sides in the interests of the moment. The brotherhood of arms had become greater than the vassal relationship, Olivier respected the oath with Du Guesclin. From this pact, Olivier formally became a Valois, the murderers of his father. In the same year, during a raid by the English General Robert Knolles outside Paris, Olivier advised the King in a cautious tactic, a defensive strategy to avoid a pitched battle as the French were not sufficiently prepared; Knowles was eventually turned away from capital. In 1371 the King of France decided to attack the English in their possessions of Guyenne. The Constable and Olivier shared the military command, the former leading the fight in Auvergne and Rouergue, while the second attacked the English positions of Poitou, Saintonge and Anjou during the summer. The English retaliated by leading an expedition against the stronghold of Moncontour, which fell after ten days of siege. The English controlled cities of Loudun, Saint Jean d'Angely and Saintes were captured in 1372. The people of La Rochelle themselves opened the gates to the French troops. On several occasions, as with Moncontour, the English did not spare prisoners who could pay ransom. The squire of Olivier who was captured in Benon Saintonge, was tortured and killed. In revenge, Olivier executed fifteen prisoners and developed a reputation for not hesitating to mutilate captive enemies, cutting off arms or legs. du Guesclin evidently remarked \\"God! The body of St. Benedict, the English are not wrong when they call you the Butcher! \\" =Breton war debt= Brittany was at this stage indebted to the English King Edward III. Thomas Melbourne, Treasurer and Receiver General of the Duchy, and other advisors to the Breton Duke were English. Breton Nobles such as Olivier resented this as well as an increasingly popular discontent over the implementation of a permanent ducal tax, the hearth tax. Duke John IV chose to sign a new treaty of alliance with England explaining to France that he was forced to host English troops in order to counter Olivier's militant presence in Brittany. In 1373 in response to this, King Charles V ordered the Constable on 1 March to seize the Duchy and ensure the support of Olivier, by giving him the lordship of Guillac. Du Guesclin and Olivier started a propaganda war to discredit the Breton nobility of Duke John IV. English troops were stationed in Derval, Rouge, Brest and Saint-Mathieu. Abandoned by most of the Breton nobility, Duke John IV was forced into exile and crossed the English Channel on 28 April 1373. =Olivier as co-regent of Brittany= Olivier could have claimed the title of Duke, but King Charles V chose to hand over Brittany to his brother, the Duke of Anjou, who was married to a daughter of Charles Penthievre Blois, to head the Duchy, with the title of \\"lieutenant of the King\\" This appointment was however honorific, as the Duke of Anjou never entered Brittany. Olivier was subsequently appointed co- regent with a Vicount, John I of Rohan. 1373, the summer began with the siege of Derval, symbolic as this castle was the property of the English General, Robert Knolles. During the years 1373 to 1377 Duke John IV re-entered Brittany after attaining the services of the English Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt to intervene with about ten thousand troops. Duke John IV retook Saint-Pol-de- L√©on and besieged St. Brieuc. In southern Brittany, Olivier built up military forces, while Duke John IV tried to capture Quimperl√©. A truce between the Kings of France and England, however, prevented Olivier from using it this force. The siege of Brest lasted from 1373 to 1377; Olivier then built the fortress of Guesnou to prohibit access to the city by the sea. At this stage, Brest was the last city under English occupation in Brittany. In 1378 King Charles V made the political choice to fully annex Brittany to the Kingdom of France in 18 December, causing a reversal of the independence of the Breton nobility, including Joan, Duchess of Brittany, as the Treaty of Gu√©rande had not been respected. King Charles V petitioned four Breton lords to give their opinion on the subject: * Guy XII de Laval refused to fight against Duke John IV, * Vicount Rohan timidly promised his help, * Clisson and du Guesclin affirmed their loyalty to the Valois cause. Duke John IV on his return from exile found support in Brittany and a Breton provisional government was created to meet with the King of France. Olivier saw an opportunity to take the title of Duke but failed again to convince the King of France as Duke John IV again had a secret arrangements with the then King of England, Richard II. Duke John IV therefore reclaimed his seat of Brittany except the land held by Olivier, including Nantes. Olivier V de Clisson personal blason =Second marriage= Widowed, Olivier married in 1378 his second wife Marguerite de Rohan (1330-1406), a daughter of Alain VII Rohan. Marguerite was the widow of Jean de Beaumanoir, a hero of the Breton nobility, who faced the English at the battle of Trent, she had three daughters. A sister of Clisson, Isabeau, is also united in 1338 to Jean Rieux. With these unions, Olivier V is linked to the largest noble families of Brittany. =Constable of France= In 1380 after the death of du Guesclin, King Charles VI, crowned at the age of twelve, gave Olivier the rank of Constable of France on 28 November, with the support of the Duke of Anjou, but despite the opposition of the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy, all three uncles of the King. Two other two candidates declined the offer considering Olivier's experienced warfaring skills. The role of Constable gave the holder the right to keep loot of war apart from gold, silver, and prisoners. Olivier received the Constable's sword, and held the office from 1380 to 1392. =Second Treaty of Guerande= In 1381 the second Treaty of Gu√©rande of 4 April normalised relations between the Duchy of Brittany and the Kingdom of France, Duke John IV and Olivier signed a treaty of \\"good allies\\" on 30 May 1381, which was reaffirmed on 27 February 1382. =Flanders campaign= In 1382, following a revolt in Flanders challenging feudal power, King Charles VI of France decided to intervene and assist his ally, the Count of Flanders, Louis de Male. Olivier led the French Royal army on 27 November to victory in the Battle of Roosebeke during which twenty-five thousand men were massacred. The Constable was able to gain a tactical advantage against the inexperienced bourgeois militias, artisans, and merchants who were crushed by the seasoned French troops, who then engaged in massive looting. The Flemish uprising caused secondary emancipatory desires in Paris itself. A decision to reinstate a tax which had been abolished by the previous King, started a revolt from the citizens of Paris, the Revolt of Maillotins, in March 1382. King Charles VI's absence from Paris while supporting his troops in Flanders gave hope to the revolters that royal power had weakened. King Charles VI's victory in Flanders and return to Paris, however, changed the situation as the Parisians chose not to confront the King. In February 1383 Olivier stated to them that they appeared to be rich and bourgeois, and stated: \\"Corps and property, you are in case of forfeiture. See what you choose: justice or mercy.\\" They chose mercy, that is to say, the payment of a large sum depending on the fortunes of each person. The King's entourage was magnanimous and eventually abandoned a portion of these \\"fines\\". =Marriage of daughter= In 1384 the treaty Olivier had with Duke John IV did not prevent him to pay the ransom of John I, Count of Penthi√®vre, son of Charles de Blois, who was held hostage in England. Moreover, Olivier betrothed his daughter Margaret, to him. It appears that Olivier was positioning his family as under the terms of the Treaty of Gu√©rande, if Duke John IV had no male child, Jean de Blois, son of Joan, Duchess of Brittany, would then be the Ducal heir apparent. =England invasion project= In 1384 Olivier conceived a project to invade England using a huge fortified raft. One thousand three hundred ships were gathered and protected by ninety-seven warships. This very expensive operation was not successful: At the time of its completion, in December 1386, the Duke of Berry, one of the King‚Äôs uncles, delayed and prevented the smooth running of the operation, especially as the main supporter, the Duke of Burgundy, had fallen ill. Bad weather also prevented the project, which was finally abandoned in 1387. =First assassination attempt= In 1387 Olivier was invited by Duke John IV to attend a session of the Parliament of Brittany in Vannes, to inaugurate the castle of Hermine, which Duke John IV had built. On 27 June 1387 the Constable was seized and imprisoned, and the Duke ordered that Olivier be sealed in a bag and thrown into the water. This order, however, was not followed by Jehan Bazvalan, the weapons master of Duke John IV, who was content to keep him locked up. In the morning, Duke John IV asked about the fate of Olivier, and John Bazvalan admitted the non-execution of the order. Olivier eventually agreed to pay a large sum and to give to Duke John IV the forts of Blain, Josselin and Jugon Le Guildo. In 1388 the King of France traded with the Duke for Olivier and restored the confiscated lands to the Constable, but not the ransom. This was to spare the Duke from humiliation and again becoming a fulcrum for the English. =Government marmousets= Since the King was only twelve years old, Olivier played a special role, as the historian Fran√ßoise Autrand qualified, as an \\"uncle\\". By 1388 at the age of fifteen, King Charles VI decided to govern without his real uncle. The Constable was now part of a group which headed the government, included with Olivier were: * the chamberlain of Charles V Bureau de La Rivi√®re * Jean Le Mercier promoted to grand master of Hotel King * John Montaigu This political episode is known as the \\"government of the marmousets\\". =Heir to Brittany= In 1389 the King encouraged leaders of noble Breton families such as Olivier to apply for the title of Duke of Brittany, if Duke John IV had no male heir. The Duke of Brittany, however, did produce a son with Jeanne de Navarre, who was also named Jean and was born on 24 December. =Second assassination attempt= In 1392 on Olivier's return to Paris, an attempt was made to assassinate him by Pierre de Craon, allegedly at the instigation of Duke John IV. Craon waylaid Olivier in a narrow street. Olivier's unarmed servants fled, but Olivier was saved from death by his chainmail coat, and was able to draw his sword and fend off his attackers. In the struggle, he fell from his horse and was knocked out against the door of a baker's shop. Believing him dead, Craon fled Paris for Brittany.Michael Jones, Ducal Brittany, 1364-1399: relations with England and France during the reign of Duke John IV, Oxford University Press, 1970, pp. 106, 123-4, 128, 130, 200. =Refuge in Brittany= In order to punish Duke John IV and Craon, King Charles VI, accompanied by the Constable, marched on Brittany, but it was on this expedition that the King was seized with a bout of madness. The uncles of King Charles VI blamed Olivier for his breakdown. During King Charles VI's dementia phase, the King's uncle was returned to power. The Parliament condemned Olivier on 10 December 1392 for having illegally enriched himself, banished Olivier from the Kingdom, fined him two hundred thousand pounds, and demanded the return of the sword of Constable. Olivier refused to return the sword, and sought refuge in the castle of Montlh√©ry, and in Brittany in his castle of Josselin. Duke John IV wanted to ingratiate the favor of France, and thus besieged Josselin. By 1394 King Charles VI however restored confidence in Olivier and although Philip of Artois succeeded him in 1392, the King confirmed his function as the Constable. In 1397 Louis de Sancerre was also appointed Constable, replacing the deceased Philippe of Artois, but Olivier retained the privilege of being the holder of the Constable sword. By 1397 Olivier had also formed a secondary Royal alliance with Louis d'Orleans, brother of King Charles VI. =Reconciliation with Duke John IV and Protector of Brittany= After thirty years of conflict, Olivier, through the Duke of Bourgogne, was reconciled in 1396 with his overlord Duke John IV. The latter sent his son as a guarantee of his sincerity. They promised peace and good friendship until death. The promise was kept, the two men were at peace when Duke John IV died in 1399. The Dukes son was only ten years old when the regent Joan of Navarre married King Henry IV of England. Louis of Orleans offered to his brother King Charles VI that the government of Brittany be therefore entrusted to Olivier, to prevent it passing under English domination, however Philip the Bold became regent of the Duchy.Coat of arms of the Dutchy of Brittany Marguerite de Clisson, daughter of Olivier, nicknamed Margot, sided with her husband John, Count of Penthi√®vre, against her father, and claimed the Duchy, which attracted the wrath of Olivier, who predicted: \\"Perverse, you'll ruin your children.‚Äù This prediction would come true, since two of her sons would be executed for treason after removing the Duke and the third would be imprisoned for twenty five years. The clash of Olivier and his daughter in 1399 gave rise to a legend. In her flight, Marguerite allegedly broke her leg and became lame earning her the nickname \\"Lame Margot.\\" This legend was probably invented by an opposing faction of the family after 1420. =Death= After mentioning in his will a wish to return the sword of the Constable, Olivier de Clisson died in Josselin on 23 April 1407 at the age of 71. He was buried in the chapel of the castle of Josselin. His grave was however desecrated in 1793. Genealogy Clisson carried the noble titles of: * Earl of Porho√´t * Baron Pontch√¢teau * Lord of Clisson, Porhoet of Belleville and Garnache, Clisson and Belleville, the respective lordships of his father (who was a Knight banneret) and her mother. Descent Clisson had two daughters, born of his union with Catherine de Laval. The eldest, Beatrice (born before 1366 - died in 1448), married in 1407 Alain VIII de Rohan. Their son, Alain IX of Rohan, married Margaret, a sister of John V. This branch of the Rohan family had a flourishing destiny and inherited Castle Josselin. The twenty-first (Josselin de Rohan, Senator for Morbihan from 1983 to 2011) Duke of Rohan is a 19th generation of grandson of Olivier. Marguerite (1366 - 1441) married on 20 January 1387 John, son of Joan, Duchess of Brittany, and Charles de Blois. Taking up the claims of the Penthi√®vre family in terms of the ducal throne, she kidnapped John V, son of Duke John IV. She was defeated and her property was confiscated by John V. Fortune Depending on the items specified in his will, Yvonig Gicquel estimated that the annual revenues of Olivier in 1400 were around five hundred million Francs, representing about one hundred and eighty million euros in 2013 terms. When estimating his property, his heritage and his fortune was estimated at six tons of gold and sixty tons of silver.

It is based upon the revivalist hymn \\"Follow On\\". Club usage The song has been adopted by Rangers as their club anthem. In 2007 Rangers used the song as an inspiration for the title of their initiative against unacceptable behaviour at football matches, Follow With Pride, to replace their Pride Over Prejudice campaign. There is also a Rangers fanzine named after the song. It is also called Follow Follow and was banned from being sold outside Ibrox Stadium due to having printed articles with a sectarian related content. It moved to an online message board which is now the leading Rangers fansite.  Controversy  The song has gathered an amount of controversy after some fans started to sing alternative lyrics about the Pope and the Vatican City that are considered sectarian. In 1999 Rangers' vice-chairman Donald Findlay had to stand down from his position and resign from the club's board after being filmed singing \\"Follow Follow\\" (with these alternative lyrics) and \\"The Sash\\". The Faculty of Advocates (the professional body to which Findlay belonged) found his actions were \\"likely to bring the faculty into disrepute\\" and fined him ¬£3,500. In 2009, Linda Gillies was investigated by police after West Lothian Council received a complaint after her parrot was heard whistling \\"Follow Follow\\", to the chagrin of some of her neighbours. The complaint was eventually dismissed by the council and no charges were brought against Gillies.

Known as the \\"Lion of Sagami\\", he was revered as a fearsome warrior and a cunning man. He is famous for his strategies that defeated Shingen and Kenshin. The son of H≈çj≈ç Ujitsuna (ÂåóÊù° Ê∞èÁ∂±), his only known wife was Imagawa Yoshimoto's sister, Zuikei-in. Among his sons are H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa and Uesugi Kagetora. Early years and rise His childhood name was Chiyomaru (ÂçÉ‰ª£‰∏∏). He fought his first battle when he was fifteen years old, facing Uesugi Tomooki of the ≈ågigayatsu Uesugi clan (ÊâáË∞∑‰∏äÊùâÂÆ∂) at the Battle of Ozawahara in 1530. Upon his father's death in 1541, a number of the H≈çj≈ç's enemies sought to take advantage of the opportunity to seize major H≈çj≈ç strongholds. Faced with almost endless warfare, Ujiyasu was compelled to reorganize the administration of the H≈çj≈ç lands. He had already ordered a series of aggressive cadastral surveys between 1542 and 1543, and in 1550, he overhauled the Kandaka (ja) taxation system. Odawara, where his home castle Odawara Castle (Â∞èÁî∞ÂéüÂüé) was located, was gradually transformed into an important trading center by modifying the region's throughways (which were hitherto designed with Kamakura as a hub) and creating an artisan's guild within the castle town. In addition, post stations and market places sprung up throughout the H√¥j√¥'s lands. Ujiyasu soon became one of the main powers in the Kant≈ç region. Conflict with Uesugi In 1545, Uesugi Tomosada, of the ≈ågigayatsu Uesugi clan and the eldest legitimate son of Uesugi Tomooki, allied himself with the Koga Kubo Ashikaga Haruuji (Ë∂≥Âà© Êô¥Ê∞è) and Uesugi Norimasa (‰∏äÊùâ ÊÜ≤Êîø) of the Yamauchi Uesugi clan (Â±±ÂÜÖ‰∏äÊùâÂÆ∂) and besieged Kawagoe Castle (Siege of Kawagoe Castle). The castle garrison led by H≈çj≈ç Tsunashige (ÂåóÊù° Á∂±Êàê), the stepson of Ujiyasu's brother Tamemasa (ÂåóÊù° ÁÇ∫Êòå) and son- in-law of Ujitsuna, was outnumbered 3,000 to allegedly 80,000 men. Ujiyasu, leading a relief force of 8,000 soldiers to rescue, slipped some samurai past the enemy lines to inform Tsunashige of the enemy's approach, and made use of ninja to learn of the enemy's strategy and attitude. Using this intelligence, he led a night attack against the Ashikaga-Uesugi forces, which is now said to be the one of the most notable examples of night fighting in samurai history. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the H≈çj≈ç army defeated the besiegers because under Ujiyasu's orders, they were not bulked down by heavy armor, and were not slowed by seeking to take heads. \\"The result was the complete defeat of the Uesugi forces and the Koga contingent. From that date the Go-H≈çj≈ç (\\"Later- H≈çj≈ç\\") as they were called, went on to further triumphs, beginning with the destruction of the Uesugi family.\\" This victory marked the decisive turning point in the struggle for the Kanto, and in the following years, proved the end of the ≈ågigayatsu Uesugi line and destroyed the prestige of Uesugi Norimasa of the Yamanouchi Uesugi clan as Kant≈ç kanrei (Governor-General of Kant≈ç region, ). In 1551, Ujiyasu defeated Uesugi Norimasa at Hirai Castle () and forced him to flee to Echigo, where he was taken into the protective custody of his retainer Nagao Kagetora, the later day Uesugi Kenshin and heir to Norimasa by adoption. In 1561, Kenshin assumed the post of Kant≈ç kanrei and in the same year tried to conquer the region once more. Kenshin besieged Odawara Castle and burned down the town, withdrawing after two months (Siege of Odawara (1561)). H≈çj≈ç expansion In 1563, Ujiyasu allied himself with Takeda Shingen and together regained Musashi-Matsuyama Castle (Ê≠¶ËîµÊùæÂ±±ÂüéAlso known simply as ÊùæÂ±±Âüé.) in Musashi Province against Uesugi Norikatsu (‰∏äÊùâÊÜ≤Âãù) (Siege of Musashi-Matsuyama (1563)). Ujiyasu expanded the H≈çj≈ç territory, which now covered five provinces, and managed and maintained what his father and grandfather had held. In 1564, he took K≈çnodai in Shim≈çsa Province following a battle against Satomi Yoshihiro (ÈáåË¶ã Áæ©Âºò) (Battle of K≈çnodai (1564)). Following this victory, Ujiyasu pushed on into Shimosa Province and Kazusa Province, but was never able to destroy the Satomi clan, who remained a thorn in the H√¥j√¥'s side right up until 1590. Ujiyasu's eastern moves brought the H≈çj≈ç into conflict with the Satake clan of Hitachi Province and to the limit of their expansion. After the second battle of Konodai in 1564, the H≈çj≈ç largely contented themselves with ruling the vast tracts of land earned through 60 years of war and toil. Conflict with Takeda Towards the end of his life he saw the first major conflicts between his own clan and Takeda Shingen (Ê≠¶Áî∞ ‰ø°ÁéÑ), who would become one of the greatest warlords of the period. As a response to H≈çj≈ç's intervention into the his invasion of Suruga Province, Shingen came into Musashi Province from his home province of Kai, attacking Takiyama (ÊªùÂ±±Âüé) and Hachigata (Èâ¢ÂΩ¢Âüé) (Siege of Hachigata (1568)) Castles, where Ujiyasu's sons repulsed them. After failing to take the two castles. Shingen nevertheless pressed on to the H≈çj≈ç's home castle of Odawara, burning the castle town and withdrawing after three days (Siege of Odawara (1569)). As the forces of Shingen withdrew from repeated failed sieges of Odawara Castle, two of Ujiyasu's seven sons, the brothers Ujiteru and Ujikuni, attacked him in the pass of Mimase (Battle of Mimasetoge), ending the first of the Takeda campaigns against the H≈çj≈ç. Later in the year, Shingen's son Takeda Katsuyori (Ê≠¶Áî∞ ÂãùÈ†º) led a successful siege against the Hojo Kanbara Castle (Ëí≤ÂéüÂüé) in Suruga province (Siege of Kanbara). Takeda Shingen also laid siege to other H≈çj≈ç holdings in the surrounding provinces, including Fukazawa castle in Suruga province which was taken in 1571 (Siege of Fukazawa). Death Subsequently, Ujiyasu managed to make peace with Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen, the most powerful adversaries of H≈çj≈ç Ujiyasu, letting his seventh son H≈çj≈ç Sabur≈ç be adopted by childless Kenshin and accepting the fait accompli of Shingen's reign over Suruga. To cement the ties of Takeda-Imagawa-Hojo, Ujiyasu also gave his two daughters to those two clans; Lady Hayakawa wed to Imagawa Ujizane, while Lady Hojo (Hojo Masako) wed to Takeda Katsuyori becoming his second wife. Ujiyasu died in 1571, passing on the H≈çj≈ç domains to his eldest son Ujimasa (ÂåóÊù° Ê∞èÊîø) in a relatively favourable situation.

(Coffee Crisp bar included for scale.) The Individual Meal Pack or IMP is one type of field ration used by the Canadian Forces. The IMP is designed so that a continuous diet provides all the nutrition needed to sustain a service-person in the field. The IMP meets Canada's nutrition requirements, with the exception of calcium and folic acid, which are not significant if the consumption period of rations is less than 30 (consecutive) days.MREInfo‚ÄîCanadian IMP IMPs will provide 1200-1400 calories per meal. Three IMPs (breakfast, lunch and dinner) provide approximately , enough to nourish a soldier undergoing strenuous physical activity. The meals are precooked and can therefore be safely consumed either heated or unheated. Under ideal circumstances the entrees are generally consumed heated. In 2015 IMPs include a variety of items, such as pulled pork, poutine and beef jerky (above) Contents of the combat rations are subject to a three-year research and development cycle, where new meals are added, and some replaced. Every second year, new meals are field tested by three groups of 60 people drawn from each of the three Canadian Army brigades. In all, there are 21 meals available - seven breakfasts and 14 meals suitable as noon or evening meals. In addition to the main meal, each IMP contains assorted basics such as powdered coffee, protein and sports drink mixes, energy bars, trail mix, peanut butter, cereal, condiments, candy, chocolate, gum, a plastic spoon, a wet towelette and matches. Meals are packaged fully cooked and do not require cooking. While edible cold, when circumstances permit the ideal method of preparation is to cook the entrees either in a pressure cooker, heated on the standard issue Coleman stove, or by simply boiling the rations in its package in water. Another way to warm the meal when a stove is unavailable is by putting it in the pocket of a coat during winter. Chemical cooking pouches have also been issued, allowing for flameless meal heating. Other items can also be improved by boiling or adding water, such as packages of soup, rice, powdered drinks and even the prepackaged bread, which is dense and can be softened by exposure to the pressure cooker. Another technique developed by soldiers in the field is putting the package in the grill covering the exhaust on many armoured vehicles, and on radiators of wheeled vehicles.

There are also patrol packs, which are small high- protein snack-type foods (such as beef jerky or shredded cheese) and boxed lunches (consisting of assorted sandwiches, juice, fruit, pasta and a dessert) provided for soldiers to consume in situations in which meal preparation nor the delivery of haybox style fresh rations are not possible, such as travelling for training within Canada or spending the day on a shooting range. The IMP is intended to be issued when fresh rations are not possible, they can also be consumed as emergency rations, unheated. History The IMPs appeared in the Canadian Forces in the 1980s, replacing early canned rations (Individual Ration Pack (IRP), Canadian Army Mess Tin Ration, Compo rations). The main menu items of the IMP are \\"boil in a bag\\" (known as a \\"retort pouch\\") and require less preparation time and equipment than the previous canned rations. Another stated advantage is that preparation using retort pouches can be done using less heat, reducing the impact on the taste of the food. Preparation and cooking For IMPs, the main entr√©e and the dessert portion are contained in retort pouches, which are then packaged in cardboard boxes. These cardboard boxes are positioned inside the IMP package on the outer sides, sandwiching the other contents, so the IMP itself looks like it is entirely contained within a cardboard box inside the outer foil-lined paper bag. IMPs are usually \\"stripped\\" before field use by removing the cumbersome packaging and discarding extraneous elements individual soldiers do not wish to carry with them, such as the cardboard boxes containing the main entr√©e and dessert, and any condiments that an individual soldier may not personally use. The new method of heating has greatly improved over the previous options. The soldier simply puts their meal packet into a flameless ration heater. The chemical reaction generates enough heat to ensure a hot meal.

Professional life Appointed while still young to a botanical professorship, Cirillo went for some years to England, where he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and to France. On his return to Naples he was appointed to the chair of medical practice and afterwards to the chair of theoretical medicine. He wrote copiously on scientific subjects and had practiced medicine extensively. He was the teacher of the future military doctor Antonio Savaresi. Cirillo's favorite study was botany. He was known as an entomologist by Linnaeus. He wrote many books in Latin and Italian, all of them treatises on medical and scientific subjects. The is a philosophical pamphlet remarkable for both its learning and style. He introduced many medical innovations to Naples, particularly inoculation against smallpox. As well as several works on hygiene he also wrote: * , Naples, 1771 * , 1784 * , 1788 - 1793 * , Naples, 1787 - 1792 Patriot and refugee With French help the Parthenopean Republic was established in January 1799, causing the monarch and his government to flee to Sicily. After at first refusing to take part in the new government, Cirillo consented to be chosen as a representative of the people and became a member of the legislative commission, of which he was eventually elected president. By June of the same year, the republic collapsed when the French withdrew and the city was overtaken by Cardinal Ruffo's counter-revolutionary Sanfedista army. Ferdinand IV's army returned to Naples, and the republicans withdrew to the forts, ill-armed and with inadequate provisions. After a short siege the Republicans surrendered on what they considered honorable terms: life and liberty being guaranteed them by the signatures of Ruffo, of Foote, and of Micheroux. The arrival of Lord Nelson changed the state of affairs, and he refused to ratify the capitulation. Secure under the British flag, Ferdinand and his wife, Marie Caroline of Austria, showed themselves eager for revenge, and Cirillo joined other republicans in fighting back. Cirillo wrote to Emma, Lady Hamilton (wife of the British ambassador to Naples) asking her to intercede on his behalf, but Nelson wrote of the petition: \\"Domenico Cirillo, who had been the King's physician, might have been saved, but that he chose to play the fool and lie, denying that he had ever made any speeches against the government, and saying that he only took care of the poor in the hospitals\\".

These were named Antarctosaurus septentrionalis by Friedrich von Huene and Matley in 1933.F. v. Huene and C. A. Matley, 1933, \\"The Cretaceous Saurischia and Ornithischia of the Central Provinces of India\\", Palaeontologica Indica (New Series), Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, 21(1): 1-74 In 1995 Adrian Paul Hunt et al., believing Antarctosaurus to belong to Dicraeosauridae, made the clearly titanosaurian Antarctosaurus septentrionalis the type species of a new genus, Jainosaurus, and determined that the braincase, GSI IM K27/497, should be the lectotype.Hunt, A.P., Lockley M., Lucas S. & Meyer C., 1995, \\"The global sauropod fossil record\\", In: M.G. Lockley, V.F. dos Santos, C.A. Meyer, and A.P. Hunt, (eds.) Aspects of sauropod paleobiology, GAIA 10: 261-279 Jainosaurus was further distinguished from Antarctosaurus by details of the braincase. In 2009, Jeffrey Wilson and others made a detailed reassessment of Jainosaurus septentrionalis and confirmed its validity. The postcrania, which had been assumed lost, were shown to be largely present in the collection of the Geological Survey of India at Calcutta. They include: dorsal rib fragments (GSI K20/326, K27/425); a caudal vertebra (GSI K20/317), four chevrons (GSI K27/492‚Äì494, 496), the left and right scapula (only a cast still extant); a sternal plate (GSI K20/647); a humerus (lacking an inventory number), a radius (GSI K27/490) and an ulna (GSI K27/491). In 1996 Sankar Chatterjee referred a second braincase to the species: ISI R162. Some material from Pakistan also possibly belongs to Jainosaurus. Wilson e.a. concluded that Jainosaurus is a valid taxon, clearly distinguishable from Isisaurus. It would have been a fairly derived member of the Titanosauria, more closely related to South-American forms like Pitekunsaurus, Muyelensaurus and Antarctosaurus than to Isisaurus or Rapetosaurus.Wilson, Jeffrey; D'Emic, Michael; Rogers, Christina A.

Focusing on the rise of Ugandan President Idi Amin and his reign as dictator from 1971 to 1979, the novel, which interweaves fiction and historical fact, is written as the memoir of a fictional Scottish doctor in Amin's employ. Foden's novel received critical acclaim and numerous awards when it was published. In 2006, an eponymous film adaptation was released. Plot introduction The protagonist is a fictional character named Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor who goes to work in Uganda out of a sense of idealism and adventure. He relates how he came to be the personal physician and confidant of Amin, the president of Uganda from his coup d'√©tat in 1971 until his deposal in 1979. The novel focuses on Garrigan's relationship and fascination with the president, who soon grows into a brutal and ruthless dictator. Garrigan acts repeatedly against his better judgment, remaining in Amin's employment until he is far past the point of easy escape physically or morally. He is gradually drawn into the corruption and paranoia of Amin's rule, including the expulsion of the Asians, with disastrous results for those around him.  Development and inspiration  Drawing on his 20 years of living in Africa and his background as a journalist, Foden researched the events surrounding Amin's rise to power and downfall. He interviewed many of those who watched and participated in the Ugandan ruler's eight-year reign and evokes the form of a memoir by inserting fictional newspaper articles and journal entries, along with actual events. In a 1998 interview with the online magazine Boldtype, Foden said he based parts of Garrigan's character on an associate of Amin's named Bob Astles. As a British soldier who worked his way into Amin's favour, Astles was much more \\"proactive\\" than Garrigan, according to Foden, and he paid the price by spending six and a half years in a Ugandan jail after the fall of his protector. Astles compromised himself by his direct association with Amin's security forces. While Amin was in power, Astles was alternately either favoured or punished; he was imprisoned and tortured on at least one occasion. Foden drew in part on a lengthy interview with Astles in The Times by the journalist Paul Vallely, who spoke to Astles in a Ugandan jail after smuggling a message in to Amin's henchman in a Bible.https://prezi.com/8h5j3vmwxf6o/the-last-king-of-scotland/ Another real- life figure who has been mentioned in connection with Garrigan is Scottish doctor Wilson Carswell. Amin's personal physician was, in fact, a Ugandan doctor called Paul D'Arbela. The title of the book refers to Amin's declaring himself the \\"King of Scotland\\". Foden claims that the book is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth as a third-world dictator.

History The roots of the club date back to the 1920s when the club Vlug & Vrij Overpelt-Usines (Fast & Free Overpelt-Factories) was founded, registering as an official club with the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1927 to receive matricule 1064. The club dissolved in 1933 only to be re- established in 1937 as Vlug & Vrij Overpelt (Fast & Free Overpelt) with matricule 2554 and played at stadium De Leukens in Overpelt. It was commonly known as Overpelt Fabriek (Overpelt Factory), named after the Overpelt district in which the zinc factory was situated and was a club for the local factory workers. In 1954 the club reached the national football levels, that time at the fourth level of the Belgian football pyramid, and continued to the Belgian Third Division in 1957. Near the end of the 1950s, the name was changed again, now to Vlug en Vrij Overpelt-Fabriek (Fast and Free Overpelt- Factory). In 1982 the club was promoted to the Belgian Second Division where it remained for three seasons before being relegated again and starting an up and down movement between the second and fourth divisions. In 1987 the club obtained the royal designation, thus changing the name in 1988 to Koninklijke Vlug en Vrij Overpelt-Fabriek (Royal Fast and Free Overpelt-Factory). Midway the 1990s the club played three more seasons in the second division but promotion to the highest level would never be obtained. In 2003 neighbours K.F.C. Lommel S.K. dissolved following bankruptcy. Lommel had been founded in 1932 and its biggest achievements included playing the 2001 Belgian Cup Final and playing in both the 1997 and 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Overpelt-Fabriek and Lommel merged into K.V.S.K. United Overpelt-Lommel, often referred to as KVSK United, with KVSK an abbreviation standing for Koninklijke Voetbalvereniging en Sportkring (Royal Footballassociation and Sportscircle). It continued with the matricule 2554 of Overpelt-Fabriek but moved from De Leukens to the Soevereinstadion in Lommel. The club colours became a combination of those of Lommel (green & white) and Overpelt-Fabriek (red & blue). The new club started the 2003‚Äì04 season in the third division and only narrowly missed out on promotion. The following season the team became champions undefeated throughout the whole season (30 matches) and was promoted to the second division. During the 2005‚Äì06 season the team came close to promotion to the highest level as it led the table before the last match but lost away to Oud- Heverlee Leuven and saw the title and promotion move to Mons. The following promotion playoffs were lost to Lierse. In 2010 the club merged with third division team KFC Racing Mol-Wezel and changed its name to Lommel United and started two very successful seasons, ending second in both 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11. This however was a turning point, as almost all starting players decided to leave the club after those two seasons, forcing Lommel United to rebuild the team with many youngsters. A highlight was the 2014‚Äì15 season in which Lommel United again finished second. After that, the team only narrowly managed to obtain a place in the new second-level league called Belgian First Division B, but during the 2016‚Äì17 season the team started with only 3 wins out of 28 matches and despite a strong finish, the team was relegated to the Belgian First Amateur Division, thereby losing its professional status. Following that season, the team changed its name to Lommel SK. In May 2020 it was announced that City Football Group, the parent company of Manchester City F.C., had purchased Lommel SK, making it the ninth club to join their stable.

He was born in Austrian territory, to Serbian Orthodox Christian parents, and was initially an Austrian soldier. When faced with charges of embezzlement, he fled to Ottoman Bosnia and converted to Islam, and then joined the Ottoman army where he quickly climbed in ranks. Latas crushed several rebellions throughout the Empire, and was a commander in the Crimean War, where he won some outstanding victories at Silistra and Eupatoria and participated in the siege of Sevastopol. Early life Omar Pasha - Engraving Omar Pasha was born Mihajlo Latas (), an ethnic Serb and Orthodox Christian, in Janja Gora, at the time part of the Croatian Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire (in modern Pla≈°ki, Lika region, Croatia). His father Petar served in the Austrian Army and in time was appointed lieutenant- governor of the Ogulin district. His uncle was an Orthodox priest. Mihajlo was an intelligent and lively child, if rather sickly. He developed a passion for the military, and on leaving school in Gospiƒá, he went to a military school in Zadar and was accepted as a cadet in his father's Ogulin Regiment on the frontier. He had beautiful handwriting, and was assigned to clerical duties. There he might have languished, if his father had not upset someone along the corruption line and suffered a conviction for misappropriation. Mihajlo escaped charges of embezzlement, having stolen 180 florins from the military safe, by fleeing to the Ottoman Bosnia Eyalet in 1823. Military career Omar Pasha with his officers 1854. After escaping to Bosnia and living rough for a time, In 1828 Latas was offered a position as tutor to the children of a Turkish merchant, on condition that he converted from Christianity to Islam and was circumcised. After his conversion he took the new name Omar. A necessary condition to fulfill in order to get off the streets, it was a huge cultural step that led naturally to his decision that his future lay with the Ottomans. The big break came for the newly named Omar when the family moved to Constantinople. By astute networking and doubtless exploiting his curiosity value as a European ex-military man, he was appointed lecturer at the Turkish Military Academy. With this exposure he shone enough to be snapped up as aide- de-camp to the Polish‚ÄìOttoman General Wojciech Chrzanowski, who was engaged in the re-organization of the Ottoman Army after the defeat of the Janissaries. Now a major, Omar completed a mapping assignment in Bulgaria and the Danube territories, gaining detailed knowledge of the ground which was to serve him well in the future. Chrzanowski also milked his ideas for re-organizing the Army; in return he smoothed the way for Omar's introduction into Turkish society. He thereby met and married a rich heiress Adviye Hanƒ±m (a daughter of √áerkes Hafƒ±z Mehmed Pasha), the start of his meteoric rise in Ottoman military circles. There is no doubt that Omar's marriage opened all the right doors for him, but equally no doubt that he proved equal to the challenges of high command which resulted. He became writing-master to the Ottoman heir, Abd-ul- Medjid, and on the succession of the latter in 1839 was made a colonel. He was shortly afterwards appointed Military Governor of Constantinople. His only daughter, Saffet Hanƒ±m, married Mustafa Celalettin Pasha. Lord Raglan, Omar Pasha and Marshal Pelissier during the Crimean War, 1854‚Äì1856, photographed by Roger Fenton. In 1840-41 he led a successful expedition to quell a revolt in Syria, and in 1842 was Governor of the Tripoli Eyalet (Lebanon). He won distinction in suppressing the Albanian Revolt of 1843‚Äì44, led by local Muslim aristocrats. There followed the expedition to Kurdistan following the Massacres of Badr Khan (1846).de Bess√©, Morris, p. 25 After the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Omar Pasha was put in command of the Ottoman forces in Moldavia and Wallachia. His firm and effective handling of a powder keg situation involving potential confrontation with the Russian and Austrian armies demonstrated that he possessed considerable diplomatic skills.James, p. 121-122 There followed his command in Bosnia (1850) where he executed Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá of Stolac, who had defended Ottoman power during an earlier revolt but then started to build up an independent power base.de Bess√©, Morris, p. 26 Omar Pasha executed, plundered and abolished the respected historical aristocracy of Muslim faith, in the interest of buttressing Ottoman central power.Chambler's, p. 707 This was followed by a command in the Principality of Montenegro (1852). His chief services were rendered when the Crimean War broke out.Goldstein, p. 24 In 1853 he successfully defended Kalafat. In 1854 he entered Bucharest, and the next year defeated 40,000 Russians at Yevpatoria in the Crimea. A later achievement was his capture of Cetinje, Montenegro, during the Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War (1861‚Äì62), considered a difficult feat. A clear and precise military thinker, Omar Pasha took bold decisions and relentlessly followed them through. Although he had a reputation as a strict and ruthless disciplinarian, he was revered and respected by his men. A true professional, while the other allies struggled to come to grips with local campaigning conditions, he had seen it all too often before.de Bess√©, Morris, p. 26-27 Perhaps for that reason the allied troops found his expression cold and uninterested when seated on his horse plodding round their lines.

In addition to high reserve and capital-adequacy requirements, the Central Bank of Argentina maintained a repurchase agreement with a consortium of international banks to provide a $6,000 million safety net in the event of a liquidity squeeze. Mergers and acquisitions, which decreased the number of Argentine banks from nearly 300 in 1990 to fewer than 100 at the end of 1999, were expected to continue and lead to improvements in management and efficiency. The foreign currency reserves of the Central Bank stood at nearly $25,000 million in December 1999, or over 9 months of imports. However, these reserves were used to back the monetary liabilities of the Central Bank and were not available for conducting monetary policy; by the terms of the Convertibility Law, each Argentine peso in circulation was to be matched by one American dollar in the reserves. Despite the recession (started in 1998 after the international economic shock due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis), bank deposits continued to grow until 2001, although at a much slower rate than in previous years. Total deposits in the banking system stood at nearly $80,000 million by mid-2001 -- more than twice that of June 1995, when deposits hit a low of $37,000 million. Foreign-controlled banks held over 40% of total deposits, and six of the top 10 commercial banks were in the hands of American and European financial institutions. Bank of the Argentine Nation, Buenos Aires Still, the level of bank utilization in Argentina remained relatively low, and bank intermediation represented only about 30% of the GDP -- a much lower ratio than those of Chile, Mexico, or Brazil, for example. Nevertheless, the banking system suffered a fatal flaw: it lent dollars and took deposits in Argentine pesos (nominally argendollars). By early 2001, deposits had reached $87,000 million, but when the economy took a second dip, capital started flowing out of Argentina, and deposits started to move away from the weaker players of the financial system, namely provincial banks and large local banks. This eventually led to a run on all banks in the system, a freeze in deposits, and a currency devaluation, which included an asymmetric devaluation of loans and deposits. Banks were forced to collect their dollar loans at a conversion rate much lower than the rate applied to its dollar deposits. This made many banks technically bankrupt and destroyed the confidence of the public in the financial system, which was held responsible for many of the economic ills of the country. Deposits fell to less than $40,000 million by the end of 2002. Foreign banks fled the country during 2002 and 2003, selling their operations to smaller local banks at a fraction of their original investments. Only a few large foreign banks decided to stay. In 2004, the government compensated the banks for the impact of the asymmetric devaluation of deposits and loans through a series of \\"compensation bonds\\". Currently banks are again gaining deposits, which amounted to more than $44,000 million by February 2006, and have been increasing their lending portfolios. Their operations are leaner, due to the massive layoffs of 2002, that reduced their working force by more than 30%. However, the Argentine population still remains extremely distrustful and wary of taking long-term loans, and rates are high in real terms given Argentina's low rates of inflation. Banking penetration remains low and banking costs high. The Argentine banking sector is currently dominated by state-owned banks, with the largest being the Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina. In 2005, for the first time since the 2001 collapse, the banking system made a profit, according to a Central Bank report released in February 2006. The total profits amounted to 1,958 million pesos (more than $650 million).

In 2010, ACSO co-directed Operation Guava, aimed at \\"a significant terrorist plot\\". The aim of this ACSO action was to prevent the establishment of a jihadist training camp in Kashmir on land owned by one of the suspects. Operation Guava resulted in the 2012 conviction of Usman Khan, who went on to perpetrate the 2019 London Bridge stabbing. Structure The Specialist Operations Directorate comprises three Commands. = Protection Command = Protection Command response vehicle near Kensington Palace The Protection Command is led by a Commander overseen by a Deputy Assistant Commissioner. The command is responsible for protective security for high- profile governmental representatives of the United Kingdom or from the diplomatic community. As such it is analogous to the United States Secret Service or the Diplomatic Security Service. The command comprises two branches: *Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) provides personal protection for the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, Government ministers, ambassadors, visiting Heads of State and other individuals deemed to be at risk. RaSP also provide armed security at Royal Residences in London, Windsor and Scotland. The Special Escort Group (SEG) is also operated by Special Operations. *Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP) provides armed protection of embassies, missions and the Parliamentary Estate. They also provide residential protection for high-profile Government ministers and are responsible for access control and security at Downing Street and New Scotland Yard. PaDP was formed in April 2015, with the merger of the Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6) and the Palaces of Westminster Command (SO17). = Security Command = The Security Command is led by a Commander overseen by the same Deputy Assistant Commissioner as Protection Command. The command comprises two branches: * Aviation Policing (SOAP) provides armed policing and security for all passengers and staff travelling through Heathrow and London City Airport. Gatwick, Stansted and Luton are policed by Sussex, Essex and the Bedfordshire Police respectively, as they are not located in the Metropolitan Police area. * Protective Security Operations = Counter Terrorism Command = The Counter Terrorism Command (CTC) is led by Commander overseen by a Deputy Assistant Commissioner. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner is the concurrent National Police Chiefs' Council Senior National Coordinator for Counter Terrorism leading National Counter Terrorism Policing Network. The Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) is responsible for protecting London and the rest of the United Kingdom from the threat of terrorism. The Command operates against the threat of terrorism at a local, national and international level, and supports the National Counter Terrorism Network (the Regional Counter Terrorism Units and the National Police Chiefs' Council). The Command also has the national lead for domestic extremism in support of the National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit. The Command also deals with sensitive national security investigations, such as Official Secrets Act enquiries, the investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and politically motivated murders. It was created in 2006 through the merger of the Met's Anti-Terrorist Branch and Special Branch. =Previous structure until April 2015= Protection Command Until April 2015 Protection Command was split into three units that provide protection for ministers, the royal family, and for foreign embassies, diplomats, and visiting dignitaries: * Specialist Protection (SO1) ‚Äì Provided armed personal protection services for ministers, and public officials at threat from terrorism, including visiting heads of government and other public figures. In April 2015, it was merged with Royalty Protection, to form Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP). * Royalty Protection (SO14) ‚Äì Provided protection of the Monarch and other members of the Royal Family. The OCU is divided into Residential Protection, Personal and Close Protection, and the Special Escort Group (SEG), who provide mobile protection. In April 2015, it was merged with Specialist Protection, to form Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP). * Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6) ‚Äì Provided protection for foreign missions in London, including protecting embassies, and the residences of visiting heads of state, heads of government and ministers. In April 2015, it was merged with the Palace of Westminster Division, to form Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP). Security Command Until April 2015, the Security Command consisted of three units that provide protection of Parliament and the two airports within Greater London (Heathrow Airport and London City Airport), and organise security for major events in London. * Palace of Westminster Division (SO17) ‚Äì Was responsible for the protection of the Houses of Parliament, and consisted of a team of 500 people. Officers were unarmed. In April 2015 it was merged with the Diplomatic Protection Group, to form Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP). * Aviation Security Operational Command Unit (SO18); became Aviation Policing (SOAP). * Counter Terrorism Protective Security Command (SO20); remains unchanged. Counter Terrorism Command Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) has remained unchanged. Historical structure Owing to continual restructuring of the Metropolitan Police, only a few of the original SO units still exist in their original form and still use the SO designation. Where the SO designation has been reassigned to another unit, the units are listed in order * SO1 ‚Äì Specialist Protection (Now within the Protection Command) * SO2 ‚Äì Crime Support Branch/Department Support Group * SO3 ‚Äì Scenes of Crime Branch/Directorate of Forensic Services (Now part of the Specialist Crime Directorate as SCD4 Forensic Services) * SO4 ‚Äì National Identification Service * SO5 ‚Äì Miscellaneous Force Indexes/Child Protection (now SCD5 Child Abuse Investigation Team) * SO6 ‚Äì Fraud Squad (now SCD6 Economic and Specialist Crime) * SO7 ‚Äì Serious and Organised Crime (Renamed to Serious and Organised Crime Group, SCD7) * SO8 ‚Äì Forensic Science Laboratory * SO9 ‚Äì Flying Squad (Now in SCD7, but retains same name and role). * SO10 ‚Äì Crime Operations Group (now SCD10 Covert Policing) * SO11 ‚Äì Criminal Intelligence Branch (Renamed to Public Order Operational Command Unit, CO11) * SO12 ‚Äì Special Branch (Merged with SO13 to create the Counter Terrorism Command) * SO13 ‚Äì Anti-Terrorism Branch (Merged with SO12) * SO14 ‚Äì Royalty Protection Branch (Now within the Protection Command) * SO15 ‚Äì Counter Terrorism Command * SO16 ‚Äì Diplomatic Protection Group (Now within the Protection Command) * SO17 ‚Äì PNC Bureau (now the Police Information Technology Organisation) * SO18 ‚Äì Aviation Security/Airport Policing (Now Aviation Security Operational Command Unit within Security Command) * SO19 ‚Äì Force Firearms Unit (Specialist Firearms Command, SCO19) now CO19 * SO20 ‚Äì Forensic Medical Examiners Branch See also * Central Operations * Law enforcement in the United Kingdom * Territorial Operations References External links * Category:Metropolitan Police units Category:Counter-terrorism in the United Kingdom ","title":"Specialist Operations"},{"id":"2527655","text":"Demerara-Mahaica (Region 4) is a region of Guyana, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the region of Mahaica-Berbice to the east, the region of Upper Demerara-Berbice to the south and the region of Essequibo Islands-West Demerara to the west.

The 2001 Census estimated the population as 6,455, increasing dramatically to 13,553 at the 2011 census. History The area was originally part of the manor of Weston, listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the 73rd of the 107 holdingsThorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, Part 2 (notes), 17,73 of Juhel de Totnes (died 1123/30), Feudal baron of Totnes. It was later acquired by the Peverell family of Ermington in Devon, after which it became known as \\"Weston Peverell\\" to distinguish it from other similarly named places. It passed via the heiress Amicia Peverell to her husband Nicholas Carew (died 1311) of Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire and of Moulsford in Berkshire, the founder of the prominent and widespread Carew family of Devon and Cornwall.Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.333 (see Baron Carew, Earl of Totnes, Carew baronets) The manor of Weston Peverell was later subdivided. Description Two of the main roads are named Peverell Park Road and Weston Park Road. The area now consists mostly of Edwardian terraced houses, but also includes schools and a number of churches. Peverell borders Central Park, often known as \\"the green lung\\" of Plymouth which is a very popular recreational area for Plymothians. Peverell is seen by residents and real estate agents as a safe solid and central area with a good quality housing stock and few social problems. The terms on which the land was sold for development at the turn of the twentieth century stipulated that no licensed premises (pubs), should be built on the land, as the seller was a strict abstainer. This has resulted in the district having a residential atmosphere, with very few problems apart from traffic (and parking) problems associated with its proximity to the local football club, Plymouth Argyle.

As its name suggests, it was a prayer book used for Mass. It follows the tradition of the Dominican liturgy, which around the year 1330 was adopted as the official liturgy of the see of Turku. This poor bishopric could not afford to have its own missal printed, but its Dominican tradition came to the rescue. At the same time as the Missale Aboense was printed, a simultaneous printing appeared for the Dominican order's needs elsewhere in the Scandinavian countries. In the Missale Aboense the only main difference from this were the necessary local features of the Turku see in the calendar of saints. At that time there were no printing shops in Finland. (The first one was established in 1642.) The Missale was commissioned by Bishop Konrad Bitz from the L√ºbeck printer Bartholomeus Ghotan. Bitz dated his introduction to the book, Turku, 17 August 1488, and it was published in the same year. The Missale was printed on both parchment and paper. This firstborn of Finnish literature ran to some 550 folio pages. With regard to beauty of typography, it still competes successfully for a leading place among Finnish books. A facsimile edition of the work was brought out in 1971 and 1988.

The name ropivacaine refers to both the racemate and the marketed S-enantiomer. Ropivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Naropin. History Ropivacaine was developed after bupivacaine was noted to be associated with cardiac arrest, particularly in pregnant women. Ropivacaine was found to have less cardiotoxicity than bupivacaine in animal models. Clinical use =Contraindications= Ropivacaine is contraindicated for intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA). However, new data suggested both ropivacaine (1.2-1.8 mg/kg in 40ml) and levobupivacaine (40 ml of 0.125% solution) be used, because they have less cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity than racemic bupivacaine.(Basic of Anesthesia, Robert Stoelting, page 289) =Adverse effects= Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, however allergic reactions can rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of ropivacaine mainly result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects ‚Äì CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations.

He also was a Suhrawardi, a scholar of the traditional Islamic sciences, and foremost figure (together with his student Mulla Sadra) of the cultural renaissance of Iran undertaken under the Safavid dynasty. He was also the central founder of the School of Isfahan, noted by his students and admirers as the Third Teacher (mu'alim al- thalith) after Aristotle and al-Farabi. Philosophy His major contribution to Islamic philosophy was his novel formulation regarding gradations of time and the emanations of the separate categories of time as descending divine hypostases. He resolved the controversy of the createdness or uncreatedness of the world in time by proposing the notion of huduth-e-dahri (atemporal origination) as an explanation grounded in Avicennan and Suhrawardian categories, whilst transcending them. In brief, excepting God, he argued all things, including the earth and all heavenly bodies, share in both eternal and temporal origination. He influenced the revival of al-falsafa al-yamani (Philosophy of Yemen), a philosophy based on revelation and sayings of prophets rather than the rationalism of the Greeks, and he is widely recognized as the founder of the School of Isfahan, which embraced a theosophical outlook known as hikmat-i ilahi (divine wisdom). Mir Damad‚Äôs many treatises on Islamic philosophy include Taqwim al-Iman (Calendars of Faith, a treasure on creation and divine knowledge), the Kitab Qabasat al-Ilahiyah (Book of the Divine Embers of Fiery Kindling), wherein he lays out his concept of atemporal origination, Kitab al-Jadhawat and Sirat al-Mustaqim. He also wrote poetry under the pseudonym of Ishraq (Illumination). He also wrote a couple of books on mathematics, but with secondary importance. Among his many other students besides Mulla Sadra were Seyyed Ahmad-ibn-Reyn-al-A‚Äôbedin Alavi, Mohammad ibn Alireza ibn Agajanii, Qutb-al-Din Mohammad Ashkevari and Mulla Shams Gilani. Mir Damad's philosophical prose is often accounted as being among the most dense and obstrusely difficult of styles to understand, deliberately employing as well as coining convoluted philosophical terminology and neologisms that require systematic unpacking and detailed commentary. He was called Mir Damad (Groom of the King) because he married Shah Abbas's daughter and hence his fame was based on that event. Architecture Mir Damad was also the architect of the Masjide Shah (Shah Mosque) in Isfahan which employed highly advance mathematical calculations which required the knowledge of the speed of sound at that time. The geometry of the dome is as such that all sound dissipated from the base will echo in hundreds of carefully calculated and masterly executed interior corners of the dome which will ultimately collide in the center of the dome. The geometrical analysis of the dome is of absolute sophistication and the design of the dome is a magnificent piece of art and furthermore the construction of such dome in the 17th century to a precision where all sound waves must travel and collide in an imaginary point above.

() is a Belgian publisher of comic albums and magazines. Based in Marcinelle near Charleroi, Dupuis was founded in 1922 by Jean Dupuis, and is mostly famous for its comic albums and magazines. It is originally a French language publisher, but publishes many editions both in French and Dutch. Other language editions are mostly licensed to other publishers. Dupuis was for a long time a family business but was sold in the early 1980s and has since changed ownership a few times. Origin The growth of Dupuis towards becoming the leading comic book editor of Belgium started in 1938, when Dupuis added to its portfolio a men's magazine (Le moustique [the mosquito] in French, Humoradio in Dutch), a women's magazine (Bonnes Soir√©es [good evenings] in French, De Haardvriend [the hearth's friend] in Dutch) and the children's comics magazine Spirou. The latter was originally only in French, and contained a mixture of American comics (e.g. Superman, Brick Bradford, and Red Ryder) and new creations (Spirou et Fantasio and Tif et Tondu). A few months later, a Dutch edition called Robbedoes followed. Growth after WWII After some difficulties during the war (mainly because of the scarcity of paper towards the end of it, but also because American comics weren't allowed to be published anymore), Dupuis started to grow quickly. Le moustique became one of the leading magazines with information on radio and (later) television programs in Belgium, and Spirou was one of the two leading Franco-Belgian comics magazines (together with Tintin magazine). Dupuis started publishing some books as well, but had real success by republishing the comics that had appeared as serials in the magazine, collected as albums afterwards. Sometimes these were one shots, but mainly they came in series. Dupuis has some of the best-selling European comic series, including Lucky Luke, The Smurfs, Gaston Lagaffe and Largo Winch. Many of these comic albums have been reprinted constantly for thirty or forty years, thereby generating constant revenue for the editor. Stabilization and diversification In the early sixties, Dupuis started with other activities, including the merchandising of its comic series (puppets, posters, etc.), and the making of animated movies. Most of these weren't very successful but further raised the visibility of their comics. Still, towards the end of the 1960s, the golden age of Dupuis seemed to be over. Some of the magazines were struggling, the merchandising activities were vastly reduced, and the movie studio didn't seem to be producing any successful movies. But the core business, the comics and the main magazines, continued to be hugely successful, with a comics catalogue of more than 2000 titles available in French. Many of the series were turned into animated movies in the 1990s, including Papyrus and Spirou et Fantasio, and are being sold as movies and comics throughout Europe. Dupuis has also started producing computer games. In June 2004, Dupuis was bought by M√©dia-Participations, which now owns almost all major European comic book publishers, including Dargaud and Le Lombard, More recently, in 2015, Dupuis joined with twelve other European comics publishing actors to create Europe Comics, a digital initiative co-funded by the European Commission's Creative Europe program.

Working in the Victorian High Gothic and Queen Anne styles, he especially influenced the look of Portland. Beginnings in Bath Francis H. Fassett was born in Bath, Maine, the son of John Fassett and Betsey (Turner) Fassett. He was educated at the Old Erudition School until the age of fourteen, when he became a clerk in a general store. After four years, he was indentured to Isaac D. Cole, a leading carpenter and builder, to learn the trade. Serving his apprenticeship, Fassett then went into business for himself. He showed a natural aptitude for design, and from the beginning drew his own plans. When travelling, he learned a great deal about architecture from strolling through the cities he visited. After twenty years in Bath, he moved in 1864 to Portland, \\"...regarding that as presenting a wider field for his business.\\" Portland With a reputation for both ability and reliability, Fassett was well prepared for the rebuilding which following the Great Portland Fire of 1866. His designs for the city include the original Maine General Hospital Building, Alms House, Second Parish Church, the parish house for the Cathedral of St. Luke, and the former city hall, which itself would burn in 1908 and be replaced by the present building. He also designed numerous residences, many in the fashionable West End. During the 1870s, Fassett was the leading architect in both the city and state. Mount Pleasant House c. 1912, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire He married twice; first to Mima Ann Welch, who bore him four children, and then to Harriet Hudson. His son, Edward F.

Boccalini was born in Loreto, the son of an architect, he himself adopted that profession, and it appears that he commenced late in life to apply to literary pursuits. Pursuing his studies at Rome, he had the honor of teaching future Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio, and acquired the friendship of the cardinals Gaetano and Borghesi, as well as of other distinguished personages. By their influence he obtained posts, and was appointed (by Gregory XIII) governor of Benevento in the states of the church. Here, however, he seems to have acted imprudently, and he was soon recalled to Rome, where he shortly afterwards composed his most important work, the Ragguagli di Parnaso (News-sheet from Parnassus), in which Apollo is represented as receiving the complaints of all who present themselves, and distributing justice according to the merits of each particular case. The book is light and fantastic satire on the actions and writings of his eminent contemporaries, and some of its happier hits are among the hackneyed felicities of literature. To escape, it is said, from the hostility of those whom his shafts had wounded, he returned to Venice, and there, according to the register in the parochial church of Santa Maria Formosa, died of colic accompanied with fever on 16 November 1613. It was asserted by contemporary writers that he was beaten to death with sandbags by a band of Spanish bravadoes, but the story seems without foundation. At the same time, it is evident from the Pietra del Paragone, which appeared in 1615 after his death, that whatever the Spaniards felt towards him, he cherished against them the bitterest hostility. The only government which was exempt from his attacks is that of Venice, a city for which he seems to have had a special affection. The Ragguagli, first printed in 1612, has frequently been republished. It was inserted in the first publication of the Rosicrucians, as a preface to their Fama Fraternitatis (1614). The Pietra has been translated into French, German, English and Latin; the English translator was Henry, Earl of Monmouth, his version being entitled The Politicke Touchstone (London, 1674). Boccalini died in Venice on 16 November 1613. Another posthumous publication of Boccalini was his Commentarii sopra Cornelio Tacito (Geneva, 1669). Many of his manuscripts are preserved still unprinted.

The rules relate to legal proceedings in the courts of another state, not in a state's own courts. The rules developed at a time when it was thought to be an infringement of a state's sovereignty to bring proceedings against it or its officials in a foreign country. There is now a trend in various states towards substantial exceptions to the rule of immunity; in particular, a state can be sued when the dispute arises from a commercial transaction entered into by a state or some other \\"non-sovereign activity\\" of a state. The United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property, which as of 2015 is not yet in force, would re-formulate and harmonise the rules and their exceptions. It does not cover criminal proceedings and it does not allow civil (e.g. financial) actions for human rights abuses against state agents where the abuse has occurred in another country. Lord Atkin (d.1944) observed in the highest UK court in 1938: > The courts of a country will not impede a foreign sovereign, that is, they > will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal > proceedings whether the proceedings involve process against his person or > seek to recover from him specific property or damages.The Cristina [1938] AC > 485 at 490 The rule's wider implication is that a state and any sovereign, unless it chooses to waive its immunity, is immune to the jurisdiction of foreign courts and the enforcement of court orders. So jealously guarded is the law, traditionally the assertion of any such jurisdiction is considered impossible without the foreign power's consent. Arguments for and against exceptions Some commentators argue states should not be immune to cases relating to serious human rights abuses. They argue that fundamental human rights such as the right to life and the prohibition against torture should take precedence over rules of state immunity (in technical terms, they constitute norms of jus cogens). Others point out that state immunity should be the exception that warrants proper justification, without which state should be subject to liability. Opponents of this type of exception point out that civil actions brought by disgruntled individuals in one country against another state can have grave political and economic repercussions for both states; and civil proceedings can raise difficult issues of enforcement and extraterritorial jurisdiction. They argue a sovereign immunity exception should be made in each country's domestic law, so that country's definition of abuse, standard of proof, and rules of evidence apply. In practice Under customary international law, countries are normally immune from legal proceedings in another state.Akehurst's modern introduction to international law, by Peter Malanczuk, Michael Barton Akehurst, Routledge 7th ed., 1997, , Page 118 Sovereign immunity is sometimes available to countries in international courts and international arbitration; principally not however if acting more as contracting bodies (e.g. making agreements with regard to extracting oil and selling it) nor in boundaries matters. On 3 February 2012, in the case of Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening,Immunit√© juridictionelles de l'Etat (Allemagne, Italie, Gr√®ce) the International Court of Justice ruled by a majority of 12 to 3 (12-3) that all attempts by domestic courts, forums and tribunals attempting to supranationally apply jus cogens relating to international humanitarian law are overridden by state immunity. The case affirms case law from earlier decisions. The decision was criticized by some commentators for not embracing a nascent movement to waive immunity in cases of human rights violations. Others pointed out that the decision reflected the consensus of actual international custom and practice. The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court extends to current heads of state and government of states that are members of the court. Though cases might include acts that leaders take in their official capacities (such as ordering the country's military to commit genocide), they are prosecuted against individuals rather than the country's government as a whole. =United States= The 1812 U.S. Supreme Court decision The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon interpreted customary international law to bar a ship owner from suing to regain a vessel seized by the government of France, which had docked for repairs in Philadelphia. The 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act generally bars suits against foreign governments, except in cases where state immunity is waived; certain admiralty claims; or the suit involves commercial activity, a tort inside the United States (such as a traffic accident), or expropriation of property in violation of international law. Section 221 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 added an exception for U.S. victims of terrorism, for any government designated by the State Department as state sponsor of terrorism. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 added exceptions for torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, and hostage- taking.Public Law 110-18 In 2016, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act removed the requirement that a state sponsor of terrorism be officially listed, so that victim families of the September 11 attacks could sue Saudi Arabia. European Convention on State Immunity The European Convention on State Immunity was signed in Basel on May 16, 1972 and is currently in force in 8 countries: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands (for the European Netherlands), Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Five of those (Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland) also are parties to its Additional protocol, that establishes the European Tribunal in matters of State Immunity. United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property The United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property was adopted by the General Assembly on 2 December 2004 but is yet to come into force. The Convention was open for signature by all States until 17 January 2007 and may enter into force on the thirtieth day following the date of deposit of the thirtieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. As of 30 September 2015, there are 28 signatories to the Convention and 20 instruments of ratification have been deposited.

Her most famous work is her painting of the Electoral Commission of 1877. Biography Cornelia Adele Strong was born in Owasco, New York, the third of six children of Captain Walker Strong and Sarah Devoe Strong.Judy Bullington, \\"Cornelia Adele Fassett's Portrait of Martha J. Lambe\\", Woman's Art Journal, Autumn2002/Winter2003, Vol. 23 Issue 2, page 3 et seq. Cornelia married artist and photographer, Samuel Montague Fassett, in 1851. She then studied in New York City, with Scottish artist J.B. Wandesforde, who taughter her how to paint miniatures. Cornelia Fassett spent three years in both Paris and Rome studying under Giuseppe Castiglione, Henri Fantin La Tour, and Lambert Joseph Matthew. After an early career in Chicago, Fassett and her husband moved to Washington, D.C., in 1875, where she painted successful documentary portraits of notable government figures and he was photographer to the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. A year after their move, her 1876 group portrait of the Supreme Court justices was exhibited at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. After her death the Washington Post described Cornelia Fassett as \\"one of the best known artists and portrait painters in the United States.\\"Abraham Lincoln, The Civil War in Art website. Retrieved 2013-05-15. The Florida Case Before the Electoral Commission The Florida Case Before the Electoral Commission The Florida Case Before the Electoral Commission is a massive historical painting created by Fassett between 1877 and 1878.The Florida Case before the Electoral Commission, United States Senate (Paintings Collection). Retrieved 2013-05-15. It depicts an Electoral Commission's meeting in relation to the disputed U.S. presidential election of 1876. Fassett was not commissioned to produce the painting of the Electoral Commission‚Äôs 1877 meeting, but created it independently. She was able to set up a temporary studio in the U.S. Capitol‚Äôs Supreme Court Chamber, during the summers of 1877 and 1878 while the Court was not in session. The completed work, in oil paint on canvas, measured 75 inches in width and 60 inches in height. It was signed \\"C. Adele Fassett / 1879\\". The painting depicts 256 people, including 60 women some are wives and daughters, others are professionals (including 17 journalists in the gallery). Fassett also includes herself, as well as another female artist, Imogene Robinson Morrell and the writer Mary Clemmer Ames. Included in the painting were almost every person involved in the political crisis. Other prominent city figures were included too, for example James G. Blaine, who had unexpectedly lost the Republican nomination to Hayes. Banker and art collector William Wilson Corcoranis portrayed in the row just below the commissioners. Not all of the individuals depicted attended the hearings and Fassett based some of the characters on photographic portraits by Mathew Brady. Fassett‚Äôs painting is comparable to Samuel F.B. Morse‚Äôs much larger work, The Old House of Representatives, completed in 1822. Morse's work shows the House Chamber from the same viewpoint, though it includes almost three times fewer persons. While Fassett has to crowd her figures into receding rows, Morse was able to compose his people into groups. Fassett would have known Morse‚Äôs painting, because it had been publicly displayed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Fassett's painting attracted much criticism from the newspapers and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Congress eventually agreed to buy the painting seven years after its completion. They paid $7,500 (much less than was asked). The painting remains in the painting collection of the Supreme Court of the United States.  Portrait of Martha J. Lamb (1878)  Described as \\"one of her finest portraits\\". Fassett used Martha J. Lamb's home library, to showcase the literary figure, sitting her among stacks of books and Renaissance furnishings. In 1886, a writer for the New York Column, \\"Gossip of Noted Ladies\\" mentions that \\"One of the striking features of the study is a beautiful painting by Mrs. Fassett of Washington representing its interior and Mrs. Lamb seated in a large crimson armchair which throws into capital relief her fine face and handsome figure.\\" Originally the painting was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1878, but later moved to the New York Historical Society, where it remains today.

He is mentioned by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams, and by Sebastian Faulks in Human Traces. He coined the term hypnagogic hallucination and reported a dream that famously inspired Salvador Dal√≠'s painting Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening. Alfred Maury was contemporary with Hervey de Saint Denys and the two dream researchers were in disagreement with each other (Blanken & Meijer, 1988). He was born at Meaux. In 1836, having completed his education, he entered the Biblioth√®que Nationale, and afterwards the Biblioth√®que de l'Institut (1844), where he devoted himself to the study of archaeology, ancient and modern languages, medicine and law. Gifted with a great capacity for work, a remarkable memory and an unbiased and critical mind, he produced a number of learned pamphlets and books on the varied subjects. He rendered great service to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, of which he had been elected a member in 1857. Napoleon III employed him in research work connected with the Histoire de C√©sar, and he was rewarded, proportionately to his active, if modest, part in this work, with the positions of librarian of the Tuileries (1860), professor at the Coll√®ge de France (1862) and director-general of the Imperial Archives (1868). It was not, however, to the imperial favor that he owed these high positions. He used his influence for the advancement of science and higher education, and with Victor Duruy was one of the founders of the √âcole des Hautes Etudes. He died in Paris four years after his retirement from the last post. Bibliography His works are numerous: Les F√©es au Moyen √¢ge and Histoire des l√©gendes pieuses au Moyen √¢ge; two books filled with ingenious ideas, which were published in 1843, and reprinted after the death of the author, with numerous additions under the title Croyances et l√©gendes du Moyen √¢ge (1896); Histoire des grands forts de la Gaule et de l'ancienne France (1850, a 3rd ed. revised, appeared in 1867 under the title Les Forts de la Gaule et de l'ancienne France); La Terre et l'homme, a general historical sketch of geology, geography and ethnology, being the introduction to the Histoire universelle, by Victor Duruy (1854); Histoire des religions de la Gr√®ce antique, (3 vols., 1857‚Äì1859); La Magie et l'astrologie dans l'antiquit√© et dans le Moyen √¢ge (1863); Histoire de l'ancienne Acad√©mie des sciences (1864); Histoire de l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres (1865); a learned paper on the reports of French archaeology, written on the occasion of the Exposition Universelle (1867); a number of articles in the Encyclop√©die moderne (1846‚Äì1851), in Michaud's G√©ographie universelle (1858 and seq.), in the Journal des savants in the Revue des deux mondes (1873, 1877, 1879‚Äì1880, &c;).

After a break out 2000‚Äì01 season, Ben Dayan was called up to the Israel national football team by then manager, Richard M√∏ller Nielsen, for a friendly against Hungary. His most successful club season though was in 2001‚Äì02 when he started and helped the club win the Israel State Cup having not played a single fixture in the club's previous cup title. In 2002, Ben Dayan was transferred to Hapoel Petah Tikva where he would start each match but was unimpressive, usually being the first player substituted. He moved on to Hapoel Kfar Saba but after the club was relegated and Ben Dayan was left in 2003 looking for a new club in a little less than a year. Ben Dayan would head south to Be'er Sheva to join Hapoel for the 2003‚Äì04 season. There he would revive his career playing under Eli Guttman. This even led to him getting a second chance to play on the national team, but he only featured in two friendlies against Azerbaijan and Moldova.  Move to the United States  After two seasons in Be'er Sheva, Ben Dayan became the second Israeli ever to play in the United States' top football league, Major League Soccer, when he signed a one-year contract with Colorado Rapids (the other was Guy Melamed who was released on a free transfer shortly after Ben Dayan's arrival). When his first season ended, Ben Dayan had proven his worth to Colorado manager, Fernando Clavijo, and was signed to a three-year contract estimated at $120,000 per annum. During his time there, when Ben Dayan would score a goal for Colorado at INVESCO Field, he would generally run to his family in Colorado who would throw him the Israeli flag.  Return to Israel  Ben Dayan returned to Israel to play for Maccabi Netanya in August 2006. He stated that he asked to return due to the Second Lebanon War and wanted to be closer to his family. Following his return to Israeli soccer with Maccabi Netanya, it was noted by the media that his play had improved dramatically from the time he left for the MLS in 2005. When interviewed by reporters, Ben Dayan credited this improvement to the quicker pace and more physical game of the MLS, as well as its state of the art training facilities.

Scholars of religious studies classify it as a new religious movement. Developed in Europe during the early 20th century, its practitioners model it on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of the Iron Age and Early Middle Ages. In an attempt to reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably. Heathenry does not have a unified theology but is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these past societies, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The religion's deities and spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as bl√≥ts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably sei√∞r and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves. Other Heathens assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized. Heathenry's origins lie in the 19th- and early 20th-century Romanticism, which glorified the pre-Christian societies of Germanic Europe. V√∂lkisch groups actively venerating the deities of these societies appeared in Germany and Austria during the 1900s and 1910s, although they largely dissolved following Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II. In the 1970s, new Heathen groups established in Europe and North America, developing into formalized organizations. A central division within the Heathen movement emerged surrounding the issue of race. Older groups adopted a racialist attitude‚Äîoften termed \\"folkish\\" within the community‚Äîby viewing Heathenry as an ethnic or racial religion with inherent links to a Germanic race. They believe it should be reserved for white people, particularly of Northern European descent, and often combine the religion with white supremacist and far right-wing perspectives. A larger proportion of Heathens instead adopt a \\"universalist\\" perspective, holding that the religion is open to all, irrespective of origin. While the term Heathenry is used widely to describe the religion as a whole, many groups prefer different designations, influenced by their regional focus and ideological preferences. Heathens focusing on Scandinavian sources sometimes use √Åsatr√∫, Vanatr√∫, or Forn Sed; practitioners focusing on Anglo-Saxon traditions use Fyrnsidu or Theodism; those emphasising German traditions use Irminism; and those Heathens who espouse folkish and far-right perspectives tend to favor the terms Odinism, Wotanism, Wodenism, or Odalism. Scholarly estimates put the number of Heathens at no more than 20,000 worldwide, with communities of practitioners active in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. Definition Outdoor altar to mark alt=Two tables located in the snow. On the tables are various fruits and wooden quasi-anthropomorphic statues. Scholars of religious studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement, and more specifically as a reconstructionist form of modern Paganism. Heathenry has been defined as \\"a broad contemporary Pagan new religious movement (NRM) that is consciously inspired by the linguistically, culturally, and (in some definitions) ethnically 'Germanic' societies of Iron Age and early medieval Europe as they existed prior to Christianization\\", and as a \\"movement to revive and/or reinterpret for the present day the practices and worldviews of the pre-Christian cultures of northern Europe (or, more particularly, the Germanic speaking cultures)\\". Practitioners seek to revive these past belief systems by using surviving historical source materials. Among the historical sources used are Old Norse texts associated with Iceland such as the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda, Old English texts such as Beowulf, and Middle High German texts such as the Nibelungenlied. Some Heathens also adopt ideas from the archaeological evidence of pre-Christian Northern Europe and folklore from later periods in European history. Among many Heathens, this material is referred to as the \\"Lore\\" and studying it is an important part of their religion. Some textual sources nevertheless remain problematic as a means of \\"reconstructing\\" pre-Christian belief systems, because they were written by Christians and only discuss pre-Christian religion in a fragmentary and biased manner. The anthropologist Jenny Blain characterises Heathenry as \\"a religion constructed from partial material\\", while the religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska describes its beliefs as being \\"riddled with uncertainty and historical confusion\\", thereby characterising it as a postmodern movement. The ways in which Heathens use this historical and archaeological material differ; some seek to reconstruct past beliefs and practices as accurately as possible, while others openly experiment with this material and embrace new innovations. Some, for instance, adapt their practices according to \\"unverified personal gnosis\\" (UPG) that they have gained through spiritual experiences. Others adopt concepts from the world's surviving ethnic religions as well as modern polytheistic traditions such as Hinduism and Afro-American religions, believing that doing so helps to construct spiritual world-views akin to those that existed in Europe prior to Christianization. Some practitioners who emphasize an approach that relies exclusively on historical and archaeological sources criticize such attitudes, denigrating those who practice them using the pejorative term \\"Neo-Heathen\\". A 2009 rite performed on the Icelandic hill of alt=Eight people, all white, stand on heathland. Some of them are dressed in historical clothing akin to that worn in the medieval period. Some Heathens seek out common elements found throughout Germanic Europe during the Iron Age and Early Middle Ages, using those as the basis for their contemporary beliefs and practices. Conversely, others draw inspiration from the beliefs and practices of a specific geographical area and chronological period within Germanic Europe, such as Anglo-Saxon England or Viking Age Iceland. Some adherents are deeply knowledgeable as to the specifics of Northern European society in the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods; however for most practitioners their main source of information about the pre-Christian past is fictional literature and popular accounts of Norse mythology. Many express a romanticized view of this past, sometimes perpetuating misconceptions about it; the sociologist of religion Jennifer Snook noting that many practitioners \\"hearken back to a more epic, anachronistic, and pure age of ancestors and heroes\\". The anthropologist Murphy Pizza suggests that Heathenry can be understood as an \\"invented tradition\\". As the religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius states, despite the fact that \\"no real continuity\\" exists between Heathenry and the pre- Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, Heathen practitioners often dislike being considered adherents of a \\"new religion\\" or \\"modern invention\\" and thus prefer to depict theirs as a \\"traditional faith\\". Many practitioners avoid using the scholarly, etic term \\"reconstructionism\\" to describe their practices, preferring to characterize it as an \\"indigenous religion\\" with parallels to the traditional belief systems of the world's indigenous peoples. In claiming a sense of indigeneity, some Heathens‚Äîparticularly in the United States‚Äîattempt to frame themselves as the victims of Medieval Christian colonialism and imperialism. A 2015 survey of the Heathen community found equal numbers of practitioners (36%) regarding their religion as a reconstruction as those who regarded it as a direct continuation of ancient belief systems; only 22% acknowledged it to be modern but historically inspired, although this was the dominant interpretation among practitioners in Nordic countries. =Terminology= No central religious authority exists to impose a particular terminological designation on all practitioners. Hence, different Heathen groups have used different words to describe both their religion and themselves, with these terms often conveying meaning about their socio-political beliefs as well as the particular Germanic region of pre- Christian Europe from which they draw inspiration. Academics studying the religion have typically favoured the terms Heathenry and Heathenism to describe it, for the reason that these words are inclusive of all varieties of the movement. This term is the most commonly used option by practitioners in the United Kingdom, with growing usage in North America and elsewhere. These terms are based on the word heathen, attested as the Gothic haithn, which was adopted by Gothic Arian missionaries as the equivalent of both the Greek words Hellenis (Hellene, Greek) and ethnik√≥s ‚Äì \\"of a (foreign) people\\". The word was used by Early Medieval Christian writers in Germanic Europe to describe non- Christians; by using it, practitioners seek to reappropriate it from the Christians as a form of self-designation. Many practitioners favor the term Heathen over Pagan because the former term originated among Germanic languages, whereas Pagan has its origins in Latin. Heathen ritual space marked out by an engraved wooden pillar, located on alt=A thin wooden pillar located within woodland Further terms used in some academic contexts are contemporary Germanic Paganism and Germanic Neopaganism, although the latter is an \\"artificial term\\" developed by scholars with little use within the Heathen community. Alternately, Blain suggested the use of North European Paganism as an overarching scholarly term for the movement; Strmiska noted that this would also encompass those practitioners inspired by the belief systems of Northeastern Europe's linguistically Finnic and Slavic societies. He favored Modern Nordic Paganism, but accepted that this term excluded those Heathens who are particularly inspired by the pre-Christian belief systems of non- Nordic Germanic societies, such as the Anglo-Saxons and the Goths. Another name for the religion is the Icelandic √Åsatr√∫, which translates as \\"√Üsir belief\\"‚Äîthe √Üsir being a sub-set of deities in Norse mythology. This is more commonly rendered as Asatru in North America, with practitioners being known as Asatruar. This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the Nordic deities of Scandinavia, however is problematic as many self-identified Asatruar worship entities other than the √Üsir, such as the Vanir, valkyries, elves, and dwarfs. Although initially a popular term of designation among practitioners and academics, usage of √Åsatr√∫ has declined as the religion has aged. Other practitioners term their religion Vanatr√∫, meaning \\"those who honor the Vanir\\", or D√≠sitr√∫, meaning \\"those who honor the goddesses\\", depending on their particular theological emphasis. A small group of practitioners who venerate the J√∂tnar, refer to their tradition as Rokkatru. Although restricted especially to Scandinavia, since the mid-2000s a term that has grown in popularity is Forn Si√∞r or Forn Sed (\\"the old way\\"); this is also a term reappropriated from Christian usage, having previously been used in a derogatory sense to describe pre-Christian religion in the Old Norse Heimskringla. Other terms used within the community to describe their religion are the Northern Tradition, Norse Paganism, and Saxon Paganism, while in the first third of the 20th century, commonly used terms were German, Nordic, or Germanic Faith. Within the United States, groups emphasising a German- orientation have used Irminism, while those focusing on an Anglo-Saxon approach have used Fyrnsidu or Theodism. Many racialist-oriented Heathens prefer the terms Odinism or Wotanism to describe their religion. The England- based racialist group Woden's Folk favored Wodenism and Woden Folk-Religion, while another racialist group, the Heathen Front, favored the term Odalism, coined by Varg Vikernes, in reference to the odal rune. There is thus a general view that all those who use Odinism adopt an explicitly political, right-wing and racialist interpretation of the religion, while Asatru is used by more moderate Heathen groups, but no such clear division of these terms' usage exists in practice. Gregorius noted that Odinism was \\"highly problematic\\" because it implies that the god Odin‚Äîwho is adopted from Norse mythology‚Äîis central to these groups' theology, which is often not the case. Moreover, the term is also used by at least one non-racialist group, the British Odinshof, who utilise it in reference to their particular dedication to Odin. Beliefs =Gods and spirits= A detail from alt=A stone with various engravings upon it The historian of religion Mattias Gardell noted that there is \\"no unanimously accepted theology\\" within the Heathen movement. Several early Heathens like Guido von List found the polytheistic nature of pre-Christian religion embarrassing, and argued that in reality it had been monotheistic. Since the 1970s, such negative attitudes towards polytheism have changed. Today Heathenry is usually characterised as being polytheistic, exhibiting a theological structure which includes a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with adherents offering their allegiance and worship to some or all of them. Most practitioners are polytheistic realists, referring to themselves as \\"hard\\" or \\"true polytheists\\" and believing in the literal existence of the deities as individual entities. Others express a psychological interpretation of the divinities, viewing them for instance as symbols, Jungian archetypes or racial archetypes, with some who adopt this position deeming themselves to be atheists. Heathenry's deities are adopted from the pre-Christian belief systems found in the various societies of Germanic Europe; they include divinities like T√Ωr, Odin, Thor, Frigg and Freyja from Scandinavian sources, W≈çden, Thunor and ƒíostre from Anglo-Saxon sources, and figures such as Nehalennia from continental sources. Some practitioners adopt the belief, taken from Norse mythology, that there are two sets of deities, the √Üsir and the Vanir. Certain practitioners blend the different regions and times together, for instance using a mix of Old English and Old Norse names for the deities, while others keep them separate and only venerate deities from a particular region. Some groups focus their veneration on a particular deity; for instance, the Brotherhood of Wolves, a Czech Heathen group, center their worship on the deity Fenrir. Similarly, many practitioners in the U.S. adopt a particular patron deity for themselves, taking an oath of dedication to them known as fulltru√≠, and describe themselves as that entity's devotee using terms such as Thorsman or Odinsman. Heathen deities are not seen as perfect, omnipotent, or omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own strengths and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin to that of a family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights. In Heathen ritual practices, the deities are typically represented as godpoles, wooden shafts with anthropomorphic faces carved into them, although in other instances resin statues of the divinities are sometimes used. Many practitioners combine their polytheistic world-view with a pantheistic conception of the natural world as being sacred and imbued with a divine energy force permeating all life. Heathenry is animistic, with practitioners believing in nonhuman spirit persons commonly known as \\"wights\\" (v√¶ttir) that inhabit the world, each of whom is believed to have its own personality. Some of these are known as \\"land spirits\\" (landv√¶ttir) and inhabit different aspects of the landscape, living alongside humans, whom they can both help and hinder. Others are deemed to be household deities and live within the home, where they can be propitiated with offerings of food. Some Heathens interact with these entities and provide offerings to them more often than they do with the gods and goddesses. Wights are often identified with various creatures from Northwestern European folklore such as elves, dwarves, gnomes, and trolls. Some of these entities‚Äîsuch as the J√∂tunn of Norse mythology‚Äîare deemed to be baleful spirits; within the community it is often deemed taboo to provide offerings to them, however some practitioners still do so. Many Heathens also believe in and respect ancestral spirits, with ancestral veneration representing an important part of their religious practice. For Heathens, relationships with the ancestors are seen as grounding their own sense of identity and giving them strength from the past. =Cosmology and afterlife= Heathens commonly adopt a cosmology based on that found in Norse mythology‚ÄîNorse cosmology. As part of this framework, humanity's world‚Äîknown as Midgard‚Äîis regarded as just one of Nine Worlds, all of which are associated with a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarfs live on another realm, elves on another, j√∂tnar on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind. alt=A grassy area with stones arranged in an oval shape demarcating a burial area. In the distance can be seen trees and a hill. According to a common Heathen belief based on references in Old Norse sources, three female entities known as the Norns sit at the end of the world tree's root. These figures spin wyrd, which refers to the actions and interrelationships of all beings throughout the cosmos. In the community, these three figures are sometimes termed \\"Past, Present and Future\\", \\"Being, Becoming, and Obligation\\" or \\"Initiation, Becoming, Unfolding\\". It is believed that an individual can navigate through the wyrd, and thus, the Heathen worldview oscillates between concepts of free will and fatalism. Heathens also believe in a personal form of wyrd known as √∂rl√∂g. This is connected to an emphasis on luck, with Heathens in North America often believing that luck can be earned, passed down through the generations, or lost. Various Heathen groups adopt the Norse apocalyptic myth of Ragnar√∂k; few view it as a literal prophecy of future events. Instead, it is often treated as a symbolic warning of the danger that humanity faces if it acts unwisely in relation to both itself and the natural world. The death of the gods at Ragnar√∂k is often viewed as a reminder of the inevitability of death and the importance of living honorably and with integrity until one dies. Alternately, ethno-nationalist Heathens have interpreted Ragnar√∂k as a prophecy of a coming apocalypse in which the white race will overthrow who these Heathens perceive as their oppressors and establish a future society based on Heathen religion. The political scientist Jeffrey Kaplan believed that it was the \\"strongly millenarian and chialistic overtones\\" of Ragnar√∂k which helped convert white American racialists to the right wing of the Heathen movement. Some practitioners do not emphasize belief in an afterlife, instead stressing the importance of behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels to the realm of the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessr√∫mnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan. =Morality and ethics= A 2011 Heathen bl√≥t in alt=A man and a woman standing outdoors by a tree, wearing red and white robes In Heathenry, moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse sagas. Evoking a life-affirming ethos, Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor, courage, integrity, hospitality, and hard work, and strongly emphasize loyalty to family. It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word, particularly sworn oaths. There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility, and a common motto within the Heathen community is that \\"We are our deeds\\". Most Heathens reject the concept of sin and believe that guilt is a destructive rather than useful concept. Some Heathen communities have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), which is based largely on the H√°vam√°l from the Poetic Edda. This was first developed by the founders of the UK-based Odinic Rite in the 1970s, although it has spread internationally, with 77% of respondents to a 2015 survey of Heathens reporting its use in some form. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them as an attempt to imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. Their use is particularly unpopular in Nordic countries, and has been observed declining in the United States. Within the Heathen community of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor‚Äîin which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children‚Äîis also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender‚Äîvalues perceived as socially conservative in Western nations‚Äîit has been argued that American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca. A 2015 survey of the Heathen community nevertheless found that a greater percentage of Heathens were opposed to traditional gender rules than in favor of them, with this being particularly the case in Northern Europe. A 2010 outdoor altar at the Springbl√≥t at alt=A table on which fruits and some wooden icons are situated The sociologist Jennifer Snook noted that as with all religions, Heathenry is \\"intimately connected\\" to politics, with practitioners' political and religious beliefs influencing one another. As a result of the religion's emphasis on honoring the land and its wights, many Heathens take an interest in ecological issues, with many considering their faith to be a nature religion. Heathen groups have participated in tree planting, raising money to purchase woodland, and campaigning against the construction of a railway between London and the Channel Tunnel in Southeastern England. Many Germanic Neopagans are also concerned with the preservation of heritage sites, and some practitioners have expressed concern regarding archaeological excavation of prehistoric and Early Medieval burials, believing that it is disrespectful to the individuals interred, whom Heathens widely see as their ancestors. Ethical debates within the community also arise when some practitioners believe that the religious practices of certain co-religionists conflict with the religion's \\"conservative ideas of proper decorum\\". For instance, while many Heathens eschew worship of the Norse god Loki, deeming him a baleful wight, his gender-bending nature has made him attractive to many LGBT Heathens. Those who adopt the former perspective have thus criticized Lokeans as effeminate and sexually deviant. Views on homosexuality and LGBT rights remain a source of tension within the community. Some right-wing Heathen groups view homosexuality as being incompatible with a family-oriented ethos and thus censure same-sex sexual activity. Other groups legitimize openness toward LGBT practitioners by reference to the gender-bending actions of Thor and Odin in Norse mythology. There are, for instance, homosexual and transgender members of The Troth, a prominent U.S. Heathen organisation. Many Heathen groups in Northern Europe perform same-sex marriages, and a group of self-described \\"Homo-Heathens\\" marched in the 2008 Stockholm Pride carrying a statue of the god Freyr. Rites and practices In Anglophone countries, Heathen groups are typically called kindreds or hearths, or alternately sometimes as fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of between five and fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media. A 2015 survey found that the majority of Heathens identified as solitary practitioners, with Northern Europe constituting an exception to this; here, the majority of Heathens reported involvement in groups. Sunna, the two larger wooden idols Odin (left) and Frey (right). In front of them there are the three Norns, and in the front row a red Thor and other idols. In front of the cult images are two ritual hammers.alt=A wooden table indoors on which have been placed wooden icons Priests are often termed godhi, while priestesses are gydhja, adopting Old Norse terms meaning \\"god-man\\" and \\"god- woman\\" respectively, with the plural term being gothar. These individuals are rarely seen as intermediaries between practitioners and deities, instead having the role of facilitating and leading group ceremonies and being learned in the lore and traditions of the religion. Many kindreds believe that anyone can take on the position of priest, with members sharing organisational duties and taking turns in leading the rites. In other groups, it is considered necessary for the individual to gain formal credentials from an accredited Heathen organisation in order to be recognised as a priest. In a few groups‚Äîparticularly those of the early 20th century which operated as secret societies‚Äîthe priesthood is modelled on an initiatory system of ascending degrees akin to Freemasonry. Heathen rites often take place in non-public spaces, particularly in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a h√∂rg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs in different parts of the world. In 2014 the √Åsaheimur Temple was opened in Efri √Ås, Skagafj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, while in 2014 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens have done the same at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at √ûingvellir. Heathen groups assemble for rituals in order to mark rites of passage, seasonal observances, oath takings, rites devoted to a specific deity, and for rites of need. These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska noted that in Iceland, Heathen rituals had been deliberately constructed in an attempt to recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also space in which these rituals could reflect innovation, changing in order to suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners. In addition to meeting for ritual practices, many Heathen kindreds also organize study sessions to meet and discuss Medieval texts pertaining to pre-Christian religion; among U.S. Heathens, it is common to refer to theirs as a \\"religion with homework\\". During religious ceremonies, many adherents choose to wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, sometimes termed \\"garb\\". They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance. The most commonly used sign among Heathens is Mj√∂lnir, or Thor's hammer, which is worn as a pendant, featured in Heathen art, and used as a gesture in ritual. It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor, however is also often used as a symbol of Heathenism as a whole, in particular representing the resilience and vitality of the religion. Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the valknut, used to represent the god Odin or Woden. Practitioners also commonly decorate their material‚Äîand sometimes themselves, in the form of tattoos‚Äîwith runes, the alphabet used by Early Medieval Germanic languages. =Bl√≥t and sumbel= The most important religious rite for Heathens is called bl√≥t, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are provided to the gods. Bl√≥t typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated as part of the ritual itself. In other instances, the bl√≥t is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal bl√≥ts also serve as a form of group bonding. The Swedish Asatru Society holding a 2008 bl√≥t near to alt=Four figures in medieval period costume stand outside on a grassy area. The image is misty. In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, the term bl√≥t was at times applied to a form of animal sacrifice performed to thank the deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners or altogether rejected, due in part to the fact that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries. The Icelandic group √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ for instance explicitly rejects animal sacrifice.For example, the √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞'s website state that \\"We particularly reject the use of √Åsatr√∫ as a justification for supremacy ideology, militarism and animal sacrifice.\\" √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞. Online. In 2007 Strmiska noted that a \\"small but growing\\" number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of bl√≥t. Such Heathens conceive of the slaughtered animal as a gift to the gods, and sometimes also as a \\"traveller\\" who is taking a message to the deities. Groups who perform such sacrifices typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla: the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a sharp knife, and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed a bl√≥t in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice. Another common ritual in Heathenry is sumbel, also spelled symbel, a ritual drinking ceremony in which the gods are toasted. Sumbel often takes place following a bl√≥t. In the U.S., the sumbel commonly involves a drinking horn being filled with mead and passed among the assembled participants, who either drink from it directly, or pour some into their own drinking vessels to consume. During this process, toasts are made, as are verbal tributes to gods, heroes, and ancestors. Then, oaths and boasts (promises of future actions) might be made, both of which are considered binding on the speakers due to the sacred context of the sumbel ceremony. According to Snook, the sumbel has a strong social role, representing \\"a game of politicking, of socializing, cementing bonds of peace and friendship and forming new relationships\\" within the Heathen community. During her ethnographic research, Pizza observed an example of a sumbel that took place in Minnesota in 2006 with the purpose of involving Heathen children; rather than mead, the drinking horn contained apple juice, and the toasting accompanied the children taping pictures of apples to a poster of a tree that symbolized the apple tree of I√∞unn from Norse mythology. =Sei√∞r and galdr= One religious practice sometimes found in Heathenry is sei√∞r, which has been described as \\"a particular shamanic trance ritual complex\\", although the appropriateness of using \\"shamanism\\" to describe sei√∞r is debatable. Contemporary sei√∞r developed during the 1990s out of the wider Neo- Shamanic movement, with some practitioners studying the use of trance-states in other faiths, such as Umbanda, first. A prominent form is high-seat or oracular sei√∞r, which is based on the account of Gu√∞ri√∞r in Eir√≠ks saga. While such practices differ between groups, oracular sei√∞r typically involves a sei√∞r-worker sitting on a high seat while songs and chants are performed to invoke gods and wights. Drumming is then performed to induce an altered state of consciousness in the practitioner, who goes on a meditative journey in which they visualise travelling through the world tree to the realm of Hel. The assembled audience then provide questions for the sei√∞r-worker, with the latter offering replies based on information obtained in their trance-state. Some sei√∞r-practitioners make use of entheogenic substances as part of this practice; others explicitly oppose the use of any mind-altering drugs. A 2010 Heathen rite at the Storbuckasten boulder in alt=Two people with their backs to the viewer stand in front of a large boulder in the middle of woodland. One of the figures is pouring a liquid onto the ground. Not all Heathens practice sei√∞r; given its associations with both the ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. While there are heterosexual male practitioners, sei√∞r is largely associated with women and gay men, and a 2015 survey of Heathens found that women were more likely to have engaged in it than men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of sei√∞r which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward sei√∞r surrounds the lack of any criteria by which the community can determine whether the sei√∞r-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige. Galdr is another Heathen practice involving chanting or singing. As part of a galdr ceremony, runes or rune poems are also sometimes chanted, in order to create a communal mood and allow participants to enter into altered states of consciousness and request communication with deities. Some contemporary galdr chants and songs are influenced by Anglo- Saxon folk magical charms, such as √Ücerbot and the Nine Herbs Charm. These poems were originally written in a Christian context, although practitioners believe that they reflect themes present in pre-Christian, shamanistic religion, and thus re-appropriate and \\"Heathanise\\" them for contemporary usage. Some Heathens practice forms of divination using runes; as part of this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle, and read accordingly. In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life. It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc or the Younger Futhark. Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, with books on the subject being common in New Age bookstores. Some Heathens practice magic, but this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry because it was not a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe. =Festivals= alt=A crowd of people walking along an outdoor path. They are led by individuals in robes, and a number carry flag banners. Different Germanic Neopagan groups celebrate different festivals according to their cultural and religious focus. The most widely observed Heathen festivals are Winter Nights, Yule, and Sigrbl√≥t, all of which were listed in his Heimskringla and are thus of ancient origin. The first of these marks the start of winter in Northern Europe, while the second marks Midwinter, and the last marks the beginning of summer. Additional festivals are also marked by Heathen practice throughout the year. These often include days which commemorate individuals who fought against the Christianization of Northern Europe, or who led armies and settlers into new lands. Some Heathen groups hold festivals dedicated to a specific deity. Some Heathens celebrate the eight festivals found in the Wheel of the Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world. Heathen festivals can be held on the same day each year, however are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot. Racial issues The question of race represents a major source of division among Heathens, particularly in the United States. Within the Heathen community, one viewpoint holds that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposing position is that race is a social construct rooted in cultural heritage. In U.S. Heathen discourse, these viewpoints are described as the folkish and the universalist positions, respectively. These two factions‚Äîwhich Kaplan termed the \\"racialist\\" and \\"nonracialist\\" camps‚Äîoften clash, with Kaplan claiming that a \\"virtual civil war\\" existed between them within the American Heathen community. The universalist and folkish division has also spread to other countries; in contrast to North America and much of Northern Europe, discussions of race rarely arise among the Icelandic Heathen community as a result of the nation-state's predominantly ethnically homogeneous composition. A 2015 survey revealed a greater number of Heathens subscribed to universalist ideas than folkish ones. Contrasting with this binary division, Gardell divides Heathenry in the United States into three groups according to their stances on the issue of race: the \\"anti-racist\\" group which denounces any association between the religion and racial identity, the \\"radical racist\\" faction which sees it as the natural religion of the Aryan race that cannot rightly be followed by members of any other racial group, and the \\"ethnic\\" faction which seeks a middle-path by acknowledging the religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection with those of Northern European heritage. The religious studies scholar Egil Asprem deemed Gardell's threefold typology \\"indispensable in order to make sense of the diverging positions within the broader discourse\\" of Heathenry. The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein also adopted this tripartite division, although she referred to the groups as the \\"racial-religious\\", \\"a-racist\\", and \\"ethnicist\\" factions respectively. The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White instead returned to the dual division between the \\"universalist\\" and \\"folkish\\" groups, arguing that the latter could be subdivided among the \\"ethnicist\\" and \\"racial- religious\\" factions, both of whom \\"deem Heathenry to be a religion geared for a particular racial or ethno-cultural group (whether conceptualised as 'Nordic,' 'white,' or 'Aryan')\\". Altar for Haustbl√≥t in alt=An outdoor fire burning in front of a wooden post with an anthropomorphic face carved into the top Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist approach believe that the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, it can lead to the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Universalist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the √Üsir also did the same with Vanir, J√∂tun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race. The folkish sector of the movement deems Heathenry to be the indigenous religion of a biologically distinct Nordic race. Some practitioners explain this by asserting that the religion is intrinsically connected to the collective unconscious of this race, with prominent American Heathen Stephen McNallen developing this into a concept which he termed \\"metagenetics\\". McNallen and many others in the \\"ethnic\\" faction of Heathenry explicitly deny that they are racist, although Gardell noted that their views would be deemed racist under certain definitions of the word. Gardell considered many \\"ethnic\\" Heathens to be ethnic nationalists, and many folkish practitioners express disapproval of multiculturalism and the mixture of different races in modern Europe, advocating racial separatism. This group's discourse contains much talk of \\"ancestors\\" and \\"homelands\\", concepts that may be very vaguely defined. Those adopting the \\"ethnic\\" folkish position have been criticized by both universalist and ethno-centrist factions, the former deeming \\"ethnic\\" Heathenry a front for racism and the latter deeming its adherents race traitors for their failure to fully embrace white supremacism. Some folkish Heathens are white supremacists and explicit racists, representing a \\"radical racist\\" faction that favours the terms Odinism, Wotanism, and Wodenism. Kaplan stated that the \\"borderline separating racialist Odinism and National Socialism is exceedingly thin\\", adding that this racialist wing inhabited \\"the most distant reaches\\" of the modern Pagan movement. The historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke similarly stated that Odinism \\"represents the battlefront of racist paganism in support of a white Aryan revolutionary path\\". Practitioners in this sector of the religion have paid tribute to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, claimed that the white race is facing extinction at the hands of a Jewish world conspiracy, and rejected Christianity as a creation of the Jews. Several such groups, like the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA) and the Wolves of Vinland, are designated as hate groups by the U.S. Southern Poverty Law Center. Many in the inner circle of The Order, a white supremacist militant group active in the U.S. during the 1980s, described themselves as Odinists, and various racist Heathens have espoused the Fourteen Words slogan developed by the Wotanist and Order member David Lane. Some racist organisations, such as the Order of Nine Angles and the Black Order, combine elements of Heathenism with Satanism, although other racist Heathens, such as Wotansvolk's Ron McVan, have denounced the integration of these differing religious traditions. Ethno-centrist Heathens are heavily critical of their universalist counterparts, often declaring that the latter have been misled by New Age literature and political correctness. Snook stated that both mainstream media and early academic studies of American Heathenry had focused primarily on the racist elements within the movement, thus neglecting the religion's anti-racist wing. Many anti-racist practitioners have expressed frustration that Heathenry is misrepresented by some journalists and academics as a racist movement, using their online presence to stress their opposition to extreme-right politics. History =Romanticist and V√∂lkisch predecessors= alt=An elderly, bearded white man wearing glasses and a beret During the late 18th and 19th centuries, German Romanticism focused increasing attention on the pre-Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, with various Romanticist intellectuals expressing the opinion that these ancient religions were \\"more natural, organic and positive\\" than Christianity. Such an attitude was promoted by the scholarship of Romanticist intellectuals like Johann Gottfried Herder, Jacob Grimm, and Wilhelm Grimm. This development went in tandem with a growth in nationalism and the idea of the volk, contributing to the establishment of the V√∂lkisch movement in German-speaking Europe. Criticising the Jewish roots of Christianity, in 1900 the Germanist Ernst Wachler published a pamphlet calling for the revival of a racialized ancient German religion. Other writers such as Ludwig Fahrenkrog supported his claims, resulting in the formation of both the Bund fur Pers√∂nlichkeitskultur (League for the Culture of the Personality) and the Deutscher Orden in 1911 and then the Germanische-Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft (Germanic-German Religious Community) in 1912. Another development of Heathenry emerged within the occult v√∂lkisch movement known as Ariosophy. One of these v√∂lkisch Ariosophists was the Austrian occultist Guido von List, who established a religion that he termed \\"Wotanism\\", with an inner core that he referred to as \\"Armanism\\". List's Wotanism was based heavily on the Eddas, although over time it was increasingly influenced by the Theosophical Society's teachings. List's ideas were transmitted in Germany by prominent right-wingers, and adherents to his ideas were among the founders of the Reichshammerbund in Leipzig in 1912, and they included individuals who held key positions in the Germanenorden. The Thule Society founded by Rudolf von Sebottendorf developed from the Germanenorden, and it displayed a Theosophically-influenced interpretation of Norse mythology. alt=A middle-aged white man wearing a suit. He has a receding hairline and a large, bushy moustache. In 1933, the eclectic German Faith Movement (Deutsche Glaubensbewegung) was founded by the religious studies scholar Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, who wanted to unite these disparate Heathen groups. While active throughout the Nazi era, his hopes that his \\"German Faith\\" would be declared the official faith of Nazi Germany were thwarted. The Heathen movement probably never had more than a few thousand followers during its 1920s heyday, however it held the allegiance of many middle-class intellectuals, including journalists, artists, illustrators, scholars, and teachers, and thus exerted a wider influence on German society. The v√∂lkisch occultists‚Äîamong them Pagans like List and Christians like J√∂rg Lanz von Liebenfels‚Äî\\"contributed importantly to the mood of the Nazi era\\". Few had a direct influence on the Nazi Party leadership, with one prominent exception: Karl Maria Wiligut was both a friend and a key influence on the Schutzstaffel (SS) leader Heinrich Himmler. Wiligut professed ancestral-clairvoyant memories of ancient German society, proclaiming that \\"Wotanism\\" was in conflict with another ancient religion, \\"Irminenschaft\\", which was devoted to a messianic Germanic figure known as Krist, who was later wrongly transformed into the figure of Jesus. Many Heathen groups disbanded during the Nazi period, and they were only able to re-establish themselves after World War II, in West Germany, where freedom of religion had been re-established. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, there was a social stigma surrounding v√∂lkisch ideas and groups, along with a common perception that the mythologies of the pre-Christian Germanic societies had been tainted through their usage by the Nazi administration, an attitude that to some extent persisted into the 21st century. The v√∂lkisch movement also manifested itself in 1930s Norway within the milieu surrounding such groups as the Ragnarok Circle and Hans S. Jacobsen's Tidsskriftet Ragnarok journal. Prominent figures involved in this milieu were the writer Per Imerslund and the composer Geirr Tveitt, although it left no successors in post-war Norway. A variant of \\"Odinism\\" was developed by the Australian Alexander Rud Mills, who published The Odinist Religion (1930) and established the Anglecyn Church of Odin. Politically racialist, Mills viewed Odinism as a religion for what he considered to be the \\"British race\\", and he deemed it to be in a cosmic battle with the Judeo-Christian religion. Having formulated \\"his own unique blend\\" of Ariosophy, Mills was heavily influenced by von List's writings. Some of Heathenry's roots have also been traced back to the \\"back to nature\\" movement of the early 20th century, among them the Kibbo Kift and the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. =Modern development= alt=An elderly man wearing red and white robes standing in an open area In the early 1970s, Heathen organisations emerged in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely independently from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears. Heathenry emerged in the United States during the 1960s. In 1969 the Danish Heathen Else Christensen established the Odinist Fellowship at her home in the U.S. state of Florida. Heavily influenced by Mills' writings, she began publishing a magazine, The Odinist, which placed greater emphasis on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. Stephen McNallen first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the Asatru Free Assembly in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of neo-Nazis within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), an ethnically-oriented Heathen group headquartered in California. Meanwhile, Valgard Murray and his kindred in Arizona founded the √Åsatr√∫ Alliance (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the Vor Tru newsletter. In 1987, Stephen Flowers and James Chisholm founded The Troth, which was incorporated in Texas. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation. In Iceland, the influence of pre-Christian belief systems still pervaded the country's cultural heritage into the 20th century. There, farmer Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson founded the Heathen group √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ in 1972, which initially had 12 members. Beinteinsson served as Allsherjargodi (chief priest) until his death in 1993, when he was succeeded by Jormundur Ingi Hansen. As the group expanded in size, Hansen's leadership caused schisms, and to retain the unity of the movement, he stepped down and was replaced by Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson in 2003, by which time √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ had accumulated 777 members and played a visible role in Icelandic society. In England, the British Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite was established by John Yeowell in 1972. In 1992, Mark Mirabello published Odin Brotherhood, which claimed the existence of a secret society of Odinists; most British Heathens doubt its existence. alt=Three middle-aged white men sitting at a camping table outdoors In Sweden, the first Heathen groups developed in the 1970s; early examples included the Breidablikk-Gildet (Guild of Breidablikk) founded in 1975 and the Telge Fylking founded in 1987, the latter of which diverged from the former by emphasising a non-racialist interpretation of the religion. In 1994, the Sveriges Asatrosamfund (Swedish Asatru Assembly) was founded, growing to become the largest Heathen organisation in the country. The first Norwegian Heathen group, Blindern √Ösatrulag, was established as a student group at the University of Oslo in the mid-1980s, while the larger √Ösatrufellesskapet Bifrost was established in 1996; after a schism in that group, the Foreningen Forn Sed was formed in 1999. In Denmark, a small group was founded near to Copenhagen in 1986, however a wider Heathen movement would not appear until the 1990s, when a group calling itself Forn Si√∞r developed. In Germany, various groups were established that explicitly rejected their religion's v√∂lkisch and right-wing past, most notably Rabenclan (Raven's Clan) in 1994 and Nornirs √Ütt (Kin of the Norns) in 2005. Several foreign Heathen organisations also established a presence in the German Heathen scene; in 1994 the Odinic Rite Deutschland (Odinic Rite Germany) was founded, although it later declared its independence and became the Verein f√ºr germanisches Heidentum VfgH (Society for Germanic Paganism), while the Troth also created a German group, Eldaring, which declared its independence in 2000. The first organised Heathen groups in the Czech Republic emerged in the late 1990s. From 2000 to 2008, a Czech Heathen group that adopted a Pan-Germanic approach to the religion was active under the name of Heathen Hearts from Biohaemum. Heathen influences were apparent in forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed a longing for a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre‚Äîwhich emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s‚Äîcame to play an important role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. Heathen themes also appeared in the neofolk genre. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998. Demographics alt=Four individuals stand by an outdoor table. A tall stone wall is visible in the background. Adherents of Heathenry can be found in Europe, North America, and Australasia, with more recent communities also establishing in Latin America. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic cultural inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated that it was impossible to develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self- selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. Schnurbein noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60‚Äì70% male in their composition. On the basis of his sociological research, Joshua Marcus Cragle agreed that the religion contained a greater proportion of men than women, but observed that there was a more even balance between the two in Northern and Western Europe than in other regions. He also found that the Heathen community contained a greater percentage of transgender individuals, at 2%, than is estimated to be present in the wider population. Similarly, Cragle's research found a greater proportion of LGBT practitioners within Heathenry (21%) than wider society, although noted that the percentage was lower than in other forms of modern Paganism. Cragle also found that in every region except Latin America, the majority of Heathens were middle-aged, and that most were of European descent. Many Heathens cite a childhood interest in German folk tales or Norse myths as having led them to take an interest in Heathenry; others have instead attributed their introduction to depictions of Norse religion in popular culture. Some others claim to have involved themselves in the religion after experiencing direct revelation through dreams, which they interpret as having been provided by the gods. As with other religions, a sensation of \\"coming home\\" has also been reported by many Heathens who have converted to the movement, however Calico thought such a narrative was \\"not characteristic\\" of most U.S. Heathens. Pizza suggested that, on the basis of her research among the Heathen community in the American Midwest, that many Euro-American practitioners were motivated to join the movement both out of a desire to \\"find roots\\" within historical European cultures and to meet \\"a genuine need for spiritual connections and community\\". Cragle's 2015 survey indicated that 45% of Heathens had been raised as Christians, although 21% had previously had no religious affiliation or been atheists or agnostics. Practitioners typically live within Christian majority societies, however often state that Christianity has little to offer them. In referring to Heathens in the U.S., Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kristen Horton noted that practitioners \\"almost always formulate oppositional identities\\" to Christianity. Through her research, Schnurbein found that during the 1980s many Heathens in Europe had been motivated to join the religion in part by their own anti-Christian ethos, but that this attitude had become less prominent among the Heathen community as the significance of the Christian churches had declined in Western nations after that point. Conversely, in 2018 Calico noted that a \\"deep antipathy\\" to Christianity was still \\"quite close to the surface for many American Heathens\\", with anti-Christian sentiment often being expressed through humor in that community. Many Heathens are also involved in historical reenactment, focusing on the early medieval societies of Germanic Europe; others are critical of this practice, believing that it blurs the boundary between real life and fantasy. Some adherents also practice Heathenry in tandem with other Pagan religions, such as Wicca or Druidry, but many others look unfavorably on such religions for being too syncretic. =North America= A Heathen baby naming ceremony in British Columbia, Canada in 2010 The United States likely contains the largest Heathen community in the world. While deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the U.S., in the mid-1990s the sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that there were around 500 active practitioners in the country, with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement. He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the American Heathen community were white, male, and young. Most had at least an undergraduate degree, and worked in a mix of white collar and blue collar jobs. The Pagan Census project led by Helen A. Berger, Evan A. Leach, and Leigh S. Shaffer gained 60 responses from Heathens in the U.S. Of these respondents, 65% were male and 35% female, which Berger, Leach, and Shaffer noted was the \\"opposite\\" of the female majority trend within the rest of the country's Pagan community. The majority had a college education, but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community, and also had a lower median income. From her experience within the community, Snook concurred that the majority of American Heathens were male, adding that most were white and middle-aged, but believed that there had been a growth in the proportion of female Heathens in the U.S. since the mid-1990s. Subsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base; 10,000 to 20,000 according to McNallen in 2006, and 7,878 according to the 2014 census. In 2018, the scholar of religion Jefferson F. Calico suggested that it was likely there were between 8000 and 20,000 Heathens in the U.S. =Europe= In the United Kingdom Census 2001, 300 people registered as Heathen in England and Wales. Many Heathens followed the advice of the Pagan Federation (PF) and simply described themselves as \\"Pagan\\", while other Heathens did not specify their religious beliefs. In the 2011 census, 1,958 people self-identified as Heathen in England and Wales.Office for National Statistics, 11 December 2012, 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales. Accessed 12 December 2012. A 2009 bl√≥t held by Heathens in Iceland By 2003, the Icelandic Heathen organisation √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ had 777 members, by 2015, it reported 2,400 members, and by January 2017 it claimed 3,583 members, constituting just over 1% of the Icelandic population. In Iceland, Heathenry has an impact larger than the number of its adherents. Based on his experience researching Danish Heathens, Amster stated that while it was possible to obtain membership figures of Heathen organisations, it was \\"impossible to estimate\\" the number of unaffiliated solo practitioners. Conversely, in 2015, Gregorius estimated that there were at most a thousand Heathens in Sweden‚Äîboth affiliated and unaffiliated‚Äîhowever observed that practitioners often perceived their numbers as being several times higher than this. Although noting that there were no clear figures available for the gender balance within the community, he cited practitioners who claim that there are more men active within Swedish Heathen organisations. Schnurbein observed that most Heathens in Scandinavia were middle-class professionals aged between thirty and sixty. There are a small number of Heathens in Poland, where they have established a presence on social media. The majority of these Polish Heathens belong to the non-racist wing of the movement. There are also a few Heathens in the Slovenian Pagan scene, where they are outnumbered by practitioners of Slavic Native Faith. Exponents of Heathenry are also found on websites in Serbia. In Russia, several far-right groups merge elements from Heathenry with aspects adopted from Slavic Native Faith and Russian Orthodox Christianity. There are also several Heathens in the Israeli Pagan scene.

History  Located by the Tekhuri River, on the northern edge of the Colchian plain in Samegrelo, western Georgia, lie the ruins of Nokalakevi. Occupying approximately 20ha, the site was known to early Byzantine historians as Arch√¶opolis, and to the neighbouring Georgian (Kartlian) chroniclers as Tsikhegoji, or the fortress of Kuji ‚Äî a Colchian ruler or eristavi. The fortress is located 15 km from the modern town of Senaki on the Martvili road, and would have commanded an important crossing point of the river Tekhuri, at the junction with a strategic route that still winds through the neighbouring hills to Chkhorotsqu in central Samegrelo. Nokalakevi-Archaeopolis played a part in the major wars fought between the Byzantines and Sasanians in the South Caucasus during the sixth century AD. It was one of the key fortresses guarding Lazika (modern Mingrelia) from Sasanian, Persian and Iberian (East Georgian/Kartlian) attack. During the war of AD 540-562, the Persians' failure to take Nokalakevi-Archaeopolis from the Byzantines and the Laz eventually cost them control of Lazika. The early Byzantine defensive fortifications of Nokalakevi-Archaeopolis take advantage of the site's position within a loop of the river Tekhuri, which has carved a gorge through the local limestone to the west of the fortress. The steep and rugged terrain to the north of the site made the citadel established there almost unassailable. A wall connected this 'upper town' to the 'lower town' below, where excavations have revealed stone buildings of the fourth to sixth century AD. Beneath these late Roman period layers there is evidence of several earlier phases of occupation and abandonment, from the eighth to second centuries BC LOMITASHVILI, D. 1993.

It is based on a 1948 novel of the same name by Foster Fitz-Simons. The title comes from the type of tobacco grown in North Carolina after the American Civil War. According to Bright Leaves, a 2003 documentary film by Ross McElwee, the plot is loosely based on the rivalry of tobacco tycoons Washington Duke and John Harvey McElwee, the filmmaker's great-grandfather.  Plot  Brant Royle (Gary Cooper) returns to his hometown, (fictional) Kingsmont, North Carolina, to settle his uncle's estate. Many years before, powerful tobacco magnate and cigar-manufacturer Major Singleton (Donald Crisp) drove Brant and his father (now dead) out of town. Singleton foreclosed on the Royles because they grew the best bright leaf tobacco and because young Brant dared to fall in love with his daughter, Margaret (Patricia Neal). When Royle stops a runaway carriage driven by Margaret, she gives him a cool reception. His ardor remains undiminished. Bored and eager for excitement, she deliberately incites her father to confront Royle at the hotel. Inventor John Barton (Jeff Corey) needing financing for his revolutionary cigarette-rolling machine, sees the incident and approaches Royle. (Singleton dismissed the idea.) Royle has $40, a run-down cigarette factory‚Äîand a friend. Brant was Sonia Kovac's (Lauren Bacall) first love. Long ago, he gave her his father's chiming pocket watch. Once a cigarette girl,Before the invention of machines to do the job, cigars and cigarettes were manufactured by hand, usually by women and girl children, called ‚Äúcigarette girls.‚Äù The title character in the opera Carmen works in such a factory. In the 1920s, in Europe and the United States, ‚Äùcigarette girl‚Äù came to refer to a woman working in a speakeasy or nightclub who sold tobacco products, candy and other items from a large tray supported by a strap around her neck. Sonia has prospered by turning her late mother's house into a high-class bordello. Royle persuades her to invest in the machine, making her a partner. ‚ÄúI don't kiss partners,‚Äù Sonia says. Brant hires medicine showman Chris Malley (Jack Carson) after he comes up with a perfect slogan: ‚ÄúThe Royle Cigarette Company: Fit for a King.‚Äù Malley eventually becomes Royle's second in command. Barton's invention produces cigarettes at a fraction of the cost of hand rolling, and Royle's company grows by leaps and bounds. ‚ÄúSick of being treated like a lady‚Äù and aroused by the danger, Margaret leads Brant on. Brant comes hours late to Sonia's birthday party and tells her his plans, blind to the fact that she loves him. She goes to Europe. One by one, Royle takes over the big businesses, until only Singleton is left. Finally, he shows the Major that he has acquired his shares and his debts. Royle offers to give them back ... as a wedding present. Margaret tells Singleton that she will marry Royle, even though she does not love him, in order to save the family interests. He is appalled at her cold-blooded practicality and, blaming Royle, challenges the upstart to a duel in the hotel bar. Royle refuses, even when Singleton threatens to shoot him in cold blood: That would violate Singleton's code of honor. Singleton does shoot, wounding the unarmed man slightly. Disgraced, he commits suicide. Singleton's estate is worthless. Even Singleton House is mortgaged. Margaret refuses to sell the house: She will find a way. Royle comes to see her, to say that whatever hatred there was has gone with her father. She warns him to stay away from her. He replies that with him, she can have everything. They kiss. Royle buys out Barton, who goes to Detroit and the fledgling automobile business. Sonia returns from Europe, to a house beautifully refurbished by Malley, who proposes. Sonia believes Brant and Margaret are through, now that the Major is dead. Malley shows her the betrothal announcement. Margaret and Brant marry. Sonia's wedding gift is the pocketwatch. The Royles go abroad for a year. When they return, the business is in trouble and so is the marriage. Margaret refuses to share Royle's bed.It is not clear whether the marriage was ever consummated. Royle rips up a negligee that Margaret bought on their honeymoon in Paris, calling it a lie, but Margaret asks for a divorce, not an annulment. Headlines read ‚ÄúAttorney General to Smash Royle Inc.‚Äù over monopoly charges. Spending lavishly, Margaret has sold all the stock that Royle gave her. Malley says she has taken $2 million out of the company. Royle and Malley, who knew that Barton was behind the monopoly charges, learn that Margaret has been feeding Barton information. Brant confronts Margaret, who tells him she has schemed and planned to destroy him since the day her father was buried. Now she wants a divorce. Until the day he dies, Brant will remember the Singletons. She leaves; he sets the house on fire accidentally. He stops the fire brigade, crying ‚ÄúLet it burn!‚Äù At 4 a.m. on New Year's Day, 1900, Brant comes to Sonia to say goodbye and to apologize. She says he has killed the Brant Royle she loved. As to the business, he says Malley will handle it; Royle tobacco is so big now, it doesn't need him. Riding out of town, he pauses to listen to his father's watch.

It is part of the district of Ravensburg, in the western Allg√§u region and belongs to the administrative region (Regierungsbezirk) of T√ºbingen. Since the municipal reform of 1972, the consolidated Leutkirch urban area comprises the town of Leutkirch im Allg√§u itself and the former municipalities of Diepoldshofen, Friesenhofen, Gebrazhofen, Herlazhofen, Hofs, Reichenhofen, Winterstetten and Wuchzenhofen. History =Early history= Very few protohistoric settlement remains have been found in the Allg√§u region although a grave dating from the migration period has been found in the Leutkirch area. The area was probably settled by Alemanic tribes before the establishment of the Danube-Iller-Rhine limes during the Roman period. The town was created with the merger of the villages of Ufhofen and Mittelhofen and vestiges of those settlements were found under the old church of St. Martin. First mention of the church is found in a document of the Abbey of St. Gall dating back to 766. After the line of the local lord became extinct, the area was awarded to the counts of Bregenz and of Montfort. =Era of the Free Imperial City= In 1293, King Adolf of Nassau granted to Leutkirch the right to rule itself according to the Town Code of Lindau (Rechte der Stadt Lindau), thus effectively raising Leutkirch to the status of a Free Imperial City. For a while, the town continued to be ruled by a bailiff (Landvogt) appointed by the king. In 1311, there is mention for the first time of a town council (Rat) whose members are also the town judges. An elected b√ºrgermeister (mayor) chaired the town council from the 15th century. A so-called Committee of Twenty, representing the guilds, was also part of the governing structure. Eventually, the town council was to be composed of a magistrate (Amtmann), two mayors, three secret councillors and nine councillors. Location of the Free Imperial City in southeastern Swabia The main industry of the town then was the linen trade and the main weaver guild had a membership of 200 at one time. Their linen production was exported to Italy and Spain mostly. Leutkirch became a member of the Swabian League in 1488 and gained a seat and vote both in the League and in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). Like the majority of the other Free Imperial Cities, Leutkirch went through considerable internal strife during the Protestant Reformation. The town, officially Lutheran in 1546, adhered to the Augsburg Confession and later joined the Schmalkaldic League. There was a fierce dispute for several years between the Protestant magistrates of the town and the abbot of Weingarten Abbey for control over St. Martin‚Äôs parish church whose patron was the abbot. A compromise was reached in 1562: the Catholics kept the parish church while the Protestants took over the hospital‚Äôs church, which was expanded in 1589 and is now known as Memorial Church. Catholics therefore maintained a foothold and some rights in the Protestant city. In 1577 Leutkirch joined other Lutheran Free Imperial Cities in signing the Formula of Concord. Schloss Zeil overlooking Leutkirch, circa 1900. The palace of the counts of Waldburg was built just outside the territory of the Free Imperial City. The town suffered heavily during the Thirty Years' War and the number of inhabitants fell drastically. The post-war period was not easy as well and the debt of the town continued to increase. However, difficult economic times did not prevent the town's rulers from having a new baroque town hall (rathaus) built in 1740. The stucco ceiling by Johannes Sch√ºtz remains one of the main attractions of the town. From the Peace of Westphalia onward, Leutkirch was to remain one of the smallest and least conspicuous of the 50 Free Imperial Cities of the Empire. =End of the Free Imperial City of Leutkirch= In the course of the mediatisation of 1802-03, Leutkirch was not spared the fate of the great majority of the 50 Free Imperial Cities of the moribund Holy Roman Empire and lost its independence. The town was first annexed to the Duchy (later Kingdom) of Bavaria in 1803 before becoming part of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1810. =The Free Men of the Leutkircher Heath= All of the countryside surrounding the Free Imperial City of Leutkirch except on the northwest was designated a Free Imperial Village possessing Imperial Immediacy. This territory was known as the Free Men of the Leutkircher Heath (Freien auf Leutkircher Heide). By 1800, the Free Men were only one of five Imperial villages still remaining. It shared the fate of the City of Leutkirch and was occupied by Bavarian troops in 1803. Transport The city is the initial point of the Leutkirch-Memmingen railway.

After taking his degree in law at the University of Evora, he proceeded to Madrid, where he made acquaintance with Juan P√©rez de Montalb√°n, and thus obtained an introduction to the stage. He quickly displayed great cleverness in hitting the public taste, and many contemporaries of superior talent eagerly sought his aid as a collaborator. The earliest of his printed plays is La defensa de la F√® y Principe prodigioso (1651), and twelve more pieces were published in 1658. His popularity continued long after his death on January 4, 1689. Nevertheless, Matos Fragoso's dramas do not stand the test of reading. His emphatic preciosity and sophistical insistence on the point of honor are tedious and unconvincing; in La venganza en el despe√±o, in √Å lo que obliga un agravio, and in other plays, he merely recasts, albeit very adroitly, works by Lope de Vega.

Biography  Velasco was born in the town of Carri√≥n de los Condes, in the province of Palencia, in 1511. The son of a wealthy nobleman, Velasco received formal education at a young age. By 1547, he had become viceroy and leader of Spain's armed forces in the Kingdom of Navarre. Impressed with Velasco's achievements and loyalty to the Spanish crown, Emperor Charles V (King Charles I of Spain) sent him to New Spain, in 1550, to deal with problems in the Spanish colonies, among them slavery and the encomienda system. He was accompanied by his son, Luis de Velasco, marqu√©s de Salinas, himself a future viceroy of New Spain. Velasco replaced the previous viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza. Mendoza had been given his choice of the Viceroyalty of Mexico or of Peru, with Velasco to fill the other office. Velasco arrived at San Juan de Ul√∫a, New Spain on August 23, 1550. He spent the month of September in Puebla, while Mendoza was making his choice. Finally the two men decided to meet in Cholula, and there Mendoza chose Peru. On November 25, 1550, Velasco made his official entry into Mexico City, thus becoming Viceroy of New Spain. He served until his death there on July 31, 1564. Velasco helped the natives defend themselves against the abuses of gold-mining slave owners, and released 15,000 Indian slaves. On January 25, 1553, Velasco inaugurated the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. He commissioned the founding of the towns of San Miguel el Grande (now San Miguel de Allende), Durango (1563), San Felipe de Ixtlahuaca, and Nombre de Dios. He also instituted public services such as hospitals and law enforcement for the natives. In 1558, Mexico experienced its first large flood of the Spanish era, and afterwards an epidemic. The Viceroy did everything in his power to aid the many victims. Up to 1560, Velasco governed with unlimited authority. Although he had committed no abuses, in that year the Audiencia and other powerful Spaniards attempted to influence the emperor to limit the authority of the Viceroy by requiring prior authorization of his actions by the Audiencia. In his final years, Velasco focused his efforts on establishing settlements in Florida, exploring the Pacific Ocean and searching for more riches for the Empire. In 1559, Velasco sent a fleet of 13 ships under the command of Trist√°n de Luna y Arellano to establish settlements on the eastern coast of Florida. The expedition failed when the settlements were struck by hunger and quarrels with hostile native warriors. The Spaniards were forced to abandon them. In early 1564, Velasco commissioned Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi and Andr√©s de Urdaneta to lead an expedition across the Pacific to the Spice Islands, where Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543. Velasco died in 1564. At his death, it was found that instead of enriching himself in office, he had gone into debt out of his concern for the poor and the Indians. He was succeeded by Francisco Ceinos as interim viceroy in 1564, and by Gast√≥n de Peralta, marqu√©s de Falces as permanent viceroy in 1566.

The stories were written over a span of thirty years beginning in the early 1960s, without much regard for chronology or any particular scheme. Detailing the travails of Jame Retief in the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne (CDT), the stories have a base in Laumer's experiences in the United States Foreign Service, notably his time as vice consul in Burma in the 1950s. Reorganizations in the Foreign Service both before and after World War II were a source of considerable conflict at the time, as the diplomatic \\"old guard\\" were confronted with a new world situation and a new generation of diplomats, men like Laumer, who took a more pragmatic approach to the service. This conflict undoubtedly informs the Retief stories, in which stubborn and often ignorant superiors mired in bureaucracy cause him endless difficulties in the carrying out of his duties.Prologue The first Retief story, Diplomat At Arms, appeared in the magazine Fantastic Science Fiction Stories (volume 9, number 1) in January 1960. Algis Budrys noted that the name \\"Retief\\" is, approximately, \\"fighter pronounced backwards.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, February 1966, p. 137. History, skills and appearance Retief's physical appearance is rarely described and then only in the broadest of terms (for example, in Retief's War, it is stated that he is 6'3\\" tall), though his activities within the stories indicate that he is physically fit and quite athletic, with unusual upper-body strength. In the various stories, Retief can be found swimming, skiing, mountain climbing, scuba diving, combat driving, and piloting various types of air- and spacecraft. He also shows a wide knowledge of history, art, languages, and politics, usually beyond that of his superiors in the CDT. According to Jan Strnad, who adapted several Retief stories into a comic book series published by Mad Dog Comics in the mid-80s, Laumer informed him that he had always pictured Retief as having black hair, and looking somewhat like Cary Grant. Laumer also indicated that he was displeased with the covers of the mid-80s Baen Books reprintings of the Retief books, since they presented Retief as a blond-haired character. (The model for these book covers was Corbin Bernsen.) In many of the stories Retief is shown to have a taste for fine wine, though he doesn't hesitate to down a prospector's homemade booze if offered. He also enjoys fine cigars and fine food as well. One also notices that women in the storylines tend to fall for him even if they are already in relationships, and he behaves more like a gentleman than anyone while simultaneously being the most uncouth by disregarding Corps protocol. The origins of the character's name are likely South African: \\"Retief\\" is an Afrikaans surname common among the descendants of French Huguenots in South Africa. During an interview with Paul Walker (found in \\"Speaking of Science Fiction\\", 1972), Laumer states, > Inadvertently, I dredged the name Retief up from the depths of my > subconscious; I could taste the flavor of the name, but I couldn't quite put > my finger on it. I thought of various place names such as Tenerife and > Recife and finally Retief popped into my mind. Many years later, Jack > Gaughan pointed out to me that an actual historical character named Retief > had lived in South Africa and had been massacred by the Zulus and been > mentioned in an H. Rider Haggard novel, Marie. I had read the book but had > no conscious recollection of it. Themes In the course of the stories, Retief encounters and resolves problems, usually between multiple parties, on numerous worlds. Whether establishing new missions on alien worlds, dealing with the clash of self- determination with established interests, preventing war, or solving cultural clashes, the devil is in the detail. He is master of derring-do, a cunning, fast-thinking, smooth-talking, tough brawler, solving problems through the rapid application of clever dealing, judicious violence, and complete disregard for the directives of the Corps and his immediate superiors. In contrast, most of his fellow diplomats in the CDT are protocol-obsessed, petty, small-minded, arrogant, ignorant, cowardly, and notoriously corrupt. Naturally Retief's career in the CDT is often stalled and he is very poorly regarded by his peers. The only member of the CDT who has any respect whatsoever for Retief's resourcefulness (grudging though it may be) is Retief's immediate superior, a feckless, pencil-pushing career bureaucrat named Ben Magnan who often ends up in the field with Retief. Many stories begin with a quote from the official CDT history, praising the Corps' high- minded ideals and giving all the credit for the triumph in the following story to anyone other than Retief. Targets of bureaucratic and geo-political excess skewered by Laumer include hair-splitting diplomatic protocol (often represented by required dress -- the early late evening hemidemisemi- formalwear, for example), meaningless awards (the fig leaf with clusters), the Cold War (the alien race known as the Groaci are direct analogues to the USSR in many stories), and a panoply of excruciatingly nuanced facial expressions, catalogued by number in the official CDT handbook, and exemplified in the following quote: Reception Reviewing Galactic Diplomat, an early Retief collection, Algis Budrys reported that he \\"enjoyed the daylights out of this book, without for an instant being able to distinguish between one story and the next.\\" Theodore Sturgeon rather caustically dismissed the series in 1971, saying \\"I find nothing admirable or amusing about lies and double-dealing ... What slams the ultimate lid on the whole scam is Laumer/Retief's light-hearted callousness toward one species or another of funny little green niggers.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, January 1972, pp. 115-16. Connections to the Bolo series The Retief stories seem to have a loose connection to the Bolo stories, also created by Laumer. Several Retief stories make references to the Concordiat of the Bolo series (There are hints that the Concordiat had ceased to exist by the time of Retief). There are also brief references of technology mentioned in the Bolo works. In the Retief story \\"Courier\\", a Bolo tank makes an appearance. In \\"Cultural Exchange\\", Bolo Model WV/1 tractors are mentioned for strip mining. They are Continental Siege Units with half-megaton-per-second firepower‚Äîplus a blade added for demolition work. However, it is not known whether or not Laumer intended for both series to be treated as one universe, or just have similar elements.

Phillips worked in the National Health Service for seventeen years but became disillusioned with its tightening bureaucratic demands.An Interveiw With Adam Phillips, Jill Choder Goldman He currently divides his time between writing and his private practice in Notting Hill. For a number of years he was in a relationship with the academic Jacqueline Rose. He has been a visiting professor at the University of York English department since 2006. Literary presence Phillips is a regular contributor to the London Review of Books. He has been described by The Times as \\"the Martin Amis of British psychoanalysis\\" for his \\"brilliantly amusing and often profoundly unsettling\\"\\"The Other Freud (the Wild One); New Translation Aims to Free the Master From His Disciples' Obsessions\\".

He has published essays on a variety of themes, including the work of literary figures such as Charles Lamb, Walter Savage Landor and William Empson, as well as on philosophy and psychoanalysis; and has written Winnicott in the Fontana Modern Masters series.Phillips, Flirtation paratext He is deeply opposed to any attempt to defend psychoanalysis as a science or even as a field of academic study, rather than simply, as he puts it, \\"a set of stories about how we can nourish ourselves to keep faith with our belief in nourishment, our desire for desire\\"Adam Phillips, The Beast in the Nursery (London 1998)‚Äî\\"stories [that] will sustain our appetite, which is, by definition, our appetite for life.\\"Adam Phillips, The Beast in the Nursery (London 1998) p. 3 His influences include D.W.

The Open and Affirming program is administered by the UCC Open and Affirming Coalition, which supports congregations and other church settings as they consider the adoption of an ONA \\"covenant\\"Examples of Open and Affirming covenants and maintains the official registryMap of Open and Affirming churches of ONA congregations and ministries. The Coalition encourages UCC congregations, campus ministries, seminaries, regional bodies and other settings of the church to engage their members in serious study of sexual orientation and gender identity and to declare publicly their full welcome and inclusion of LGBTQ people. With more than 1,600 congregations, the UCC's ONA program is the largest of several LGBT-welcoming church movements in U.S. and Canadian churches. There is a similar \\"Open & Affirming\\" programOpen & Affirming Ministries in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). History In 1985 the United Church of Christ's General Synod adopted a resolution encouraging UCC congregations to welcome (or consider welcoming) gay, lesbian, and bisexual people after a time of dialogue, study and prayer. Following later General Synod resolutions affirming transgender members of the church, the welcome was extended so that, today, an ONA covenant typically welcomes members of any sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.UCC resolutions on LGBTQ justice An ONA church is expected to commit to the inclusion of LGBTQ members in the sacraments and ministries of the church, including marriage. The 1985 resolution had no legislative authority over individual congregations, which are autonomous, but set in motion a movement that spread rapidly throughout the church. The resolution allocated no funds to support an ONA program in the UCC's national office. As a result, the UCC Coalition for LGBT Concerns launched an ONA program in 1987, led by the Rev. Ann B. Day and Donna Enberg, which raised funds from individual contributors, sympathetic congregations and private foundations.History of the ONA movement To this day, the official registry of ONA congregations is managed by the Coalition (since renamed the Open and Affirming Coalition), a voluntary non-profit organization independent from the church's national office, although it works in close partnership with the UCC's national ministries. The Coalition publishes a wide range of resources to support congregations considering an ONA commitment and to help existing ONA churches build relationships with the LGBTQ community.Resources for Open and Affirming congregations New York City's Riverside Church, under the pastoral leadership of the late Rev. William Sloane Coffin, was the first in the UCC to be listed as Open and Affirming in 1987. According to the Coalition, more than 1,600 UCC congregations with 370,000 members (about 33 percent of all UCC churches) are listed as officially Open and Affirming as of December 2019. Twenty-one of the UCC's 38 regional conferences, most new church starts, all seven seminaries affiliated with the UCC and several UCC- related campus ministries have adopted ONA statements, or \\"covenants.\\" Other ministries in the UCC, like the Council for Health and Human Service Ministries and the Order of Corpus Christi have also adopted ONA covenants. Opposition In response to the perceived promotion of the ONA movement by denominational officials, 75 UCC congregations have identified themselves as \\"Faithful and Welcoming\\" by affirming the Lexington Confession (named for the North Carolina town where it was drafted), which affirms marriage as an relationship between a man and woman.Faithful and Welcoming churches See also * LGBT-affirming religious groups Notes External links *UCC Open and Affirming Coalition website *UCC LGBT Ministries *Open & Affirming website for Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Category:United Church of Christ Category:LGBT Christian organizations ","title":"Open and affirming"},{"id":"2527983","text":"Greenwich Millennium Village (GMV) is a mixed-tenure modern development on an urban village model located on the Greenwich Peninsula in Greenwich, in south- east London, and part of the Millennium Communities Programme under English Partnerships (now renamed Homes and Communities Agency).

It is primarily used in radio receivers to keep the receiver tuned to the frequency of the desired station. In radio communication, AFC is needed because, after the bandpass frequency of a receiver is tuned to the frequency of a transmitter, the two frequencies may drift apart, interrupting the reception. This can be caused by a poorly controlled transmitter frequency, but the most common cause is drift of the center bandpass frequency of the receiver, due to thermal or mechanical drift in the values of the electronic components. Assuming that a receiver is nearly tuned to the desired frequency, the AFC circuit in the receiver develops an error voltage proportional to the degree to which the receiver is mistuned. This error voltage is then fed back to the tuning circuit in such a way that the tuning error is reduced. In most frequency modulation (FM) detectors, an error voltage of this type is easily available. See Negative feedback. AFC was mainly used in radios and television sets around the mid-20th century. In the 1970s, receivers began to be designed using frequency synthesizer circuits, which synthesized the receiver's input frequency from a crystal oscillator using the vibrations of an ultra-stable quartz crystal. These maintained sufficiently stable frequencies that AFC's were no longer needed.

Avis Budget Group operates the Avis brand in South Africa, North America, South America, India, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2011, Avis announced it was acquiring Avis Europe plc, which had been a separate corporation licensing the Avis brand. Since the late 1970s, Avis has featured mainly General Motors (GM) vehicles such as Chevrolet and Cadillac, but today also rents popular non-GM brands including Ford and Toyota. Avis is a leading rental car provider to the commercial segment serving business travelers at major airports around the world, and to leisure travellers at off-airport locations. Many of the off- airport locations are franchised operations rather than company-owned and -operated, as is the case with most airport locations. Avis was the first car rental business to be located at an airport. In January 2013, the company agreed to acquire Zipcar for $491 million.

An engine control unit (ECU), also commonly called an engine control module (ECM) or powertrain control module (PCM), is a type of electronic control unit that controls a series of actuators on an internal combustion engine to ensure optimal engine performance. It does this by reading values from a multitude of sensors within the engine bay, interpreting the data using multidimensional performance maps (called lookup tables), and adjusting the engine actuators. Before ECUs, air‚Äìfuel mixture, ignition timing, and idle speed were mechanically set and dynamically controlled by mechanical and pneumatic means. If the ECU has control over the fuel lines, then it is referred to as an electronic engine management system (EEMS). The fuel injection system has the major role of controlling the engine's fuel supply. The whole mechanism of the EEMS is controlled by a stack of sensors and actuators.  Workings  = Control of air‚Äìfuel ratio = Most modern engines use some type of fuel injection to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based on a number of sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel or too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen or too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The throttle position sensor tells the ECU how far the throttle plate is opened when the accelerator (gas pedal) is pressed down. The mass air flow sensor measures the amount of air flowing into the engine through the throttle plate. The engine coolant temperature sensor measures whether the engine is warmed up or cool. If the engine is still cool, additional fuel will be injected. Air‚Äìfuel mixture control of carburetors with computers is designed with a similar principle, but a mixture control solenoid or stepper motor is incorporated in the float bowl of the carburetor. = Control of idle speed = Most engine systems have idle speed control built into the ECU. The engine RPM is monitored by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor- based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle. A full authority throttle control system may be used to control idle speed, provide cruise control functions and top speed limitation. It also monitors the ECU section for reliability. = Control of variable valve timing = Some engines have variable valve timing. In such an engine, the ECU controls the time in the engine cycle at which the valves open. The valves are usually opened sooner at higher speed than at lower speed. This can increase the flow of air into the cylinder, increasing power and fuel economy. = Electronic valve control = Experimental engines have been made and tested that have no camshaft, but have full electronic control of the intake and exhaust valve opening, valve closing and area of the valve opening. Such engines can be started and run without a starter motor for certain multi- cylinder engines equipped with precision timed electronic ignition and fuel injection. Such a static-start engine would provide the efficiency and pollution-reduction improvements of a mild hybrid-electric drive, but without the expense and complexity of an oversized starter motor. The first production engine of this type was invented (in 2002) and introduced (in 2009) by Italian automaker Fiat in the Alfa Romeo MiTo. Their Multiair engines use electronic valve control which dramatically improve torque and horsepower, while reducing fuel consumption as much as 15%. Basically, the valves are opened by hydraulic pumps, which are operated by the ECU. The valves can open several times per intake stroke, based on engine load. The ECU then decides how much fuel should be injected to optimize combustion. At steady load conditions, the valve opens, fuel is injected, and the valve closes. Under a sudden increase in throttle, the valve opens in the same intake stroke and a greater amount of fuel is injected. This allows immediate acceleration. For the next stroke, the ECU calculates engine load at the new, higher RPM, and decides how to open the valve: early or late, wide-open or half-open. The optimal opening and timing are always reached and combustion is as precise as possible. This, of course, is impossible with a normal camshaft, which opens the valve for the whole intake period, and always to full lift. The elimination of cams, lifters, rockers, and timing set reduces not only weight and bulk, but also friction. A significant portion of the power that an engine actually produces is used up just driving the valve train, compressing all those valve springs thousands of times a minute. Once more fully developed, electronic valve operation will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, could be made much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or \\"dead hole\\". Another even more significant advancement will be the elimination of the conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With electronic valve operation, it will be possible to control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.  Programmability  A special category of ECUs are those which are programmable; these units can be reprogrammed by the user. When modifying an engine to include aftermarket or upgrade components, stock ECUs may or may not be able to provide the correct type of control for the application(s) in which the engine may be used. To accommodate for engine modifications, a programmable ECU can be used in place of the factory-shipped ECU. Typical modifications that may require an ECU upgrade can include turbocharging, supercharging, or both, a naturally aspirated engine; fuel injection or spark plug upgrades, exhaust system modifications or upgrades, transmission upgrades, and so on. Programming an ECU typically requires interfacing the unit with a desktop or laptop computer; this interfacing is required so the programming computer can send complete engine tunings to the engine control unit as well as monitor the conditions of the engine in realtime. Connection typically used in this interface are either USB or serial. By modifying these values while monitoring the exhausts using a wide band lambda probe, engine tuning specialists can determine the optimal fuel flow specific to the engine speed's and throttle position. This process is often carried out at an engine performance facility. A dynamometer is typically found at these locations; these devices can provide engine tuning specialist useful information such as engine speed, power output, torque output, gear change events, and so on. Tuning specialists often utilize a chassis dynamometer for street and other high performance applications. Engine tuning parameters may include fuel injection volume, throttle-fuel volume mapping, gear shift mapping, and so forth. While the mentioned parameters are common, some ECUs may provide other variables in which a tuning software could potentially modify. These parameters include: * Anti-lag * Closed loop Lambda: Lets the ECU monitor a permanently installed lambda probe and modify the fueling to achieve the targeted air/fuel ratio desired. This is often the stoichiometric (ideal) air fuel ratio, which on traditional petrol (gasoline) powered vehicles this air-to-fuel ratio is 14.7:1. This can also be a much richer ratio for when the engine is under high load, or possibly a leaner ratio for when the engine is operating under low load cruise conditions for maximum fuel efficiency. * Gear control * Ignition timing * Launch control * Fuel pressure regulator * Rev limiter * Staged fuel injection * Transient fueling: Tells the ECU to add a specific amount of fuel when throttle is applied. This is referred to as \\"acceleration enrichment\\". * Variable cam timing * Wastegate control * Water temperature correction: Allows for additional fuel to be added when the engine is cold, such as in a winter cold- start scenario or when the engine is dangerously hot, to allow for additional cylinder cooling (though not in a very efficient manner, as an emergency only). A race-grade ECU is often equipped with a data logger to record all sensor data for later analysis. This can be useful for identifying engine stalls, misfires or other undesired behaviors during a race. The data logger usually has a capacity between 0.5 and 16 megabytes. In order to communicate with the driver, a race ECU can often be connected to a \\"data stack\\", which is a simple dashboard presenting the driver with the current RPM, speed and other basic engine data. These data stacks, which are almost always digital, talk to the ECU using one of several protocols including RS-232 or CANbus. Information is then relayed through the Data Link interface that usually located on the underneath of the steering column.  Sensors and actuators  Sensors for air flow, pressure, temperature, speed, exhaust oxygen, * knock and crank angle position sensor makes a very vital impact in EEMS. sensors *MAP: Manifold Absolute pressure. *IAT: Intake Air Temperature. *MAF: Mass of Air Flow. *CKP: Crank Shaft Position. *CMP: CAM Shaft position. *ECT: Engine coolant temperature. *O2: Oxygen sensor. *TP: throttle position. *VSS: Vehicle speed sensor. *Knock sensor *APP: Acceleration pedal position. *Refrigrant sensor  History  = Early designs = One of the earliest attempts to use such a unitized and automated device to manage multiple engine control functions simultaneously was the Kommandoger√§t created by BMW in 1939, for their 801 14-cylinder aviation radial engine. This device replaced the 6 controls used to initiate hard acceleration with one control in the 801 series-equipped aircraft. However, it had some problems: it would surge the engine, making close formation flying of the Fw 190 (Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wurger), a single- engine single-seat German fighter aircraft, somewhat difficult, and at first it switched supercharger gears harshly and at random, which could throw the aircraft into an extremely dangerous stall. The development of integrated circuits and microprocessors made engine control economically feasible in the 1970s. In the early 1970s, the Japanese electronics industry began producing integrated circuits and microcontrollers for engine control in Japanese automobiles. The Ford EEC (Electronic Engine Control) system, which utilized the Toshiba TLCS-12 microprocessor, went into mass production in 1975. = Hybrid digital designs = Hybrid digital or analog designs were popular in the mid-1980s. This used analog techniques to measure and process input parameters from the engine, then used a lookup table stored in a digital ROM chip to yield precomputed output values. Later systems compute these outputs dynamically. The ROM type of system is amenable to tuning if one knows the system well. The disadvantage of such systems is that the precomputed values are only optimal for an idealised, new engine. As the engine wears, the system may be less able to compensate compared to other designs.  Modern design  Modern ECUs use a microprocessor which can process the inputs from the engine sensors in real-time. An electronic control unit contains the hardware and software (firmware). The hardware consists of electronic components on a printed circuit board (PCB), ceramic substrate or a thin laminate substrate. The main component on this circuit board is a microcontroller chip (MCU). The software is stored in the microcontroller or other chips on the PCB., typically in EPROMs or flash memory so the CPU can be re-programmed by uploading updated code or replacing chips. This is also referred to as an (electronic) Engine Management System (EMS). ECU reference architecture Sophisticated engine management systems receive inputs from other sources, and control other parts of the engine; for instance, some variable valve timing systems are electronically controlled, and turbocharger waste gates can also be managed. They also may communicate with transmission control units or directly interface electronically controlled automatic transmissions, traction control systems, and the like. The Controller Area Network or CAN bus automotive network is often used to achieve communication between these devices. Modern ECUs sometimes include features such as cruise control, transmission control, anti-skid brake control, and anti-theft control, etc. General Motors' (GM) first ECUs had a small application of hybrid digital ECUs as a pilot program in 1979, but by 1980, all active programs were using microprocessor based systems. Due to the large ramp up of volume of ECUs that were produced to meet the Clean Air Act requirements for 1981, only one ECU model could be built for the 1981 model year.GM Emission Control Project Center - I Was There - GMnext The high volume ECU that was installed in GM vehicles from the first high volume year, 1981, onward was a modern microprocessor based system. GM moved rapidly to replace carburation with fuel injection as the preferred method of fuel delivery for vehicles it manufactured. This process first saw fruition in 1980 with fuel injected Cadillac engines, followed by the Pontiac 2.5L I4 \\"Iron Duke\\" and the Chevrolet 5.7L V8 L83 \\"Cross-Fire\\" engine powering the Chevrolet Corvette in 1982. The 1990 Cadillac Brougham powered by the Oldsmobile 5.0L V8 LV2 engine was the last carbureted passenger car manufactured for sale in the North American market (a 1992 Volkswagen Beetle model powered by a carbureted engine was available for purchase in Mexico but not offered for sale in the United States or Canada) and by 1991 GM was the last of the major US and Japanese automakers to abandon carburetion and manufacture all of its passenger cars exclusively with fuel injected engines. In 1988 Delco (GM's electronics division), had produced more than 28,000 ECUs per day, making it the world's largest producer of on-board digital control computers at the time.Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, The Atwood Legacy, Spring '89, page 25  Other applications  Such systems are used for many internal combustion engines in other applications. In aeronautical applications, the systems are known as \\"FADECs\\" (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls). This kind of electronic control is less common in piston-engined light fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters than in automobiles. This is due to the common configuration of a carbureted engine with a magneto ignition system that does not require electrical power generated by an alternator to run, which is considered a safety advantage.

At the , Port Victoria had a population of 345. Like many other coastal towns on the peninsula, it has a jetty and used to be a thriving port for the export of grain to England. Its anchorage is sheltered from westerly weather by nearby Wardang Island. The windjammers carrying the bagged grain called at Falmouth, England or Queenstown, Ireland for orders of where the grain was to be taken. Many of the smaller ports were visited only by coastal ketches and schooners. Port Victoria also had an anchorage offshore for the larger windjammers. These were loaded from the ketches which were in turn loaded at the jetty. The last working sailing ships visited in 1949. As a result, Port Victoria is known as the last of the windjammer ports. This era is illustrated in the Port Victoria Maritime Museum. It was formerly known as Wauraltee and was renamed as Port Victoria in 1940. Today, Port Victoria is predominantly a fishing town. Activity peaks during the holiday season. In literature Port Victoria was visited by English travel author Eric Newby in 1939, while he was crew in the 4-masted barque Moshulu. Sailors on the Moshulu, mostly Scandinavian in origin, referred to Port Victoria as \\"Port Veek\\", and it was their second Australian port-of-call after Port Lincoln; Newby did not have many complimentary things to say about the town, but he states that the inhabitants were \\"kind and hospitable\\". Moshulu was anchored off Port Victoria for just over a month, during which time she was loaded with 4,875 tons of grain - 59,000 bags which were manually loaded onto ketches at the jetty, ferried to Moshulu, and then manually loaded into Moshulu's holds. During the 1939 season, Olivebank, Pamir, Pommern and Viking were also loaded with grain at Port Victoria - some of these vessels now have streets in Port Victoria named after them. Newby wrote about his experiences on the round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book The Last Grain Race (1956), and several pictures of Port Victoria as it appeared in 1939 are included in his photo- essay of his voyage, Learning the Ropes. Port Victoria is also the setting for Phillip Gwynne's classic Young Adult novel Deadly, Unna? (1998) and its sequel Nukkin Ya (2000).

Established as a pastoral school in 1972, the seminary now provides a number of educational programs to prepare students for work in the Orthodox Church, as readers, choir directors, church school teachers, and clergy. History With the closing of the Russian school at Unalaska in 1917, the Church in Alaska lost its ability to provide formal training for church workers and clergy. In time the lack of an institution to provide education locally was felt by the Diocese of Alaska as the shortage of trained people increased. To correct this situation, in September 1972, the diocese approved a proposal by the Archpriest Joseph P. Kreta to establish a pastoral school, which was the only practical way of solving this problem. With the approval of the proposal by the diocesan council, the first semester of classes began on February 1, 1973. The classes were conducted in leased facilities at the Wildwood Station near Kenai, Alaska. This first class began with fourteen students. In August 1973, the Alaska State Department of Education recognized St. Herman‚Äôs Pastoral School as a diploma-granting institution. The search for a permanent campus led to the procuring property in Kodiak, near the Church of the Holy Resurrection. In 1974, all classes were moved to the new facilities. In February 1975, St. Herman‚Äôs was recognized by the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in America as a theological school within its seminary system. Then in 1976, the Holy Synod approved the renaming of St. Herman‚Äôs as a Theological Seminary. The seminary was subsequently authorized under the Alaska ordinances to grant degrees of Bachelor of Sacred Theology and Associate of Arts in Theological Studies. A continuing program is in place to keep pace with the growth of the student body and to maintain and rehabilitate the buildings on the campus. Recently, classes in advanced studies have been conducted at an Anchorage campus. Since the creation of the seminary, over 90% of the student body has been composed of indigenous Alaskans‚ÄîAleut, Athabascan, Thligit and Yupiq villagers‚Äîcoming to study at Saint Herman's from all over rural Alaska. Programs St. Herman‚Äôs Seminary offers a four-year program of theological, liturgical, patristics, and Biblical studies in a progression of one year programs. A one-year program is offered to prepare students to serve as readers and singers. This year is followed by a year of further Biblical studies, Church history and doctrine for teachers and catechists. As a diaconate program, the third year continues with classes in higher level theology and liturgical experience, and includes training in substance abuse counseling with a certification. A fourth year priestly formation program places emphasis on pastoral ministry and theological education and includes mentoring in prison and hospital ministry and in parish life and administration. All classes are held at the Kodiak campus.

Life Michael Tarchaniota Marullus was born to a family of Greek ancestry. His biography is rather obscure, he was born in either Constantinople or near the site of ancient Sparta in the Despotate of the Morea on the Peloponnese. His father was known as Manoli Marulo (ŒúŒ±ŒΩœéŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒ¨œÅŒøœÖŒªŒªŒøœÇ) and his mother was Euphrosyne Tarchaneiotissa (ŒïœÖœÜœÅŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ Œ§Œ±œÅœáŒ±ŒΩŒµŒπœéœÑŒπœÉœÉŒ±).

Both of Marullus's parents were Greek exiles who had fled from Constantinople when it fell to the Turks in 1453, and he always proudly called himself a Greek. Due to the Ottoman expansion in the 1460s, he fled with his parents to the Republic of Ragusa, where he spent his earliest years. From there, the family went further to Italy. He was educated in Italy, in Ancona, and also perhaps in Venice and Padua. Marullus travelled from city to city as a composer of Latin poetry and an ardent advocate of a crusade against the Ottoman Turks. In the 1470s, he fought as a common Stratioti against Turks in the Crimea. In order to liberate his subjugated homeland from domination he was willing to take up arms himself and allied with the king of France when he planned to go on a crusade. In Italy he served under the cavalry capatain Nicholas Rolla, a Lacedemonian.A New and general biographical dictionary, 1795, vol. VII, p. 145 Through his poetry, Marullus got in contact with many influential people of his time, including popes, kings and members of the Medici family. In Florence in 1494, he married the learned Alessandra Scala (1475‚Äì1506), daughter of Bartolomeo Scala. On 10 April 1500, after visiting with the humanist Raffaello Maffei in Volterra, he was riding in full armour to join the armed forces against Cesare Borgia when he drowned with his horse in the river Cecina near Volterra. The only substantial biography of Marullus is by Carol Kidwell. In Marullus, Soldier Poet of the Renaissance (London, 1989), she reveals the life of a soldier poet who roams exotic lands, composes poems at the borders of the Black Sea, and participates in a military campaign of Vlad the Impaler (the inspiration for Dracula). Yet Kidwell is not sensitive to the manipulative moves in Marullus's \\"autobiographical\\" poems. These, and their implications, have been explored in more detail by Karl Enenkel in his chapter on the poet (see Die Erfindung des Menschen: Die Autobiographik des fr√ºhneuzeitlichen Humanismus von Petrarca bis Lipsius (Berlin, 2008), pp. 368‚Äì428). Enenkel argues that it is improbable that Marullus was born in Constantinople. On the contrary, he suggests that the poet was born after the city fell to the Sultan in 1453. The French poet Pierre de Ronsard (1524‚Äì1585) considered Marullus as one of his teachers and dedicated an epitaph to him.Pierre de Ronsard, Oeuvres compl√®tes, Librairie A. Franck, Paris, 1866, Vol. 7, p. 238: Epitaph de Marulle, Capitaine et Po√´te Grec tres-excellent, natif de Constantinople. Works Marullus composed a large and varied collection of epigrams in four books. Some of his best love poems were later appropriated by Pierre de Ronsard and others. Marullus also composed a collection of hymns, the Hymni naturales, in which he celebrates the ancient Olympian pantheon. His Institutiones principales, or the education of princes, he left unfinished. An ardent reader of the Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius, he proposed some valuable emendations which were not published until 1513. Marullus's opera omnia were first edited by Alessandro Perosa in 1951. The Hymnes and the Institutiones are available in translation. Both works were translated in German by Otto Sch√∂nberger (W√ºrzburg 1996 and 1997). In addition, the Hymnes were translated in Italian by Donatella Coppini (Florence, 1995), and in French by Jacques Chomarat (Gen√®ve, 1995).

It is the capital city of the North Western Province and the Kurunegala District. Kurunegala was an ancient royal capital for 50 years, from the end of the 13th century to the start of the 14th century. It is at the junction of several main roads linking to other important parts of the country. It is about from Colombo, from Kandy and from Matale. Located at an altitude of above sea level, Kurunegala is surrounded by coconut plantations and rubber estates. There are eight very noticeable large rocks that encircle and dominate the city. Kurunegala's rocks rise from the plain below and have characteristic names, six of which come from the animals that they are imagined to represent. The largest among them is Ethagala or the \\"Elephant Rock\\" (though the translation is actually tusker), reaches . The shape of Ethagala resembles an elephant.  Etymology  Kurunegala has been named after the Elephant rock (‡∂á‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂ú‡∂Ω). \\"Kurune\\" means tusker or an elephant with protruding teeth and gala in Sinhala means rock. Kurunai means tusker or an Elephant and gal in Tamil means rock or hill. Kurunegala's old name was Hasthishaila-pura, which can be translated as 'The City of the Elephant Rock' in Sanskrit. In some ancient literature, the word Athugal-pura (‡∂á‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂ú‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑î‡∂ª) is employed to describe the city of Kurunegala. Nearby are three archeological cities ‚Äî Parakramapura (Panduvasnuwara, ‡∂¥‡∂¨‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂±‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∂ª) (northwest) with remains of a moated palace and monasteries from the 12th century, Dambadeniya (‡∂Ø‡∂π‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑í‡∂∫) (southwest, mid-13th century) and Yapahuwa (north). Kurunegala enjoys a pleasant location with huge rocky outcrops some of which have been given names of the animals they resemble: elephant rock, tortoise rock etc. According to folklore legend, a long time back the city had a severe drought. To exacerbate matters for humans, animals had threatened the city's storage capabilities by consuming huge amounts of water. A witch volunteered to alleviate the problem, transforming some of the animals magically into stone figures.  History  A statue of the Buddha on Athugala (Elephant Rock), measuring Clock Tower, Kurunegala Kurunegala had a citadel in the 13th century. Its ascendancy as an ancient capital of Sri Lanka began with a series of events that took place during the late 12th century at Yapahuwa. The sacred tooth relic which was in the Yapahuwa Kingdom was taken by an Aryacakravarti from the Jaffna Kingdom to the Pandyan country during the rule of Buwaneka Bahu I from 1272 to 1284.The tooth Relic of Lord Buddha The relic was brought back by King Parakrama Bahu III who ruled from Kurunegala between 1287 and 1293.Dumbara kings ‚Äì The Dambadeniya period Over the next half a century Kurunegala was the capital and the governing centre for three other kings of Sri Lanka. After the death of King Parakrama Bahu III, kings Buvanekabahu II (1293‚Äì1302) who was followed by Parakramabahu IV (1302‚Äì1326) ruled from Kurunegala. The ruler in Kurunegala from 1326 to 1335 was Buwaneka Bahu III alias Wanni Buwaneka Bahu. He was the son of Pandith Parakrama Bahu II and is believed to be the last king to rule the country from Kurunegala. After the reign of Buwaneka Bahu III, the newly throned king Vijayabahu V ruled from Dambadeniya and Yapahuwa from 1335 to 1341 before once again the kingdom of Sri Lanka shifted to Gampola. Few remains of the Palace of the Tooth relic that housed the tooth of the Buddha have avoided natural destruction, including few stone steps and a part of a doorway.

Biography Graham began her career during the 1960s as a band singer with the Cyclones in Scotland and later with the Cyril Stapleton Band, based in London England. She joined The Track in the mid-sixties and was a founding member of The Nocturnes, originally alongside Sandra Stevens (later of Brotherhood of Man) and then Lyn Paul (her future colleague in The New Seekers), recording for UK Columbia Records between 1967 and 1969. In 1969 she joined songwriter Roger Cooke for a single release, again on Columbia, called \\"Smiling Through My Tears\\" shortly before becoming a founder member of The New Seekers in 1969 and was lead singer on the majority of their early hits, including the world wide Number One hit ‚Äì \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\". Other songs that featured Graham as lead vocalist included the US and Canadian smash \\"Look What They've Done to My Song Ma\\", the British Top 5 hit \\"Circles\\", the Japanese No.1 \\"The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard\\" and the Roger Cook-Roger Greenaway composition \\"We've Got To Do It Now\\". Graham's three- octave range was showcased on several songs, most notably the British and European hit \\"Never Ending Song of Love\\", in which she reached No. 6. Though mainly a vocalist, she played acoustic guitar on stage in the Chuck Berry- influenced skiffle number \\"Good Old-Fashioned Music\\" and kazoo in the comic song \\"(Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut\\". In 1974, the group disbanded and Graham moved onto solo cabaret work, but rejoined a reconstituted New Seekers in 1976, and sang lead on their hits \\"It's So Nice To Have You Home\\" and \\"I Wanna Go Back\\". In 1978 she left once more, and again performed as a solo singer, as well as marrying another ex-New Seeker Kevin Finn (known professionally as Danny Finn) on 1 June 1979. They toured as a duo for many years and released one single \\"Ocean and Blue Sky\\". Graham retired in 2000 after a last charity performance, and originally said that she could not envisage being tempted out of retirement. However, in 2005, former New Seekers record producer David Mackay produced a new album with her The Mountains Welcome Me Home. It was released as a CD and DVD, and contained Scottish traditional songs and new recordings of New Seekers songs. A Christmas themed album, Til The Season Comes Round Again, followed in 2006. In 2008, she told The Independent newspaper that after the band broke up she found work fitting bras, in a branch of Debenhams department store in Essex. She lived in Abernethy, Perthshire with her husband, who worked for a kitchen and bathroom design company. He died on 22 February 2016 after a short illness. Graham told The Independent that owing to contractual problems she has not received any royalties since 1973.

He has authored and edited numerous books, and written for The New York Times, The Guardian, The Nation, Newsweek, and Al Jazeera. Much of his writing focuses on labor, the urban environment, and the organisation of work, from the Western world of business and high-technology to conditions of offshore labour in the Global South. Making use of social theory as well as ethnography, his writing questions the human and environmental cost of economic growth. Outside his field, Ross is known as a recipient of the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize for literature for his part in the Sokal hoax. Life and education Ross was born and educated in the lowlands of Scotland. After graduating from the University of Aberdeen in 1978, he worked in the North Sea oil fields. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 1984. He joined the faculty at Princeton University in 1985, and left in 1993 to become Director of the Graduate Program in American Studies at NYU. He was the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship in 2001-2002. and has held research positions at Cornell University and Shanghai University. Early writing His doctoral dissertation, about modern American poetry, was published as The Failure of Modernism in 1986. Several subsequent books (No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture; Strange Weather: Culture, Science, and Technology in the Age of Limits; and The Chicago Gangster Theory of Life: Nature's Debt to Society) established his reputation as one of the leading practitioners of cultural studies, particularly in the fields of popular culture, ecology, and the history of technology. Later writing Increasingly, his writing focused on urban sociology, labour, and the organisation of work. A scholar and activist associated with the anti- sweatshop movement, he published No Sweat: Fashion, Free Trade, and the Rights of Garment Workers in 1998 and Low Pay, High Profile: The Global Push for Fair Labor in 2002. In 1997, he took up residence for a year in Disney's new town of Celebration, Florida, and wrote The Celebration Chronicles, based on his participant observation of the town's residents, the first ethnography of a New Urbanist community. Two further books were based on field work with employees: No-Collar: The Humane Workplace and Its Hidden Costs, about employees in Internet companies during the New Economy boom and bust, and Fast Boat to China: Corporate Flight and the Consequences of Free Trade, about skilled Chinese employees of foreign firms in Shanghai and other Yangtze Delta cities. The latter book, written on the ground in China, is a frank alternative to Thomas Friedman's pro-outsourcing views on corporate globalisation. In 2009, Ross published Nice Work if You Can Get it: Life and Labor in Precarious Times, an analysis of changing patterns in the nature of creative work and contingent employment. In several of his books, Ross has pioneered a method he calls Scholarly Reporting, which is a blend of ethnography and investigative journalism. In Bird on Fire: Lessons from the World's Least Sustainable City, Ross draws on his fieldwork in Phoenix, Arizona. Focusing on areas such as water supply, metropolitan growth, renewable energy, downtown revitalisation, immigration policy, and patterns of pollution, the book argues that urban managers have to base policy on combating environmental injustices to avoid replicating the condition of \\"eco- apartheid\\" that prevails in Phoenix and other major urban areas. His most recent book, Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal, analyses, and proposes solutions to, the massive household debt burden that has accumulated over the last two decades. The book considers some of the legal and moral principles of the Jubilee South movement‚Äìaimed at repudiating external debts of developing countries‚Äìand adapts them to the situation of household debtors in the North. Creditocracy engages with ideas and actions from the Occupy movement of debt resistance to Wall Street's creditor class. In Richard Posner's 2003 study, Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline,Richard A. Posner, Public Intellectuals: A Study in Decline (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2001). Ross was ranked among the top 100 public intellectuals in the US. From 1986 to 2000, Ross served on the editorial collective of Duke University Press's journal Social Text. In 1996 he was one of the journal's editors who published a paper by Alan Sokal professing to show connections between physics and post-modern theory, and which was later revealed by Sokal to be a hoax meant to expose the low academic standards of \\"post-modernism\\" (see Sokal affair). Ross was among the editors of Social Text who were awarded the 1996 for Literature for his part in being taken in by the hoax. Ross's involvement in the Sokal hoax gave rise to criticism from outside the area of his academic specialisation. In an article in Nature, Richard Dawkins said \\"Ross has the boorish, tenured confidence to say things like, \\"I am glad to be rid of English departments. I hate literature, for one thing, and English departments tend to be full of people who love literature\\"; and the yahooish complacency to begin a book on 'science studies' with these words: \\"This book is dedicated to all of the science teachers I never had. It could only have been written without them.\\" Activism Ross has been active in the anti-sweatshop movement since the mid-1990s. From the late 1990s, he has turned his attention to the academic labour movement, both in the national AAUP, and at NYU as a vocal supporter of the graduate student union, and as a founding member of Faculty Democracy. In 2007, his co-edited volume, The University Against Itself, documented and analysed the long strike at NYU in 2005 by GSOC-UAW (The Graduate Student Organizing Committee). A founder of the Gulf Labor Coalition, he has helped to organise campaigns to raise migrant labour standards in the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, he edited an anthology of art and writing from Gulf Labor entitled, The Gulf: High Culture/Hard Labor. An early participant in Occupy Wall Street, he helped found the Occupy Student Debt Campaign and has been an integral member of the Occupy Debt Assembly and Strike Debt‚Äîa coalition formed in the summer of 2012 to help build a debtors' movement. Strike Debt produced the Debt Resisters' Operations Manual and organised the Rolling Jubilee. He is an active member of the Debt Collective, a prototype debtors' union. He also serves on the board of the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI). Ross has been critical of labor conditions in Abu Dhabi and similar fast-growth environments for a number of years.

It was designed in 1955-1957 by Nord Aviation, later A√©rospatiale. It was a derivative of the NORD SS-10 and SS-11 missiles which were surface-to-surface wire-guided missiles for use by infantry, vehicle or a helicopter primarily in the anti-tank role, but also anti-material, anti-personnel and against light field fortifications. The SS.12/AS.12 was basically a scaled-up version of the SS.11/AS.11, with a massive increase in range and warhead weight. The SS.12/AS.12 original mission was primarily to be anti-shipping from naval helicopters and combat aircraft or ground launchers, and secondarily for use against heavy field fortifications. The range and the destructive power of its warhead are roughly equivalent to a 5-inch artillery shell.Bill Gunston, ROCKETS & MISSILES, page 239-240, Salamander Books Ltd 1978 Development The SS.12 was originally intended to be a surface-to-surface weapon. A naval surface-to-surface version, the SS.12M was developed at the same time. Trials of the weapon began in 1956. An air-launched version, the AS.12, was trialed in 1957. Description The missile has a distinctive bulging nose and four clipped triangular wings. The missile has two solid fuel rocket motors. One is a powerful booster rocket that burns for 2.2 seconds, and the other is a sustainer motor that burns for 28 seconds. The booster motor exhausts through two nozzles on the sides near the trailing edge of the wingsnote - See first photo External Images and the sustainer motor exhaust is located in the missile rear at the centre. The wings are positioned at an angle of one degree to the direction of flight so that the missile spins, giving it stability. Two rearward-facing flares, which ignite on launch, make the missile more visible to the operator during flight. The two flares are mounted on the opposite side of the booster nozzles between the wings so as not to interfere with the two guidance wires spooling out of the rear section of the missile.not - third photo; External Images The missile steers using four metal vanes around the exhaust nozzle in a thrust vectoring system that directs the thrust of the sustainer motor exhaust nozzle. Steering signals are sent to the missile by means of two wires which pay out from two spools on the rear of the missile. A gas-operated arming mechanism is fed from the sustainer motor, arming the warhead 7.7 seconds after launch. The average maximum flight time of the missile is approximately 30 seconds, giving it a range of 7,000 metersJohn Norris, in Anti-tank weapons, p. 45, states the SS.12 has a maximum range of 6,000 meters according to whether it is ground-launched or air-launched. Operators train using the T10K simulator, which is a simple device that projects a beam of light on a predetermined path on a wall-mounted chart. The operator guides the light beam around the path by means of a small hand joystick, training to gain proficiency to position the beam just above the target five seconds before the end of flight, then gently flying the beam, which represents the missile's flight, down on to the target for final impact. The simulator closely resembles the missile's reaction to signal reception, which has an increasing time delay the further the missile travels. The missile can be fitted with a three different warheads: * OP3C - a semi-armour piercing warhead mainly for naval use * A shaped charge HEAT warhead for antitank * A fragmentation warhead for anti-personnel use The semi-armour piercing warhead has a delayed action allowing it to penetrate 20 mm of armour then travel two meters beyond before exploding. Service The AS.12 originally entered service with the French Navy in 1960 in the air-to-surface role against ships and submarines on the surface. In 1966 the French Navy made an evaluation of the SS.11(M) and SS.12(M) from the fast patrol boat La Combattante. In 1966, the Libyan Navy ordered three fast patrol boats from Vosper (Sebha, Sirte and Susa). Delivered in 1968, these were the first operational naval vessels to be armed with AS.12(M), with four launch rails on each side of the vessel's bridge.Jane's Fighting Ships 1976-77 page 214 The Libyan fast patrol boats proved to be a very low cost way to give long-range heavy firepower to small naval vessels. Other navies soon followed Libya and bought the SS.12(M) and SS.11(M) for their light naval vessels; among them Brunei, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Tunisia. Sweden bought the SS.12(M) (designated the Robot 54) as a heavier support for the SS.11(M) (designated Robot 52). NORD also developed a ten-missile trainable launcher for either the AS.11(M) or AS.12(M) which was sold in numbers due to its cost-effective firepower. The AS.12 saw action on both sides of the 1982 Falklands War. It was fired from Westland Wasp helicopters against the Argentine submarine . A total of nine missiles were fired at the submarine which was trapped on the surface and unable to dive after its dive tanks suffered damage from a depth charge attack by a British Royal Navy Wessex HAS.3 antisubmarine helicopter.Falklands Air War, Chris Hobson, , p.37 Of the missiles fired four hit, four missed and one failed to launch. Two of the missiles that hit the target failed to detonate on impact, instead punching a hole through the slender conning tower and exploding on the far side. In an unusual mission, it was fired from a British Royal Navy Wessex Hu.5 commando helicopter at Port Stanley town hall on 11 June 1982 in an attempt to disrupt a meeting of senior Argentine personnel that took place there every morning. Both missiles that were fired missed, one striking the roof of a police station and the other hitting some telegraph poles. Production of the SS.11/SS.12 series ceased some time in the 1980s; but in 1978 168,450 missiles had been produced.FLIGHT International 15 November 1980, page 1888 The AS.12 has been operational from the following aircraft: *Breguet Aliz√© *Lockheed P-2 Neptune *Breguet Atlantique *Westland Wasp *A√©rospatiale Alouette III *Hawker- Siddeley Nimrod *Westland Wessex Operators     * * - aboard Navy SH-3/AB-212ASW helicopters.

The term has various applications and meanings, and specific definitions can vary widely between denominations, geographical locations and different schools of thought. The terms Christian values and family values are often used as a euphemism for familialism by the Christian right. Christian values also relate to the Christian identity in identity politics.  Christian tenets  The core values of Christianity include: * Love of God and neighbors: \\"You shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might\\", an excerpt from the Shema Deut.6:5 (Matthew 22:37). This is the first half of the statement and the second half, given equal weight, is \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" upon which hang all the Law and all the prophets (Matthew 22:36-40). * Fidelity in marriage: \\"Whom God has joined together let no man put asunder\\" (Matthew 19:6) * Renunciation of worldly goods: \\"Gather not your riches up upon this earth, for there your heart will be also\\" (Matthew 6:21). * Renunciation of vengeance: \\"If a man strikes you on one cheek, turn the other cheek\\" (Luke 6:29). * Forgiveness of sins: \\"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us\\" (Matthew 6:12). * Unconditional love: \\"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\\" (Luke 6:27-28). Explicit directions in the New Testament text include: * Jesus' enumeration of the intention of the Ten Commandments contained in the Sermon on the Mount is considered a key component of Christian ethics and a fundamental recipe for Christian conduct for centuries. This large unified text was meant as a counter to the practices of the day that followed the letter of the law but denied the spirit of the law. * One of the characteristic contrasts between Christianity and its Jewish roots occurs along the axis of the Law. The Christian holds that for un-redeemed mankind it is impossible to follow any holy law at all and further holds that only regeneration makes it possible for an individual to start and persist not breaking at least some of the body of holy law. Within this context falls the only letter from the totality of New Testament authorship to the totality of the Christian church on that topic. It is also profoundly important to recognize that these are placeholders that refer to Old Testament texts which more completely elaborate what each means. Acts 15:20 enumerates the four things that Christianity requires abstinence from: 1) food sacrificed to idols; 2) blood; 3) meat of strangled animals; and 4) sexual immorality. These all were part of the practices included in the polytheism of Greek and Roman civilizations.  Modern use in worldwide conservative or right wing politics  In the 21st century United States, Australia, United Kingdom and other countries, the phrases Christian values and family values are used by Christian right and conservative parties to describe some or all of the following political stances: * Censorship of sexual content, especially in movies and on television.Gregory D. Black, Hollywood Censored, p. 39. \\"Daniel Lord drafted a Hollywood censorship code. What emerged was a fascinating combination of conservative politics, Catholic theology, and pop psychology.\\", Cambridge University Press, 1994, . * The desirability of laws against induced abortion. * Sexual abstinence outside marriage and abstinence-only sex education.\\"Geneva Declaration\\". \\"Marriage between a man and a woman forms the sole moral context for natural sexual union. Whether through pornography, promiscuity, incest or homosexuality, deviations from these sexual norms cannot truly satisfy the human spirits\\". * The promotion of intelligent design to be taught in public schools and colleges as an alternative to evolution.\\"Christianity, Intelligent Design, Evolutionary Theory Movements in the U.S. and the Sepration of Church and State\\". \\"Political commentators have noted the rise of the religious right during the presidency of George W. Bush. Though Christianity and politics have often been intertwined in American culture, the Bush administration funded faith-based initiatives more profoundly than any previous president. Moreover, President Bush remarked that he supported the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolutionary theory in public schools\\". * The desirability of laws against same-sex marriage. * Support for laws against the acceptance of homosexuality into mainstream society.\\"Why write about homosexuality?\\". \\"The Bible clearly condemns homosexuality as a sin and Christians who seriously follow God's Word must also condemn it as sin\\". * The desirability of organized school prayer in public schools.  Modern use in worldwide liberal or left wing politics  In the 21st century United States, Australia, United Kingdom and other countries, the phrases Christian values and family values are used by some liberal or social democratic political groups to describe some or all of the following political stances: * Support for a culture of empathy and compassion, seen as central to Christianity among a diverse range of religions and worldviews; favoring individuals, families (of all compositions) and small communities' interests over the interests of large corporations and the powerful. * Protection of the environment as the product of a deep reverence for God's creation. * The undesirability of war other than as a last resort and a respect for diplomacy (see swords to ploughshares). * Embrace inclusion and acceptance of immigrants and refugees. * A living wage for all and the right of workers to form trade unions as keeping with the solidaristic nature of man. * A high, progressive income tax to promote greater income equality in keeping with Jesus' words in support of the poor and against excessive riches. * Promoting \\"Render unto Caesar\\" as an endorsement of secular governance separation of church and state (secular laws do not affect or no relations with religious freedom, such as same-sex marriage; churches can reject holding weddings for same-sex couples) and religious tolerance, consistent with the concept of Christ's kingdom not being \\"of this world\\" and warnings against the hunger for potentially corrupting temporal power throughout the Bible.

History The Date family was founded in the early Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) by Isa Tomomune who originally came from the Isa district of Hitachi Province (now Ibaraki Prefecture), and was a descendant of Fujiwara no Uona (721‚Äì783) in the sixteenth generation. The family took its name from the Date district (now Date City in Fukushima Prefecture) of Mutsu Province which had been awarded in 1189 to Isa Tomomune by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first Kamakura sh≈çgun, for his assistance in the Genpei War and in Minamoto no Yoritomo's struggle for power with his brother, Minamoto no Yoshitsune. During the Nanboku-ch≈ç Wars in the 1330s, the Date supported the Imperial Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo through Kitabatake Akiie, who had been appointed Chinjufu Sh≈çgun or Commander in Chief of the Defense of the North, by the emperor. As warlords gained and lost power in the Sengoku period, trying to unite the country, the Date, along with a handful of other powerful families, did all they could to retain independence and dominance over their section of the land (in the case of the Date, the far north). Though not gaining the fame or power of the likes of Oda Nobunaga, Uesugi Kenshin, or Toyotomi Hideyoshi, they resisted the invasions of these warlords into the north. Date Masamune (1567‚Äì1636) contributed in particular to this effort, consolidating the families of the north into alliances against the major warlords. In 1589, Masamune with the help of former Ashina's samurai, Inawashiro Morikuni, seized the Aizu Domain of the Ashina at the Battle of Suriagehara; and he installed himself at Kurokawa Castle in Wakamatsu Province. However, the following year, Hideyoshi triumphed over the H≈çjo of Odawara; and Hideyoshi then obliged Masamune to be content with the fief of Yonezawa (300,000 koku). Masamune ultimately gained some degree of independence by supporting Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu granted the Date much of the north, and yet the Date were not fully trusted. Despite the Date contribution of reinforcements for the Tokugawa during the battle of Sekigahara, the Date were viewed as a threat. In the Edo period, the Date were identified as one of the tozama or outsider clans,Appert, Georges. (1888). Ancien Japon, p. 64. in contrast with the fudai or insider daimy≈ç clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan. In 1600, Ieyasu charged the Date to fight against Uesugi Kagekatsu; and, with the assistance of Mogami Yoshiteru, Masamune's forces defeated Naoe Kanetsugu. In recognition of this success in battle, Masamune was granted the fiefs in twelve districts which had been held until that time by the Uesugi clan. The Date established themselves at Sendai (620,000 koku). By 1658, Masamune changed the name of the Uesugi's castle at Iwatezawa to Sendai Castle. The feudal daimy≈ç were sometimes identified with the suffix \\"-k≈ç\\" (duke, ruler of the land), preceded by the name of a place or a castle, e.g., Sendai-k≈ç was one of the names by which Date Masamune was known.Plutschow, Herbert. (1995). Japan's Name Culture: The Significance of Names in a Religious, Political and Social Context, p. 44. Succession disputes erupted; there were a number of direct descendants of Masamune, and many kinsmen and hereditary vassals of the Date who resided nearby held estates of at least 10,000 koku, and thus had some influence. In 1660, Date Tsunamune was arrested in Edo, for drunkenness and debauchery; the charges were generally believed to have been true. Tsunamune was condemned to excavate the moats which encircled the sh≈çgun's Edo Castle. In 1660, he was ordered to supervise and pay for enhancing the north-east moat running from Megane-bashi to the Ushigome gate. The initial charges of licentious living are now believed to have been encouraged heavily by certain vassals and kinsmen in the north. These vassals and kinsmen appealed to the Council of Elders in Edo that Tsunamune should not be considered fit to rule, and that his son Date Tsunamura, great-grandson of Masamune, should become the daimy≈ç (lord) of the Date han (fief). Thus, Tsunamura became daimy≈ç, under the guardianship of his uncles, Date Munekatsu and Muneyoshi. Ten years of violence and conflict followed in the north, reaching a climax in 1671 when Aki Muneshige, a powerful relative of the Date, complained to the shogunate of the mismanagement of the fief under Tsunamura and his uncles. The episode that followed is so complex and dramatic as to warrant becoming a well-known story known as the Date S≈çd≈ç (Date Disturbance) and a theatrical play as well. Aki was summoned to Edo to argue his case before various councils and officials, and was involved in a number of interrogations, examinations and meetings, as were several other retainers of the Date. One retainer in particular, Harada Munesuke, was a supporter of Tsunamura and his uncles and, it is said, made a poor impression at Edo. At one point, Aki came upon Harada waiting to meet with some of the officials, and Aki began shouting insults. Swords were then drawn, and Aki was killed. Harada was killed moments after, by the officials or their guards. The official verdict was that Harada drew first; the Harada family was disbanded and though Tsunamura was affirmed as the proper daimy≈ç, his uncles were punished. Though the Date are most well known for their power in the north, Date Hidemune, the second son of Masamune, enjoyed a fief of 100,000 koku on Shikoku.

They claim descent from the Fujiwara clan. The branches of the tozama Date clan include the following: * The senior branch of the Date were daimy≈ç at Date in Mutsu province from the 12th century; and then, in 1601, they transferred the seat of their clan holdings to Sendai. From the early 17th century until 1868, the Date continued to hold Sendai Domain (620,000 koku) in Mutsu Province. The head of this Senior clan line was ennobled as an hereditary \\"Count\\" in the Meiji period. * This senior branch of the Date produced a nominal offshoot or \\"side branch\\". Date Tadamune (1599‚Äì1658), a son of Masamune, produced more than one son. Tadamune's second son, Muneyoshi, revived the name of Tamura, an ancient Mutsu family name which had been relinquished by Masamune. Date MuneyoshiScreech, Timon. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779‚Äì1822, p. 23. or Tamura Muneyoshi (1637‚Äì1678) settled himself at Ichinoseki domain (30,000 koku) in Mutsu Province (now in Iwate Prefecture), where his descendants resided up through 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as an hereditary \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * A cadet branch of the Date was created in 1614; and this clan line was established at Uwajima Domain (100,000 koku) in Iyo Province. Date Muneki (1817‚Äì1882) was a prominent member of this Cadet branch. He played an important role in the early days of the Meiji Restoration, and he was among the first to argue persistently for the suppression of shogunate powers. As The head of this clan line, Muneki and his heirs were ennobled as an hereditary \\"Marquis\\" in the Meiji period. * An additional cadet branch of the Date was created in 1657. In that year, a separate clan line was installed at Yoshida Castle (30,000 koku) in Iyo Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as an hereditary \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. =Clan temple in Edo= In the Edo period, T≈çzen-ji was considered the family temple of various clans, including the Date clan of Sendai.

Walters, Jr., Scientific Papers of the Bureau of Standards, No. 439 (Part of Vol. 18) \\"Sensitometry of Photographic Emulsions and a Survey of the Characteristics of Plates and Films of American Manufacture,\\" 1922. The next page starts with the H & D quote: \\"In a theoretically perfect negative, the amounts of silver deposited in the various parts are proportional to the logarithms of the intensities of light proceeding from the corresponding parts of the object.\\" The assumption here, based on empirical observations, is that the \\"amount of silver\\" is proportional to the optical density. Sensitometry is the scientific study of light-sensitive materials, especially photographic film. The study has its origins in the work by Ferdinand Hurter and Vero Charles Driffield (circa 1876) with early black-and-white emulsions.Hurter, Ferdinand & Driffield, Vero Charles (1890) Photochemical Investigations and a New Method of Determination of the Sensitiveness of Photographic Plates, J. Soc. Chem. Ind. May 31, 1890. They determined how the density of silver produced varied with the amount of light received, and the method and time of development.  Details  Plots of film density (log of opacity) versus the log of exposure are called characteristic curves, Hurter‚ÄìDriffield curves, H‚ÄìD curves, HD curves, H & D curves, D‚ÄìlogE curves, or D‚ÄìlogH curves. At moderate exposures, the overall shape is typically a bit like an \\"S\\" slanted so that its base and top are horizontal. There is usually a central region of the HD curve which approximates to a straight line, called the \\"linear\\" or \\"straight-line\\" portion; the slope of this region is called the gamma. The low end is called the \\"toe\\", and at the top, the curve rounds over to form the \\"shoulder\\". At extremely high exposures, the density may come back down, an effect known as solarisation. Different commercial film materials cover a gamma range from about 0.5 to about 5. Often it is not the original film that one views but a second or later generation. In these cases the end-to-end gamma is approximately the product of the separate gammas. Photographic paper prints have end-to-end gammas generally somewhat over 1. Projection transparencies for dark surround viewing have end-to-end gamma approximately 1.5. A full set of HD curves for a film shows how these vary with developer type and time.  Sensitometry and film in television  Conventional 35 mm. and 16 mm. motion picture films are widely used to supplement television programmes. They carry images which are visually similar to those used in the cinema. Continuous-tone images are derived from conventional motion picture cameras, whilst images built up in the form of line structures are derived from telerecordings. To synthesise a moving picture these films are projected at the rate of 25 frames per second‚Äîthe television picture frequency in Great Britain instead of 24 frames per second as in the motion picture industry. In America the television picture frequency is 30 frames per second and this raises considerable problems when conventional motion pictures which have been shot for the cinema at 24 frames per second are to be televised. Although films originally made for television in Great Britain (whether by telerecording or by conventional cinematography) will be photographed at 25 frames per second, films exposed for cinema exhibition at 24 frames per second are also transmitted for television at 25 frames per second. This naturally causes an increase in the speed of image movement and raises the frequency of sound reproduction by approximately 4 per cent. (this results in the pitch of musical notes rising by something less than a semi-tone and is acceptable to all but the most critical ear). Five types of film image are acceptable for television transmission: (1) conventional motion picture camera negatives, (2) conventional motion picture laboratory positive prints derived from (1), (3) telerecordings made by filming a cathode-ray tube display to produce a negative image, (4) telerecordings as in (3) but arranged to produce a direct positive image on the original telerecording camera film, (5) motion picture laboratory prints made from (3). Gamma-control amplifiers in television transmission equipment are capable of inverting the phase or contrast relationship of the signal‚Äîin practice this means that an incoming negative image can be electronically converted eventually to appear as a positive image displayed by the television receiver. This facility may also be employed during live studio transmissions, for special trick effects, and is not confined only to film work. Because of this it is not necessary to make prints from motion picture negatives before they can be utilised in television programmes although, for several reasons connected with programme acquisition and distribution, it often happens that positive film images are used. Furthermore, the presence of any dirt or dust on the film will appear as a white spot when negative is transmitted, but as a black spot if a positive film is transmitted. Since black spots are far less noticeable to the viewer, this is one strong reason for transmitting positive film images whenever possible. In television the original image passes through many stages before finally emerging as a recognisable picture but, in all cases, the film is ultimately projected via a telecine machine‚Äîthis is basically a special form of film projector in conjunction with a television camera. Telecine equipment scans the pictorial image information and creates an electrical version of the picture in terms of a television signal. This signal is eventually converted back into a recognisable picture when, at suitably modified strength, it energises the phosphor in the cathode-ray tube of the domestic receiver. Apart from the widely employed factors such as log-exposure, density, opacity and transmission, sensitometric control of film for television transmission is also particularly concerned with contrast ratios. The definition of contrast ratio is therefore re-stated as follows : 'The ratio between the opacities of the darkest and lightest points in the film image', thus: contrast ratio = Omax. / Omin. As we have already seen, opacity is not easily measured with standard photographic equipment‚Äîbut the logarithm of opacity is continually measured since, in fact, it is the unit of image saturation known as density. Since density is a logarithm we must take the ratio of the anti-logarithms of the maximum and minimum densities in the image in order to arrive at the contrast ratio. This may be written so: contrast ratio = antilog ( Dmax.‚Äî Dmin. ) If this is applied to the well-known B.B.C. Test Card 'C', we find that, in the positive film version of the card, the maximum density is 2‚Ä¢0 whilst the minimum density is 0‚Ä¢3. Therefore the contrast ratio is as follows: contrast ratio = antilog (2‚Ä¢0 ‚Äî 0‚Ä¢3) = antilog (1‚Ä¢7) = 50 Therefore contrast ratio = 50 : 1 (50 to 1). When applied to the negative film version of the same test card, the maximum density is 1‚Ä¢30 although the minimum density remains at 0‚Ä¢30. The contrast ratio of the negative is therefore as follows: contrast ratio = antilog (1‚Ä¢3-0‚Ä¢3) = antilog (1‚Ä¢0) = 10 Therefore contrast ratio = 10: 1 (10 to 1). Fig.1. Monochrome Telefilm Transmission. Figure 1 illustrates the several ways in which the viewer may receive monochrome television pictures. At the top of the diagram we see that an original scene is fed from the television camera during a live transmission via a video transmitter having a gamma value of 0‚Ä¢4. Since the cathode-ray tube in the domestic receiver has an effective gamma value of 2‚Ä¢5, the final screen picture will be at a gamma of 1‚Ä¢0‚Äîequal to the original scene. Film is used to supplement television programmes in two ways ; either originating as a telerecording or as a motion picture film. In any event it must pass through film processing and possibly printing equipment before reaching the telecine machine and, in all cases, the overall gamma for the entire film-using system must be 1‚Ä¢0 so that, for example, sections of film may be inter-cut with live transmissions. One example of this is, of course, the many sections of television newsfilm material rapidly intercut with live announcements by the newsreader. The telerecording film chain can be arranged to produce a direct negative-image film recording, a direct positive- image film recording, or a positive print can be made from the negative. In the first two cases we have the following four units in which local gamma or effective image contrast may be adjusted: The recording channel amplifier. The display cathode-ray tube. The negative and positive film processing. The telecine transmitting machine. Fig. 2. Combinations of gamma values in film chain. In the remaining case the gamma of the film printing machine and also of the positive film processing must also be accommodated. When motion picture films are made for television purposes the conditions shown at the foot of Figure 1 will apply. Here it is possible to transmit the negative film image directly by phase or contrast inversion, or to make a positive film copy and to transmit this instead, in either case the gamma of the films plus the telecine equipment must result in a product-gamma of unity. There are several ways of displaying the picture which is to be telerecorded; there are several types of film on which to make the recording; there are various types of telerecording cameras, some of which record a so-called suppressed-field image, whilst others record full information; finally, there are various types of telecine equipment, such as vidicon or flying-spot image transducers. It is quite impossible to discuss all the various techniques and fundamental principles of television equipment in a book of this nature; for similar reasons, it is not possible to quote one fixes set of gamma and density values which, one achieved, would satisfy each stage of the various combinations of equipment involved in the basic methods outlined in Figure 1. However, some idea of the variations which may be encountered is gained from the table on Figure 2. In system 'A' a telerecording negative is printed before final transmission and, by some standards, the recording amplifier gamma is high, the display tube and film print gammas are low and the final telecine gamma correction is somewhat high. By comparison, system 'C' employs a much lower recording amplifier gamma, higher display tube and print film gamma values, and a relatively lower telecine gamma correction.

He died in Valencia, and was buried in Valencia Cathedral on 22 December 1604. Marti joined the Valencian Academia de los noclurnos, under the name of Atrevimiento, but is best known by another pseudonym, Mateo Luj√°n de Sayavedra, under which he issued an apocryphal continuation (1602) of Alem√°n's Guzm√°n de Alfarache (1599).Ignacio Arellano Autores espa√±oles Page 80 - 1991 \\"En 1604, en Lisboa, public√≥ Alem√°n su Segunda parte de la vida del p√≠caro Guzm√°n de Alfarache, atalaya de la vida ... escrita por el abogado valenciano Juan Jos√© Mart√≠ (1570-1604), pero firmada por un tal \\"Mateo Luj√°n de Sayavedra\\" \\" Marti obtained access to Alem√°n's unfinished manuscript, and stole some of his ideas; this dishonesty lends point to the sarcastic congratulations which Alem√°n, in the genuine sequel (1604) pays to his rival's sallies: \\"I greatly envy them, and should be proud that they were mine.\\"Dictionary of the Literature of the Iberian Peninsula: L-z - Page 1286 Germ√°n Bleiberg, Maureen Ihrie, Janet W..

Because of its vast and rich collection of Chinese landscapes and architecture, the Mountain Resort in many ways is a culmination of all the variety of gardens, pagodas, temples and palaces from various regions of China. It is one of China's four famous gardens, World Heritage Site, national relic protection unit and Class 5A Tourist Attractions in China. History Qing dynasty map of the resort Built between 1703 and 1792 during the Qing dynasty, the Mountain Resort took 89 years to complete. It covers a total area of , almost half of Chengde's urban area. It is a vast complex of palaces and administrative and ceremonial buildings. Temples of various architectural styles and imperial gardens blend harmoniously into a landscape of lakes, pastureland and forests. The Kangxi, Qianlong and Jiaqing emperors often spent several months a year here to escape the summer heat in the capital city of Beijing and the palace zone in the southern part of the resort was therefore designed to resemble the Forbidden City in Beijing. It consists of two parts: a court in front, where the emperor received high officials, nobles of various minority nationalities, and foreign envoys; and bed chambers in the rear, which were the imperial family's living quarters, notably the Yanbozhishuang Hall, where the Kangxi Emperor spent a total of 12 summers while the Qianlong Emperor spent 52 summers in the hall during the course of their reign. The Jiaqing and Xianfeng emperors both died while staying at Chengde in 1820 and 1861 respectively.  Climate  Chengde Mountain Resort is located in the transition zone from warm temperate zone to cold temperate zone. It has semi - temperate, semi - arid continental monsoon climate. It has a large difference in temperature between day and night. In winter, it is cold and has little snow. It has much thundershowers in summer, basically there is no hot period. Chengde Mountain Resort is suitable for traveling in every season, but best from April to October. Scenic spots The Mountain Resort is most famous for the 72 scenic spots which were named by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors. Many of the scenic spots around the resort's lake area were copied from famous landscaped gardens in southern China. For instance, the main building on the Green Lotus Island, \\"Tower of Mist and Rain,\\" () is modeled upon a tower at the Nanhu Lake at Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province. The resort's plain area also possesses characteristics of the scenery of the Mongolian grasslands. Forested mountains and valleys are dotted with various buildings. This includes a -tall stone Chinese pagoda, one of the tallest in China, built in 1751 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. The pagoda is shaped with an octagonal base, while the pagoda's nine stories are decorated with colorful glazed tiles and the steeple is crowned with a gilded round spire. In December 1994 the Mountain Resort was listed by UNESCO on its list of World Heritage Sites. Events The 2018 Women's Bandy World Championship was held at a naturally frozen ice at the lake in the complex.

Arctic and Antarctic insects, fish and amphibians create cryoprotectants (antifreeze compounds and antifreeze proteins) in their bodies to minimize freezing damage during cold winter periods. Cryoprotectants are also used to preserve living materials in the study of biology and to preserve food products. For years, glycerol has been used in cryobiology as a cryoprotectant for blood cells and bull sperm, allowing storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures. However, glycerol cannot be used to protect whole organs from damage. Instead, many biotechnology companies are researching the development of other cryoprotectants more suitable for such uses. A successful discovery may eventually make possible the bulk cryogenic storage (or \\"banking\\") of transplantable human and xenobiotic organs. A substantial step in that direction has already occurred. Twenty-First Century Medicine has vitrified a rabbit kidney to -135 ¬∞C with their proprietary vitrification cocktail. Upon rewarming, the kidney was successfully transplanted into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney. Mechanism Cryoprotectants operate by increasing the solute concentration in cells. However, in order to be biologically viable they must easily penetrate and must not be toxic to cells. =Glass transition temperature= Some cryoprotectants function by lowering the glass transition temperature of a solution or of a material. In this way, the cryoprotectant prevents actual freezing, and the solution maintains some flexibility in a glassy phase. Many cryoprotectants also function by forming hydrogen bonds with biological molecules as water molecules are displaced. Hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions is important for proper protein and DNA function. Thus, as the cryoprotectant replaces the water molecules, the biological material retains its native physiological structure and function, although they are no longer immersed in an aqueous environment. This preservation strategy is most often utilized in anhydrobiosis. =Toxicity= Mixtures of cryoprotectants have less toxicity and are more effective than single-agent cryoprotectants. A mixture of formamide with DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), propylene glycol, and a colloid was for many years the most effective of all artificially created cryoprotectants. Cryoprotectant mixtures have been used for vitrification (i.e. solidification without crystal ice formation). Vitrification has important applications in preserving embryos, biological tissues and organs for transplant. Vitrification is also used in cryonics, in an effort to eliminate freezing damage. Conventional Conventional cryoprotectants are glycols (alcohols containing at least two hydroxyl groups), such as ethylene glycol , propylene glycol and glycerol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as automobile antifreeze; while propylene glycol has been used to reduce ice formation in ice cream. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is also regarded as a conventional cryoprotectant. Glycerol and DMSO have been used for decades by cryobiologists to reduce ice formation in sperm, oocytes, and embryos that are cold-preserved in liquid nitrogen. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a practice that involves conventional cryoprotectants to store genetic material with the intention of future revival. Trehalose is non- reducing sugar produced by yeasts and insects in copious amounts. Its use as a cryoprotectant in commercial systems has been patented widely. Examples in nature Arctic fish use antifreeze proteins, sometimes appended with sugars, as cryoprotectants. =Insects= Insects most often use sugars or polyols as cryoprotectants. One species that uses cryoprotectant is Polistes exclamans (a wasp). In this species, the different levels of cryoprotectant can be used to distinguish between morphologies. =Amphibians= Cold-adapted arctic frogs (e.g., wood frog) and some other ectotherms in polar and subpolar regions naturally produce glucose, but southern brown tree frogs and Arctic salamanders create glycerol in their livers to reduce ice formation. When glucose is used as a cryoprotectant by arctic frogs, massive amounts of glucose are released at low temperature and a special form of insulin allows for this extra glucose to enter the cells. When the frog rewarms during spring, the extra glucose must be rapidly eliminated, but stored. Food preservation Cryoprotectants are also used to preserve foods. These compounds are typically sugars that are inexpensive and do not pose any toxicity concerns. For example, many (raw) frozen chicken products contain a sucrose and sodium phosphates solution in water.

Ratified on 17 January 1948, the agreement was an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the disputes that arose following the 1946 Linggadjati Agreement.

Dutch Lt. Governor-General Van Mook gave the ceasefire order on 5 August.Ide Anak Agung (1973), pp. 34‚Äì35. On 25 August, the Security Council passed a resolution proposed by the United States that the Security Council tender its good offices to help resolve the Dutch- Indonesian dispute peacefully. This assistance would take the form of a Committee of Good Offices (CGO, known locally in Indonesia as the Trilateral Commission (, not to be confused with the current Trilateral Commission)) made up of three representatives, one appointed by the Netherlands, one by Indonesia and a third, mutually agreed by both sides. The Dutch chose a representative from Belgium, Indonesia chose one from Australia and both agreed on the US for the third member.Ide Anak Agung (1973), p. 34.Kahin (1952) p. 217. A few days later, on 29 August 1947 the Dutch proclaimed the Van Mook Line, claiming it marked the extent the areas they held as of the ceasefire. However the Dutch included areas of Indonesia the Dutch had not reentered. The republic was left with about a third of Java and most of the island of Sumatra, but the republican forces were cut off from the main food growing regions. A Dutch blockade then stopped arms, food and clothing reaching the republicans.Kahin (1952) pp. 218‚Äì221. The negotiations begin There were protracted discussions over the location of talks between the two sides. The Dutch wanted negotiations to take place in Indonesia, while the Indonesians rejected this as they would have to meet while under the threat of the Dutch military. After considering overseas locations and a US battleship, US Assistant Secretary of State Dean Rusk proposed using the unarmed transport ship , which was brought to Indonesia and anchored in Jakarta Bay. The first formal session of the CGO began on 8 December 1947.Fischer (1959), p.102Kahin (1952), p. 224.Ide Anak Agung (1973), p.36.Kahin (1952), p. 224. The republican delegation was led by Indonesian Prime Minister Amir Sjarifuddin, with Johannes Leimena as his deputy. On the Dutch side, the delegation was led by civil service official Col. Raden Abdulkadir Widjojoatmodjo, an Indonesian who had left with the colonial administration when the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies, and had worked with the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration after the war. On 26 December as negotiations stalled, the CGO issued a \\"Christmas Message\\", a proposal calling for a truce with the Van Mook line as military boundary. However, Dutch forces withdrew to positions held before the July 1947 military action and the republicans would take over civilian administration upon returning to those areas. The Indonesian side accepted the proposal in its entirely, but the Dutch gave only partial agreement and put forward 12 counter proposals. Among these was a demand for free elections for people to decide their relationship with the future United States of Indonesia and for both sides to guarantee freedom of assembly and speech. The Dutch not accept troop withdrawals or Indonesian civilian administration in those areas returned to their control. The Dutch also opposed any international observation of the agreement.Kahin (1952), pp. 224‚Äì229. Pressure from the Dutch outside the talks Dutch newsreel discussing the Renville Agreement (from 0:43) On 19 December, the Dutch prime minister visited Medan and said there must be a quick resolution and that it would be \\"most regrettable if this last appeal, this last appeal, were not understood\\".Ide Anak Agung (1973), p. 37. Ten days later, Van Mook announced the establishment of the State of East Sumatra, thus indicating that the Dutch were going ahead with the establishment of a federal state. Then on 4 January 1948, the Dutch organized a conference of representatives they had selected from ten regions of Indonesia. These representatives agreed to form an interim federal government pending the establishment of the United States of Indonesia. The Republic of Indonesia was invited to join as minority partner.Kahin (1952), p. 225. Agreement Negotiations underway on USS Renville between the Dutch and the Indonesian republicans On 9 January, the Dutch delegation said that if the Indonesian side did not accept its proposals within three days, it would ask its government for further instructions. The CGO put forward six principles to counter the 12 from the Dutch. Among their provisions were that Dutch sovereignty would continue until transferred to the United States of Indonesia, with the Republic of Indonesia a component of it; fair representation for each component of the provisional federal state in its government; a referendum within six months to ask people if they wanted their region to the Republic of Indonesia or the United States of Indonesia and a constitutional convention to draw up a constitution. Furthermore, any state would be free to not join the RIS.Kahin (1952), pp. 224‚Äì226. The Dutch side said it would accept these proposals if the Republicans accepted them and its original 12 proposals by the 12 January deadline. After a 48-hour extension to the deadline and discussions to clarify the Dutch proposals, Dr Frank Graham, the US member of the CGO convinced the Republicans to accept, saying they could rely on the US using its influence to ensure the Dutch kept to their side of the bargain. The Indonesian side also felt that referendums in the regions would result in victory for the pro-Republicans and that they would be able to dominate the federal government. Graham also told Amir Sjarifuddin that the US would provide aid to help rebuild a free Indonesia.Kahin (1952), pp. 226‚Äì228.Ide Anak Agung (1973), p. 39. The Van Mook Line in Java. Areas in red were under Republican control Kahin (1952), p. 233 Initially President Sukarno and Vice-president Hatta opposed the agreement, but after hearing reports of shortages of ammunition and worried that Dutch would attack again if the agreement not signed, they agreed. They were also reluctant to accept responsibility for substantial civilian and military casualties if the fighting continued. After the Dutch and republican sides agreed on a truce along the Van Mook Line and the proposals put forward by the CGO and the Dutch, the agreement was signed on the foredeck of USS Renville on 17 January 1948.Kahin (1952), pp. 228‚Äì229.Ide Anak Agung, (1973) pp. 389. Consequences Diplomatic efforts between the Netherlands and the Republic continued throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, both domestic and international, hindered Dutch attempts at goal formulation. Similarly Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook's federal Indonesia concept . The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base.Reid (1974), p. 149 The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising the leadership of the federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.Reid (1974), p. 150 Mutual distrust between the Netherlands and the Republic hindered negotiations. The Republic feared a second major Dutch offensive, while the Dutch objected to continued Republican activity on the Dutch side of the Renville line. In February 1948 the Siliwangi Battalion of the Republican Army, led by Nasution, marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Battalion in the Surakarta area. The Battalion, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing Mount Slamet, and the Dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. The fear of such incursions actually succeeding, along with apparent Republican undermining of the Dutch-established Pasundan state and negative reports, lead to the Dutch leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control.Reid (1974), pp. 149‚Äì151 See also * Timeline of the Indonesian National Revolution * Dutch police actions * Linggadjati Agreement * Round Table Conference Notes References * Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung (1973) Twenty Years Indonesian Foreign Policy: 1945‚Äì1965 Mouton & Co  External links *britannica.com *Text and Background on the Renville Agreement Category:Indonesian National Revolution Category:1948 in Indonesia Category:1948 in the Dutch East Indies Category:History of Jakarta Category:Indonesia‚ÄìNetherlands relations Category:Treaties of Indonesia Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Articles containing video clips Category:January 1948 events ","title":"Renville Agreement"},{"id":"2528138","text":"Bill Mondy, sometimes credited as Bill Monday, is an American film and television actor.

This is one of the rare mainstream Hindi movies in which the hero plays the role of a loser. It is widely considered to be one of Shah Rukh Khan's best performances, and he has said that it is his favourite film. Produced on a budget of , the film grossed , equivalent to adjusted for inflation. At the 39th Filmfare Awards, it won the Critics Award for Best Film and the Critics Award for Best Actor for Shah Rukh Khan, who also won the Best Actor award for Baazigar at the same ceremony. The film was remade in Telugu as Swapnalokam (1999) with Jagapathi Babu. Shah Rukh Khan has bought the rights to the film under his banner, Red Chillies Entertainment. Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa has also drawn comparisons to the later Hollywood film 500 Days of Summer (2009).  Plot  Sunil (Shah Rukh Khan) is woken up from his dream of marrying the girl he loves, Anna (Suchitra Krishnamurthy), by his sister (Sadiya Siddiqui). Sunil is a happy-go-lucky scamp who loves music and is not interested in studies, which bothers his father, Vinayak (Anjan Srivastav). Everyone has given up on Sunil and thinks he is good for nothing except for Father Braganza (Naseeruddin Shah) who believes Sunil is pure at heart. Sunil, Anna, and Chris (Deepak Tijori) are 3 members of a 6-person music band, who are looking to make it big. Anna rejoins the group after being away for a while, which makes Chris happy as he loves Anna. After Anna reenters his life, Sunil begins to try and change his ways in order to get Anna to fall in love with him. During a performance at a friend's wedding, Sunil notices the closeness between Anna and Chris. Devastated, he decides to create a rift between them. Sunil eventually gets caught in his own web of lies. A furious Anna slaps him and decides to never talk to him again. Sunil is thrown out of the band. However, fortune favors Sunil who saves the band from being heckled at a local club by putting on a stellar show; the entire band forgives and forgets. Sunil thinks he has won Anna back but finds out that Anna and Chris love each other and want to be married. Crushed to pieces, Sunil accepts he has lost in love. Meanwhile, Anna's father decides that Chris is worthy of marrying her. He makes his intentions known but Chris' parents have other ideas and decide Chris's marriage to their friend's daughter. Anna and her family are dejected. Sunil consoles Anna and the tide slowly turns in his favor. Anna's father, having realized that Sunil will love and take care of her, convinces Anna to marry Sunil. Sunil is overjoyed until he realizes Anna still loves Chris. Sunil decides to reunite the two and get them married. On their wedding day, as Chris and Anna are about to exchange rings, Chris drops his ring and it rolls out of sight. Sunil spots the ring but feigns ignorance, even as his younger sister gazes at him with a heavy heart. Eventually, Chris locates the ring and the couple gets married. Just after the wedding, Sunil is shown sitting on the sidewalk, dejected, and heartbroken. By happenstance, a random girl (Juhi Chawla), who is lost and is seeking directions, approaches Sunil. Sometime later, Sunil and the girl are seen walking in the moonlight and talking merrily. Anthony and Vasco, two criminals who are a part of the story, see Sunil with the new girl and break the fourth wall, saying that Sunil will be alright. The criminals hear the police siren and immediately scamper away as the credits roll.

Sumption was sworn in as a Justice of the Supreme Court on 11 January 2012, succeeding Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury. Exceptionally, he was raised to the Supreme Court bench directly from the practising at the Bar, rather than the more usual route of having been full-time judge. He retired from the Supreme Court on 9 December 2018 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. Sumption is well known for his role as a barrister in many legal cases. They include appearances in the Hutton Inquiry on HM Government's behalf, in the Three Rivers case, his representation of former Cabinet Minister Stephen Byers and the Department for Transport in the Railtrack private shareholders' action against the British Government in 2005, for defending HM Government in an appeal hearing brought by Binyam Mohamed, and for successfully defending Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in a private lawsuit brought by Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. A former academic, Sumption was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2003 New Year Honourshttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/56797/supplement/24/data.htm and is also known for writing a substantial narrative history of the Hundred Years' War, so far in four volumes. Sumption has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). Early life and education Sumption was the elder son of Anthony Sumption, a decorated naval officer and barrister, and Hilda Hedigan; their marriage was dissolved in 1979. He was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating in 1970 with a first in History.Brick Court Chambers website: Jonathan Sumption QC‚Äôs Full CV Retrieved: 16 October 2011 He was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, teaching and writing books on medieval history before leaving to pursue a career in law. Called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1975, he then pursued a successful legal practice in commercial law. In the 1970s, Sumption served as an adviser to the Conservative MP and Cabinet Minister Sir Keith Joseph. Sumption and Joseph co- wrote a 1979 book, Equality, seeking to show that \\"no convincing arguments for an equal society have ever been advanced\\" and that \\"no such society has ever been successfully created\\". In the late 1970s Sumption was a regular contributor to The Sunday Telegraph. Legal career Sumption was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1986 at the relatively young age of 38, and elected a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1991. He has served as a Deputy High Court Judge in the Chancery Division, and a Judge of the Court of Appeal of Jersey and the Guernsey Court of Appeal. A member of the Judicial Appointments Commission, until his appointment to the Supreme Court, Sumption was joint head of Brick Court Chambers. On 30 November 2007, when a practising barrister, Sumption successfully represented himself before Lord Justice Collins in a judicial review application in the Administrative Court concerning development near his home at Greenwich. =Earnings as a barrister= The Guardian once described him as being a member of the \\"million-a-year club\\", the elite group of barristers earning over a million pounds a year. In a letter to The Guardian in 2001, he compared his \\"puny ¬£1.6 million a year\\" to the vastly larger amounts that comparable individuals in business, sports and entertainment are paid. For a four-week trial (and all the preparatory work) in the UK in 2005 he charged ¬£800,000 to represent HM Government in the largest class action in the UK, brought by 49,500 private shareholders of the collapsed national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. The Government had money and reputation at stake, the case examining some of the actions of HM Government, especially of former Transport Secretary Stephen Byers. Byers became the only former Cabinet Minister to be cross-examined in the High Court in relation to his actions in modern times: the British Government won the case.  Judicial career  On 4 May 2011 Sumption's appointment as a Justice of the Supreme Court was announced. Upon his subsequent swearing-in on 11 January 2012, he assumed the title of Lord Sumption pursuant to a Royal Warrant (by which all members of the Supreme Court, even if they do not hold a peerage title, are accorded the style of \\"Lord\\" for life). Sumption was sworn of the Privy Council on 14 December 2011 in advance of his joining the Court, whose Justices double as members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He retired from the Supreme Court on 9 December 2018. Sumption is the first lawyer appointed to the Supreme Court without previously serving as a full-time judge since its inception in 2009. There were only five such appointments as Law Lords to the Court's predecessor, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.www.burkespeerage.com Two were Scots lawyers: Lord Macmillan in 1930 and Lord Reid in 1948; the others were: Lord Macnaghten (1887), Lord Carson (1921) and Lord Radcliffe (1949). After his retirement, Sumption was appointed as a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong on 18 December 2019. He had previously appeared as counsel in the Court of Final Appeal in a number of cases.For example, , reported at (2010) 13 HKCFAR 479, and , reported at (2009) 12 HKCFAR 512 Historian =The Hundred Years' War= Sumption's narrative history of the Hundred Years' War between England and France (of which four volumes have so far been published, between 1990 and 2015) has been widely praised as \\"earning a place alongside Steven Runciman's A History of the Crusades\\" according to Frederic Raphael, and as a work that \\"deploys an enormous variety of documentary material ... and interprets it with imaginative and intelligent sympathy\\" and is \\"elegantly written\\" (Rosamond McKitterick, Evening Standard); for Allan Massie it is \\"An enterprise on a truly Victorian scale ... What is most impressive about this work, apart from the author's mastery of his material and his deployment of it, is his political intelligence\\".Quotations from the selection of reviews displayed on the back of The Hundred Years War III: Divided Houses. Five volumes are planned. Volume I (covering the years from the funeral of Charles IV of France in 1329 to the Surrender of Calais in 1347) was first published in 1990. Volume II (covering the years from 1347 to 1369) was published in 1999. Volume III (covering the years from 1369 to 1399) appeared in 2009. Volume IV (covering the years from 1399 to 1422) appeared in 2015, the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt. Sumption has been praised for a clipped and polished prose style, which he credits to his unwillingness to employ clich√©. He admires Gibbon but points out \\"if anybody wrote like him today they‚Äôd be dismissed as a pompous fart\\".  Political views  Sumption said that an attempt to rapidly achieve gender equality in the Supreme Court through quotas or positive discrimination could end up discouraging male applicants and so \\"have appalling consequences for justice\\". Sumption has been described as \\"conservative neo-liberal and libertarian.\\" He has criticised the historical curriculum in English schools as \\"appallingly narrow\\", warning that by forcing English schoolchildren to study 1918‚Äì1945 in isolation they \\"are being taught about Germany and Europe during its most aberrant period\\". Sumption has written about his concerns regarding law and order and the justice system, most notably in his book Trials of the State: Law and the Decline of Politics (2019). He argues that in recent years, judicial law has undermined legislation and political process because the courts have been given too much power and have been judging issues that should be decided in a political debate context. This is because he argues that in political realms, rather than in courts, there is more accountability, especially from the public. He has criticised the European Court of Human Rights. He has compared the values of the Strasbourg court and those of the post-war dictatorships of eastern Europe, stating that \\"they both employ the concept of democracy as a generalised term of approval for a set of political values\\". = COVID-19 pandemic = Sumption argues that coronavirus disease 2019 is not as serious to the general population as is widely believed. He has been very critical of the British government response to the pandemic, arguing against restrictions on the public in defence of the rights and civil liberties of the private individual. As he is a former Supreme Court judge, Sumption's criticism is a notable addition to the views of other high-profile critics such as Peter Hitchens and Toby Young. On 30 March 2020, Sumption gave an interview on The World at One about the then recently implemented full restrictive lockdown on the population on 23 March 2020. He argued that the full restrictive lockdown would have serious negative consequences as a result of restricting civil liberties, locking down a healthy population, and stalling a healthy economy. He questioned whether the virus was serious enough to \\"warrant putting most of the population into house imprisonment, wrecking our economy for an indefinite period, destroying businesses that honest and hard-working people have taken years to build up, saddling future generations with debt?\\" He argued that the lockdown would have serious health costs on many people causing \\"unbelievable distress inflicted on millions of people who are not especially vulnerable and will suffer only mild symptoms or none at all, like the Health Secretary and the Prime Minister\\". For these reasons, Sumption believes the lockdown as a 'cure' for the virus may be worse than the effects of the actual virus. He has criticised the actions of the police forces during the lockdown measures because he argued that they followed the wishes of ministers instead of just the law, when the ministers themselves were simply reacting to public pressure in applying stringent lockdown measures. Furthermore, in The Sunday Times of 17 May 2020 he remarked that \\"Free people make mistakes and willingly take risks. If we hold politicians responsible for everything that goes wrong, they will take away our liberty so that nothing can go wrong. They will do this not for our protection against risk, but for their own protection against criticism\\". In The Spectator, he wrote of his concerns that Britain risked becoming a 'police state' and queried whether the \\"severe\\" police reaction was justified. In a podcast interview in July 2020, Sumption claimed evidence existed indicating the virus was very mild compared to other pandemics in the 20th century. He said a Cabinet Office paper which showed pandemics in the 20th century with the Coronavirus at the lowest in terms of infectiousness and mortality levels. He argued that a coronavirus inquiry is needed because there will be worse pandemics in the future. In the same interview he also added that MPs had privately thanked him for speaking out against the lockdown but did not \\"dare open their mouths‚Äù to publicly speak out about it. Sumption has argued that the lockdown response to the pandemic could threaten democracy. He has said this is because people have been giving up their liberties because of their fear of the virus, and despotisms arise not because liberty is forcibly taken away by tyrants but because people voluntarily surrender their liberty in return for protection from some perceived threat and it‚Äôs in the interests of governments to exaggerate that threat in order to procure compliance. Furthermore, he has noted that advocates of human rights ‚Äúhave been extraordinarily silent‚Äù about the lockdown. Sumption has said that his view on the virus vindicate the views he expressed in his Reith lectures and in his book Trials of the State: Law and the Decline of Politics (2019) which was \\"remarkably prescient\\" about it. In a podcast aired on 10 September 2020, Sumption told journalist Allison Pearson of The Daily Telegraph that the \\"lockdown and the quarantine rules and most of the other regulations have been made under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984\\", not the Coronavirus Act 2020 itself. Sumption further observed that the only language contained in this Act which confers specific powers over an individual's liberty relate to individuals who are believed \\"on reasonable grounds\\" to have contracted an infectious agent, and that thus the powers purported by the Johnson government to enforce lockdown measures on the whole population are in fact ultra vires and of vanishing effect on the vast majority. He found the deliberate employment of this Act to enforce a lockdown a \\"drastic decision\\" and \\"profoundly controversial\\".

A settlement with an over 1000 years history, it was incorporated as a city in 1796. The city hosts the Vasylkiv air base since the Cold War. Population: History The exact date of the settlement's foundation is unknown but, according to the Primary Chronicle, it was the place where Vladimir the Great's numerous wives were living. After the Christianization of Kyiv, Vladimir built there a fortress and named it Vasilev, after his patron saint - Saint Basil (Vasily). It was a birthplace of Saint Theodosius, and there is a Ukrainian baroque church (1756‚Äì58) commemorating this saint. In 1658, the Russian military commander Yuri Baryatinsky defeated the army of hetman Ivan Vyhovsky's brother Konstantin near Vasylkiv, after the Ukrainian hetman switched the sides in favour of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Throughout the times, an obscure place, almost forgotten in spite of the glorious history and connection to many earlier historic events, it was put back on the map by an anecdotal story related to Catherine II of Russia. As per legend, while passing through it during the night, the carriage lost one wheel. Catherine II woke up from the sudden jerk, and asked the name of the town. When she fell asleep again, her servants repaired the wheel and the carriage moved again. She woke up again and upon learning that it is still Vasilkov, she remarked : \\"A large town, indeed\\".

This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman Colosseum and Greek amphitheatres. * A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as symphonic music or chamber music or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole.

Examples of this practice is the Celebrity Series of Boston renting venues in Boston's Boch Center. New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses.

It was released in September 1979 by the record label Polydor. Upon its release, it was hailed by the British press, including Melody Maker, Sounds, NME and Record Mirror. Join Hands took the topic of the First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is darker than the band's debut album The Scream: it sounds more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first recorded line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement at the beginning of the British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release. The record peaked at No. 13 on the UK Albums Chart. \\"Playground Twist\\" was the only single released from the album. Join Hands was reissued on vinyl in 2015, along with the very first artwork that the band had presented to Polydor in 1979.  History, content and music  Join Hands was written over a period of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, including scenes of repression and curfews; it was one of the first times they had seen images of people being shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as \\"a real time, everything in flux and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this stuff from the past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting\\". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of what things were like at the time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took \\"the very un- rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration\\". The album's references to poppies represented the idea of \\"loss, of flesh and blood and hopelessness\\". The themes of the songs also included \\"child-like terror, attacks on social and spiritual conditioning, various kinds of death and torture, and loneliness\\". Some songs were also about families and nursing. For the critic Ronnie Gurr, \\"All lyrical options are left completely open\\". The album opens with the sound of tolling bells before the beginning of \\"Poppy Day\\". The words were based on John McCrae's poem \\"In Flanders Fields\\", which was written in 1915 after the loss of a friend during a First World War battle. \\"Poppy Day\\", a short track with a long introduction building over what one journalist called \\"shards of John McKay's guitar\\" and a \\"strident militaristic backbeat\\", had been shaped after Steven Severin had observed the televised two minutes of silence in memory of the war dead on Sunday, 12 November 1978. \\"We wanted to write a song that would fittingly fill that gap\\", he stated. On the inner sleeve of the album, the mention \\"2 minutes of silence\\" was added next to the lyrics of the song. \\"Regal Zone\\", featuring saxophone by McKay, also covers the subject of war and is about the conflict in Iran. \\"Placebo Effect\\" addresses the use of placebos in medicine, while \\"Icon\\" displays echoes of iconoclasm, with the destruction of paintings featuring religious images, or statues and symbols of old authoritarian regimes. \\"Premature Burial\\", \\"ostensibly inspired\\" by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, \\"an expression of claustrophobia, of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations\\". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line \\"We're all sisters and brothers\\" looked like a mockery of the Summer of Love. The song's conclusion features what sounds like \\"a formal choir backing for a retreating Red Army in its magnificent defeat\\". Beginning the second side, \\"Playground Twist\\" is a \\"swirling mass of flanged guitars\\" with church bells; it includes a nursery rhyme section. The song \\"talks about adults who act like children and children who think they're adults\\". Siouxsie explained: \\"It's about the cruelty of children and that whole aspect of being thrown out into the playground in the winter in howling gales and left to fend for yourself. It's not the sort of thing you're supposed to write pop songs about\\". It was the band's third single in less than a year and \\"probably the best\\", according to the music historian Clinton Heylin. The single did not sound catchy, but it nevertheless entered the top 30. Severin later recalled the head of A&R; at Polydor telling him he expected a commercial failure. The lullaby \\"Mother / Oh Mein Papa\\" is an interpretation of the German song \\"O mein Papa\\" with words by Siouxsie. Phil Sutcliffe called it \\"a raw wound of a song offered by Siouxsie from her own life and surely shared and picked and scratched at by everyone who hears it\\". Over a music box, two voices sing simultaneous love and hatred for the same mother. The positive lyric is upfront and the negative one is in the background. The final track of the album is a studio recording of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\", the song that Siouxsie and the Banshees had famously played at their debut live performance at the 100 Club Punk Festival in September 1976. It was recorded in one take; after every session in the first week, they put down a version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\". Before entering the studio, the band had recorded a John Peel session in early April in which they had premiered the tracks \\"Placebo Effect\\", \\"Playground Twist\\", \\"Regal Zone\\" and \\"Poppy Day\\". The band then went into Air Studios on Oxford Street in London to record the album in May. By June, they had mixed it. Join Hands was different from The Scream; it was darker, more experimental, less abrasive, with a new \\"claustrophobic\\" mood. McKay's guitar- playing generates a \\"barrage of sound\\" while Severin's \\"bass carries the tune\\". The recording took place under a strained atmosphere. McKay and Kenny Morris withdrew and became uncommunicative with the rest of the band and their manager and co-producer of the album, Nils Stevenson. Unlike the sessions for The Scream, the music was recorded without Siouxsie, as she added her vocals later. Morris did not take part in the mixing sessions, while Siouxsie was heavily involved. Commenting a few days before the album's release, Jon Savage wrote about the music: \\"The songs are delivered with the stifling intensity of inner violence in a locked room\\". Kris Needs remarked that Join Hands was, in retrospect, an ironic title for a record which split the group in two.Kent, Nick and Needs, Kris. \\" Night of the Long Knives\\". NME. 22 September 1979. The album reflected how the band felt at the time: \\"We were lonely and isolated and that comes across in the music\\", stated Siouxsie in 2003. She added: \\"Musically, Join Hands was an uncompromising album but it still sounds modern today\\". Cover artwork, release and tour Initially, the group wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing children joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, so it had become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled to coincide with the release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release. Stevenson suggested an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done in front of the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for \\"In Flanders Fields\\", which inspired \\"Poppy Day\\". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Sunday in the UK. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: \\"The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device\\". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: \\"We wanted it all white because you were supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so we had it nice and classic\\", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was the only part of the original design that survived. Join Hands was issued on 7 September 1979 by Polydor Records. It reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. At that time, the breach between McKay and Morris and the rest of the group had become important. A warm-up show in Ireland had caused problems for McKay; none of the ancillary equipment arrived at the venue, forcing him to play without all his effects pedals. Finally, after a brawl at a record shop, McKay and Morris abruptly left the band on the day of the album's release, just a few hours before a concert at the Capitol Theatre in Aberdeen. It was a spur- of-the-moment decision, but they never returned. Severin later remarked, \\"Is there another band that that's happened to? I don't think so\\". A 2006 remastered edition included two bonus tracks: the non-album song \\"Love in a Void\\" and the previously unreleased instrumental \\"Infantry\\". The album, this time with the Maybury-designed sleeve, was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day in April 2015. This edition had the original collection of tracks, but \\"Infantry\\" was made the album's closing track, as had been the original intent. A 180g vinyl reissue of the album, remastered from the original ¬º‚Äù tapes and cut half-speed at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell, was released in August 2018.  Critical reception  Upon release, the album was well received by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Peter Silverton, noting a change in the sound: \\"The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure\\". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have \\"Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect\\". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, \\"Poppy Day\\", as a \\"short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders\\". He also wrote that \\"Placebo Effect\\" \\"has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation\\". About \\"Icon\\", Savage wrote: \\"The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal.\\" Savage noted that the five songs of the first side \\"rise and fall into another in a stunning segue\\". Similarly, Paul Morley wrote in NME that \\"Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini- dramas\\". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: \\"Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks\\". \\"Mother\\" was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the \\"track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides\\". Gurr concluded that with \\"Severin's truly disturbing scratchings\\", Join Hands was a dangerous work that \\"should be heard\\". In a retrospective review published in 1989, Steve Lamacq wrote in NME that Join Hands was \\"a more absorbing, haunting LP\\" than the band's debut album. Lamacq rated it 8 out of 10, though he said that the version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" was \\"out of place\\". The 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave a 2.5 out 5 rating and commented that the \\"brooding trance music\\" of their previous material \\"can slip into dankness\\" on Join Hands. AllMusic's David Cleary considered \\"Icon\\" the best track on the album, commenting that it \\"survives an unpromising beginning to open out into a faster main section with fuller vocal sound and gutsier guitar work\\", but Cleary panned the rest of Join Hands, describing it as \\"almost uniformly grim, with dragging tempos, bleak lyrics, long and wandering free-form structures, static and often unfocused harmony and thick, colorless arrangements\\".  Legacy  Join Hands is considered a post-punk album by Heylin and listed as such on AllMusic. According to Simon Reynolds, it is also seen as a precursor of the gothic rock genre due to several of its songs. Its \\"funereal\\" atmosphere \\"inspired a host of gothic impersonators\\", according to Mojo, but \\"none of whom matched the Banshees' run of singles\\". AllMusic's David Cleary commented that \\"some of [Join Hands'] selections appear to strongly anticipate the work of Joy Division's second album, Closer, especially 'Placebo Effect', whose guitar sound was a clear inspiration for that of the Manchester band's song 'Colony'.\\" In the 2007 film Control, the sleeve of Join Hands is shown in a scene where Ian Curtis's wife, Deborah, looks through her husband's record collection.Corbijn, Anton.

James Murphy, the leader of LCD Soundsystem, expressed an appreciation of the album stating the first records he bought were Join Hands, the Fall's Grotesque and the Birthday Party's \\"Nick the Stripper\\". \\"All three of those records are three of my favourite things I've ever heard\\", he said. In late 2008, Morrissey chose the track \\"Mother\\" in his playlist when he was interviewed for BBC Radio 2, and another former member of the Smiths, Johnny Marr, said he was a big admirer of second albums from several bands, including Siouxsie and the Banshees.

She worked from 1984 through 1993 to establish the Vietnam Women's Memorial, lobbying federal authorities for permission to build a memorial to the 11,000 military women who served in Vietnam and the 265,000 who served around the world during the Vietnam era. Carlson Evans and thousands of volunteers in 50 states raised money and public support for the cause, including from leading veteran's organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, and the American Legion. At the time of dedication, the VWMP was about $600,000--$700,000 short of required funds, and the corporation which underwrote the amount, provided the needed last-minute cash. It took seven years of testimony before three federal commissions and two congressional bills for Evans and her supporters to earn permission for the memorial. Once permission was granted, more than 300 artists entered a major design competition in 1990. Sculptor Glenna Goodacre, of Sante Fe, New Mexico, submitted a design that received honorable mention and was selected as the statue that replaced the design \\"Nurse\\" by Rodger Brodin which was used as a fundraiser during the early days of awareness- raising; the model for \\"Nurse,\\" with which thousands fell in love and which raised the first million dollars toward the Project, was Rhonda McKellup a 26-year-old sheriff's office dispatcher in Minnesota. The Goodacre statue now stands on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The bronze sculpture is 7'0\\" tall with four figures, 3 women and a wounded soldier. The Vietnam Women's Memorial was dedicated before a crowd of thousands on November 11, 1993, with remarks from then Vice President and Vietnam Veteran Al Gore. = Career since 1993 = Since the dedication of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in 1993, Carlson Evans has remained active in the veterans community. As Founder and President of the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation, she speaks nationally about the experience of women in wartime. She and her husband, of forty years plus, have four children and seven grandchildren. Awards and honors Carlson Evans has been honored for her work from many organizations and institutions.

The song is about a lumber drive near Badger, Newfoundland. As with many Newfoundland ballads the lyrics are about places and events and sometimes actual individuals, this song has all those qualities.Composed in 1912 by John V. Devine of King's Cove, Bonavista Bay, NL.1 Local and family tradition hold that Devine composed it in a Grand Falls boarding house after having been fired from his job as scaler for the Anglo Newfoundland Development Company (A.N.D.). He sang the song at a St. Patrick's Day concert at which company officials were present and allegedly won his job back.2 Note: Reference 1 has erroneously transcribed the phrase \\"caulks on their boots\\" as \\"cocks in their boots\\". Additional history and photos related to the Badger Drive and other log drives near Grand Falls, NL are available online in The \\"Badger Drive\\" Examined, by Bryan Marsh.3 Lyrics There is one class of men in this country that never is mentioned in song. And now, since their trade is advancing, they'll come out on top before long. They say that our sailors have danger, and likewise our warriors bold, But there's none know the life of a driver, what he suffers with hardship and cold. Chorus: With their pike poles and peavies and bateaus and all They're sure to drive out in the spring, that's the time With the caulks on their boots as they get on the logs, And it's hard to get over their time. Bill Dorothey he is the manager, and he's a good man at the trade; And when he's around seeking drivers, he's like a train going down grade, But still he is a man that's kindhearted, on his word you can always depend. And there's never a man that works with him but likes to go with him again. Chorus: With their pike poles and peavies and bateaus and all They're sure to drive out in the spring, that's the time With the caulks on their boots as they get on the logs, And it's hard to get over their time. I tell you today home in London, The Times it is read by each man, But little they think of the fellows that drove the wood on Mary Ann, For paper is made out of pulpwood and many things more you may know, And long may our men live to drive it upon Paymeoch and Tomjoe. Chorus: With their pike poles and peavies and bateaus and all They're sure to drive out in the spring, that's the time With the caulks on their boots as they get on the logs, And it's hard to get over their time. The drive it is just below Badger, and everything is working grand, With a jolly good crew of picked drivers and Ronald Kelly in command, For Ronald is boss on the river, and I tell you he's a man that's alive, He drove the wood off Victoria, now he's out on the main river drive. Chorus: With their pike poles and peavies and bateaus and all They're sure to drive out in the spring, that's the time With the caulks on their boots as they get on the logs, And it's hard to get over their time. So now to conclude and to finish, I hope that ye all will agree In wishing success to all Badger and the A.N.D. Company. And long may they live for to flourish, and continue to chop, drive and roll, And long may the business be managed by Mr. Dorothey and Mr. Cole. Chorus: With their pike poles and peavies and bateaus and all They're sure to drive out in the spring, that's the time With the caulks on their boots as they get on the logs, And it's hard to get over their time.

Drawn into the madness of war, Ross commits \\"a last desperate act to declare his commitment to life in the midst of death.\\" Years later, a historian tries to piece together how he came to commit this act, interviewing the various people Ross interacted with. Style The Wars utilizes first-, second-, and third-person narrative points of view, which is very rare in literature. The narrative moves between voices, each telling part of Robert's story. The novel is also an example of historiographic metafiction. Plot summary =Prologue= A young man named Robert Ross is introduced as squatting in a tattered Canadian military uniform, with a pistol in hand. A nearby building is on fire, and a train is stopped. There is evidence of war, and Ross is shown to be in the company of a black horse and a dog. Robert, the horse, and the dog seem to have been together for a while, as they understand each other. He decides to free a herd of horses from the train, and the prologue ends with the horses, rider, and dog all running as a herd. =Part One= Robert Ross enlists in the army to escape the guilt he feels after the recent death of his sister, Rowena, who died from falling out of her wheelchair while playing with her beloved rabbits in the barn. Robert feels guilty because he was unable to save her since he was making love to his pillows in his bedroom when he should have been watching her. His mother orders Robert to kill the rabbits after Rowena's death; when he refuses, his father hires Teddy Budge to kill the rabbits. In an attempt to stop Teddy, Robert is beaten up. Later, while he soaks the resulting bruises in the bathtub, Robert's mother comes in to talk to him. Drunk and visibly upset, she says that she knows Robert wants to go to war, and she accepts that she cannot stop him. Robert goes to army training. There, he meets Eugene Taffler, a lauded war hero. Taffler shows him how to break bottles with stones, prompting Robert to think of him as David throwing stones at Goliath. Robert then goes with his soldiers-in-training to a brothel named Wet Goods. He goes into a room with the prostitute Ella; when she realizes that he has accidentally ejaculated in his pants and therefore will not be having sex, she decides to pass the time by showing him a peephole into the next room. Here Robert sees Taffler having sadomasochistic sex with another man. Out of anger, Robert throws his boots at a mirror and a water jug, scaring Ella. While sailing to England on the S.S. Massanabie, Robert must kill a horse that broke its leg. While struggling to kill the horse, he fires and misses many times before landing his shots. =Part Two= Robert is now in France and in charge of a convoy. While scouting ahead in the fog, he falls into a muddy sinkhole and nearly drowns. After saving himself, he is met by Poole and Levitt, two of his men. They eventually reach the dugout that will be their temporary home. There, they meet the three other men that live in the dugout: Devlin, Bonnycastle, and Rodwell. Rodwell cares for injured animals he finds: birds, rabbits, toads, and hedgehogs. The rabbits painfully remind Robert of Rowena. However, Robert manages to build a bond with Rodwell, the only other civil soldier who cares and respects animals. Robert remembers Harris, another soldier whom he had befriended on the ship when both fell ill. On land, Harris died two days before Robert was scheduled to leave for France. It is during their time in the infirmary together that Robert and Harris meet Taffler again. After Harris dies, Robert asks Taffler to help him in burying his friend. However, Robert learns that Harris has already been cremated. Disappointed by this turn of events, Robert and Taffler dump the ashes into the sea. Robert says, \\"This is not a military funeral. This is just a burial at sea. May we take off our caps?\\"The Wars, pg. 107. On February 28, 1916, the Germans set of a string of land mines, strategically placed along the St. Eloi Salient. The whole countryside goes up in flames. This is the second half of a battle that the Canadians thought was already over. \\"30,000 men would die and not an inch of land would be won.\\" =Part Three= Robert is now experiencing trench warfare at its worst. Following a shelling of the dugout, his fellow soldier Levitt loses his mind, and Robert finds himself close to the brink. Ordered to place guns in a location sure to be a deathtrap, Robert and his men find themselves on the wrong end of a gas attack in the middle of a freezing cold winter. Robert is instructed to place the guns in a crater that is formed by the shelling attacks. As he descends the side of crater, Robert slips and smashes his knees on a discarded machine gun, creatin the men start descending the side of crater, there is a sudden gas attack. The bottom of the crater is full of freezing water, and many begin jumping into it. Robert takes control with his pistol and instructs the men to urinate on strips of clothing and hold them over their faces. One man is too scared to urinate, and Robert must do it for him. The men then lie down, feigning death. Hours later, Robert finally sits up and surveys their surroundings. He immediately realizes that they are being watched by an enemy German soldier sitting at the lip of the crater. Rather than shooting the soldiers, the German allows all of Robert's men to escape the crater. Just as Robert is leaving, however, the German makes a quick motion, and Robert shoots the German. Thinking that the German had been reaching for his rifle, Robert is shocked when he realizes that the German was only reaching for a pair of binoculars to look at the bird flying overhead; Robert is even more horrified to see that the German had had a sniper rifle, meaning that he could have killed Robert and his men if he had wanted to. Robert hears a bird chirping above him and, from then on, is haunted by the sound. =Part Four= In an interview, Juliet d'Orsey explains that the d'Orsey home was converted into a hospital for soldiers during the war. It is here that Robert recovers from his own injuries sustained in Part Three. Once again he meets Taffler, another patient at the d'Orsey home; Robert is devastated to find that Taffler has lost both of his arms in the war. While Taffler seems to be in good spirits, he ends up attempting suicide; one day, as Juliet comes into Taffler's room to give him some flowers, she finds him trying to rub his raw arm stumps against the walls and subsequently bleed to death. Various people, including Robert, respond to Juliet's screams, and Taffler is saved. Juliet tells Robert that his assigned room is haunted by the ghost Lady Sorrel, who comes into the room every night and lights the candles. One night, Juliet thinks it would be a neat prank to dress up as Lady Sorrel, walk into Robert's room, and light the candles. When Juliet opens the door, she sees Barbara and Robert Ross having sex, so violently that Juliet at first thinks that Robert is hurting Barbara. Although they do not see who opens the door, Juliet begins to feel guilty. When Robert eventually leaves the home, Juliet slips him a candle and a box of matches in an effort to explain herself and apologize. =Part Five= Robert heads back to battle on a small train. He gets hopelessly lost on the way and loses his pack. After many weeks of travelling in circles, he arrives at D√©sol√©, a mental institution. In the bath house, he is brutally raped by four men. Although he assumes that they are patients of the institution, he is horrified to learn that they are fellow soldiers. When he returns to his room, he finally receives his lost pack. He burns his only picture of Rowena, as an act of charity, reasoning that it would be horrible for something so innocent to exist in such a perverse world. Robert then returns to the front. The Germans begin firing shells. Robert asks Captain Leather to let the horses out of the barn, as they will die if the barn is hit, but Captain Leather refuses. Robert returns to the barn and asks his friend Devlin to help him release the horses. As Devlin runs out to open the gate, Captain Leather comes out of hiding and shoots Devlin dead. He then fires at Robert but misses. At that moment, three shells land. Soon everything is burning around Robert; even the horses are slowly burning alive. Robert finds Captain Leather and shoots him dead. Robert runs away, as he knows he will be court-martialed for disobeying orders. He finds a black horse with a black dog beside an abandoned train. Before riding the horse down the track, he realizes that there are horses in the train. He frees 130 horses from the train and flees the area with them. As Robert is riding with all the horses, a soldier stops him and tries to force him to return the horses; Robert shoots him dead. Robert is finally caught in a barn with the horses. The soldiers surrounding Robert set the barn on fire in an attempt to smoke him out. However, the doors of the barn are locked. Before Robert can open them, the roof collapses on him and the horses. Robert is saved but badly burned, and all the horses and possibly the dog are killed. Robert turns down an offer of euthanasia from a nurse from Bois de Madeleine hospital before being sent to England and tried in absentia. Since he could not be kept in prison, he was given leave to stay in St Aubyn's for longterm treatment. Juliet d'Orsey remains by Robert's side until his death in 1922. Mr. Ross is the only member of his family to come see Robert buried. Characters =Robert Ross= The character of protagonist Robert Ross was inspired by T. E. Lawrence and the author's uncle, Thomas Irving Findley, to whom the author dedicated the novel. Findley named the character after Canadian literary figure Robbie Ross. Robert Ross enlisted when he was eighteen and served as a second lieutenant in the Canadian field artillery from 1916-1917. He is a compassionate, handsome fellow. He is also an idealist, hindered by youth and inexperience. Robert's personality is serious, practical, determined, and observant of things that other people cannot see. His observations also allow him to react quickly to the situations he encounters in this novel. Robert suffers great guilt over the accidental death of his sister, Rowena, who died from a fall onto cement ground in the barn. After Rowena's death, Robert became distant from his mother and much closer to his father, who continued to support and encourage him throughout his experience in the war. Rowena's death also leaves him with violent streaks and leads an internal war with himself while also trying to cope with the war going on in the world. Even though Robert is determined, he was not a natural killer; this weakness was seen in his inability to kill the injured horse or Rowena's rabbits. Robert strove to learn from Eugene Taffler, whom Robert hoped could help teach him to kill by example. After all the terrible things Robert witnesses, he gradually descends into madness, and goes AWOL. He kills two fellow officers in an attempt to save hundreds of horses from slaughter. He dies of his war wounds several years after the war ends. =Rowena Ross= Rowena is Robert's older sister, with whom Robert felt a connection from a very early age. She was hydrocephalic, meaning she was born with water in the brain. This caused her to have an adult-sized head but a body of a ten-year- old, and made her unable to walk. Robert acted as her guardian for most of his life. She was 25 years old when she fell out of her wheelchair onto the concrete floor of their barn and died as a result. Robert took it as his duty to protect her, but Robert was in his room masturbating when she fell out of her chair. Thus, he feels guilty throughout the novel for inadvertently causing her death. She remains in Robert's heart and mind throughout the novel and is constantly referenced. Rowena had ten rabbits that she looked after and kept as pets while she was alive, but Mrs. Ross insisted that they be killed, against Robert's wishes, shortly after Rowena's death. Robert's desperate attempts to save animals throughout his war experiences reflects his love for the dead animal-loving sister. The character of Rowena was inspired by Mary Macdonald, daughter of Sir John A. Macdonald, who was similarly afflicted with hydrocephalus. =Thomas Ross= Commonly referred to as Mr. Ross in the novel, he is the wealthy father of protagonist Robert Ross. He was the more lenient parent in the family and loved every member enough to encourage Robert to go for what he wants while withstanding the accusations surrounding Rowena's death. His relationship with his wife became helpless after Rowena's death and Robert's enlisting in the army. He has a strong relationship with his son Robert, and he is the only member of the family to attend Robert's funeral. =Marian Turner= Marian Turner is a young nurse during the war. She cares for Robert when he is injured late in the novel, but the reader is introduced to her earlier. Via transcripts of interviews, an 80-year-old Marian gives accounts of what Robert was like as a young man, and of life during the war. =Lady Juliet d'Orsey= Juliet d'Orsey gives an account of Robert, whom she knew at the age of twelve and for whom she had romantic feelings. She is Barbara d'Orsey's younger sister, who saw too much and acted too maturely for her age. She seems to be the only character who understands the delicate homoerotic undertones in male friendships without being confused or disturbed by them. =Lady Barbara d'Orsey= This lady is Juliet's older sister, who became Robert's lover at a point in the novel. She was uncaring and moved easily from one man to another. She admired athletes and heroes. She constantly frustrated the delicate homoerotic relationships around her without understanding her own destructiveness. =Eugene Taffler= This man was a war hero who was often accompanied by a dog and a horse. From the very beginning when he is first introduced, he plays the game of hitting bottles off of posts with stones, displaying strength and perfect accuracy. This reflects Taffler's reputation in the war as a soldier who kills as though it were some kind of game. He later loses his arms. When Taffler loses his arms he no longer wants to live because his arms were so much a part of him and his identity that without them he doesn't have the will to live. He attempts suicide, by rubbing his stubs against the wall, but is thwarted by Lady Juliet d'Orsey. Taffler's reputation and self-image are linked closely with his arms. First as he's introduced using them to hit bottles with stones, and even later when he helps Robert toss Harris's ashes into the river. Taffler is a complex character because although when introduced, Robert makes Taffler his model of masculinity. Later, upon discovering him having sex with the Swede, Robert's homophobia causes him to cease regarding Taffler as a role model. Nevertheless, Taffler goes on to have a seemingly heterosexual relationship with Barbara d'Orsey. It is also noteworthy that Robert himself may have been struggling with his own homosexual tendencies. =Harris= Robert meets Harris in the ship's infirmary. Harris's condition grows progressively worse while in England and he eventually dies before being sent off to France. While under Robert's care at a hospital, Harris talks at great length of his love of the sea. Robert describes Harris as someone he loved deeply. Analysis =Introduction by Guy Vanderhaeghe (2005) = In Penguin's Modern Classic edition, published 2005, Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe wrote the ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù for The Wars. Vanderhaeghe describes his first experience reading the novel on the ‚Äúlast leg of a long bus trip.‚Äù Vanderhaeghe states that he could not stop reading and, upon finishing the book, he was \\"strangely exalted and disturbed by an encounter with a novel harrowing and uplifting, a novel that was both a marvelous work of art and a passionate indictment of the first cruel idiocy of the twentieth century.\\" Vanderhaeghe also sets The Wars in the context of other works of historical war fiction. His main distinction between The Wars and works like War and Peace, The Naked and the Dead, From Here to Eternity, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and A Farewell to Arms is the compressed size of The Wars, usually being under two hundred pages (depending on the edition). Vanderhaeghe points towards Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front as being perhaps the only other work to \\"so efficiently compress and crystallize the horrors of combat in so few pages.\\" Vanderhaeghe continues, however, that \\"But unlike Remarque, Findley achieves this impressive economy by piecing together a collage of arresting images and brief, telling scenes that not only cohere in a compelling narrative but whose form mimics the fractured lives of soldiers and civilians shattered by war.\\" Throughout his introduction, Vanderhaeghe also argues that \\"The Wars is the finest historical novel ever written by a Canadian,\\" ending with the personal confession that \\"The Wars has always been, and shall remain for me, the loveliest, the most moving of novels.\\" =Symbols= Wars The plural \\"Wars\\" in the title implies that there are multiple conflicts within the novel. Robert's time in the army and his personal conflicts are among them, creating both external and internal struggles. Guy Vanderhaeghe, in his introduction to The Wars in Penguin's Modern Classics 2005 edition, states that \\"Like the frieze of horse and dog, or the occasional glimpse of Harris's blue scarf, the wars [emphasis in original] hovers in the reader's consciousness, heard as the faintest of dire whispers. It is as impossible to boil simple meaning from these two words as it is to impute clear and unambiguous motives' for Ross's actions, or to determine how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\\" The bald third-person summaries of casualties, contrasted with Robert's idealized view of war, also heighten the book's impact on readers. Animals Animals appear throughout the story. Among the most common or meaningful: *Birds represent danger and often appear as a sort of warning, with an attack following every time that Robert notices that the birds have stopped singing. Birds are sometimes shown to reflect what Robert is feeling. Birds also represent life and the personal freedom for which Robert fights. *The coyote represents the relationship between man and beast. It symbolizes companionship and loyalty, as the coyote willingly ran with Robert. *Rabbits appear throughout the novel, most notably as the pets that Rowena kept and that Robert was told to kill after her death. Rabbits, along with Rowena, symbolize innocence and purity. *Horses appear throughout the novel as well. Horses bring Robert to Eugene Taffler: Robert was corralling mustangs when he came across Taffler, who had returned and reenlisted in the war. The horse was often used in the novel as a means of transportation and companionship. When Robert finds a black mare while attempting to free a group of doomed military horses; this refers to the Book of Revelation, in which St. John the Divine describes a vision of a black horse whose rider is holding balances. In Robert's mind, the horses from the abandoned train represent his men, whom he had also been unable to save, as well as the last living creatures that he can attempt to protect. Horses also represent the happiness that Robert experienced before the war, as demonstrated in the old photograph of Rowena on a pony. Elements The four classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water are all featured in the novel. They each represent a trial that Robert Ross must overcome on his journey: *Earth appears as the mud that almost claims Robert's life in Ypres. *Air represents life. In the chlorine gas attack against the Allies, Robert neutralizes it with urine. *Fire represents destruction, pain, and death. It appears as gunfire, artillery fire, and flamethrowers. Harris's body is cremated instead of being buried. Finally, the flaming barn which appears in the Prologue and in Part Five claims the lives of Robert's horses and dog. *Water represents change: Robert takes a bath after Rowena's death; the skies are snowing at Rowena's funeral; Robert stands in the rain at the train station; the snow begins to melt when Mrs Ross leaves the church; and the war trenches are filled with rain. Pistol Robert's pistol is a powerful symbol of authority and security. It is also a tool with which Robert vents his violent feelings, such as when Juliet witnesses him destroying a tree with his gun. In other media A feature film version of The Wars was released in 1983. The film was directed by Robin Phillips from a screenplay written by Findley, and starred Brent Carver as Robert Ross.

Abraham Lincoln was invited to give the annual oration at the fair in 1859. He spoke on the principles of free labor - farmers and their families working for themselves without the use of hired labor - and of the interconnectedness of farmers, merchants, and other businesses. He advised farmers to embrace new methods of agriculture, with the goal of raising the standard of living.Eric Foner. The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.

For decades, the fair moved from city to city, including Janesville, Watertown, Fond du Lac, Madison and Milwaukee, until 1892, when it was first held at its permanent and present location at Wisconsin State Fair Park. During the 2011 fair, a small but violent flash mob was formed and began attacking fairgoers, with some witnesses stating that the attacks were racially-motivated. Eighteen people, including seven police officers, were injured during the event. In response, fair managers added a youth curfew and worked with civic and youth leaders to prevent a recurrence. On May 28, 2020, the state fair's board of directors announced the cancellation of the 2020 State Fair, due to the state's COVID-19 pandemic. Previous Fairs had been cancelled in 1917 and 1918, then 1942 through 1945, all due to World Wars I and II.  The Milwaukee Mile  The Milwaukee Mile is a one-mile paved oval racing circuit on the grounds of the State Fair. It is the oldest continuously-operated motor racing circuit in the world.Wisc. State Fair Park http://www.milwaukeemile.com/event_planning/mile.html Feb. 22, 2013 Racing or exhibition events are often held on the circuit in conjunction with the state fair.  Events and entertainment  Yearly features at the fair include a wide variety of vendors, many local and national bands, the Kids From Wisconsin, and a large assortment of food and drink, including cream puffs, which are one of the fair's most popular attractions. In 2010, the Wisconsin State Fair introduced Comet 2, a forty-foot roller coaster. New in 2012, the Wisconsin State Fair took over the Midway, creating Spin City, a collection of independently contracted rides including the Sizzler, the Freak Out, and the Stratosphere, a 200-foot-tall swing ride. The Main Stage features headline performance every evening of the fair. Many local bands can also be seen on smaller stages and pavilions located throughout the grounds. Agricultural exhibits of horses, cattle, sheep, chickens and other animals are featured every year at the fair. The Wisconsin State Fair is also home of the Wisconsin Wine Garden. Established in 1996 by the then ten member-wineries of the Wisconsin Winery Association, the Wine Garden features wines from dozens of Wisconsin wineries.

He was introduced by producer Michael Ferguson to revamp the show, and originally served as one of the show's leading protagonists throughout the 1990s; with the character first appearing in 22 February 1990 and then departing on 25 October 1999 after Kemp had opted to leave the show in 1999. He then returned to the show on 24 October 2005 for a few weeks and returned again between March and June 2006. Kemp was persuaded to return to the role for brief stints during a period of heavy media criticism aimed at EastEnders. The return proved to be a ratings success. Kemp reprised the role of Grant for various guest stints in 2016, appearing in twelve episodes between 13 May and 9 September. Throughout the course of his 1990s duration, Grant established himself as one of the show's most prominent characters. He was portrayed as a tough persona, wildly known for his fiery temper and his tendency to resort to violence. Despite this, however, his family is important to him ‚Äì particularly his relationship with his older brother Phil (Steve McFadden). Known as the \\"Mitchell brothers\\", Grant and Phil have become household names in the United Kingdom ‚Äì due to their association with the stereotypical black leather jacket wearing bald and brutal thug. They have been parodied even in adverts where their gruff, tough talking, cockney accents have been impersonated. One of EastEnders most popular and highly rated storylines was \\"Sharongate\\", where Grant discovers that his wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) has been having an affair with his brother. In light of this iconic revelation, Grant attacked Phil and exacted revenge on Sharon until she departed the programme following her betrayal. Grant then went on to embark on a second marriage with local barmaid Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon), up to the point where she gave birth to their daughter ‚Äì Courtney. However, their marriage ended in tragedy when Grant's prolonging mistreatment towards Tiffany ultimately led to her being accidentally killed by his would-be stepfather Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). The character has also become a prime suspect in the murder of Sharon's hated boss Eddie Royle (Michael Melia); sparked a longstanding feud with her best-friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully); clashed with Peggy's campaign rival George Palmer (Paul Moriarty); developed a close friendship with local shopkeeper Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley); formed a conflict with Sam's former boyfriend David Wicks (Michael French); slept with Nigel's wife Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard) they secretly harbored feelings for each other; cheated on Tiffany by having an affair with her mother Louise (Carol Harrison); triggered a rivalry with his archenemy Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco); disputed with Beppe's younger brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman); worked with Palmer's daughter Annie (Nadia Sawalha) on a jointed business venture at the local gym; established an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's would- be sworn nemesis, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); had a one-night stand with Phil's estranged wife Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth); exonerated Sam for the murder of Sharon's illegitimate father, Den (Leslie Grantham), by proving to his ex- wife that her stepmother Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman) was responsible for the crime; teamed up with Phil to confront their mother's gangland enemy, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), and get justice for the death of Sharon's adopted brother-turned-second husband Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) in the Get Johnny Week scenario; infuriated Kathy's son Ian (Adam Woodyatt) after sleeping with his eventual lover Jane (Laurie Brett) prior to their wedding; ended his third ill-fated marriage to Carla (Christianne Oliveira) upon learning that she turned him against Courtney; and discovered that he is the father of Michelle's secret son, Mark (Ned Porteous), in light of coping with losing his mother Peggy to cancer. Despite his tough nature, he is also a womanizer and has been involved in several relationships with an array of women - including Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), Nina Harris (Troy Titus-Adams), and Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin). While he has calmed down in recent years, Grant is still feared by people in and around Walford. Storylines =1990‚Äì1999= Grant Mitchell first arrived in Albert Square with his older brother Phil (Steve McFadden), and the pair become co-owners of the local garage - The Arches. Grant had returned from being a paratrooper in the Army who got involved in the Falklands War. After a brief fling with Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright) and getting involved in various dodgy deals, Grant starts wooing the local barmaid - Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). She grows attracted to his machismo, and soon their flirting progresses into a relationship. Fiercely protective of his girlfriend, most of Grant's initial problems in the Square revolve around his over-possessive nature and jealousy. He puts Sharon's boss Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), the landlord of The Queen Victoria public house, in hospital after he makes a pass at Sharon; he later becomes prime suspect for Royle's murder, but is proven innocent when the killer is revealed to be Nick Cotton (John Altman) - a local thug who eventually owns up to the crime. In the wake of this, Grant decides to re-enlist in the army; however, he is left despondent after getting rejected for failing their psychiatric tests. Sharon marry (1991). Despite his hot-headed tendencies, Sharon sees a different side to Grant, and when he proposes marriage to her, she accepts on the condition that he buys her childhood home, The Queen Vic, which he does. Grant marries Sharon and together they run The Queen Vic. Their marriage is stormy and punctuated with violent rows and fights. Grant is desperate for a child, and when he discovers Sharon is still taking contraception, he smashes up the pub and then disappears. In his absence, Sharon is comforted by Phil and they begin an affair, although this comes to an abrupt end when Grant returns and promises to change his ways. He cannot live up to his promises however, and on Sharon's birthday, Grant sets fire to The Queen Vic to generate insurance money to pay off debts. He does not check to see if Sharon is out of the way, and she and her dog Roly nearly die in the blaze. The insurance money is insufficient, and Sharon reacts with fury when she discovers what Grant has done. She leaves Grant for a while, and when she returns and attempts to seize control of The Queen Vic; Grant turns violent, assaults Sharon and her best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and is imprisoned on remand. While he is in prison, Sharon and Phil rekindle their affair, but neither can confess to Grant, and it ends when he is released from prison. Sharon and Grant patch up their relationship; however, Grant discovers a tape on which Sharon talks about her affair with Phil, and plays it to a packed pub at Phil's engagement party to his fiance - Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). In response, Grant batters Phil in revenge - leaving him with a ruptured spleen - and bullies Sharon until she flees to the United States. She returns briefly to enact revenge, making Grant realise that he is still in love with her, he chooses to be with Sharon over his family. Sharon is ready to turn him down in front of a packed pub and his family. However, in the end, she cannot go through with it, and stops him from publicly proposing before he humiliates himself. She then confesses to him that she still loves him, before returning to the US, leaving Grant heartbroken. Michelle has a volatile relationship with Grant but, following Sharon's exit, falls pregnant following a one-night stand with him and then flees to the US without telling Grant that he is to be a father. Grant would not find out that the baby is his until years later. He goes on to marry Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon), who soon becomes pregnant - although it is unclear whether he or Tiffany's ex-partner Tony (Mark Homer) is the father of her child. When Grant discovers this, he is incensed and throws Tiffany out. He begins a relationship with Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard), until a paternity test reveals that Grant is the father of his baby, Courtney (Carissa and Josephine O'Meara). He reunites with Tiffany to be near his daughter, but by this time his marriage has deteriorated. When Tiffany discovers that Grant has had an affair with her mother Louise Raymond (Carol Harrison), she plans to flee to Spain with Courtney. However, Grant discovers her plan and retrieves Courtney. Tiffany attempts to snatch Courtney, but is hit by a car driven by Grant's stepfather Frank Butcher (Mike Reid); she dies instantly as the clock struck midnight. Grant tries to move on by dating barmaid Nina Harris (Troy Titus-Adams) for a while, but dumps her after discovering the latter's past as a prostitute. It is at this point that Grant and Phil have established themselves as the undisputed hardman of the square's local borough - Walford; the pair have spent the entirely of the 1990s decade embarking on criminal activities, amongst other separate shenanigans. Despite the majority of occasions when the pair clashed, particularly in the follow-up to Phil's affair with Sharon, the two brothers remained faithful to each other. This impact heightens in 1999 when Grant goes into partnership with Phil's archenemy Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), and they end up having a feud - which ends with Grant punching Steve after getting annoyed with his disrespectful attitude towards him. By then, Grant and Phil have conducted a plan to cheat some gangsters by intercepting a drug deal and stealing a large amount of cash - in order to take care of their debts. The job is initially successful, but is quickly grows obstructive when Phil finds out that Grant had slept his ex-wife Kathy before doing the job. He confronts Grant after the job and Grant admits he did it in revenge for Phil having sex with Sharon. As they attempt to flee from the oncoming police, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots the steering wheel in their getaway car - causing Grant to plunge the car into the River Thames. Phil is rescued, but Grant is not found and presumed dead. It soon transpires a week later that Grant has survived, and he leaves the country with both Courtney and the stolen money to Rio de Janeiro. =2005‚Äì2006= Grant returns to Walford with Phil to exonerate their younger sister, Sam (Kim Medcalf), for the murder of her ex-boss and Sharon's adopted father - Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Although she was involved in the events surrounding Den's murder, Sam was framed for the crime by his widow and her nemesis Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman) - the real murderer. Grant manages to put behind him his differences with both Phil and Sharon, forgiving Sharon when she confesses that she aborted his child. The two brothers manage to convince Sharon that Chrissie is the real killer and that Sam is innocent. Whilst teaming up with Phil and Sharon to prove Sam's innocence, Grant forms a rivalry with her husband Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) - who had previously teamed up with Den to imprison Phil for robbery. Grant and Dennis soon put their differences aside to help Phil with their conflict against Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), the local gangland kingpin who holds a grudge against the Mitchell brothers because of their mother - Peggy (Barbara Windsor). When Johnny extracts CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing to her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) that she killed Den, he plans to use the tape as bait for Phil and Grant - intending to kill them. The brothers eventually beat Johnny at his nightclub office in order to get the tape, which is promptly delivered to the police; as a result, Sam is released from prison and Chrissie is arrested for Den's murder. Following Sam's release, Grant initially returns to Rio - only to later come back to Walford with Courtney (now played by Megan Jossa), citing family and financial problems back in Brazil. When Phil learns about his brother's return, he tricks Grant into helping him with quest against Johnny. During Grant's absence, Phil and Johnny embarked on a feud that led to Dennis and Sharon getting involved. The impact escalated after Dennis humiliated Johnny on Christmas Day 2005, which prompted Johnny to throttle Sharon with an ultimatum; Dennis will be killed unless she and him leave Walford for good. On the eve of 2006 commencing, Dennis learned from Phil about the threat Johnny made to Sharon - as well as being told that Johnny killed his best-friend and Sam's ex-husband, Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), on the same night Chrissie killed Den. This resulted in Dennis beating up Johnny, who then ordered Jake's brother Danny (Jake Maskall) - his henchman - to kill Dennis. Following Dennis' murder, Phil was wracked with guilt for sparking the events of Sharon losing her husband and has vowed revenge on Johnny more than ever. After hearing Phil explain his reasons for wanting to bring Johnny to justice for killing Dennis, specifically as a promise he made to Sharon before she left Walford, Grant reluctantly accompanies his brother in settling their score with Johnny once and for all. Their efforts quickly falter by Grant arguing with Phil about the situation he has put them in, all the while Phil demands Grant to maintain their course against Johnny - who uses this opportunity to capture the brothers. Johnny later orders Danny to kill the brothers and bury them in the woods. After marching them into the forest for execution, Danny prepares to kill Grant; however, the brothers are saved when Jake appears and shoots Danny - accidentally killing him. After telling the brothers that it was Danny who killed Dennis on Johnny's orders, Jake allows Phil and Grant to flee whilst he himself proceeds to bury Danny in the woods. Phil and Grant rush back to Johnny's mansion to confront him once more, only to find out that he has already been arrested; Johnny surrendered to the police after his daughter, Ruby (Louisa Lytton) threatened to disown her father unless he confessed to his crimes. Following his arrest, Johnny is sentenced to life imprisonment and later dies of a heart attack - allowing Phil and Grant to finally put their demons to reason for good. The brothers reconcile after Phil apologises to Grant for the situation he put them in, and Grant forgives Phil for his actions. As time goes on, Grant begins flirting with Jane Collins (Laurie Brett) - the girlfriend of Kathy's son Ian (Adam Woodyatt) - after seducing her. Their affair ends when Phil catches them together and Grant then has a one-night stand with 19-year-old Chelsea Fox - to his mother's outrage. Shortly after, his estranged Brazilian wife, Carla (Christianne Oliveira), shows up in Walford. Grant and Carla resume their relationship, but Carla's ex-partner Ray (David Kennedy) soon arrives to retrieve ¬£12,000 that Carla has stolen from him. Carla and Ray resume their affair and plan to fleece Grant for ¬£25,000. Grant learns of Carla's scam; unbeknownst to Carla he chases Ray away and leads Carla to believe he has fallen for her lies. Grant catches her attempting to steal his money and reacts by dumping her in a litter bin, ending their marriage. After quitting his job at the newly reopened Scarlet nightclub, currently owed by Jake following Johnny's imprisonment, Grant leaves the country again with Courtney for a new life in Portugal. =2016= In May 2016, Peggy returns to Albert Square following a diagnosis of terminal cancer. She decides to stop her treatment, but Phil tries to change her mind, enlisting the help of Sharon. Sharon then calls Grant in Portugal, leaving a voicemail saying that his family needs him. Grant returns to the square soon after and walks in on Phil and Peggy. He plans to take Peggy with him back to Portugal, only for her to say that her cancer is active. Grant is angry when Peggy reveals that her plan for him and Sam to learn about it was by letters to them after her death by suicide, however Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil he immediately needs the money that he lent him. Knowing he cannot get it, Grant threatens him unless he returns the money. Grant returns to Portugal, and Sharon has to call him about Peggy having killed herself. When Sam returns to Walford for Peggy's funeral, she reveals that Grant is unable to attend the funeral, although Grant secretly attends, laying a flower and watching from a distance. When Grant's nephew Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) goes missing and Phil is reluctant to get the police involved, Sharon contacts Grant for help, but Courtney (now played by Alice Nokes) meets Sharon instead; Grant has not seen the messages. Sharon decides to go to the police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney to ask to stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting to tell him about Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with Aunt Sal (Anna Karen) due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend Paul Coker (Jonny Labey). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal. Mark also works out who Grant is, but Sharon convinces him he is better off with his adoptive father - Tim. Character creation =Background= In the latter part of 1989 EastEnders executive producer Michael Ferguson, had taken over from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's The Bill ‚Äî a hard-hitting and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging EastEnders in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London. Due to his success on The Bill, Peter Cregeen, the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of EastEnders. Following a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comedic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen. Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake has said that it was a challenging period, but \\"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\\". As a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters, including Marge Green (Pat Coombs), Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), Trevor Short (Phil McDermott) and Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton), were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters. Two major new characters, the Mitchell brothers, made their first appearance in February 1990. Ferguson wanted to introduce a couple of young men who would bring an air of danger, characters who would be \\"unpredictable\\" and \\"bursting with energy\\". Phil and Grant Mitchell went on to become major long-term characters, rooted firmly at the heart of the series. =Casting= Grant as he appeared in 1994. To cast Phil and Grant Mitchell many actors were screen-tested together. This was done to assure that the chosen actors ‚Äî who would work predominantly alongside each other ‚Äî had a strong rapport and physical resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth has commented: \\"There were some good actors we had to turn down because we couldn't find the 'right' brother\\". Ross Kemp was chosen to play Grant. Kemp was an actor with a stocky, muscular build and shaven hair, making him an ideal choice to play one of Walford's latest \\"tough-men\\". Steve McFadden was given the role of Phil. Both actors worked well and convincingly together and both shared similar physical characteristics, such as short cropped hair and a \\"round, open face\\" ‚Äî facial characteristics also shared by Danniella Westbrook, who was chosen to play their sister Samantha partly because of this (Westbrook was later recast, with Kim Medcalf taking over). =Personality= Of the two brothers Grant was the more volatile, but both had a sense of physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War. Grant often displayed laddish, thrill- seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, gambling and living off of his wits. He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this was that he was one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness. Another was that he went to console Nigel Bates after his wife, Debbie, was killed by in a road accident. Grant took great pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local reputation as a boxer. He always strived to live up to the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained. While Grant liked to think of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered. Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch.\\"Happy Birthday EastEnders\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 3 December 2006. Because of this, he attracted many women, despite the fact that he often treated them as possessions, disregarding their feelings and eliciting exaggerated revenge should they cross him (resulting in spousal abuse and the destruction of all three of his marriages).\\"The queens of mean\\", The Guardian. URL last accessed on 3 December 2006. His quick temper was off-set by a period of genuine remorse and promises that he would change. However, more often than not, Grant reverted to form and when placed under pressure he seemed incapable of controlling his aggression, disregarding all consequences.\\"EastEnders Blood Ties\\", avalonbooks. URL last accessed on 3 December 2006. Character development and impact The Mitchell brothers quickly became two of the soap's most popular characters and storylines involving the brothers soon began to dominate the programme. Their arrival heralded a new era for the soap, which aptly coincided with the beginning of a new decade ‚Äî EastEnders during the 1980s having been very much dominated by the hugely popular Fowler and Watts families. =Sharongate= One of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Grant was a love triangle between him, his brother and his wife Sharon (played by Letitia Dean). Despite the fact that Sharon married Grant initially, EastEnders writer Tony Jordan has revealed in The Mitchells - The Full Story that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers came to the realisation that Sharon was perfect for them both.\\"Mitchells Special\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 18 September 2006. This storyline was slow burning and was spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious three-handers. Sue Dunderdale directed the episodes and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama. Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of EastEnders' most popular and renowned episodes, which have been dubbed \\"Sharongate\\".\\"Sharongate\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 18 September 2006. The episodes ‚Äî which were watched by 25.3 million viewers\\"Profiles: EastEnders Kemp and McFadden\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 18 September 2006. ‚Äî centred around Grant's discovery of the affair and his startling reaction. The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the brothers throughout the 1990s. Writer of Sharongate, Tony Jordan, has stated that of all the storylines he has penned for the soap, Sharongate is the one he is most proud of. He comments \\"Three of the strongest characters that have ever been in EastEnders are the Mitchell brothers and Sharon... when we actually blew that story it was incredible... being able to reach that many people with your work is what makes EastEnders exciting.\\"\\"Tony Jordan interview\\", youtube. URL last accessed on 24 February 2007. Sharongate has also proven a popular storyline with viewers and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of the decade in a poll of 17,000 people for What's On TV magazine. =Volatile marriage to Tiffany= From 1996 to 1998 viewers were gripped by Grant's combustible marriage to Tiffany Raymond (played by Martine McCutcheon). Their relationship was a typical portrayal of unrequited love on Tiffany's side and was fraught with tragedy and drama. For Grant it was more a marriage of convenience, allowing him access to his daughter, Courtney. Grant's poor treatment of Tiffany included physical and emotional abuse and two affairs, one of which was with her mother Louise (played by Carol Harrison) and the other with Lorraine Wicks (played by Jacqueline Leonard). Their volatile relationship made headlines in July 1997 amid reports that EastEnders bosses were considering airing a highly controversial storyline that saw Tiffany brutally raped by Grant. The plot, which was slated to be aired on Christmas Day 1997, evoked high criticism from female MPs and children's groups, TV clean-up campaigners and church officials, who were all expressive in unanimous condemnation about the BBC's \\"cynical ploy to win the seasonal ratings war over arch-rival Coronation Street.\\" Labour MP Anne Clywd suggested that the BBC should \\"reconsider\\" and Michelle Elliott, director of the children's charity Kidscape, said: \\"This is an appalling, outrageous, utterly nauseous example of rape for ratings.\\" Reports also alleged that actor Ross Kemp was not happy about the plot either and threatened to quit the role unless the scripts were altered. Subsequently, the plot never came to fruition.\\"EastEnder hardman Ross says he'll quit over Christmas Day rape plot\\", Sunday Mirror. URL last accessed on 24 February 2007. The following year EastEnders topped the ratings at Christmas 1998 when Grant was accused of the attempted murder of Tiffany, and the following Monday 15.7 million viewers tuned in to see Grant make a first court appearance.\\"Tiffany helps trounce ITV\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 24 February 2007. The year finally culminated with the death of Tiffany ‚Äî killed in a motor accident, while trying to reclaim her daughter from Grant. 22 million viewers tuned in to see Grant and Tiffany's final clash on New Year's Eve 1998.\\"Tiffany's death\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 24 February 2007. =Initial departure and The Mitchell Brothers car crash= On 24 March 1999, it was reported that Kemp had decided to leave EastEnders after almost ten years of playing Grant. The storyline signifying his departure played heavily on the Mitchell brothers' fragile and damaged relationship.

The character was played by Rebecca Michael from 1989 to 1993, Alexia Demetriou from 1993 to 1996, and Charlie Brooks from 1999 to 2014. Brooks departed on 7 May 2004. After a three episode guest stint in April 2008 which saw the character reappear for her father Frank's funeral, Brooks agreed to reprise her role full-time, returning permanently on 18 December 2008. Brooks then took a break in 2012, with the character off-screen from September 2012 until April 2013. She later departed again, with the character making her final appearance on 20 March 2014. Janine's story arc typically involve her in an antagonistic role; the character has been described as a \\"super-bitch\\" and a \\"classic villainess\\". Her storylines include prostitution, drug addiction, financial worries, becoming rich, and experiencing agoraphobia. During her major stints on the show, Janine has developed an ambivalent relationship with both her older brother Ricky (Sid Owen) and their troubled father Frank (Mike Reid); triggered a longstanding conflict with her stepmother Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement); conducted a scheme with her friend Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) to fleece Pat's stepson Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), whom she later married on New Years Eve 2003 and then killed on New Years Day 2004; been wrongfully charged for the death of her sworn enemy Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman); forged a wedding with a wealthy Jewish businessman, David (Harry Towb), that ended with the latter abruptly dying of a fatal heart attack; sparked a prolonged feud with Frank's second wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor); accidentally ran over local resident Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) in a hit and run incident; conspired with Peggy's brother-in-law Archie (Larry Lamb) to defraud the Mitchell family from their ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; becoming a prime suspect in Archie's murder investigation; established a marriage with her colleague Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) that culminated with her trying to kill him; framed her arch-rival Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) for attempted murder; embarked on a fourth marriage with fellow entrepreneur Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) that led to her conceiving their child, Scarlett; and falsely implicated Scarlett's nanny Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) in Michael's murder, after Janine killed had him at the climax of their intensifying custody battle for Scarlett. The follow-up to Janine killing Michael and eluding conviction for the crime, just as she did for both Barry's murder and Danielle's death respectively, saw the character being shunned in her local community ‚Äì thus facilitating her third and final departure from the programme. Storylines =Backstory= Janine was born just four years before her mother, June, died from cancer and she subsequently went to live with her sister Claire (Lucy Foxell; Caroline O'Neill). Eventually, Janine's father, Frank (Mike Reid), moved to Walford with her older siblings Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane (Sophie Lawrence) - as well as with his beloved wife Pat Wicks (Pam St Clement). Soon afterwards, Clare moved to Manchester in 1989 - leaving Janine with Pat and Frank. =1989‚Äì2004= A troublesome child, Janine throws tantrums, runs away, is a bed-wetter, a sleepwalker, a thief, a compulsive liar, self-harmer and hates Pat. Unable to discipline her, Pat forces Frank to take Janine to family therapy, which helps somewhat. Janine refuses to go to school and Ricky finds out she is being bullied. When Frank has a breakdown and disappears in 1994, Janine stays with Pat but finds her father's absence upsetting. Janine makes friends with Clare Bates (Gemma Bissix) and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and they cause trouble for Felix Kawalski (Harry Landis), when they spread rumours that he is a pervert who murdered his wife, and keeps her body in his cellar. She is overjoyed when Frank returns and they move to Manchester in 1996. However, Frank returns to Walford in 1998, leaving Janine with Clare. Janine returns in 1999 to live with Frank and his new wife, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). She sets about coming between them, constantly trying to antagonise Frank with rebellious behaviour. She sleeps with Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) and humiliates him by spreading rumours about his inadequate prowess. Frank abandons Janine in 2000 after the breakdown of his marriage. Homeless, Janine is taken in by Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards); they start a business together as estate agents. Terry sees Janine as a surrogate daughter but her constant manipulation tests his patience. Janine uses him for money, deliberately dresses like his late daughter Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), ruins his relationships with women and tries to seduce him. Janine also has a relationship with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) until he runs out of money. This behaviour infuriates Terry but Janine starts using cocaine, pestering Terry for money to feed her habit. When he refuses, she resorts to sex with her drug dealer, Lee Vickers (Dermot Keaney), in exchange for cocaine; Vickers beats Terry up when he tries to warn him off. When he sees Janine's lack of remorse, Terry throws her out and leaves Walford, ignoring her pleas for him to stay. Owing Vickers money for drugs, Janine turns to prostitution under the pseudonym \\"Blonde Bombshell\\". One of her clients, Matt Lindsay (Matthew Steer), falls in love with her and proposes but attempts suicide when he learns she is still a prostitute. Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) begins using her services but she blackmails him, threatening to tell his wife Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman) unless he pays her. Depressed, Janine begins drinking heavily and nearly dies of alcohol poisoning. She gives up prostitution, but when Laura discovers that she has been having sex with Ian, she throws a pan of boiling milk in Janine's face. Janine becomes agoraphobic as a result and eats dog food because she is too afraid to go outside to buy food. She eventually gets over this with Billy's help. Janine hopes to rekindle their relationship but is devastated when she learns that he is in love with Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth). Her attempts to ruin their blossoming romance fail. Janine gets a job working at Barry Evans' (Shaun Williamson) car lot after becoming friendly with Barry, following his father's death. She and her friend, Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) plan to fleece Barry out of his money. She seduces Barry and moves in with him, but sleeps with Paul too. Barry eventually proposes to Janine, and she accepts, thinking that Barry has a life-threatening heart murmur. They marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in Scotland, but Janine is furious to learn Barry's illness is a false alarm. They take a stroll around the hills and cliffs, but Janine cracks and admits everything. Barry refuses to believe that she does not love him and tries to embrace her. Repulsed, Janine pushes him away and he falls down a cliff, fatally hitting his head on a rock; Janine watches him die. As his widow, Janine inherits Barry's estate and has him cremated in Scotland, denying his friends and family a chance to pay their respects. This makes Barry's ex-wife, Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed), suspicious, and she becomes close to Paul, who feels guilty about his role in Barry's death. Spurred on by Natalie, Paul gives a statement to the police, implicating Janine in Barry's death. She is arrested, but released without charge, due to lack of evidence, and spitefully tells Natalie that she has got away with murder; however, telling Pat proves to be her downfall. Pat is also friends with Laura, who has a feud with Janine. Janine angers the locals by reporting Laura for benefit fraud and announces it in The Queen Victoria public house. Janine and Laura are seen fighting just before Laura dies after falling down the stairs. It is noted in the post mortem that Laura had recently been in a fight, due to bruising and Janine's skin is found under her nails. Although Janine was with Pat when Laura died, Pat refuses to give Janine an alibi, and brands her \\"pure evil\\". In desperation, Janine goes to Paul and offers to sleep with him in return for an alibi, but Paul refuses. She is arrested by the police, charged with Laura's murder and remanded in custody in May 2004. Janine stands trial off- screen in 2005, and Frank tries to persuade Pat to tell the truth in court, giving Janine an alibi. Pat refuses, but a conversation with Laura's mother, Edwina Dunn (Gay Hamilton), forces Pat to tell the court what really happened. Janine is released but leaves Frank outside the courtroom. =2008‚Äì2014= Janine returns for Frank's funeral and is angry that he has not left money in his will; she scatters his ashes before departing. Pat and Ricky later discover that Janine is masquerading as a Jewish orphan named \\"Judith Bernstein\\" so she can marry an elderly Jewish man named David (Harry Towb) for his money. They trace Janine to a synagogue, where, just after Janine and David are married, Pat declares that Janine is \\"about as Jewish as a bacon sandwich\\". David has a heart attack and dies, and a now homeless Janine has no choice but to return to Walford. She makes various enemies, among them Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), whom Janine drugs and then restrains so she can gain a taped confession of his past misdemeanours, which she uses as blackmail to gain control of Walford's car lot. Pat and Jack usurp her, reclaiming the business. Whilst driving around the square, Janine accidentally knocks down Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), the long lost daughter of Jack's girlfriend Ronnie (Samantha Womack); moments later, Danielle dies and Janine is left guilt-ridden. Though Janine is cleared of any blame, it causes a rift between her and the Mitchells. In need of money, Janine teams up with Ronnie's father Archie (Larry Lamb); they make plans to ruin the Mitchell family by taking The Queen Vic from them. When they manipulate Archie's niece Sam (Danniella Westbrook) into breaking her bail terms, the Mitchells lose bail surety and face financial ruin. Ian provides the Mitchells with a loan on condition they use their pub as collateral. Janine has sex with Ian, recording the tryst, then blackmails him, threatening to show his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) unless he sells the Mitchell loan to Archie. Archie subsequently takes control of The Queen Vic when the Mitchells are unable to meet the terms of the loan. Meanwhile, Janine and her flatmate Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), with whom Janine is having sex, plan to fleece Archie. He and Janine announce their engagement, but on Christmas Day, Archie ‚Äì who has realised Janine is intending to con him ‚Äì throws her onto the street, leaving her distraught. That same day, Archie is murdered by an unknown assailant. Janine becomes a suspect for his murder, though she denies it and feigns distress over Archie's death. While she attempts to frame Ian and the Mitchells for the murder, Peggy attempts to frame her, planting evidence in her flat, which leads to an arrest but no charge. In the end, Janine is cleared and fellow resident Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is held falsely responsible for the murder - although, unknown to everyone, Archie's killer was in fact Bradley's wife Stacey (Lacey Turner) - whom he had previously raped amid his conspiracy with Janine. When Ryan confesses his love for Janine, she recoils, but when he attempts to leave Walford, she admits she loves him too. Despite Janine nearly straying on her hen night, she and Ryan marry, but marital happiness is short- lived when Ryan discovers he is the father of Stacey's daughter Lily. A feud erupts between Janine and Stacey when Janine reports her to Social Services for neglecting Lily. Later, Janine kidnaps Lily, suggesting to Ryan they leave Walford with the child to separate Ryan from Stacey. Her games push Ryan and Stacey closer together and they begin an affair. When Janine finds out, she vows to kill them both. She buys sedatives and poisons Ryan. He is left bedridden but manages to escape and ends their marriage publicly after being released from hospital. Hurt and angry, Janine discovers Stacey is Archie's murderer and goes public with this, but is largely ignored with no concrete evidence. Desperate, Janine visits Stacey; she stabs herself to try to frame Stacey for her own attempted murder, but Stacey escapes the country before arrest. Blaming Janine for Stacey's departure, Ryan refuses to reunite with Janine and attempts to kill her by removing her oxygen tubing when she is hospitalised. She is saved by Ricky's chance arrival, but both Ricky and Pat denounce Janine's actions when she admits her injuries are self-inflicted. Ricky and Janine receive news that their maternal rich grandmother, Lydia Simmonds (Margaret Tyzack/Heather Chasen), is ill and in need of care. Janine takes her grandmother in, with the ulterior motive of inheriting her fortune. Janine learns that Lydia is very similar to herself and they both put on an act of hating each other. Janine eventually admits she loves her grandmother, but Lydia's health quickly deteriorates. Janine discovers Lydia has left all her money to charity, but admits to Lydia she no longer cares during a heartfelt conversation. Before she dies, Lydia explains that she wanted to look after Janine after her mother died, but Pat and Frank would not allow it. Janine is devastated by Lydia's death, but her family, including Pat, accuse her of killing her. At Ryan's behest, Janine is questioned by police, but released without charge, and Janine is stunned when she inherits Lydia's estate, making her a millionaire. Janine later happily achieves full closure from Ryan after learning that he has fled Walford. Janine buys various properties and businesses; she starts a property management company and a women's fitness centre with her boyfriend Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). She also buys a share in the nightclub R&R;, making Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) her reluctant partner; both clash over the running of the club. When Pat needs money to pay debts, Janine gives her a loan, insisting Pat use her house as collateral. She later brings the loan payment deadline forward, refusing to believe Pat is dying. Despite a period of animosity, Janine makes peace with Pat before her death, with Pat convincing a pregnant Janine to keep Michael's child. Janine accepts Michael's marriage proposal after he reluctantly agrees to sign a prenuptial agreement. When Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) tells everyone, including Janine, that Michael stole her money and lied to her, Janine refuses to believe Jean's claims and dismisses them because Jean is bipolar. However, Janine's enemy Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) returns and demands Janine repay the funds, or she will go to the police. Michael eventually confesses the truth to Janine on her wedding day and offers her an ultimatum: that she rip up the prenuptial agreement or the wedding is off. Janine is torn between the two but eventually agrees to cancel the pre- nup; Janine and Michael marry but she goes into labour 11 weeks early at the wedding reception. At the hospital, Janine undergoes a cesarean and her daughter is put into an incubator, which distresses Janine, who wants to see her. The baby is named Scarlett. Janine begins to doubt Michael's intent when he asks to be a signatory on the business accounts and buys a sports car, so orders Billy to change the combination on the office safe. Michael's strange behaviour continues, leaving Janine convinced he is having an affair. She confronts him, offering him a suitcase of money and saying that if he really loves her, he will refuse to take it. Michael is furious and tells Janine that she cannot hope to be a good mother to their baby. Believing him to be right, Janine packs her bags and hands Scarlett to Michael, taking the money and leaving. Michael is informed that Janine has transferred all the money from her bank accounts and has ordered that her business Butcher's Joints be closed down, transferring all her properties over to another estate agent, leaving Michael with nothing. Several months later, Janine returns to Walford and visits Michael, where Kat tells her how Michael has coped without her. Janine tells Michael that she is back for Scarlett, and says he will be hearing from her lawyer. Janine manipulates Michael into giving her custody of Scarlett, and she denies Michael parental access. She then hires Michael's former nanny, Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) to look after Scarlett, pleasing Michael, as Alice is on his side. When Janine catches Alice stealing jewellery from her house, Alice explains she is stressed because Michael is putting demands on her to see Scarlett, and she has been letting him do so. Janine agrees that it is better for Scarlett, in the long-run, to have a relationship with both her parents. At Ian's restaurant opening, Janine, as an investor, has the sign and name of the restaurant changed from \\"Ian Beale @ Le Square\\" to \\"Scarlett's\\" which pleases Michael. They apparently call a truce, but Janine then leaves in a car with Scarlett, telling Michael that she may never return. Michael eventually tracks Janine down and she returns to Walford. She employs Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), who Michael is jealous of, and buys a share in Michael's boxing club. Janine has sex with Danny but tells him that it is a one off. She rehires Alice as her nanny, unaware that she is still being manipulated by Michael, but fires her again when she tells Janine that she had sex with Michael. The increasing animosity between Janine and Michael leads to her taking out an injunction out against him. Michael then begins a plot to kill Janine, and involves Alice in his plans. Alice has second thoughts and tells Janine of Michael's plans. When Janine confronts Michael, he tries to strangle her, leading to Alice stabbing Michael in the back to stop him. Alice then leaves to answer the door, but realising Michael is still alive, Janine stabs him again in the stomach, killing him. Alice believes she killed him, and Janine tells the police that Alice stabbed Michael twice and also attacked her, and tells Alice that the real story is something her mind created. Alice's brother, Joey Branning (David Witts), seduces a lonely Janine in a bid to extract the truth from her, but fails. Janine's former stepbrother David Wicks (Michael French) suspects that Janine is guilty of the murder, so he manipulates her into allowing him to stay at her house, and then into admitting that she killed Michael. David promises to keep her secret, but has secretly recorded the confession on his phone. Meanwhile, Janine is planning to buy The Queen Vic, and sells her share of R&R; and her car to do so. David then reveals the recording to Janine and blackmails her into giving him the ¬£250,000 she has raised. Janine panics, and tries to kill David by hitting him with a car. However, he suffers only minor injuries. After she hands over the cash, he threatens to call the police anyway. She convinces him to give her a day to get away, but Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) finds David's phone and plays the confession. She gives the phone to Joey, who calls the police and Janine is arrested for Michael's murder, and is dragged away by the police, sobbing hysterically. In February 2014, Kat visits Janine in prison and tries to convince her to drop her statement against Stacey. Janine agrees on the condition that Kat provides her with a false witness testimony to Michael's murder, backing up Janine's story that Alice killed him. At the trial, Kat agrees and does as she is told. However, halfway through the trial, Alice tries to kill herself in her cell and is immediately rushed to hospital. Because of this, Janine feels guilty and tells the truth. The jury later returns with a not guilty verdict for both Alice and Janine. After recovering, Alice goes back to live with her mother, as she is too distraught to return to Walford. Meanwhile, Janine briefly returns to Walford and tries to make amends with the locals in The Queen Vic, but everyone, including Carol, is completely hostile towards her and she is forced to leave. Janine then leaves for Paris to join Scarlett and Diane, and it is hinted that she plans to con a couple who have won the lottery. Off-screen in December 2019, Janine sells the house that Kat and the Slater family are living in to Kheerat Panesar (Jaz Deol), leaving them homeless for Christmas. Creation and development =Casting and characterisation= The character was first mentioned in September 1987, when her father Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) first appeared on-screen. Frank and his children Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) were introduced as regular characters in 1988. However, Janine did not become a regular character until a year later, in June 1989, her arrival completing the Butcher family. Janine was initially seen as a 6-year-old, played by Rebecca Michael. In 1993, following a storyline that saw her stepmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) imprisoned for manslaughter, Janine was sent to stay with her off-screen sister Clare Butcher, but she returned later that year, played by 11-year-old Alexia Demetriou who reigned as Janine from 14 October 1993 until 12 March 1996, when the character was written out again, as Demetriou left to concentrate on her studies. Executive producer Matthew Robinson re- introduced Janine in 1999 as a 16-year-old played by Charlie Brooks. On her getting the part Brooks said, \\"It's funny, but for as long as I can remember I knew I was going to make it, I never worried about my career or money, and when I left college I was headstrong and confident and felt very grown. Then I joined EastEnders and I felt like a lost little girl. I remember the casting director taking me to meet Patsy Palmer on my first day there and, because I'd been watching EastEnders since I was little, I actually felt sick. Janine's storylines typically involve her in an antagonistic role; the character has been described as a \\"super-bitch\\" and a \\"classic villainess\\". =Relationships= Relationship with Ryan Malloy In December 2009, the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer teased about upcoming storylines involving Janine and her flatmate Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), saying: \\"There's something really interesting with Ryan and Janine [...]. They're both people who don't know how to love. So will they fall in love? And if they do, can they cope with it? Will they understand the alien feelings coursing through their bodies?\\" In August 2010, Janine proposes to Ryan. Brooks said that the idea of getting married would be daunting for the character, but added that she believes Janine is genuinely in love with Ryan. She commented: \\"It's easy to assume that Janine is playing games or using him for sex, but [...] Ryan clearly adores her too, so he may be the man to tame her wild ways.\\" Brooks hinted at possible trouble for the couple if Janine discovers that Ryan fathered a baby with Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), saying \\"Janine will be absolutely destroyed when she finds out. She wants Ryan all to herself, and the idea of a baby snatching his attention away would be devastating. All she needs is to be loved.\\" McDermott stated that he believed Ryan was the right man for Janine, and that they could be perfect for each other, saying: \\"Janine's never loved any of the men she's been with before. She has only ever been in it for the money. Ryan understands her and knows why she does the things she does. They both forgive one another's mistakes very easily, and that's why their partnership works.\\" Lydia Simmonds In February 2011, Janine's estranged grandmother, Lydia Simmonds, \\"a lady of class and dignity,\\" was announced. Lydia's backstory states that she loved her daughter June but hated the man she married, Frank, so she grew old alone. Lydia and Janine have been estranged for many years and Janine is shocked to have her grandmother back in her life. Executive Producer Bryan Kirkwood said: \\"I can't wait to see Janine meet her match.\\" =Drug addiction= In 2002, a storyline saw Janine using drugs and prostituting to fund the habit. She was shown about to snort cocaine in a scene that sparked viewer complaints to the BBC. Brooks has said about Janine's behaviour: \\"Sleeping with her pusher is very sad and desperate. But she feels she has to do it to get more drugs. Janine has such low self-esteem that she's deliberately reckless. She thinks, 'Why not take drugs if they make me feel good about myself for a while?' I think she knows she's on a slippery slope but she believes she can get out of it like she's always done before.\\" =Departure (2004)= The character was written out of the series in the spring of 2004 when Janine was charged with the murder of Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman) and remanded in custody. Brooks rejected an offer to re-appear in late 2005 for the murder trial, although BBC bosses did persuade Mike Reid to make his final appearances as Frank Butcher for scenes involving his former wife Pat during the duration of the trial. =Reintoduction (2008)= Three years after her initial departure, Brooks was asked to reprise the role by executive producer Diederick Santer as part of a storyline that was dubbed \\"Frank Week\\". Mike Reid died in July 2007, and due to the popularity of the character he played, Santer decided that Frank would also be killed off in the serial. A funeral was held for the character as a tribute to both the actor and the \\"iconic\\" character he played. Brooks was one of several actors brought back to the show especially for the storyline. She was joined by Sophie Lawrence, who played her older sister Diane Butcher, and Sid Owen as her brother Ricky. Following the conclusion of her three episode guest stint in April 2008, it was announced the following month that Brooks would reprise her role as Janine on a full-time basis. Brooks said she was \\"thrilled\\" to be back and admitted her recent appearance gave her \\"a taste\\" of being Janine again. Executive producer, Santer, said her recent appearances \\"reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine\\". He promised a longer spell on the programme would enable viewers to see \\"what makes Janine tick\\" and also find out where she got the \\"flashy big black car\\" with which she was seen at the funeral. Janine's return scenes aired in December 2008. In June 2009, she signed a three-year contract. =Sabbatical and second departure (2014)= In February 2012, Brooks announced that she would take a six-month break from the show later in the year, and departed on 14 September. Brooks returned to filming on 21 February 2013 and returned on screen on 18 April that year. On 28 October 2013, it was announced that Brooks had decided to leave the show for a third time, but to allow for her to return again, the character would not be killed off. Following Janine's arrest on Christmas Day, she returned to screens on 24 February 2014 when Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) visited her in prison, and last appeared on 20 March 2014. Reception Janine has been well received by critics although some of her storylines have come under criticism. She has been described as \\"the crazy, evil vixen of Albert Square\\" and journalist Richard Arnold said of the character, \\"No matter how bad she gets, we welcome her back to Walford with open arms. Because you wouldn't turn your back on her.\\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed Janine \\"the best bitch on TV\\", while show writer Tony Jordan called her the \\"devil\\" and \\"evil\\", but added, \\"She‚Äôs cheated, she's lied her way through Albert Square and we still kind of like her.\\" In 2001, it was reported that education experts blamed delinquent young characters in soap operas, like Janine, for increasing disorder and violence in schools. In 2002, scenes involving the character, when Janine prostituted herself to pay for cocaine that she was about to snort were chastised by Tory MP Tim Yeo and Liberal Democrat MP Nick Harvey The BBC defended the storyline, saying, \\"Although the storyline implied Janine had taken drugs, there were no scenes that actually showed her using them. EastEnders has always tackled difficult issues like drug-taking in a responsible way, mindful of its responsibilities to its younger audience.\\" =Awards and nominations= Brooks was awarded \\"Best Bitch\\" at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001. In March 2009, Brooks won the \\"Best Bad Girl\\" award at the 2009 All About Soap Bubble Awards, which are voted for by the public, for her portrayal of Janine, saying: \\"I'm thrilled that viewers think I am so good at being bad!\\" Brooks also won \\"Villain of the Year\\" at the British Soap Awards in 2004 for her portrayal of the same character, and was nominated in the same category in 2011. Brooks won her third Inside Soap Award for \\"Best Bitch\\" in 2009. In February 2011, the love triangle storyline between Janine, Ryan and Stacey was nominated in the \\"Best Love Triangle\\" category at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards. She also won the award for \\"Best Bitch\\" at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Brooks won \\"Best Female Soap Actor\\" with 23.0% of the vote.

With the departure of John McKay and Kenny Morris and their replacement by two new musicians, Budgie on drums and John McGeoch on guitars, the band changed their musical direction and offered an album containing a wide variety of colors. \\"It was almost a different band\\", said Siouxsie. The album was preceded by the hit singles \\"Happy House\\" and \\"Christine\\". In the UK, Kaleidoscope quickly became their most successful album to date, climbing to No. 5 in the albums chart.  Background and music  Following the departure of McKay and Morris, the band regrouped and redirected their sound for their third record. Departing from their previous work, the Banshees incorporated synthesizers and drum machines for the first time. They particularly experimented in electronic music on a couple of tracks: the electro-dance minimalism of \\"Red Light\\" and the atmospheric, synth-based piece \\"Lunar Camel\\". The album also contained what could be described as a ballad, \\"Desert Kisses\\". Kaleidoscope marked the debut of guitarist John McGeoch and new drummer Budgie. Siouxsie saw it \\"like a new lease of life\\".\\"The Banshees and other Creatures\\". BBC2 television. 1 hour documentary. Broadcast September 1998 The songs had been demoed at Warner Chappell studios with only a bass and a synthesizer played by Siouxsie and Steven Severin. After the 1979 tour, Siouxsie had been ordered to take one month of rest by doctors; she used this time to learn to play guitar and compose music for the first time.  Release  Kaleidoscope was released on 1 August 1980 by record label Polydor. The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart, the highest position the band has achieved to date. A 180 gram vinyl reissue of the album, remastered from the original ¬º‚Äù tapes and cut at half-speed at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell, was released in December 2018. Critical reception  Melody Maker's Paulo Hewitt gave the album qualified praise, summarising it as \\"a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes\\". Singling out the tracks \\"Paradise Place\\" and \\"Skin\\", Hewitt called them \\"classic Banshee pieces. Hypnotic, relentless and incisive\\". Writing for ZigZag, Kris Needs hailed it as \\"probably the most varied, diverse and adventurous offering yet to shimmer under the Banshees' banner\\", praising the band's new musical direction: \\"If anything, it makes its two predecessors, seem a trifle one-dimensional now. Tracks veer from the lightest electronic backdrop pulse to surging soundwalls as mesmeric and powerful as anything they've done. But the subtlety evident in 'Happy House' and marvellous 'Christine' are the pointers to the main content of 'Kaleidoscope'\\". Needs noted that Siouxsie's voice \\"gained new strength and depth, but she's also widened beyond singing and writing to include synth, piano and a spot of guitar\\". The band's work on the singles \\"Happy House\\" and \\"Christine\\" was hailed shortly after their release by peers the Jam; singer- songwriter Paul Weller said that both songs used \\"some unusual sounds\\", while drummer Rick Buckler qualified them as \\"innovative\\". In his retrospective review, David Cleary of AllMusic described Kaleidoscope as a \\"strong record\\" with \\"extraordinarily imaginative production values, featuring intricate synthesizer-flecked arrangements; psychedelic touches in \\"Christine\\", spaceship synthesizer swoops in \\"Tenant\\" and rhythmic camera clicks in \\"Red Light\\" all enliven their respective songs\\". The 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave a 3 out 5 rating saying that with the change in personnel, Kaleidoscope refined \\"the Banshees' attack, diversifying the sound without losing its swirling impact\\".  Legacy  Kaleidoscope later influenced several critically acclaimed musicians. In 1985, the Cure frontman Robert Smith cited the album when describing The Head on the Door: \\"It reminds me of the Kaleidoscope album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours\\". During a TV interview to promote The Head on the Door, Smith also included Kaleidoscope in a selection of his \\"Top 5 all-time favorite albums.\\"The Cure on 4C+\\" Robert Smith interview. Canal plus. 11 December 1985. Retrieved 7 June 2015 on youtube. Excerpt about Siouxsie and the Banshees from 15:24 In a February 2008 interview on BBC Radio 2, Johnny Marr from the Smiths discussed McGeoch's contribution to \\"Happy House\\": \\"What it is about \\"Happy House\\" from a guitar playing point of view, is for a start it's modern. It's not got any of the sort of creaky old rock'n'roll aspects to it and it still sounded like the Banshees, almost more so. That's when I really began to become a fan of John McGeoch. It was an extra bonus for me that they'd got a great guitar player who had left another band and came in as a ringer and joined and not surprisingly, that to me was a very good scenario. I've always liked that. It was like getting George Best on the guitar\\". Radiohead stated in 2008 interviews that they had rehearsed \\"Happy House\\" before going on tour. Guitarist Ed O'Brien added: \\"We've been doing all this [...] stuff, [...] which is our youth, really. You know, when we were teenagers. They were very formative years, and those bands\\". Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream was inspired by both \\"Happy House\\" and \\"Christine\\" because they were pop songs with dark subject matter. He stated: \\"That's the idea, yeah‚Äîto use the conventional way of constructing a pop song to communicate what I feel about the world and my take on relationships. It's a twist that makes it darker than it seems. When we were growing up, Siouxsie and the Banshees were doing this kind of stuff‚Äîthey were getting in the charts with songs about mental hospitals! \\"Happy House\\"? That was nearly number fucking 10 in the charts! 'Christine, the strawberry girl, Christine, banana split lady'‚Äîthey were writing about a girl with schizophrenia! They were getting in pop magazines and on TV; they were getting played on daytime radio. It's fucking subversive! They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream\\". Santigold took inspiration from the song \\"Red Light\\", explaining, \\"'My Superman' is an interpolation of a Siouxsie Sioux song, 'Red Light'... I love her song...\\" Santigold also later sampled another song from Kaleidoscope, \\"Lunar Camel\\", on her Top Ranking remix album. Jeremy Jay covered the same song on his Airwalker EP. Kaleidoscope was also praised by the singer of Suede, Brett Anderson. Erasure's Andy Bell cited it as one of his favourites :\\"More commercial offering from Siouxsie was much more up my street - and consequently, as with all my favourite teen angst albums, I learnt all of the songs inside out and backwards\\". The Weeknd sampled and used the chorus of \\"Happy House\\" on his track \\"House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls\\" in 2011.Neyland, Nick.\\"The Weeknd‚Äôs House Of Balloons\\" . Pitchfork. 2011-03-28. Cultural references In the 2006 film Notes on a Scandal, the sleeve of Kaleidoscope is shown in one of the scenes: the character played by Cate Blanchett told her lover that it is her favorite album, calling it \\"a masterpiece\\".

Petruchio is a fortune seeker who enters into a marriage with a strong-willed young woman named Kate and then proceeds to \\"tame\\" her temperamental spirit. The role has attracted notable performers. Plot In the play, Petruchio comes to the town of Padua in the hopes of marrying a wealthy woman. Hortensio suggests that he marry Kate Minola, the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in the city, particularly because Hortensio can not court her sister Bianca until Kate is married. Petruchio takes an interest in Kate, owing to the dowry he could potentially receive, and agrees. During his first encounter with Kate, he matches her fierce temper and manages to convince her father that she passionately loves him but only pretends to hate him in public. The two are married, with Petruchio arriving at the wedding late and forcing Kate to leave the ceremony feast early. Petruchio then starts to try to \\"tame\\" his wife in a variety of ways. He frightens Kate by yelling at the servants, and he prevents her from eating by insisting that the dishes are not good enough for her. He then offers Kate dresses and jewellery, only to return them saying that they too weren't good enough. When Bianca and Lucentio are married, Petruchio refuses to let Kate go to the wedding unless she agrees with everything he says, regardless of the validity of his claims. He puts her to the test by telling her that a man is a woman and that the moon is the sun ‚Äì she agrees with both statements. At the wedding, Petruchio is taunted by Hortensio and Lucentio for having married a \\"shrew\\". Petruchio proposes a contest to see which man has the most obedient wife: The three men are to call for their wives to see which ones respond. Of the three women, only Kate comes, and a triumphant Petruchio is the winner. Petruchio then orders Kate to bring the other wives and give a speech telling them to honour their husbands always.  Character analysis  Petruchio is debatably the most complex character in The Taming of the Shrew. His actions can be interpreted in several different lights, with each interpretation entirely changing the tone of the play. One popular opinion is that Petruchio is, for the most part, a selfish misogynist determined to tame Katharine for his own convenience and pride. He simply wanted to tame her to be able to say he tamed the most shrewish woman. In this interpretation, Petruchio marries Katharine solely for her dowry. The counterargument is that Petruchio develops love for Katharine and tames her because he sees her shrewishness as a condition that she cannot cure on her own. Another interpretation is that Petruchio likes Katharine for her strong, challenging personality and takes on taming her as a fun challenge. Regardless, Petruchio seems to believe, like most members of Christian society did at the time, that society is most stable if women are submissive to their husbands. There is also some debate about how seriously Petruchio should be taken, and hence how we should interpret the meaning of the play. His ridiculous actions, including his unconventional attire at his wedding and his treatment of Katharine once they are married, are sometimes viewed as a reflection of his descent into madness. On the other hand, some see Petruchio as the fool of the play and attribute his actions to intended comic relief.Desmet, Christy. \\"The Persistence of Character.\\" Shakespeare Studies 34 (2006): 46‚Äì55. ProQuest. Web. 30 March 2017. Petruchio's character is very powerful in that the light in which we view him can change the play from a story of male chauvinism to an absurdist comedy.  Petruchio acts as the shrew  Petruchio marries Katharine to gain wealth. However, he is not content with her shrewish behaviour and he goes through great measures to assert his dominance over her and tame her. He believes that the only way to get through to Katharine is by giving her a taste of her own medicine. Petruchio takes on the role of a shrew to prove to his wife that this kind of behaviour is unpleasant. He makes a scene as he shows up late to his own wedding, and dressed inappropriately for the occasion. He decides that he will be the one to determine when Katharine will eat or sleep, believing that depriving her of her needs makes her more submissive to him. Toward this end, he also toys with her mind. On their journey back to Padua, Petruccio refuses to continue until Katharine agrees with him that the midday sun is the moon.

Chris Hill and his wife Jo, who owned William Jackson Books, had taken a flat above the shop on Southampton Row and ran the export business from there. It soon proved to be a popular venue for the INDICA Books team and the royalty of the 'swinging sixties' that were associated with them. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were visitors to the flat and on one evening, in 1966, they rehearsed a song they called \\"Mark X\\" in the flat.

It is remarkable for its poetic style, undulating modes of transition between the scenes, innovative structure, biting satire, and ruthless examination of Socialist ideals.  Plot summary  The novel is about a pathetic young man named Nikolai Kavalerov, who refuses to accept Communist values and is consumed by loathing and envy for his benefactor Andrei Babichev, a model Soviet citizen who manages a successful sausage factory. With Andrei Babichev's brother Ivan, Kavalerov attempts to stage a comeback of all the old, petty feelings that were crushed under communism. In the end, Ivan and Kavalerov are crushed by their own iniquity. Publication History \\"Envy\\" first appeared in Red Virgin Soil, a Soviet literary magazine, in late 1927. Olesha wrote the novel while working at the \\"Whistle\\", a widely read newspaper of the Railway Workers' Union. He read pages of the novel to other notable Soviet writers: Mikhail Bulgakov, Isaac Babel, Ilya Ilf, and Yevgeny Petrov. References Olesha, Yuri. Envy. Trans. Marian Schwartz.

He is the author of a three-volume award-winning biography of British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883‚Äì1946). Skidelsky read history at Jesus College, Oxford and is Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick, England.  Early life  Skidelsky's parents, Boris Skidelsky and Galia Sapelkin, were British subjects of Russian ancestry, Jewish on his father's side and Christian on his mother's. His father worked for the family firm L. S. Skidelsky which leased the Mulin coalmine from the Chinese government. Boris had three brothers, one of whom was the British novelist and bridge player and writer S. J. \\"Skid\\" Simon (1904-1948). In 1919, a factory was built by L. S. Skidelsky in Harbin for obtaining albumin from blood. When war broke out between Britain and Japan in December 1941, he and his parents were interned first in Manchuria then Japan and finally released in exchange for Japanese internees in England. He then went back to China with his parents in 1947, living for a little over a year in Tientsin (now Tianjin). They left for Hong Kong just before the Chinese Communists took the city. Skidelsky has two sons, Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Exeter; and William Skidelsky, a journalist and author of Federer and Me: A Story of Obsession.  Education  From 1953 to 1958, Skidelsky was a boarder at Brighton College. He went on to read history at Jesus College, Oxford. From 1961 to 1969, he was successively research student, senior student and research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford. In 1967, he published his first book, Politicians and the Slump, based on his D.Phil. dissertation. The book explores the ways in which British politicians handled the Great Depression.  Academic career  During a two-year research fellowship at the British Academy, Skidelsky began work on his biography of Oswald Mosley (published in 1975) and published English Progressive Schools (1969). In 1970, he became an associate professor of history in the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University. However, the controversy surrounding the publication of his biography of Mosley in which he was felt to have let Mosley off too lightly led Johns Hopkins University to refuse him tenure. Oxford University also proved unwilling to give him a permanent post. From 1976 to 1978, Skidelsky was professor of history, philosophy and European studies at the Polytechnic of North London. In 1978, Skidelsky was appointed Professor of International Studies at the University of Warwick, where he has since remained, although joining the Economics Department as Professor of Political Economy in 1990. He was appointed professorial fellow of the Global Policy Institute at London Metropolitan University. Since 1997, Skidelsky has been an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1994. Since 2016, he serves as a director/trustee of the School of Civic Eduction in London , which forms part of an association of schools of political studies, under the auspices of the Directorate General of Democracy (\\"DGII\\") of the Council of Europe. He is currently writing a book on globalisation with Vijay Joshi, a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford.  Political career  Skidelsky has been a member of three political parties. Originally a Labour Party member, Skidelsky left that party to become a founding member of the Social Democratic Party, where he remained until the party's dissolution in 1992. On 15 July 1991, he was created a life peer as Baron Skidelsky, of Tilton in the County of East Sussex and in 1992 became a Conservative. He was made chief opposition spokesman in the Lords, first for Culture, then for Treasury affairs (1997‚Äì1999), but he was removed by Conservative party leader William Hague for publicly opposing NATO's 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia. In 2001, Skidelsky left the Conservative Party for the Cross Benches. He was chairman of the Social Market Foundation between 1991 and 2001. In September 2015, Skidelsky endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election, writing in The Guardian: \\"Corbyn should be praised, not castigated, for bringing to public attention these serious issues concerning the role of the state and the best ways to finance its activities. The fact that he is dismissed for doing so illustrates the dangerous complacency of today's political elites. Millions in Europe rightly feel that the current economic order fails to serve their interests. What will they do if their protests are simply ignored?\\" He currently writes a column on economic history for Project Syndicate, an international media organization.  Awards  The second volume of Skidelsky's three-volume biography of John Maynard Keynes The Economist as Saviour, 1920‚Äì1937 won the Wolfson History Prize in 1992. The third volume Fighting for Britain, 1937‚Äì1946 won the Duff Cooper Prize in 2000, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography in 2001, the Arthur Ross Book Award for international relations in 2002 and the Lionel Gelber Prize for International Relations and was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction writing in 2001.

Later, he became known for his character roles and antagonistic roles during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1978, he won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in M. T. Vasudevan Nair's Bandhanam. As a producer, he produced such films as Irakal and Padayani. In June 1997, Sukumaran suffered a massive heart attack and died. He was 49 at the time of his death.

It was recorded at Surrey Sound studio with Nigel Gray as co- producer, and was released on 6 June 1981 by record label Polydor. Two singles were released from Juju: \\"Spellbound\\" and \\"Arabian Knights\\". The album was commercially successful in the UK. It was acclaimed by critics upon its release, with praise given particularly to John McGeoch's unconventional guitar playing and Siouxsie's vocal performances. It remains a critical favourite and is seen as a landmark album of post-punk.  Background After the slightly electronic bent of their previous album, 1980's Kaleidoscope, Siouxsie and the Banshees returned to a guitar-based sound for Juju, due to the presence of now-official guitarist McGeoch. The album also prominently featured the intricate percussion work of band member Budgie. According to Steven Severin: \\"Juju was the first time we'd made a \\"concept\\" album that drew on darker elements. It wasn't pre-planned, but, as we were writing, we saw a definite thread running through the songs; almost a narrative to the album as a whole\\". The album was recorded at co-producer Gray's Surrey Sound studio. There, McGeoch experimented with a rarely used guitar effects device called the Gizmo for the album track \\"Into the Light\\". Attached to the guitar's bridge, the Gizmo used keyed wheels to press the strings, giving a McGeoch's guitar the sound of a classical string instrument. For \\"Arabian Knights\\", McGeoch transformed a tune by Siouxsie, initially in waltz rhythm, that she had composed on a Vox Teardrop guitar. The sleeve reproduced a picture of an African statue that the group found at the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill.  Musical style  Juju is a post-punk album, and was listed solely as such by AllMusic. The record was also qualified as \\"art rock\\" by The Guardian, which also dubbed the two singles as \\"pop marvels\\". However, Juju has also been cited by certain critics as gothic rock, though the band dispute such categorisation.  Release  Juju reached No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart, remaining in the chart for 17 weeks. A 180g vinyl reissue of the album, remastered from the original ¬º‚Äù tapes and cut half-speed at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell, was released in August 2018.  Critical reception  Sounds hailed the album, observing that Siouxsie's voice \\"seems to have acquired a new fullness of melody\\" with \\"a rich, dark smoothness\\". Assessing the band's music, writer Betty Page commented: \\"The way this unit operates is impressively cohesive, like one brain the inventive musical talents of [guitarist] McGeoch, [drummer] Budgie and [bassist] Severin mesh perfectly with Siouxsie\\". She also praised McGeoch as being \\"the only man who can make an acoustic guitar sound foreboding\\". NME considered that \\"Juju, their fourth LP [might be] their second best\\", qualifying it as \\"a peak in entertainment\\". Critic Paul Morley wrote that Siouxsie \\"exult[ed] with priceless poise\\". He concluded, naming all the songs, saying : \\"Side one's highlights ‚Äì 'Spellbound', 'Into the Light', 'Arabian Knights', 'Halloween' and 'Monitor'. The most consistent side since The Scream. Side two's highlights ‚Äì 'Night Shift', 'Sin In My Heart', 'Head Cut' and 'Voodoo Dolly'. Juju is the first integrated and sparkling-complete Banshees since The Scream.\\" In a retrospective review, AllMusic wrote, \\"The upfront intensity of Juju probably isn't matched anywhere else in the catalog of Siouxsie and the Banshees. Thanks to its killer singles, unrelenting force and invigorating dynamics, Juju is a post-punk classic.\\" The 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, gave a 3 ouf 5 rating while pairing Juju with Kaleidoscope as albums that, refined \\"the Banshees' attack, diversifying the sound without losing its swirling impact\\". Rating the album three out of five in the MusicHound album guide book, Doug Pullen described Juju as \\"a dark sensual record that combined Sioux's pained lyrics with smartly evocative grooves\\". In 2007, The Guardian placed Juju on its \\"1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die\\" list, writing, \\"Perennial masters of brooding suspense, the Banshees honed their trademark aloof art rock to its hardest and darkest pitch on Juju.\\" Juju was also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.  Legacy  In 1995, Melody Maker writer Cathi Unsworth described Juju as \\"one of the most influential British albums ever\\". McGeoch's guitar playing in particular was singled out for praise by critics and musicians. In 2006 he was listed at number 89 on Mojo's list of the \\"100 greatest guitarists of all time\\" for his work on \\"Spellbound\\". Johnny Marr of the Smiths said on BBC Radio 2 in February 2008 that he rated McGeoch highly for his work on \\"Spellbound\\". Marr qualified it as \\"clever\\", with a \\"really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll\\". In Uncut, Marr rated McGeoch as his 10th favourite guitarist for his work on Juju and Real Life by Magazine. Another member of the Smiths, singer Morrissey, commented on \\"Spellbound\\" during an interview for the US KROQ-FM radio station in 1997: \\"Another great single. A hit in England. Certainly not here, I don't think. But they were one of the great groups of the late '70s, early '80s. [...] Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent [...]\\" Morrissey later named Juju as a major album of the Banshees. Radiohead cited Juju, with Thom Yorke, Ed O'Brien and Colin Greenwood all mentioning their liking for the album.Ryan Dombal. \\"Radiohead interview\\". Pitchfork. 28 March 2008. Retrieved 16 May 2016. \\"Yeah. In rehearsals yesterday, Thom, Ed and I were running through a Siouxsie and the Banshees cover called \\"Happy House\\" and Jonny [Greenwood]-- the young one-- was like, \\"What the fuck is this?\\" And we're like, \\"You know, Siouxsie and the Banshees! Check out Juju.\\" O'Brien remembered recording \\"Spellbound\\" on a tape recorder after listening to the charts, noting that \\"it was a great era of music\\". John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers mentioned it as one of his influences for the album By the Way. He said: \\"John McGeoch is a guitarist I want to be. He's got a new brilliant idea at each song. I generally listen to the records he recorded with Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees, Juju\\". Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins selected \\"Arabian Knights\\" when he talked about some of his favourite music on BBC radio:\\"6 music playlist Billy Corgan\\". BBC.co.uk. Broadcast on 7 December 2014. Retrieved 15-5-2015 commenting the song, he said that \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees were able to unlock certain rhythms and feelings that are still in alt rock today\\".

Many fisherman from Newfoundland spent their summers fishing on the Labrador coast.

The vessel in the song is obviously a schooner, and it would have been burdened by a full load of salt cod caught along the Labrador coast.

It first aired on BBC One on 29 April 2006. The episode's narrative takes place in England some time after the events of the 2005 episode \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", and involves the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) reuniting with his former travelling companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), whom the Fourth Doctor left behind in the 1976 serial The Hand of Fear. In the episode, the alien race the Krillitanes, disguising themselves as school faculty, use the minds of children to solve a theory of everything that would allow them to control time and space. The use of the Doctor's previous companions, in particular Sarah Jane and K9 (John Leeson), was first proposed in 2003 to the BBC. After the episode was produced, Elisabeth Sladen was approached by the BBC to star in a spin-off, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which also included K9 in several stories. The episode was positively reviewed, with an Appreciation Index of 85 (\\"Excellent\\"). Plot Mr Finch, the headmaster of Deffry Vale School, has been changing the school to improve the students' performance; his changes include free lunches with special chips. The Tenth Doctor is undercover as a science teacher in the school, and Rose is working undercover in the school's cafeteria. The Doctor discovers the oil in the chips has caused the students' increase in performance. Rose observes that the chip oil has an adverse effect on the other kitchen staff, who must use hazmat suits to handle the oil. Mr Finch's successes arouses the attention of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a former companion of the Doctor. She meets the Doctor, Rose, and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. Sarah Jane shows them the robot dog K9 in the boot of her car. K9 identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, previously unaware that the Doctor even had past companions, confronts him on why he leaves his old companions behind and never mentions them. The following day, the group returns to the school to investigate further. The Doctor confronts Mr Finch, who confirms that he and other staff members are Krillitanes ‚Äì a composite species that takes desirable attributes of the species they conquer. He attempts to subvert the Doctor, without success. Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance. With the Doctor's help, Sarah Jane and Rose discover that the school computers ‚Äì bolstered by the students' enhanced intelligence ‚Äì are part of a Krillitane effort to solve the \\"Skasis Paradigm\\", a theory of everything. Mr Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, but the Doctor again refuses, and they run from Mr Finch. After Kenny (a student who had not eaten the chips) alerts Mickey to the students' plight, Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen. Upon their arrival, K9 detonates the chip oil container, saturating the Krillitanes and blowing them up along with K9. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided to move on with her life. Mickey decides to join the Doctor. Sarah Jane, now getting on better than at their first meeting, asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and is given a new K9 as a parting gift. Production The concept of Sarah Jane and K9 returning to Doctor Who was an idea of Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling too much on the classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be the focal point of the adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006. The episode went through several changes in production: working titles included \\"Old Friends\\" and \\"Black Ops\\", the latter being set in an army base. Davies requested that Whithouse set it in a school instead, mainly for simplicity, but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher. Additionally, the Krillitanes were to be named \\"Krillians\\" until the BBC found the name was trademarked, and Finch's forename was originally Hector, until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name, and renamed him Lucas. A scene that was cut was of Milo's brain being \\"shorted out\\" by the Doctor's rapid- fire questions causing him to collapse at the beginning of the episode, which was later alluded to in the episode. The episode, originally in the second production block, was produced in the first block along with \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" and \\"New Earth\\". Two high schools in Wales were used for filming: Fitzalan High School in Leckwith was used on 23 August and 24 August 2005, for filming the first conversation between the Doctor and Finch, and for the playground, kitchen, and cafeteria scenes, and Duffryn High School in Newport, which was used between 25 August and 6 September for the remainder of the episode, with filming delayed due to asbestos being discovered in Duffryn High School's structure. The scenes in the schools utilised dozens of children as extras. Pick-up shots were later completed on 7 September and 8 September, with filming of the cafe scene delayed due to drunk and disorderly conduct from members of the public. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 8.3 million viewers, the twelfth most-watched programme of the week, with an Appreciation Index score of 85%. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+ rating, and jokingly stated that he \\"didn't know why the Doctor was fucking around [during the Physics lesson]: he taught Physics at Coal Hill School way back in '63\\".See An Unearthly Child, where it was Ian Chesterton who was shown teaching Chemistry and Physics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10 (\\"Great\\") and commented that the episode had \\"fantastic character moments\\" and \\"brilliant CGI effects\\", and that \\"if you're willing to accept the Scooby-Doo storyline, then the strong nostalgic vibes present in this episode should be enough to carry this episode into a must-see category.\\", and K9 and Sarah Jane alone made the episode worth watching for fans of the classic series. The episode was subsequently nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, an award that was won by the following episode \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\".

He was one of the first to introduce Cuban music to the United States by bringing Cuban musical styles to the New York City jazz scene. While Cuban bands had had popular jazz tunes in their repertoire for years,Acosta, Leonardo 2003. Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. Smithsonian, Washington, D.C..Giro Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. Extensive essay on Cuban jazz in vol 2, p261‚Äì269. Bauz√°'s composition \\"Tang√°\\" was the first piece to blend jazz harmony and arranging technique, with jazz soloists and Afro-Cuban rhythms. It is considered the first true Afro-Cuban jazz or Latin jazz tune. Biography As a child he studied clarinet becoming recognized as a child prodigy on the instrument leading to being featured with the budding Havana Symphony at the age of 11. Bauz√° then performed on clarinet and bass clarinet with pianist Antonio Maria Romeu's charanga (flute and violins) orchestra. This proved a fateful event as the orchestra came to New York City to record in 1926. Bauz√°'s stayed with his cousin, trumpeter Ren√© Endreira, who was a Harlem resident and played with The Santo Domingo Serenaders, a band was made up of Panamanians, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans of color playing jazz. The teenage Bauz√° was impressed with Harlem's African American community and the freedom they had. He also witnessed a performance of George Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" and was inspired with saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer's feature in the piece. Upon his return to Cuba he vowed he would return to New York City to become a jazz musician doing so in 1930 learning to play the alto saxophone while maintaining his clarinet technique. A chance encounter with vocalist Cuban vocalist Antonio Machin, who needed a trumpet player for an upcoming record date he was leading gave Bauz√° an unusual opportunity. Machin was the vocalist for the Don Azpiaz√∫ Havana Casino Orchestra who had taken New York City by storm with their public performances and recent hit recording of \\"El Manisero,\\" The Peanut Vendor. Machin was offered a record date to record four tunes. Machin when he would perform solo would do so with two guitars, a trumpet, and himself on maracas. All the trumpet players that knew how to play in the Cuban style who were part of Azpiaz√∫'s orchestra had left to back to Cuba. Faced with a dilemma Bauz√° offered his services to Machin because he knew the finger positions on the horn buying a trumpet and in two weeks developed enough technique to play on the recordings. He would now devote his time to playing the instrument being inspired by Louis Armstrong. By 1933 Bauz√° had been hired as lead trumpeter and musical director for drummer Chick Webb's Orchestra, and it was during this time with Webb that Bauz√° both met fellow trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and allegedly discovered and brought into the band singer Ella Fitzgerald. In 1938 Bauz√° joined Cab Calloway's band, later convincing Calloway to hire trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. He would leave Calloway's band in 1940. Bauz√°'s musical relationship and friendship with Gillespie would continue yielding game changing results. The fusion of Bauz√°'s Cuban musical heritage and Gillespie's bebop culminated in the development of cubop, one of the first forms of Latin jazz. In 1939, Bauz√° became co-founder and musical director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans with his vocalist brother- in-law, Francisco Ra√∫l Guittierez Grillo (Machito). The band produced its first recordings for Decca in 1941, and in 1942 Bauz√° brought in a young timbalero named Tito Puente.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music. Chicago Review Press. p472 Importantly in 1947, Bauz√° introduced the young Havana conga virtuoso Chano Pozo to Dizzy, when the latter wanted to add a Cuban percussionist to his band; though Pozo was killed in a Harlem bar fight just a year later, he left an indelible and long-lasting mark on Dizzy's playing and compositions, co-writing several legendary compositions such as \\"Manteca\\" and \\"Tin Tin Deo\\". In 1943 the success of \\"Tanga,\\" the first truly Afro-Cuban jazz tune (attributed to Bauz√°), were followed by \\"Cubop City\\" and \\"Mambo Inn.\\" Machito and his Afro-Cubans often played straight-ahead big band jazz as well as mambo music. Many of the numbers were covers of recordings which had proved popular in Cuba hut with updated arrangements using jazz harmony. The band played mambo-style dance numbers at venues such as Manhattan's legendary Palladium Ballroom. Bauz√° kept his post as director of the Afro-Cubans until 1976. After this he worked sparingly, eventually retiring to almost total obscurity. In 1979 New York City's Caribbean Cultural Center gave tribute to Bauz√° in an outdoor concert at Lincoln Center that included Bauz√° leading his own big band. The concert featured musical greats Billy Taylor, Bobby Capo, Graciela, Machito, Jorge Dalto, Chocolate Armenteros and Mario Rivera and was a follow up to CCCADI‚Äôs 1979 tribute at Alice Tully Hall which reignited Bauza‚Äôs career. A 1990 Celebration of his 80th birthday with his big band with special guests Dizzy Gillespie, Chico O'Farrill, Celia Cr√∫z, Jos√© Fajardo, Marco Rizo, at Symphony Space in Manhattan, gave Bauz√° the opportunity to record again for the German based Messidor label. The subsequent recordings; Tanga - The Original Mambo King, 944 Columbus Avenue, and My Time Is Now, brought Bauz√° two Grammy nominations and out of the shadows into the public's eye with critical acclaim. Subsequent European tours on the jazz festival circuit followed culminating with him gracing the cover of Downbeat magazine and a 1992 guest appearance with his big band on the Cosby show. (S08 E22: \\"You Can't Stop the Music\\"),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0547129/ performing with Willie Col√≥n. \\"Tang√°\\" and the creation of Latin jazz The band had a major hit with \\"Tang√°,\\" initially a descarga (Cuban Jam) in mambo tempo with jazz soloists, spontaneously composed by Bauz√°. \\"Tang√°\\", which was over time arranged with a more formal arrangement. It is generally considered to be the first true Latin jazz or Afro-Cuban jazz tune. > The first descarga [Cuban jam session] that made the world take notice is > traced to a Machito rehearsal on May 29, 1943, at the Park Palace Ballroom, > at 110th Street and 5th Avenue. At this time, Machito was at Fort Dix (New > Jersey) in his fourth week of basic training. The day before at La Conga > Club, Mario Bauz√°, Machito's trumpeter and music director, heard pianist > Luis Varona and bassist Julio Andino play something which would serve as a > permanent sign off (end the dance) tune. On this Monday evening, Bauz√° > leaned over the piano and instructed Varona to play the same piano vamp he > did the night before. Varona's left hand began the introduction of Gilberto > Valdes' \\"El Botellero.\\" Bauza then instructed Julio Andino what to play; > then the saxes; then the trumpets. The interlocking riffs soon began to take > shape into an Afro-Cuban jazzed up melody. Gene Johnson's alto sax then > emitted oriental-like jazz phrases. By accident, Afro-Cuban jazz was > invented when Bauz√° composed \\"Tanga\\" (the Bant√∫ Congolese word for energy) > that evening. Thereafter, whenever \\"Tang√°\\" was played, it sounded different, > depending on a soloist's individuality. In August, 1948, when trumpeter > Howard McGhee soloed with Machito's orchestra at the Apollo Theatre, his ad- > libs to \\"Tang√°\\" resulted in \\"Cu-Bop City,\\" a tune which was recorded by > Roost Records months later. The jams which took place at the Royal Roost, > Bop City and Birdland between 1948 and 1949, when Howard McGhee, tenor > saxophonist Brew Moore, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie sat in with the > Machito orchestra, were unrehearsed, uninhibited, unheard of before jam > sessions which at the time, master of ceremonies Symphony Sid called Afro- > Cuban jazz. The Machito orchestra's ten to fifteen-minute jams were the > first in Latin music to break away from the traditional under-four-minute > recordings and live performances.

The right hand of the \\"Tang√°\\" piano guajeo is in the style known as \\"ponchando,\\" a type of non-arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack-points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping.Pe√±alosa, David 2010.

With \\"Tang√°,\\" Bauz√° was the first to explore modal harmony (a concept explored much later by Miles Davis and Gil Evans) from a jazz arranging perspective. Of note is the sheet of sound effect in the arrangement through the use of multiple layering. Under Bauz√°'s direction, Machito and his Afro-Cubans were first band to successfully wed jazz big band arranging techniques within an original composition with jazz oriented soloists utilizing an authentic Afro-Cuban-based rhythm section in a successful manner. e.g. Gene Johnson ‚Äì alto, Brew Moore ‚Äì tenor, composition in \\"Tanga\\" (1943).Bobby Sanabria, posting to the Latinjazz discussion list (2008). http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/latinjazz/ Master of arranging in- clave 3-2 clave () and 2-3 clave () written in cut-time. The 3-2/2-3 clave concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Bauza while he was the music director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans.Bobby Sanabria quoted by Pe√±alosa (2009: 252) The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. .. Bauz√° was a master at moving the song from one side of clave to the other. The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of ‚ÄúQue vengan los rumberos‚Äù by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Notice how the melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back again. A measure of 2/4 moves the chord progression from the two-side (2‚Äì3), to the three-side (3‚Äì2). Later, another measure of 2/4 moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2‚Äì3). > The first 4 1‚ÅÑ2 claves of the verses are in 2‚Äì3. Following the measure of > 2/4 (half clave) the song flips to the three-side. It continues in 3-2 on > the V7 chord for 4 1‚ÅÑ2 claves. The second measure of 2/4 flips the song back > to the two-side and the I chord. In songs like ‚ÄúQue vengan los rumberos,‚Äù > the phrases continually alternate between a 3‚Äì2 framework and a 2‚Äì3 > framework. It takes a certain amount of flexibility to repeatedly reorder > your orientation in this way. The most challenging moments are the > truncations and other transitional phrases where you ‚Äúpivot‚Äù in order to > move your point of reference from one side of clave to the other. Working in > conjunction with the chord and clave changes, vocalist Frank ‚ÄúMachito‚Äù > Grillo creates an arc of tension/release spanning more than a dozen > measures. Initially Machito sings the melody straight (first line), but soon > expresses the lyrics in the freer and more syncopated inspiraci√≥n of a > folkloric rumba (second line). By the time the song changes to 3‚Äì2 on the V7 > chord, Machito has developed a considerable amount of rhythmic tension by > contradicting the underlying meter. That tension is then resolved when he > sings on three consecutive main beats (quarter-notes), followed by tresillo. > In the measure immediately following tresillo the song returns to 2‚Äì3 and > the I chord (fifth line)‚ÄîPe√±alosa (2010).Pe√±alosa, David (2010: 154).

Bobby Sanabria, who was Bauz√°'s drummer during his later years, points out that Bauz√° was the first to explore jazz arranging techniques with authentic Afro-Cuban rhythms on a consistent basis giving, it a unique identifiable sound that no other band in the genre of Afro-Cuban-based dance music had at the time. Cuban big band arranger Chico O'Farill stated: \\"This was a new concept in interpretating Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible. You have to understand how important this was. It made every other band that came after, followers.\\"Notes from The Mambo Inn -The Story of Mario Bauza. PBS documentary (1998).

To stop such people from coming to see him, Mian Mir posted his mureeds (disciples) at the gate of his house.A Sufi, a Sikh and their message of love - A journey from Lahore to Amritsar, Dawn newspaper, Updated 20 May 2017, Retrieved 20 June 2017 Once, Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, with all his retinue came to pay homage to the great faqir. He came with all the pomp and show that befitted an emperor. Mian Mir's sentinels however, stopped the emperor at the gate and requested him to wait until their master had given permission to enter. Jahangir felt slighted. No one had ever dared delay or question his entry to any place in his kingdom. Yet he controlled his temper and composed himself. He waited for permission. After a while, he was ushered into Mian Mir's presence. Unable to hide his wounded vanity, Jahangir, as soon as he entered, told Mian Mir in Persian: Ba dar-e-darvis darbane naa-bayd (\\"On the doorstep of a faqir, there should be no sentry\\"). The reply from Mian Mir was, \\"Babayd keh sage dunia na ayad\\" (So that selfish men may not enter). The emperor was embarrassed and asked for forgiveness. Then, with folded hands, Jahangir requested Mian Mir to pray for the success of the campaign which he intended to launch for the conquest of the Deccan. Meanwhile, a poor man entered and, bowing his head to Mian Mir, made an offering of a rupee before him. The Sufi asked the devotee to pick up the rupee and give it to the poorest, neediest person in the audience. The devotee went from one dervish to another but none accepted the rupee. The devotee returned to Mian Mir with the rupee saying: \\"Master, none of the dervishes will accept the rupee. None is in need, it seems.\\" \\"Go and give this rupee to him,\\" said the faqir, pointing to Jahangir. \\"He is the poorest and most needy of the lot. Not content with a big kingdom, he covets the kingdom of the Deccan. For that, he has come all the way from Delhi to beg. His hunger is like a fire that burns all the more furiously with more wood. It has made him needy, greedy and grim. Go and give the rupee to him.\\"  Mian Mir and Sikhism  According to Sikh tradition, the Sikh guru Guru Arjan Dev met Mian Mir during their stay in Lahore. This tradition does not appear in the early Sikh literature, and is first mentioned in the 18th and 19th century chronicles. However, it may be possible that this tradition is historically true, and may have been suppressed during the earlier period because of Sikhs' conflicts with the Muslim Mughals and Afghans. = Legend about foundation of Harmandir Sahib = According to Tawarikh-i-Punjab (1848), written by Ghulam Muhayy-ud-Din alias Bute Shah, Mian Mir laid the foundation of the Sikh shrine Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), at the request of Guru Arjan Dev. This is also mentioned in several European sources, beginning with The Punjab Notes and Queries. Even the Report Sri Darbar Sahib (1929), published by the Harmandir Sahib temple authorities, have endorsed this account. However, this legend is unsubstantiated by historical evidence. Sakinat al-aulia, a 17th-century biography of Mian Mir compiled by Dara Shikoh, does not mention this account. It appears only in the later accounts, and may have been invented to strengthen the Sikh-Muslim relationship.  Death and legacy Mian Mir's Mausoleum in Lahore. After having lived a long life of piety and virtuosity, Mian Mir died on 22 August 1635 (7 Rabi' al-awwal, 1045 according to the Islamic Calendar). He was eighty-eight years old. His funeral oration was read by Mughal prince Dara Shikoh, who was a highly devoted disciple of the Saint. There is a hospital named after him in his hometown Lahore, called Mian Mir Hospital.Mayor Lahore pays visit to Mian Mir Hospital, lahorenews.tv website, Published 19 April 2017, Retrieved 17 June 2017 = Tomb = The heavily embellished ceiling of Mian Mir tomb He was buried at a place which was about a mile from Lahore near Alamganj, that is at the south-east of the city.

History The Law Courts Complex was constructed on the site of the original Supreme Court building, which had been largely destroyed by arson on 1 September, 1968. The remains of this building were demolished in October, 1976, and construction of the first stage of the complex commenced on the western end of the site. Once completed, this first stage held only the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was relocated to the second, and larger stage of the complex upon its completion in the early 1980s, while the District Court began to occupy the now vacant first stage soon after. Following the relocation of the Supreme and District Courts to the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law in August 2012, the Law Courts Complex was decommissioned. In May 2013 it was announced that the Law Courts site bordered by George, Adelaide and Ann streets and North Quay was sold to the Taiwan- based developer the Shayher Group. The new development proposed for the site is called 300 George Street. Major demolishing works were completed on the site by January 2015.

The AAS's vision is to see transformed lives on the African continent through science. Moses Alobo was appointed as Head of the African Academy of Sciences response to coronavirus disease. Its mandate is to pursue excellence by recognising scholars and achievers; provide advisory and think tank functions for shaping the continent's strategies and policies; and implement key science, technology and innovation (STI) programmes that impact developmental challenges. The AAS and the New Partnership for Africa‚Äôs Development Planning and Coordinating Agency (NEPAD Agency) created the Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA), an Africa-led, Africa-centred, and Africa specific platform for accelerating scientific excellence, leadership and innovation and serving the goal for implementing STI programmes. The AAS recognises excellence through the election of AAS fellows and affiliates. The AAS also awards the Obasanjo Prize for Scientific Discovery and Technological Innovation every two years to an outstanding scientist who contributes to the development of the continent. The AAS fellows and affiliates are distinguished researchers who represent the most talented and promising men and women in and outside the continent, from 59 countries across the globe. Fellows are Africans who may live in or outside the continent and working on science in Africa are elected by previously elected AAS fellows based on achievements that include their publication record, innovations, leadership roles and contribution to policy. Affiliates are promising early career scientists likely to become world class research leaders. Currently, the AAS has 62 affiliates, who are from countries that include Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Fellows form a community of scientists, which is poised to engage with governments and policy makers to enable wise investment in the future of the continent. The Academy, through its think tank functions, encompasses policy and advocacy, to identify, articulate, and evaluate timely science, technology and innovation (STI) policy issues to create a policymaking framework. This initiative also provides a robust forum for the exchange of ideas and information among key stakeholders in order to guide and inform initiatives to positively impact STI investment throughout Africa.  History  The Academy was founded in 1985 following a proposal presented by the renowned entomologist Thomas Odhiambo at the inaugural meeting of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), in Trieste, Italy. Odhiambo led a taskforce on the creation of The Academy, which presented its recommendations at a meeting convened on 10 December 1985. Participants at the meeting unanimously adopted the recommendations, turned the gathering into a General Assembly and drafted and adopted the Academy's founding constitution, which has since been updated. The 33 participants who attended the General Assembly also became the founding fellows of the Academy. The Academy also developed and implemented four strategies between 1989 and 2005 that focused on forestry research, biotechnology, soil and water management, improved food production and policy and advocacy. In 1988 the AAS launched the journal Discovery and Innovation, which focused on all areas of science and ran until 2012. At first the Academy was largely unfunded and run by volunteers. Between 1993 and 1996 Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Rockefeller Foundation helped the organization establish efficient institutional and financial systems. In May 2005 the Kenyan government gave official recognition to the Academy and extended to it diplomatic privileges given to international non governmental organisations headquartered in Kenya. It also authorized construction of its headquarters on a site that it owns in the Karen area of Nairobi. A US$5 million endowment from the Nigerian government was used to cover the cost of construction. As of 2017 the AAS had 396 fellows from 59 African countries. On 28 February 2011 Ahmadou Lamine Ndiaye of Senegal was appointed President of the AAS for a three-year term replacing Mohamed Hassan of Sudan. He is the first francophone to hold this position since the AAS was founded. Ndiaye said he wanted to rejuvenate the AAS, and felt that conditions were favorable. He aimed to open up centers of excellence on the continent where French and English speakers could work on joint research programs.  Governance  The AAS is governed by: * A general assembly that consists of AAS fellows and is the highest authority of the academy, which determines its general policy and has an oversight of the governing council * A governing council, that consists of 15 officers elected by the General Assembly which meets twice a year to create and review the Academy's programmes Members of the Governing Council  The governing council of the academy has the following members: * Felix Dapare Dakora, President * Barthelemy Nyasse, Secretary General * Dominic Makawiti, Treasurer (deceased March 2018) *Mahmoud Abdel-Aty, Vice President, North Africa *Elly Sabiiti, Vice President, East Africa *Vincent P.

Retrieved 1 September 2012 A 180g vinyl reissue of the album, remastered from the original ¬º‚Äù tapes and cut half-speed at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell, was released in September 2018.  Background, production and music  The band held back from writing after the success of 1981's Juju. During the spring of 1982, they went on tour in Scandinavia with three tracks completed: \\"Cascade\\", \\"Painted Bird\\" and \\"Green Fingers\\". When they returned to the studio in July, the group embarked on a week of improvisation sparked off by a tape-looped section of the orchestral version of \\"Fireworks\\", a non-album single they had released in May. Other numbers followed easily.Steve Sutherland. \\"Fireworks expected in Siouxsie's Dream House\\". Melody Maker. 14 August 1982 Siouxsie didn't want to use synthesizers for the arrangements: > \\"Fireworks\\" indicated the direction we wanted for the album. We wanted > strings [...] John [McGeoch] wanted a machine but Steven [Severin] and I > said it had to be real strings. They give a real, earthy, rich sound. You > could hear the strings spitting and breathing and wheezing. Me and Steve > have always wanted our music to be performed by the Royal Philharmonic > Orchestra. We've always thought our songs would suit orchestration. Real > strings have a very physical sound\\". A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was the first album on which the Banshees really exploited the possibilities of the studio. They allowed themselves to be inspired by sounds.Cooper, Mark. \\"Let's Get Physical\\". Record Mirror. 18 December 82 Engineer Mike Hedges, who was interested in vocals, put different effects on Siouxsie's voice and multi-layered it.Paytress, Mark. p.120 Hedges also encouraged them to fiddle with effects; if the band came up with something off-the-wall, he'd want to top it.Paytress, Mark. p.124 According to the band, A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was probably their most experimental work. The album contains recorders, chimes, tubular bells, loops and many vocal overdubs. Consequence of Sound described the album as the band's \\"own form of neo-psychedelic rock.\\" The personal dynamics associated with the period in which A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was recorded were often less than healthy. The band's recently fired manager and Siouxsie's former partner, Nils Stevenson, had become obsessive in response to her developing relationship with Budgie. The band spent long hours in the studio, fuelled by drink and drugs. According to Uncut writer Garry Mulholland, the \\"stunningly beautiful music\\" of Dreamhouse was \\"a product of addiction, stress, old, sick love and new, dangerous love, money woes and a darkness that would eventually claim three lives\\". Title and artwork Dana√´ (1907) by Gustav Klimt. The artwork was based on Klimt's work. The title of A Kiss in the Dreamhouse came to Severin after watching a programme about Hollywood prostitutes in the 1940s who had cosmetic surgery to look like stars, so they could get more clients. The \\"Dreamhouse\\" was a brothel in Los Angeles that actually existed where people could meet perfect replicas of the stars of the time, women like Mae West. The quote in the inner sleeve, \\"Nellie the Elephant packed his trunk and said goodbye to the circus\\", referred to longtime former manager Stevenson (nicknamed \\"Nellie\\"), who was fired before the recording of the album. The album's artwork was inspired by the paintings of Gustav Klimt. As the Banshees achieved the richness they desired, they wanted \\"a really colourful sleeve with lots of gold and deep colours because we felt the music was very rich\\".  Critical reception  The UK music press was unanimous in its praise for the album on its release. NME's Richard Cook considered it innovative: > A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of imagination scarcely ever recorded. > It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention has met with a > hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of > songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon > out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley > between the walls of the recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the > luxuriant sheen of the mix. Repeated listens trick the sense of balance; > tremendous risks are taken. Cook finished his review by saying, \\"I promise. This music will take your breath away\\". Paul Du Noyer wrote that A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was \\"a real departure from rock tradition\\" and \\"maybe even their best [album]\\". The album was ranked at No. 11 in the NME top \\"Albums of the Year\\" for 1982, with \\"Slowdive\\" ranked among the year's top 50 tracks. Melody Maker's Steve Sutherland also welcomed the new musical direction: \\"The Banshees achieve an awesome, effective new pop without so much as a theory or qualm. Dreamhouse is an intoxicating achievement\\". Critic David Cleary of AllMusic would later describe the single \\"Slowdive\\" as \\"a violin-colored dance beat number\\", with \\"a catchy melodic hook away from being the real thing\\", and positively assessed the album, saying, \\"This fine platter is well worth purchasing\\". In 2006, music historian Garry Mulholland included it in his book Fear of Music about the 261 greatest albums since 1976. In their 2009 review of the reissued album, The Quietus wrote: \\"The result was their most colourful and ‚Äì ahem ‚Äì kaleidoscopic collection yet\\". Critic Julian Marszalek commented that the album's music is \\"fundamentally pop, yet unafraid to revel in a quirkiness born of altered states. A deliberate shift from the overt darkness of its predecessor, Juju\\". Marszalek qualified the work of guitarist McGeoch as \\"a seamless beauty\\", and wrote that \\"Siouxsie's voice achieves a sense of strength and maturity\\". The journalist concluded the review by noting that \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees weren't afraid to stretch themselves. Here was a band that dared to challenge itself as much as their listeners\\".  Legacy  Several bands later covered and sampled songs from this album. LCD Soundsystem released a version of \\"Slowdive\\" as the B-side to their single \\"Disco Infiltrator\\"; it was also included on their Introns compilation in 2006. The Beta Band sampled the live Nocturne version of \\"Painted Bird\\" on their track \\"Liquid Bird\\", issued on their 2003 album Heroes to Zeros.

History The Armenian chroniclers Movses Khorenatsi and Anania Shirakatsi wrote about vishaps living in Lake Van. According to the legend, the god Vahagn, the vishapakagh (\\"reaper of vishaps\\"), would plunge into Lake Van to drag out any vishap that had grown large enough to devour the world. Scholar James Russell considers that this legend is an Armenian adoption of Urartian myths concerning the combat of the god Teisheba with the water monster Ullikummi. Russell writes that into the modern period, the Armenians of the Van basin would refer to the sudden storms that arise on the lake as vishap kami (wind).James Russell, \\"Van and the Persistence of Memory\\", pp. 45‚Äì48, in \\"Armenian Van/Vaspurakan\\", ed. Richard G. Hovannisian, 2000. A story in the Ottoman newspaper Saadet of April 29, 1889, recounted that a creature had dragged a man into lake Van. Following reports of the incident, the Ottoman government sent an official scientific survey group to the lake who failed to spot the creature. Akhtamar Island, Lake Van Russell discounts a connection between their belief about lake vishaps and the 1990s sightings of a lake creature, considering that any folk beliefs amongst the Kurdish population are likely to be affected more by stories about lake monsters in popular Western culture than any surviving Armenian traditions. He also recounts that Kurds he met in Van in 1994 and 1997 considered the lake monster story to be a \\"commercial ploy and a farce\\".James Russell, \\"Van and the Persistence of Memory\\", p. 47 footnote 4, in \\"Armenian Van/Vaspurakan\\", ed. Richard G. Hovannisian, 2000. In 1997 a local man called √únal Kozak claimed to have captured the monster on video which was sent for analysis. Academic Mustafa Y. Nutku has written a book about the creature, together with Kozak. Kozak's video is under constant criticism, with questions like why it never pans left, possibly because of a boat that may have carried the creature. Or why the monster only goes straight, instead of curving through the water. Even criticism as to why the breathing is not in and out, but a continuous release, much like the effects of an air hose. A 4-meter high statue based on reported sightings has been erected to its honor in Van, Turkey. Skeptics point out that the region would benefit from tourist revenue and a hoax might attract visitors. Cultural impact The Prime Minister of Turkey and poet B√ºlent Ecevit wrote a poem titled \\"Van G√∂l√º Canavarƒ±\\" (Lake Van Monster in Turkish language). The Lake Van Monster appears in The Secret Saturdays episode \\"The Unblinking Eye.\\" This version resembles a Mosasaurus-like creature. Animal X (an Australian television show) season 1, episode #3 features the Van Lake Monster. Josh Gates and his team search for the Van Lake monster on Destination Truth. Season 3, episode 305 \\"Alien Mummies/Van Lake Monster\\". The monster has also been mentioned in the Turkish-language Turkic Mythology Dictionary (T√ºrk S√∂ylence S√∂zl√ºƒü√º) written by Deniz Karakurt. The monster is mentioned too, during an episode of the YouTube series Unexplained Mysteries, released in 2019.

The machines are intended as a secondary screening device, used as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, traditional X-ray machines. The term \\"trace-detection\\" refers to the machine's ability to detect extremely small \\"traces\\" of these compounds. The exact sensitivities of these machines is not available information, but a mass spectrometer detects compounds on a molecular level and would only be limited by the efficiency of the collection from the air puffed to obtain a sample for analysis.  Available models and technologies  Entry Scan, developed by General Electric, and Ionscan Sentinel II, developed by Smiths Detection, use ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) technology and can detect explosives such as RDX, PETN, TNT, and Nitroglycerin. It can also detect controlled substances such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, PCP, methamphetamine, and MDMA. The Guardian, developed by Syagen Technology with preconcentration technology licensed from Sandia National Laboratories, is physically similar but internally different. The Guardian uses mass spectrometry (MS) technology, which can detect 16 explosive compounds with 10-100x more sensitivity than IMS, resolve multiple compounds at the same time, and perform shoe bomb detection without removing shoes. The collection technology licensed from Sandia Laboratories is also significantly different from those used in Entry Scan and the Sentinel II. Syagen offers a narcotics screening portal as a separate product.  Improvements  The Sentinel ll, unlike the Sentinel l, \\"requires less power, has a more modular frame design, which incorporates the compressor into the unit for easier installation and as a result, requires less space.\\" It also \\"has a more ergonomic design, improved passenger interface and easier maintenance.\\" According to the Transportation Security Administration's website, the machines \\"can be instantly updated through their vast information technology network to stay ahead of the curve.\\" The Guardian has been under development since 2001 but was introduced commercially after Entry Scan and The Sentinel. It improved the GE and Smiths Detection machines by providing a MS analyzer rather than IMS analyzer to do the sample analyses and detection. The National Academy of Sciences recommends the use of MS technology over IMS, calling it the \\"Gold Standard for resolving high-consequence analyses\\". The Guardian is the first and only trace portal machine that can perform shoe bomb detection as part of its scanning process, resulting in no removal of shoes is required. Most US airports currently require passengers to remove their shoes, a common complaint about airport security hassles.  Process  The machine operates by releasing multiple puffs of air at a passenger who is standing upright within the machine. This will flush out any particles on the person inside the machine then analyze and identify them in seconds. According to an article in the 16 June, 2005, New York Times, it is capable of screening up to 180 passengers an hour. This sample is then analyzed using IMS or MS technology to search for specific explosive or narcotic compounds. If a substance of concern is detected, the security personnel are notified by a visible and/or audible alarm.  Development  The machines were originally developed by Sandia National Laboratories in 1997. Prototypes have been under improvement since 2001 at the Science and Technology division of the Homeland Security Department of the United States. Sandia National Laboratories currently licenses its \\"puffer\\" preconcentration collection technology in collaboration with Syagen Technology in the production of the industry's only mass spectrometer-based puffer machine. According to an article in the 3 September, 2006, New York Times, they are also manufactured by General Electric and Smiths Detection using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) technology at a cost of about $160,000 each. Delays in testing at the Homeland Security Department laboratory and questions about reliability have hindered their deployment. Early models were loud and slow, and required a lot of power. Durability has also been a concern. Trace portal machines are currently the only airport screening devices that automatically examine passengers for explosives.  Usage  At their peak, about 95 machines were installed in 34 airports. The majority of these were GE's Entry Scan and a few were Smith's Sentinels. According to an article on the 10 October, 2007 in USA Today, the TSA had planned on installing 434 machines; however, due to maintenance problems, they have halted installation and \\"have no plans to acquire more.\\" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported involvement with Syagen's MS trace portal machine recently, funding them in 2008 with one unit tested at Orange County Airport shortly afterwards. At most airports, the machines were replaced either by millimeter wave scanners or backscatter X-ray machines. As well as having been implemented in US airports, there are also puffer machines at the Statue of Liberty (GE EntryScan3), just before visitors enter the statue itself. This is one example of the many increased security measures taken for popular New York landmarks post September 11, 2001. The Israeli Border Police use trace portal machines at border crossings into areas under their jurisdiction such as the Allenby Bridge. Three machines are installed at the security check for the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada. Five machines are also currently operating at the \\"Gentilly-2\\" nuclear plant in Quebec.

Catherine had eleven children of which Nelson was the third surviving son. Family and marriage Catherine was born on 9 May 1725 in Barsham, the oldest child and youngest daughter of the Reverend Maurice Shelton Suckling, the rector of Barsham and Woodton, and a prebendary of Westminster. Her father died when Catherine was five, and her mother Ann took the family to live at Beccles. There Catherine met the former curate of Beccles, the Reverend Edmund Nelson. They were married on 11 May 1749. The marriage was a good one for Edmund, for Catherine was related through her father to the poet Sir John Suckling, and through her mother to the powerful Walpole family, by now elevated to the peerage as the Earls of Orford. She was a grandniece of Sir Robert Walpole, and the Walpoles' influence had helped her brothers Maurice and William embark on successful careers. Children The couple moved to Swaffham after their marriage where Catherine bore Edmund three children. Two died in infancy; a third, Maurice, survived. They then moved to Sporle, where on 12 June 1755 Catherine gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Susanna. Also in 1755 Horace Walpole offered Edmund the position of rector at Burnham Thorpe. Edmund accepted and the two settled at the rectory. William was born on 20 April 1757, and on 29 September 1758, Catherine gave birth to Horatio, naming him after their benefactor and the young Horatio's godparent, Horace Walpole. Horatio was a sickly child, and Edmund feared he would not live long enough to be baptised at the public ceremony arranged for 15 November. Horatio was baptised at a private ceremony on 8 October. The last of the Nelson children followed, Ann on 20 September 1760, Edmund on 4 June 1762, Suckling on 5 January 1764, and Catherine on 19 March 1767. Another boy, George, was born in 1765 but died three months later. Death and legacy Catherine died on 26 December 1767 at the age of 42, leaving Edmund with eight children. A grief-stricken Edmund buried her four days later in the church at Burnham Thorpe. He never remarried. Catherine's mother, Ann, died shortly afterwards. Maurice Suckling, Edmund's brother-in- law, visited the rectory to attend the funerals, and found Edmund heart- broken, and fearing for the future for his children. He had begun to call in favours with relatives to ensure that educations and positions could be found for them, and Suckling promised to do what he could for one of the boys, using the patronage available to him as a naval captain. This saw the start of Horatio's successful career in the Royal Navy. Horatio was nine when his mother died, but remembered her with fondness. He recalled a line from Henry V when he did so and said that it could be seen in the tears in his eyes. He would also recall her hatred for the French.

As of April 1, 2013, Monarch is operated by RCCL's Pullmantur Cruises brand. It was built in 1991 at the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyards in Saint-Nazaire, France. At , Monarch was one of the largest cruise ships in the world at time of her completion. She could carry up to 2,744 passengers.  History  Monarch of the Seas with Royal Caribbean livery anchored off Coco Cay. Monarch had an outdoor basketball court, two shuffleboard courts, and a rock climbing wall. There were also two full-sized salt water pools. She was refurbished in May 2003 to add the rock-climbing wall. The fitness center, spa and children's area were also enlarged. Prior to being retired from the Royal Caribbean International fleet, Monarch of the Seas (as she was then called) sailed to the Bahamas out of Port Canaveral, Florida. In 2007, Monarch became the first major cruise ship in the world to be captained by a woman, the Swede Karin Stahre-Janson, who remained the only one until 2010 when the British captain Sarah Breton took charge of of P&O; Cruises. On 1 April 2013, after serving for Royal Caribbean International for 22 years, Monarch was transferred to Spain's Pullmantur Cruises, joining her sister ship . Before sailing for Pullmantur, Monarch underwent another refurbishment to some of her cabins, casino and shops.http://www.merima.fi/uutiset/pullmantur-ship-management-awards-merima- refurbishing-project-0 She began sailing year-round in the Southern Caribbean on 27 April 2013. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Monarch and were placed into \\"cold lay-up\\" and Pullmantur Cruises filed for financial reorganization. According to reports, the interiors of the ships were stripped of \\"everything of value\\". Pullmantur Cruises announced that MS Monarch, MS Sovereign and MS Horizon were to be sold to breakers for scrap in Aliaƒüa, Turkey being beached on 22 July 2020. Incidents =Grounding off St. Maarten= After evacuating a sick passenger at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, the Netherlands Antilles on December 15, 1998, Monarch of the Seas grazed a reef while departing, opening a gash along the starboard hull in size. The ship started taking on water and began to sink by the head. Three of its watertight compartments were completely flooded and several others partially flooded. The ship was intentionally grounded on a sandbar to prevent further sinking. All passengers were evacuated by crew members and local tender operators. No lives were lost. The grounding breached two of the ships diesel fuel tanks and an overflow tank causing a small fuel spill of approximately . There was also severe damage to the ship. A joint investigation by the Norwegian Maritime Investigator and the United States Coast Guard found that the accident was due to \\"‚Ä¶a myriad of human performance deficiencies.\\" Reports also indicate that navigation out of the port was done visually rather than using of electronic navigation and that the relocation of a vital buoy was not reflected on charts. The ship was drydocked for repairs for three months at Atlantic Marine's Mobile, Alabama facilities. One hundred fourteen of the ship's compartments had to be cleaned. The work also included replacement of machinery, 460 tons of shell plating, and of electrical wiring. American comedian John Pinette was aboard the ship at the time of the incident, referencing it in his 2005 DVD 'I Say Nay Nay'. =Gas leak= While docked at the port of Los Angeles in August 2005, maintenance on a sewage pipe caused a small amount of raw sewage and an unknown amount of hydrogen sulfide gas to escape. Three crew members were killed and 19 others were injured. Reports said that the deaths were almost instantaneous as the crew members were not wearing breathing apparatus at the time. =Captain's death= Thirty-eight- year-old Captain Joern Rene Klausen was found dead in his stateroom aboard Monarch early the morning of January 30, 2006. The ship was returning to Los Angeles from a three-night cruise to Ensenada, Mexico. According to reports, the death appeared to be of natural causes. = Coronavirus pandemic = On 14 March 2020, Panama repatriated 1,504 Colombian tourists from the cruise ship Monarch due to coronavirus fears. Since the port of Cartagena, Colombia was closed, the people had to fly from Col√≥n, Panama. As of 14 March, about 300 people were still waiting to buy tickets. On 17 April 2020, a Honduran crew member died of the virus in a hospital in Panama City. He had been medically evacuated after having trouble breathing, and tested positive at the hospital.

The riots were mainly due to escalations of hostilities after large scale protests by Muslims in reaction to the 1992 Babri Masjid Demolition by Hindu Karsevaks in Ayodhya. The violence was widely reported as having been orchestrated by the Shiv Sena, a Hindu-nationalist political party in Maharashtra. A high-ranking member of the special branch later stated that the police were fully aware of the Shiv Sena's capabilities to commit acts of violence, and that they had incited hate against the minority communities. Historian Barbara Metcalf has described the riots as an anti-Muslim pogrom. The riots were followed by the retaliatory 12 March 1993 Bombay Bombings.ERCES Online Quarterly Review Religious Identity of the Perpetrators and Victims of Communal Violence in Post-Independence India Background-Communalism in India The Bombay riots can be considered a result of larger communal tensions throughout India. The British colonial policy of Divide and Rule allegedly included administrative and political activities such as communalized census taking, and the Morley Minto reforms, that relied on communal segregation, and in particular Hindu-Muslim divisions. Post-Independence, the after-effects of the Partition of India along communal lines, the resurgence of ‚ÄòHindu Muslim Economic competition‚Äô, the growth of right-wing communalist movements such as the RSS, and political strategies of 'appeasement' towards communal political influences by secular political authorities (see Shah Bano case), reinforced communalist ideologies in the country. The Babri Mosque demolition on 6 December 1992, an act of communal violence by Hindu extremist, is considered to be the immediate cause of the riots.  Overview of the Riot  As determined by the government's Srikrishna commission; the riots started as a result of communal tension prevailing in the city after the Babri Mosque demolition on 6 December 1992. The Commission identified two phases to the riots. The first was mainly a Muslim instigation as a result of the Babri Masjid demolition in the week immediately succeeding 7 December 1992 led by political leaders representing Hindutva in the city of Ayodhya. The second phase was a Hindu backlash occurring as a result of the killings of Hindu Mathadi Kamgar (workers) by Muslim fanatics in Dongri (an area of South Bombay), stabbing of Hindus in Muslim majority areas and burning of six Hindus, including a disabled girl in Radhabai Chawl. This phase occurred in January 1993, with most incidents reported between 6 and 20 January. The Report asserted that the communal passions of the Hindus were aroused to fever pitch by the inciting writings in print media, particularly Saamna and Navaakal which gave exaggerated accounts of the Mathadi murders and the Radhabai Chawl incident. From 8 January 1993, many riots occurred between Hindus led by the Shiv Sena and Muslims potentially funded by the Bombay underworld at that time. An estimated 575 Muslims and 275 Hindus were killed at the end of the riot. The communal violence and rioting triggered off by the burning at Dongri and Radhabhai Chawl, and the following retaliatory violence by Shiv Sena was hijacked by local criminal elements who potential opportunity to make quick gains. By the time the right wing Hindu organization Shiv Sena realised that enough had been done by way of \\"retaliation\\", the violence and rioting was beyond the control of its leaders who had to issue an appeal to put an end to it. The events as listed by the Srikrishna Commission =6 December 1992= News of the demolition of Babri Masjid spread by 14:30 hours on 6 December 1992. Muslims angered by this act felt that Islam was in imminent danger since proponents of the Hindu nation had been allowed to destroy, under the very nose of the police forces, the Babri Masjid, despite assurances and undertakings by the Uttar Pradesh state Government and the Government of India that no harm would be permitted to be caused to the Babri Masjid during kar seva at Ayodhya on 6 December 1992. The extensive media coverage, particularly on television, of footage of file pictures of kar sevaks dancing on the dome of the Masjid, as well as the latest video shots showing actual demolition of the Babri Masjid, caused a sense of deep resentment. The demolition of the Babri Masjid provided enough fuel to excite, ignite and exploit the sentimentalities of the Indian Muslims. Muslims were proselytised by these exploitative elements that the Establishment and the Government had an active hand in the destruction, since it did not do anything to prevent the same. Rumours abounded that alleged members of certain Hindutva parties were seen to be celebrating the demolition of Babri structure. Muslims protested violently on the streets. A large number of Muslims congregated near Minara Masjid in Pydhonie jurisdiction at about 23:20 hours on 6 December 1992 and came out protesting frenziedly in Bombay located in the state of Maharashtra. The first targets of the rioting mob became the municipal vans and the police, both visible signs of the government. Activists of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena jumped into the fray, and escalated communal sentiments, as seen from their act of stopping the vehicles on roads in the jurisdiction of V.P. Road Police Station. In Nirmal Nagar jurisdiction, a Ganesh idol in the Ganesh Mandir on Anant Kanekar Marg was found moved out from its place of installation though the lock on the grill surrounding the sanctum sanctorum was found intact. This was noticed at about 23:45 hours. Though at the time the incident happened there were no immediate clues as to the identity of the miscreants, it was widely rumoured that Muslim fanatics were behind it. In the jurisdiction of Deonar, there was a sharp counter‚Äìreaction by Muslims who stoned the house of a local Bharatiya Janata Party leader. Tensions escalated. =7 - 12 December 1992= Two constables in Deonar jurisdiction were killed with choppers and swords by Muslims. While one lay on the ground bleeding to death, the body of another was dragged and thrown into the garbage heap from where it was recovered seven days later. One constable was beaten to death in Byculla jurisdiction. Several police officers and policemen who bravely attempted to stem the tide sustained injuries in mob action. Jogeshwari area, which has been the hotbed of frequent communal riots saw serious riots at the junction of Pascal Colony and Shankar Wadi. A police officer on duty received a bullet injury in his head and died subsequently, though it cannot be said with certitude that it was a case of private firing. The police recovered large number of iron rods, sickles, choppers, knives and soda water bottles from different jurisdictions indicating that there was intention and preparations to carry on the communal riots. On 8 December 1992 communal rioting and communal violence spread to 33 jurisdictions, the number of clashes of rioting mobs with police as well as rioting mobs inter se increased alarmingly. Attacks on places of worship also continued. Shiv Sena systematically attacked Muslim men, women and children during that time. The police had to resort to firing in 43 cases resulting in the death of 11 Hindus, 31 Muslims and three others. There were several cases of mob violence, stabbing and arson. One temple in Dharavi, one in Deonar, one in Park Site and one in Saki Naka were attacked. Simultaneously, two mosques in Dharavi, one madrasa in Mahim and Bhoiwada each and one dargah in Dadar were also attacked. Though the police found their resources stretched, they were unwilling to take the help of army for carrying out operational duties. Army columns were used only to carry out flag marches which had little impact on the, by now hardened and emboldened, rioters. The imposition of curfew from the night of 7 December 1992 also did not appear to deter the clashing mobs in view of its effete enforcement. Police intervention came about by resort to fire on 72 occasions, killing 15 Hindus and 72 Muslims and injuring 131 Muslims and one Christian. By 10 December, the situation had improved further with the number of police stations affected coming down to four, though serious communal riots occurred in Dharavi and Mahim police jurisdictions to control which the police had to fire on three and two occasions respectively. Two Muslims were injured in police firing within the jurisdiction of Mahim. By 12 December, the situation showed further improvement and the number of police stations affected came down to 14, though there also the occurrences were stray. There were three instances of police firing, one each in Ghatkopar, Bhandup and Dindoshi in which one Hindu and one Muslim were injured. Mob violence took the toll of one life. There were six cases of stabbing in which 1 Hindu and two Muslims died and one Hindu and one Muslim sustained injuries. There were eight stray cases of arson. Four dead bodies, all of Muslims, having multiple stab wounds on vital organs and in highly decomposed condition, were recovered from a gutter in Golibar area. In yet another incident, one was found murdered with her throat slit and her body was dumped in the open compound of National Girls‚Äô High School adjoining Behrampada. The December phase of the rioting petered out by 12 December 1992. The police appeared to have regained grip on the law and order situation and peace appeared to have returned. However, beneath the surface there was simmering discontent and seething anger amongst the Muslims that unduly excessive police firing had resulted in large number of Muslim casualties. Media had criticised the police for having used unnecessary and excessive fire‚Äìpower, going so far as to suggest that Muslims were intentionally targeted and selectively killed. This refrain was repeated by political leaders and ministers, past and current. The explanation of the commissioner of police that the aggressive and violent mobs in the initial stages comprised Muslims and therefore, Muslim casualties were higher. Considering it from all aspects, the Commission was not inclined to give serious credence to the theory that dis‚Äìproportionately large number of Muslim deaths in December 1992 was necessarily indicative of an attempt on the part of the police to target and liquidate Muslims because of bias. =12 December 1992 to 5 January 1993= On 20 December 1992, two Muslims were locked inside a room in Goregaon jurisdiction, and the room was set on fire as a result of which they suffered severe burns resulting in the death of one. Two bodies, one of a male Hindu and another identified as that of a uniformed Muslim police constable attached to the Nasik Rural Police Headquarters, were recovered from the septic tank of the public latrine in Behrampada on 20 and 21 December 1992 respectively. These bodies bore multiple stab injuries. It would appear that there was a systematic attempt to stab and murder Hindus and the policeman, though a Muslim, became a victim of the anger of the Muslims directed against the uniform worn by him. On 24/25 December 1992 one Mathadi worker was killed in Dongri area. Though subsequent investigation by police resulted in arrest of the accused who was an alcoholic and whose motive was far from communal, at the material time the immediate reaction was that the killing was done of a Muslim. The fires under the simmering cauldron were continuously stoked by communal activities even after the active phase of the December 1992 riots was over. There was a sudden spurt in attendance at Friday namaaz in mosques, which was interpreted by the Hindu as ominous and evidencing intent to seek revenge on the part of Muslims. This was because it was alleged that the namaaz were used as occasions for delivering instigatory communal speeches. The Hindus replied with Maha aartis (Great Hindu worship of the God), in an ostensible response against the sudden spurt in namaaz on streets. The Maha aartis were started from 26 December 1992 were viewed as a direct challenge to the Muslims, and endangered the fragile peace which had been established, with allegations that participants of the Maha aartis indulged in rioting. The Maha aartis continued unabated throughout January 1993 and came to an end only by or about the first week of February 1993. The last week of December 1992 and first week of January 1993, particularly between 1 and 5 January, saw a series of stabbing incidents in which both Hindus and Muslims were victims, The killers had not been then identified in several cases, though it was presumed, at least in the cases where the Hindus were victims, that the killers were Muslims and vice versa. The motive for the stabbings appears to have been to whip up communal frenzy between Hindus and Muslims. On 1 January 1993 there was an article in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamna under the caption \\"Hindunni Akramak Vhayala Have\\" (Hindus must be aggressive now), openly inciting Hindus to violence. On 2 January 1993, a number of Muslim hutments in M.P. Mill Compound in Tardeo jurisdiction were set on fire. On the same day there was an incident in Dharavi jurisdiction in which two Muslims were assaulted with iron rods by Hindus. On 4 January 1993 a big mob of Hindus led by Gajanan Kirtikar, Ramesh More and other Shiv Sena activists took a morcha to the Jogeshwari Police Station complaining of lack of security for Hindus. Some of the people in the morcha attacked Chacha Nagar Masjid and the Muslims in the vicinity and killed them. Several Muslim huts in Magdum Nagar in Mahim jurisdiction were set on fire by Hindus. On the night of 5 January 1993 a worker employed in the godown of Vijay Transport Company who was sleeping in the godown went to the street to relieve himself. Suddenly, he was set upon by miscreants who stabbed him to death. Three more workers who came out of the godown to help him were also stabbed to death. The murders of the workers created tremendous tension in the area. The workers' Union called for a Bandh. Huge meetings were held which were addressed by leaders of Unions. Speeches were made during this meeting to condemn the police and Government for their ineffectiveness with exhortations that Hindus might have to pick up swords to defend themselves if the police failed to protect them. At the time when these murders of workers took place, neither the police, nor the public, had a clue as to the identity of the killers, which came to be established much later. Nonetheless, the Hindus spearheaded by the Shiv Sena kicked up a furore that the murders had been committed by Muslims, virtually giving a call for arms, killing 10 Muslims. On 5/6 January 1993 the workers gave a call for bandh of wholesale markets, which also gave immense publicity to the murders of the workers allegedly by Muslims. =6 January 1993 to 11 January 1993= On 6 January 1993 there were several cases of stabbing in Dongri, Pydhonie, V.P. Road and Nagpada jurisdictions in which the victims were innocent pedestrians who were stabbed. Cases of stabbing, arson, mob violence and attacks on private and Government properties occurred in Dongri, Pydhonie, V.P. Road, Nagpada, Tardeo, Mahim, Dharavi, Nirmal Nagar, Chembur and Kherwadi police stations. Most of the stabbing cases occurred in isolated lanes and bye‚Äìlanes and by the time police arrived on the scene, the miscreants would vanish. In all, 18 cases of stabbing were reported by the evening of this day of which were from Pydhonie, two from Dharavi, two from V.P. Road, two from Nagpada and one each from Nirmal Nagar, Kherwadi and Andheri. These stabbing cases resulted in one Hindu, one Muslim and two others being killed and 1 Hindu, one Muslim and one other being injured. Mob violence accounted for the deaths of one Hindu and one Muslim and injuries to nine Hindus and eighteen Muslims. Rumours of further imminent riots swept the city and the police were unable to scotch them. Despite repeated denials of such rumours by the police, the public did not believe them. The situation in Mahim went out of control at 21:00 hours. Hindus attacked Muslims in Muslim pockets in Mahim area and killed them, led by Shiv Sena Corporator, Milind Vaidya, and a police constable, Sanjay Gawade, openly carrying a sword. There were serious riots in which frenzied mobs of Hindus and Muslims attacked each other. On 7 January, the violence and riots afflicted other parts of the city. There were more deaths and more stabbings and 16 police station areas (Pydhonie, Dongri, Agripada, Gamdevi, V.P. Road, Byculla, Bhoiwada, Nagpada, Kherwadi, Nehru Nagar, Kurla, Deonar, Trombay, Bandra, Vakola and Jogeshwari) were affected by serious riots. The stabbing incidents resulted in deaths of 16 Hindu and four Muslims and injured 3 Hindus and twelve Muslims. Eleven cases of mob violence occurred in different jurisdictional areas, killing two Muslims and injuring two Hindus and two Muslims. Seven cases of arson were reported on that day in which, apart from huge property loss, two Muslims were killed; two Hindus and two Muslims were injured. The police resorted to firing on four occasions, resulting in injuries to 3 Hindus and 5 Muslims. Violent mobs of Hindus and Muslims kept attacking each other and the police when they tried to intervene. The mobs also created roadblocks to prevent the police and fire-brigade from reaching the sites of incidents for rendering assistance. A taxi in which three Muslims were travelling was set on fire by Shiv Sena workers in Pratiksha Nagar, Antop Hill jurisdiction, resulting in the 2 Muslims being burnt alive. By 8 January, the Hindu backlash commenced. The communal riots spread to the jurisdictions of Pydhonie, Dongri, Jogeshwari, M.R.A. Marg, L.T. Marg, V.P. Road, D.B. Marg, Gamdevi, Nagpada, Agripada, Byculla, Kala Chowki, N.M. Joshi Marg, Worli, Bhoiwada, Dadar, Mahim, Dharavi, Kurla, Nehru Nagar, Trombay, Chembur, Bandra, Nirmal Nagar, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Parksite, Vakola, Oshiwara, D.N. Nagar, Jogeshwari and Aarey sub‚Äìpolice stations. Sixty‚Äìsix stabbing cases were reported from different jurisdictions, in which 3 Hindu, 37 Muslims and two others were killed and injuries caused to several Muslims. Forty‚Äìeight cases of mob violence occurred in which sixteen Muslims were killed and 4 Hindus and 17 Muslims and one other received injuries. Thirty‚Äìone cases of arson were reported which, apart from causing loss of property, resulted in deaths of two Muslims and injuries to five Muslims and one Hindu. A dargah and mosque in Pydhonie jurisdiction, a kabrastan and a madrassa in Jogeshwari jurisdiction and a temple in Byculla jurisdiction were attacked and damaged. Police resorted to firing on 31 occasions in different jurisdictions resulting in the killing of six Hindus and 18 Muslims and injuries to 10 Hindus and 24 Muslims and one other. Several raids conducted by the police resulted in seizure of weapons of offence like broken tube lights, swords, petrol bombs and daggers. That the rioters had become defiant and the authority of the police was considerably eroded, appeared clear when a crude bomb was hurled at the police commissioner's car from one of the buildings in Pydhonie jurisdiction and exploded on the road. The commissioner of police and his staff had a lucky escape, though the severity of the explosion caused a big dent on the road. Eleven army columns were deployed by the police to do Flag March in different areas. Curfew was imposed in areas where it was considered necessary. On 9 January, fifty‚Äìseven cases of stabbing resulting in death of five Hindus and 18 Muslims and injuries to 7 Hindus, 41 Muslims and one other, were reported. Ninety‚Äìseven cases of mob violence occurred in various parts of the city resulting in the death of one Hindu and sixteen Muslims and injures to 9 Hindus and 24 Muslims. Seventy-three cases of arson were reported from different jurisdictions which caused loss of property, death of a Hindu and six Muslims and injures to two Hindus and six Muslims. In Pydhonie jurisdiction, few rounds were fired at a police picket from the Suleman Bakery rooftop. The policemen climbed to the terrace of the Taj Book Depot, a neighbouring building, and sighted 8 ‚Äì 10 persons hiding behind the water tank on the bakery rooftop. Inspector Anant Ingale shouted warnings and fired a few shots from his service revolver, but his party was no match to the automatic weapon wielding group. Joint Commissioner of Police R. D. Tyagi arrived with the Special Operations Squad (SOS), and demanded the opening of the locked door of the Bakery. The inmates responded by throwing soda-water bottles and acid bulbs. The SOS stormed into the Bakery and were promptly attacked by about 15 people armed with choppers, knives and iron bars. There was no surrender or cessation of attack, so the Police had to open fire. Totally, 78 Muslims were flushed out of the bakery dead, by the police. Fifty‚Äìtwo cases of police firing occurred in different jurisdictions, killing 5 Hindus, 22 Muslims and one other. Police combing operations resulted in the seizure of stocks of swords, iron bars, choppers, kerosene cans, acid bulbs and soda water bottles from different areas. On 10 January, twenty‚Äìsix army columns were deployed for carrying out flag marches and for the first time the Government issued instructions to the commissioner of police that the army personnel may be directed to do operational duties by resorting to firing after taking control of a situation. Fifty‚Äìone police stations were affected by the riots. Eighty‚Äìone cases of stabbing occurred in different jurisdictions resulting in deaths of 10 Hindus and 39 Muslims and injuries to 12 Hindus and 42 Muslims. One hundred and eight cases of arson occurred in which there was property loss, death of one Hindu, seven Muslims and two others, while one Hindu, one Muslim and one other were injured. Attempts of the fire brigade to reach the places of fire were frustrated by the rioters who not only blocked the streets but also threatened the fire brigade staff and resorted to stone- throwing against the fire brigade vehicles. Fires blazed uncontrolled. Mob violence was reported from 25 jurisdictions causing deaths of two Hindus, nineteen Muslims, while 3 Hindus, 27 Muslims and two others were injured. The police were given orders to fire and resorted to firing on 82 occasions, resulting in deaths of 2 Hindus, 23 Muslims and one other, while injuries were caused to 7 Hindus, 27 Muslims and two others. Police seized large number of swords, choppers, tube lights, fireballs, soda water bottles, iron bars, guptis and also one country-made revolver. The situation was very grave in several jurisdictional areas. Even normally law-abiding citizens seemed gripped by the communal frenzy and were seen attacking members of the rival community. Peace committee members, politicians and other social workers were conspicuous by their absence. Communal hatred and fear psychosis appeared to have overtaken the citizens of Bombay making tolerance and reason prime casualties. Rumours about attacks from rival community swept the city. By 11 January, the situation continued to be serious. Fifty‚Äìtwo police stations were affected by communal violence in varying degrees. Eighty‚Äìsix cases of stabbing occurred in different jurisdictions resulting in the death of 11 Hindus, 44 Muslims and 1 other; 11 Hindus, 68 Muslims and one other were injured. Four Hindus, 19 Muslims and two others were killed in 129 incidents of mob violence in different jurisdictions. Ninety‚Äìthree cases of arson in different jurisdictions resulted in the death of two Hindus and 20 Muslims and injuries to seventeen Muslims. Police firing on 67 occasions caused to deaths of 3 Hindus and 15 Muslims and injuries to 11 Hindus, 41 Muslims and two others. The army column was used for operational duty in Dadar jurisdiction where it fired on a riotous mob of Hindus without causing any injuries. Police raids in several Muslim pockets unearthed several swords, knives, choppers, kerosene bottles, acid bulbs, tube lights, one country-made revolver and live cartridges. =13‚Äì19 January= By 13 January, the situation had improved slightly in several areas; the number of affected police stations comes down to 48; stabbing cases to 36; mob violence to 67 and arson to 51. The police resort to firing on 24 occasions resulting in the killing of two Muslims and injuries to six Hindus and fourteen Muslims. Mob violence takes a toll of the lives of three Muslims and injures four Hindus and 18 Muslims. Stabbings cause the death of one Hindu and 19 Muslims, while two Hindus and 10 Muslims and one other are injured. By the 14th, the situation showed substantial improvement. The number of affected police stations came down to 40, the number of arson cases drops to 39, in which one Hindu and nine Muslims were killed apart from loss to property; mob violence is reported only in 34 cases in which seven Muslims and are killed and nine Muslims are injured; the police resort to firing only on four occasions in which no one is killed and one Hindu is injured. Stabbing cases resulted in the death of three Hindus and 16 Muslims and three others, while six Hindus, 18 Muslims and one other are injured. The deployment of army columns is increased to 36. By the 15th, the situation had improved further: # There is further improvement in the situation; the number of police stations affected comes down to 29; mob violence occurs only in 24 cases resulting in the death of twelve Muslims and four Hindus and injuries to eight Muslims. The number of stabbing cases comes down to 12 in which one Hindu and 15 Muslims are killed and three Hindus and nine Muslims are injured; the number of arson cases comes down to 25 in which there was only loss of property without death or injury to anyone. The police resort to firing only on two occasions which result in the killing of three Muslims, and injuries to 14 Muslims. Army column deployed at Nirmal Nagar resorts to firing to quell a riotous mob. # The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narsimha Rao, makes a quick tour of the riot-affected areas amidst heavy security arrangements. By the 16th, the situation showed further improvement. Only 15 stray cases of stabbing are reported in which 12 Muslims are killed and injuries caused to seven Muslims. Seven mob violence cases occur resulting in injury to one Muslim; 23 stray cases of arson are reported in different areas in which there is only property loss. Police firing comes down to two cases in which none is injured. By the 17th, the situation seemed to be improving for the better. There is no occasion for the police to resort to firing. Three cases of stabbing are reported from different areas in which two Muslims were injured; three minor cases of mob violence occur causing injuries to thirteen Muslims; and six minor cases of arson reported in which, apart from loss of property, one Muslim is killed. =The period subsequent to 20 January 1993= From 20 January 1993 onwards there was no major communal incident despite a few stray cases being reported. The rumour mills worked overtime and rumours about imminent attacks and explosions likely to occur were thick. Call was given out by Imam of Jama Masjid that Muslims should boycott the Republic Day and hoist black flags on their establishments and houses. Police maintained continued vigil along with the army and paramilitary forces. On 25 January 1993, there is a minor riot in Dharavi jurisdiction which is quickly controlled by police firing without any death or injury. 26 January 1993 passed off peacefully in all jurisdictions except Dindoshi where the police resorted to firing in which two Muslims were killed and three Muslims were injured; mob violence caused injuries to two policemen and two Muslims. During the subsequent period in January, the situation in the city slowly comes back to normalcy. The total number of deaths was 900. The causes for the deaths are police firing (356), stabbing (347), arson (91), mob action (80), private firing (22) and other causes (4).  Role of the Shiv Sena  The violence was widely reported as having been orchestrated by the Shiv Sena, a Hindu-nationalist political party in Maharashtra. A high-ranking member of the special branch later stated that the police were fully aware of the Shiv Sena's capabilities to commit acts of violence, and that they had incited hate against the minority communities. Historian Barbara Metcalf has stated that the riots were anti-Muslim pogrom.Bal Thackeray, the then-leader of the Shiv Sena, was arrested in July 2000 for his complicity in the riots and for 'inflammatory writings' that may have helped propagate the riots. The case was later dismissed. Justice B.N. Srikrishna Commission Justice Srikrishna, then a relatively junior Judge of the Bombay High Court, accepted the task of investigating the causes of the riots, something that many of his colleagues had turned down. For five years until 1998, he examined victims, witnesses and alleged perpetrators. Detractors came initially from left quarters who were wary of a judge who was a devout and practising Hindu. The Commission was disbanded by the Shiv Sena led government in January 1996 and on public opposition was later reconstituted on 28 May 1996; though when it was reconstituted its terms of reference were extended to include the Bombay bomb blasts that followed in March 1993. The report of the commission stated that the tolerant and secular foundations of the city were holding even if a little shakily. Justice Srikrishna indicted those he alleged as largely responsible for the second phase of the bloodshed and to some extent the first, the Shiv Sena. The report was criticised as \\"politically motivated\\". For a while, its contents were a closely guarded secret and no copies were available. The Shiv Sena government rejected its recommendations. Since under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, an Inquiry is not a court of law (even if it conducts proceedings like a court of law) and the report of an inquiry is not binding on Governments, Srikrishna's recommendations cannot be directly enforced. To date, the recommendations of the Commission have neither been accepted nor acted upon by the Maharashtra Government. Many indicted policemen were promoted by the government and indicted politicians continue to hold high political office even today. According to the commission report, the causes of these riots were listed as # Class Conflict # Economic Competition # Decline of employment # Population density # changing political discourse. The immediate causes were listed as # the demolition of Babri Masjid # the aggravation of Muslim sentiments by the Hindus with their celebration rallies # the insensitive and harsh approach of the police while handling the protesting mobs which initially were not violent. Arrests, convictions and verdict Only 3 convictions happened in the 1992-93 Bombay riots cases. On 10 July 2008, a Mumbai court sentenced former Shiv Sena MP Madhukar Sarpotdar and two other party activists to a year's rigorous imprisonment in connection with the riots. However, he was immediately granted bail. He died on 20 February 2010 without serving his sentence. In popular culture The riots are portrayed in several different films: * They are the key plot in the 1995 film Bombay in which the protagonists, a Muslim wife and her Hindu husband, are separated from their children during the riots. * The 2004 Hindi film Black Friday deals with the events leading to the riots and the aftermath which led to the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts, and related investigations, told through the different stories of the people involved ‚Äì police, conspirators, victims, middlemen. * The violence is also an instrumental part of the plot of the film Slumdog Millionaire. The protagonist, Jamal Malik's mother is among those killed in the riots, and he later remarks \\"If it wasn't for Rama and Allah, we'd still have a mother.\\" * The event also appeared in 2010 film Striker, 2000 film Fiza and 2013 film Shahid. *The Bombay Riots set the background for the popular Netflix TV Series Sacred Games, which began in 2018. The TV Series shows the rivalry of the protagonist, Ganesh Gaitonde's gang & Isa's gang amidst religious clashes.

However, he failed to cement a first-team place at the East London side either and the following season he joined Strasbourg on another season-long loan. After enjoying regular first-team action there he signed permanently and spent the next three seasons there. He was on the bench when Strasbourg won the 2005 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Bassila signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Premiership side Sunderland in the last week of the 2005 summer transfer window. After injuries caused him to fail to establish himself in a struggling Sunderland team that was eventually relegated, at the start of the 2006 season he activated a clause in his contract which allowed him to move to another club without a transfer fee being paid to Sunderland, and transferred to Greek side Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.. There he enjoyed more first-team football in a dynamic defensive role in the midfield. Bassila later transferred to Energie Cottbus and French Ligue 2 club Guingamp. Whilst at Guingamp, then in Ligue 2, Bassila captained his team in the 2009 Coupe de France Final in which they beat Rennes. International career In 2006, Bassila was called up to represent the Congo national football team by coach Noel Tosi. Since Bassila had represented France at under-21 level, however, FIFA ruled against this as he should have applied for the change in his national status before 31 December 2005. In 2009, after a change in the FIFA rules concerning an age of limit to switch the national allegiance, Bassila was called again to the national squad together with Lucien Aubey, Albin Ebondo and Matt Moussilou, all newly eligible for the Congo national team. Coaching career In 2015, Bassila was hired as responsible for the development of the U12, U13 and U14 teams of Olympique Lyonnais, where he also functioned as a coach for several of the teams. In the summer 2018, he took charge of Lyon's B-team. In the summer 2019, Bassila joined INF Clairefontaine as director of the youth sector.

A vestment at the church, made of coarse linen dates from 1686, and a painting of Isaac's Sacrifice was presented to the church in 1643. After the Protestant Reformation, ridge turrets were raised, which changed the external appearances. In 1706 and in 1712, some repair work repairs were made on the church. The altar-piece was carved by a local artist in 1780. Major repair was carried out in 1924, under the leadership of architect Arnstein Arneberg, who later conducted extensive renovation of the Hamar Cathedral.

Matchless HC-30 model with the trademark backlit nameplate featured on all Matchless amplifiers  History  Mark Sampson started Matchless while living in Hollywood, California in 1989. He, along with partners Rick Perotta, Steve Goodale and Chris Perrotta were the initial force behind the company, often working on Rick's kitchen table. When Rick and Mark started working on their first prototype amp, the C-30, they wanted it to sound significantly better than the amplifiers that were currently being mass-produced. They also wanted their amps to take the rigors of the road and remain completely reliable for musicians who played night after night. Chris explains \\"A lot of work went into those early prototypes. Mark and Rick worked tirelessly perfecting the amp's pre-amplifier section and tone circuits. They were very passionate about it. They'd spend hours reverse-engineering older transformers by unraveling them and counting every turn of wire. They'd experiment with different speaker combinations and speaker modifications.\\" As part of their research, they'd solicit working musicians to play through the prototypes. By listening to their feedback, they'd incorporate those desirable changes into the amp design. Rick explains \\"During that time, some of the components were getting very difficult to find because the whole industry had embraced semiconductors and was going away from the older vacuum tube technology. Most of the well known tube manufacturers had either shut down production or sold off their tooling to other countries. We had to hunt down and purchase NOS (new old stock) tubes that were warehoused in small lots across the country. We also had to import tubes from other countries. Often, those tubes had a very high rejection rate and didn't make the grade, many had to be scrapped out. We had difficulties finding other components as well, like large carbon-composition resistors. Even commercially available transformers didn't seem to do the trick. In the end, we had to have them hand wound in small batches by a private company. The transformers were by far the heaviest and most costly part of the amp; they needed to be because they were the heart of it. It wasn't just about the amp's power, it was also about delivering punchy, clear, complex voicing. Naturally, the amps were very labor intensive to construct. Just one DC-30 amp took over 13 hours to complete. Because the amplifiers were so costly to make, we didn't know if customers would actually buy them. After all, it was like taking a step backwards into an older \\"garage technology\\" and then asking more money for it.\\" As prototyping neared completion, Mark and Rick came up with the name MATCHLESS‚Äîbecause that's what they intended their \\"no-compromise\\" amplifier to be. Chris designed the amp's trademark light-up logo. Steve Goodale joined them as a co-founder in 1991, bringing financing and marketing to the company. Goodale insisted that they participate in the 1992 Guitar Player Magazine boutique amplifier shootout by delivering an early DC-30 (Dual Combo 30) from Los Angeles to Cupertino. The amplifier wound up in the hands of editor Andy Widders-Ellis from Guitar Player Magazine. The amplifier won first place Guitar Player Magazine March 1992 and effectively helped launch the company. Mark Sampson went on to design the Clubman 35', followed by the 15 watt series consisting of the Spitfire, Tornado, and Lightning. This series was followed by the Chieftain, Superchief, and Thunderchief. These models were all designed while the company was in the early stages of its development in North Hollywood, California. The models created following the C-30 series were an attempt by the company to create a unique entity within the market place. While Mark was the chief design engineer, Rick handled production duties and administration with much overlap in job duties as the company grew. Chris handled computer related assignments, CAD engineering and purchasing. Due to the growing demand, the founders elected to become partners with the U.S. Music Corporation in January 1994. This merger was done to acquire much needed growth and capital. During the partners tenure at U.S. Music, Mark Sampson became head of Corporate R&D; which consisted of Guild guitars, Matchless amplifiers, Randall amplifiers and Vinci strings. Rick Perrotta became the manager of the Anaheim production facility where Matchless, Randall, and Vinci were located. Chris Perrotta would be responsible for mechanical engineering, blueprinting, and other fine detail work for all the brands of the corporation. This merger lasted until October 1995 when Mark Sampson acquired Matchless without the other founding partners. Sampson stayed on with the company as President and C.E.O. until late 1999. Matchless is widely regarded as being the company that kick-started the boutique amplifier craze in the early nineties, paving the way for other smaller manufacturers like Dr. Z Amplification, Bad Cat and Victoria Amp Company, all specializing in making handmade, high-end tube amplifiers.Handmade Guitars, Amps Strike a Chord -Reuters/Billboard, Apr 30, 2004 The company also manufactured tube stompboxes such as the Hotbox, the Hotbox II, the Dirtbox (higher gain version of the Hotbox), the Coolbox (a Booster pedal), the Splitbox (a tube buffered signal splitter), the Mixbox (a tube buffered mixer), and the Vibrobox (a tube tremolo effect), as well an echo/delay pedal called the Echobox, which employed a tape format from an adapted cassette.  Currently  The drop in value of the yen caused terminal financial problems, as Matchless had invested heavily in a new production facility. When their Japanese distributor withdrew an order for amplifiers, the company went under. Matchless Amplifiers closed down in 1998 but reopened in 2000 under new administration. They currently manufacture several lines of amplifiers and speaker cabinet enclosures. Phil Jamison, who worked alongside Mark Sampson and Rick Perotta, is now the brand's chief designer. Although some claim that the early Matchless amps bear superiority, Jamison insists that all current models are made to the same standards and specifications. Current models There are currently 16 amplifiers. Most of them are offered in both head and combo form.

Early life Whistler was a son of architect and estate agent Henry Whistler and Helen Frances Mary, daughter of Rev. Charles Slegg Ward, vicar of Wootton St Lawrence in Hampshire, whose wife, Jessy, was granddaughter of the goldsmith and silversmith Paul Storr. Paul Storr 1771-1844, Silversmith and Goldsmith, N. M. Penzer, Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1971, pp. 16-17 Career He devoted himself to glass engraving, on goblets and bowls blown to his own designs, and (increasingly, as he became more celebrated) on large-scale panels and windows in churches and private houses. He also engraved on three- sided prisms, some of them designed to revolve on a small turntable so that the prism's internal reflections completed the image. The best-known of these was done as a memorial to his elder brother, Rex Whistler. His son, Simon Whistler, also became a glass engraver. In 1935 Laurence Whistler became the first recipient of the King's Gold Medal for Poetry. Verse works of his included 'The Emperor Heart' ; 'Four Walls'; 'Armed October and other Poems'; and 'In Time of Suspense', in 1940, published by William Heinemann. He also wrote a biography, 'Sir John Vanbrugh, Architect and Dramatist'. However, he largely turned away from verse to concentrate on glass engraving. His early works include a casket for the Queen Mother, and a hinged glass triptych to hold her daily schedule. Other engravings of his can be found, for example, in Salisbury, where his family lived during part of his childhood, including a pair of memorial panels with quotations by T. S. Eliot, and the Rex Prism in the Morning Chapel, both in Salisbury Cathedral; at the Ashmolean Museum; at Balliol College, Oxford where he was an undergraduate, and St Hugh's College, Oxford, where he also designed the Swan Gates leading from the college grounds onto Canterbury Road; at Stowe House in Stowe, Buckinghamshire; at the village church of St Nicholas at Moreton, Dorset, where every single window was engraved by him over about 30 years; and in the Corning Museum of Glass (USA). In 1947, Whistler created one of the wedding gifts for Princess Elizabeth, a glass goblet engraved with the words of a 1613 poem by Thomas Campion, written for the marriage of Elizabeth of Bohemia, daughter of James I.Royal Collection http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/royalwedding1947/object.asp?grouping=&exhibs;=NONE&object;=63143&row;=31 Honours Whistler's many honours included an OBE (1955) and a CBE (1973). In 2000, not long before his death at the age of 88, Laurence Whistler was created a Knight Bachelor. In 1975 he became the first President of the newly founded British Guild of Glass Engravers. Personal life In 1939 Whistler married the actress Jill Furse, who died, in 1944, of blood poisoning. They had two children. His Brother, Rex Whistler, died the same year. In 1950 he married Jill Furse's younger sister, Theresa (1927‚Äì2007), but the marriage was later dissolved. They had another two children Daniel and Frances. In 1987 he married a third time, but was divorced in 1991.

In chemistry, volatility is a material quality which describes how readily a substance vaporizes. At a given temperature and pressure, a substance with high volatility is more likely to exist as a vapor, while a substance with low volatility is more likely to be a liquid or solid. Volatility can also describe the tendency of a vapor to condense into a liquid or solid; less volatile substances will more readily condense from a vapor than highly volatile ones. Differences in volatility can be observed by comparing how fast a group of substances evaporate (or sublime in the case of solids) when exposed to the atmosphere. A highly volatile substance such as rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) will quickly evaporate, while a substance with low volatility such as vegetable oil will remain condensed. In general, solids are much less volatile than liquids, but there are some exceptions. Solids that sublime (change directly from solid to vapor) such as dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) or iodine can vaporize at a similar rate as some liquids under standard conditions. Description Volatility itself has no defined numerical value, but it is often described using vapor pressures or boiling points (for liquids). High vapor pressures indicate a high volatility, while high boiling points indicate low volatility. Vapor pressures and boiling points are often presented in tables and charts that can be used to compare chemicals of interest. Volatility data is typically found through experimentation over a range of temperatures and pressures. = Vapor pressure = A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids Vapor pressure is a measurement of how readily a condensed phase forms a vapor at a given temperature. A substance enclosed in a sealed vessel initially at vacuum (no air inside) will quickly fill any empty space with vapor. After the system reaches equilibrium and no more vapor is formed, this vapor pressure can be measured. Increasing the temperature increases the amount of vapor that is formed and thus the vapor pressure. In a mixture, each substance contributes to the overall vapor pressure of the mixture, with more volatile compounds making a larger contribution. = Boiling point = Boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the surrounding pressure, causing the liquid to rapidly evaporate, or boil. It is closely related to vapor pressure, but is dependent on pressure. The normal boiling point is the boiling point at atmospheric pressure, but it can also be reported at higher and lower pressures.  Contributing factors  = Intermolecular forces = Normal boiling point (red) and melting point (blue) of linear alkanes vs. number of carbon atoms. An important factor influencing a substance's volatility is the strength of the interactions between its molecules. Attractive forces between molecules are what holds materials together, and materials with stronger intermolecular forces, such as most solids, are typically not very volatile. Ethanol and dimethyl ether, two chemicals with the same formula (C2H6O), have different volatilities due to the different interactions that occur between their molecules in the liquid phase: ethanol molecules are capable of hydrogen bonding while dimethyl ether molecules are not. The result in an overall stronger attractive force between the ethanol molecules, making it the less volatile substance of the two. = Molecular weight = In general, volatility tends to decrease with increasing molecular mass, although other factors such as structure and polarity play a significant role. The effect of molecular mass can be partially isolated by comparing chemicals of similar structure (i.e. esters, alkanes, etc.). For instance, linear alkanes exhibit decreasing volatility as the number of carbons in the chain increases.  Applications  = Distillation = A crude oil distillation column. Knowledge of volatility is often useful in the separation of components from a mixture. When a mixture of condensed substances contains multiple substances with different levels of volatility, its temperature and pressure can be manipulated such that the more volatile components change to a vapor while the less volatile substances remain in the liquid or solid phase. The newly formed vapor can then be discarded or condensed into a separate container. When the vapors are collected, this process is known as distillation. The process of petroleum refinement utilizes a technique known as fractional distillation, which allows several chemicals of varying volatility to be separated in a single step. Crude oil entering a refinery is composed of many useful chemicals that need to be separated. The crude oil flows into a distillation tower and is heated up, which allows the more volatile components such as butane and kerosene to vaporize. These vapors move up the tower and eventually come in contact with cold surfaces, which causes them to condense and be collected. The most volatile chemical condense at the top of the column while the least volatile chemicals to vaporize condense in the lowest portion. On the right is a picture illustrating the design of a distillation tower. The difference in volatility between water and ethanol has traditionally been used in the refinement of drinking alcohol. In order to increase the concentration of ethanol in the product, alcohol makers would heat the initial alcohol mixture to a temperature where most of the ethanol vaporizes while most of the water remains liquid. The ethanol vapor is then collected and condensed in a separate container, resulting in a much more concentrated product. = Perfume = Volatility is an important consideration when crafting perfumes. Humans detect odors when aromatic vapors come in contact with receptors in the nose. Ingredients that vaporize quickly after being applied will produce fragrant vapors for a short time before the oils evaporate. Slow-evaporating ingredients can stay on the skin for weeks or even months, but may not produce enough vapors to produce a strong aroma. To prevent these problems, perfume designers carefully consider the volatility of essential oils and other ingredients in their perfumes. Appropriate evaporation rates are achieved by modifying the amount of highly volatile and non-volatile ingredients used.

Until 2009, they did not apply to any deaths occurring in other jurisdictions, when the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 extended the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 to service personnel at the discretion of the Chief Coroner or the Secretary of State. The equivalent process in England and Wales is an inquest. A major review of the fatal accident inquiries was undertaken by Lord Cullen of Whitekirk, at the request of the Scottish Government, which resulted in the passing of the Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016. History Fatal accident inquiries were introduced into Scots Law by the Fatal Accidents Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1895, before which time the circumstances of a death which required examination were determined by a procurator fiscal. Since then, the procurator fiscal now deals with the investigation and initiation of such inquiries. The applicable legislation is the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 and Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016, and the law provides for inquiries to be held on a mandatory basis for some deaths and on a discretionary basis for others. Previously, a fatal accident inquiry only dealt with deaths that occurred in Scotland, whereas in England and Wales a Coroner will deal with the investigation of a death where the body lies within their district irrespective of where the death actually occurred. This led to some distress being caused to the families of service personnel who had been killed abroad but whose bodies have been returned through or to England at the insistence of the Ministry of Defence and in consequence their funerals have been delayed. The inquiries process was reviewed by Lord Cullen of Whitekirk for the Scottish Government in 2008, following which the Scottish Government consulted on proposals in 2014. The Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016 was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 10 December 2015, and replaced the 1976 act when it came into force in June 2017. Process =Death certificates= A person cannot be buried or cremated in Scotland unless a medical practitioner has issued a death certificate (and the associated certificate of registration of death, known as a form 14, has been issued), and doctors are mandated to report certain sudden, suspicious, accidental, or unexplained deaths to the procurator fiscal, and the report will be received by the Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit, part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The procurator fiscal can require a Police investigation, and where mandated by statute, or otherwise at their discretion, the procurator fiscal can hold a fatal accident inquiry. =Criminal acts= Where the death appears to be due to a criminal act, the procurator fiscal will initiate investigations by the police, or other appropriate public authorities, to enable the identification of suspects and associated evidence to enable them to prosecute the case in the Sheriff Court, or for an Advocate Depute to prosecute in the High Court of Justiciary. =Mandatory inquiries= A fatal accident inquiry is mandated by the 2016 Act if the death occurred while the deceased was in lawful custody or whilst they were at work. Other inquiries may be held where the procurator fiscal decides it is \\"expedient in the public interest\\". The Lord Advocate has the discretion not to hold an inquiry (including a mandatory inquiry) where the circumstances of the death have been adequately established in criminal proceedings. =Territorial jurisdiction= A fatal accident inquiry will take place before a Sheriff (judge) in a Sheriff court; there is no jury. Proceedings are inquisitorial, as opposed to adversarial. Evidence is presented by the procurator fiscal in the public interest, and other parties may be represented. Parties can choose representation by Advocate (counsel) or solicitor, or may appear in person. A fatal accident inquiry does not need to take place in the sheriffdom where the death occurred, and will take place in whichever sheriffdom the Lord Advocate determines. Although the Lord Advocate must consult the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service before making a determination. A sheriff may make an order to transfer the inquiry subject to another sherrifdom, subject the approval of the relevant sheriffs principal. =Determinations= Section 6 of the 1976 Act the Sheriff is required to produce a determination. In drafting a determination the Sheriff is required to consider five distinct areas: #Time and place of the death #The cause of death #Any precautions which may have avoided the death #Any defects in the system of working which may have avoided the death #Any other relevant considerations. The 2016 Act introduces several changes to the previous system governed by the 1976 Act, including: # Mandatory inquiries for deaths in lawful custody are extended to the deaths of children in secure accommodation # Discretionary inquiries can held at the direction of the Lord Advocate for deaths abroad # If requested, the Lord Advocate must provide a written explanation if they decide not to hold an inquiry # Inquiries may be reopened, or a fresh inquiry held, where there is new evidence Events subject to a fatal accident inquiry Examples include: * The Quintinshill rail disaster in 1915 * The 1971 Ibrox disaster * The Waage Drill II diving accident (1975) * The Venture One diving accident (1977) * The Star Canopus diving accident (1978) * The Wildrake diving accident (1979) * Pan Am Flight 103, Lockerbie (1988) * 1994 Scotland RAF Chinook crash, Mull of Kintyre * The helicopter crash that killed Colin McRae in 2007 * 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash See also * Courts of Scotland * Crown Office * Lord Advocate * Inquests in England and Wales References External links * Our role in investigating deaths on the Procurator Fiscal Service website Category:1895 establishments in Scotland Category:1895 in British law ","title":"Fatal accident inquiry"},{"id":"2528595","text":"Idaho russet potatoes Russet Burbank is a potato cultivar with dark brown skin and few eyes that is the most widely grown potato in North America. A russet type, its flesh is white, dry, and mealy, and it is good for baking, mashing, and french fries (chips).Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal. Eric Schlosser, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2001 It is a common and popular potato. Origin This variety is a mutation (or sport) of the cultivar 'Burbank' that was selected by the plant breeder Luther Burbank. The known lineage of Russet Burbank began in 1851 when Chauncey E. Goodrich imported the Rough Purple Chili Potato from South America in an attempt to add diversity to American potato stocks which were susceptible to late blight. Goodrich bred Garnet Chili from Rough Purple Chili and Albert Bresee bred Early Rose from Garnet Chili, from which Luther Burbank bred Burbank. All the crosses were open pollinated and only the maternal parents are known. Russet Burbank has been widely, but incorrectly, reported to have been selected in 1914 by the Colorado potato grower Lou D. Sweet. A 2014 study confirmed that it was originally released in 1902 by L. L. May & Co and was first known as the Netted Gem. To improve the disease resistance of Irish potatoes, Luther Burbank selected the potato that became known as \\"the Burbank\\". It was not patented because plants such as potatoes propagated from tubers, were not granted patents in the United States. Usage Russet Burbank was not initially popular, accounting for only 4% of potatoes in the US in 1930. The introduction of irrigation in Idaho increased its popularity as growers found it produced large potatoes that were easily marketed as baking potatoes. The invention of frozen french fries in the '40s and fast food restaurants in the '50s increased its popularity further. By the 2010s, Russet Burbank accounted for 70% of the processed potato market in North America, and over 40% of the potato growing area in the US. Restaurants such as McDonald's favor russet potatoes for their size, which produce long pieces suitable for french fries. As of 2009, \\"McDonald's top tuber is the Russet Burbank\\". After decades of consumption in North America, consumers and processors consider it the standard potato against which others are judged.  Botanical features  The Russet Burbank plants are medium sized with stems that have a medium thickness that are prominently angled. The leaves of this variety are medium sized with large terminal and primary leaflets. The flowers of the plant are medium sized with dark green buds that drop readily. The variety has large, long tubers that are cylindrical or slightly flat. There are numerous eyes on the potato that are evenly distributed and the sprouts are a brownish purple colour.  Storage  The Russet Burbank variety stores very well for long periods of time. It can be stored at 7¬∞C for up to five months without the need to apply gasses that inhibit sprouting. One issue that can occur while in storage is internal black spot, also known as IBS. Also, if the potatoes are harvested too early there could be a skinning issue.

He was the first to use the term \\"psycholinguistics\\" in his book An Objective Psychology of Grammar in 1936. Biography J. R. Kantor was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Julius Kantor, a German orthodox rabbi, and Mary, a Lithuanian, who immigrated to Pennsylvania some years before the birth of Kantor. Kantor had two brothers and four sisters. He entered the University of Chicago with an interest in chemistry, but then discovered his love for psychology. In 1914 Kantor earned a Ph.B. He earned his Ph.D. in 1917 and was an instructor at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1920. Kantor married Helen Rich in 1916. Their only child was born in 1919, renowned archaeologist and professor at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Helene J. Kantor (d. 1993). Because Helene was born with a progressive muscular dystrophy, Kantor accepted a position as a professor at Indiana University where he would remain for 39 years. This period overlapped for a brief time with B. F. Skinner's tenure there, to their mutual benefit. Kantor was also one of the founders of the journal The Psychological Record in 1937. Following the death of his wife in 1956, Kantor retired in 1959 but continued teaching as a visiting professor at New York University and then at the University of Maryland. He was appointed to the position of research associate at the University of Chicago in 1964, and worked there until the time of his death twenty years later. Contributions to psychology Kantor was an active and passionate writer throughout all of his career and almost to the day of his death in 1984. He authored 20 books and over 120 papers. One of Kantor's biggest contributions to psychology was his development of naturalistic viewpoints in psychology. Kantor strove to create scientific method for studying psychology, much like the scientific methods for biology, chemistry and physics. Kantor used this method of objective psychology to research further in the areas of social psychology and behavioral psychology. He also published numerous writings on the philosophy of science. Interbehaviorism Kantor originally named his system Organismic Psychology, but around the time of the publication of the first volume of his Principles of Psychology (Kantor, 1924), he had already renamed it to interbehavioral psychology. Interbehaviorism as developed by Kantor was characterized as \\"field-theoretic, not lineal-mechanistic, self-actional, or mediational; a system that is naturalistic, not dualistic; and a system that is comprehensive, not narrowly focused.\\" (Midgley & Morris, 2006). At the University of Chicago, Kantor was heavily influenced by the pragmatism and functionalism of Dewey (who had retired earlier from the University), Angell, and Mead. Kantor was also heavily impressed by the development of relativity theory in physics. It was from these two sources, as well as from his historical inquiry, that Kantor devoted himself to the creation of a naturalistic system in psychology. Kantor saw a similar goal in the recently developed school of behaviorism, although he saw it as reductionistic and simplistic, and not completely separated from mentalism. His conclusion was that in order to do so, behaviorism had to embrace a field orientation. For Kantor, because the interaction between organism and environment is continuous in time this event should be analyzed in terms of all of its interdependent components. This led to the proposal of the interbehavioral field as the unit of analysis. Kantor represented this field with the formula PE = C(k, sf, rf, hi, st, md) where PE is the psychological event, consisting of the interdependence (C) of the factors in the field, k stands for the specificity of every behavior segment, sf is the stimulus function, rf is the response function, hi stands for the history of interactions, st corresponds to the interactional setting, and md is the medium of contact. According to Kantor, this interbehavioral field is at the core of every psychological event, and this event is not reducible to any of the individual factors. Kantor used this conceptualization to analyze various sub-fields of psychology, as well as the relation of psychology with other disciplines. Among the major topics that he addressed in an interbehavioral manner can be found social psychology, psycholinguistics (a term he created and used for the first time in 1936, in his book An Objective Psychology of Grammar, and was used much more frequently by his pupil Nicholas Henry PronkoPronko, N.

Edku lies on a sandy strip behind Abi Qir Bay, in the northwestern Nile River delta. Immediately south is Lake Idku, a 58-square-mile (150-square-km) lagoon that stretches some 22 miles (35 km) behind and parallel to the coast and has a maximum width of 16 miles (26 km). Drained by Al-Madiyyah Channel, connecting with the Mediterranean, the lagoon is reputed to be the ancient Canopic branch of the Nile. Edku's isthmus position enables it to capitalize on the fisheries of both the lagoon and the Mediterranean. Other industries include rice milling and silk weaving. Edku is linked by coastal road and railway to Alexandria, 26 miles (42 km) to the west-southwest, and Rosetta (Rashid ), 12 miles (19 km) northeast.  History  Edku was one of the ancient cities of the Pharaonic era. It was within the province of \\"Ra Amenati\\", where many ancient pharaonic cities have become uninhabited to be replaced by other cities, including the city of \\"Tajo\\", which is Edku currently, and some historians believe that the name of Edco Pharaonic is \\" Jackat \\" which means in Ancient Egyptian language the high hill, and it is clear that the urbanization is related to the sandy hills north of Lake Idku and also tells one of the historians that its ancient name is mentioned in the bishop's revelation in the name of Etco. Idku was conquered in the succession of Omar bin Al-Khattab by order of him to the leader Amr bin Al-Aas at the hands of \\"Abdullah bin Omar\\" and the governor of Idko was \\"Zarand\\". The king and his army took refuge in the forts and closed the walls, and the Arabs surrounded and the siege lasted for six months. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Edku as a nahiyah in the district of Atf in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the town was 5,751 (2,937 men and 2,814 women).

The game is based primarily on the film, which in turn is based on the plots of the first three books of the series: The Bad Beginning (1999), The Reptile Room (1999), and The Wide Window (2000). Players take the roles of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, solving puzzles, fighting villains and finding objects. Players encounter characters such as Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine, along with villains such as Count Olaf, the Hook-Handed Man, the White-Faced Women, and the Bald Man With the Long Nose. Jim Carrey, Emily Browning and Liam Aiken reprise their roles from the film while the voice of Lemony Snicket is provided by Tim Curry, who provided narration for the audiobooks for the series.  Gameplay  The core gameplay consists of elements of a platformer, a puzzle game, and a third-person shooter. The player assumes the role of either of the three Baudelaire orphans, and can cycle through them depending on the version. The Baudelaires can eventually gain access to a multitude of inventions as well as ammunition throughout the game, which are mostly those that tend to run along the lines of things a child might actually attain, such as rotten eggs, bubble gum, bees, eau de toilette, and garlic, among other things. = Console versions = Klaus Baudelaire wielding a makeshift battering ram. The three console versions have the same basic layout - players can switch between playing as Violet, Klaus and, at certain moments, Sunny. The game begins at Count Olaf's house, then progresses to Justice Strauss' home, back to Olaf's, then to Uncle Monty's house, then Damocles Dock, then Aunt Josephine's house, Curdled Cave and, finally, Olaf's again. Along the way, Violet invents things - Klaus's weapon ‚Äî the Brilliant Bopper; her own weapons ‚Äî the Fruit Flinger, the Reptile Retriever, and the Peppermint Popper; the Baby Booster, which helps Sunny jump; the Steady Stilts, which help Violet reach high places; the Uplifting Umbrella, which helps Violet glide across gaps; the Horrifying Hook, which Klaus uses as a grapple gun; and the Levitating Loafers, which can make Klaus levitate for a brief period of time. In the game, the heroes solve puzzles, fight Count Olaf's theater troupe, and collect puzzle pieces with the familiar eye throughout the series. If the player collects 25 of each color puzzle piece, a place is revealed in their secret folder, which in turn reveals a picture where they can find a V.F.D package. This package reveals a special extra in the game, such as a making of featurette. Completing the game will also unlock the World Map, a sandbox mode allowing players to roam around the various levels and collect more puzzle pieces and packages. = Game Boy Advance version = The Game Boy Advance (GBA) version is different in that players can switch between all three Baudelaires at all times. The game also features more places, such as Briny Beach. It is said to be more difficult than the console versions. In The Reptile Room level, some reptiles are mentioned that never appear in the books. Also, there are fewer inventions but have the same effects as the other games, such as the Parasol Glider, which helps Sunny glide from platform to platform; the Water Pump, which helps Klaus spray and absorb water; the Grappling Hook, which helps Klaus swing from platform to platform; and the Apple Cobbler, which helps Violet shoot apples. Players must collect objects that Violet or Klaus mentions to make the inventions. Players must also talk to other characters to complete some quests or grab items that other characters are holding. The player must collect pictures and butterflies for invention upgrades, movie scenes, and concept art. They must also collect book pages to use on specific places to either give you extras, keep going on the story, or makes it easier to get around. = PC version = The PC version has several differences from the console games. For one, players cannot switch between characters. The game keeps the player as one character, switching to another when necessary, and even separates the older Baudelaire siblings at times. Secondly, there are two new environments, Briny Beach and a horseradish factory (presumably the one that is discussed in The Reptile Room, The Grim Grotto, Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography and The End). Finally, players have different inventions to make; the Smasher, the Lobber (which uses rotten eggs, bubble gum, horseradish, water balloons, and bananas as ammo), the Lockpick, the Sprayer (which uses eau du toilette, onions, pillow feathers, bees, and limes as ammo), the Lever Yanker, the Reptile Retriever, stilts, and a Grappling Hook. As a bonus, players can collect eyes; every ten eyes collected gives the player a poster for an Olaf theater production, and letters from the alphabet which start a word that is then defined. Some of the words, such as Quagmire, referring to the Quagmire triplets and Xenophobe, referring to a word Jerome Squalor mentioned to the Baudelaires in The Ersatz Elevator are from the books.  Development  The teaser trailer, released 5 months before the game's official release, features radically different gameplay from the final game.  Reception  The game has received average to mixed reviews upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 70% and 72 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 70% and 70 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 67% and 64 out of 100 for the PC version; 66% and 63 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; and 68% and 67 out of 100 for the Xbox version. Some reviewers gave the game lower scores, citing the short span of the game, lack of replay value, easy difficulty and repetitive gameplay. The Sydney Morning Herald gave the game two-and-a-half stars out of five and stated that \\"The difficulty level is accommodating for youngsters, although the controls can be unwieldy. Sadly, the fun is short-lived, with no multi- player modes or replay appeal.\\" Detroit Free Press gave it two stars out of four and stated that \\"Potential players need to know that we cruised through the entire game‚Äîwithout any cheats‚Äîin about four hours.\\"  References   External links   Category:2004 video games Category:Activision games Category:3D platform games Category:A Series of Unfortunate Events Category:GameCube games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Java platform games Category:Mobile games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Jeremy Soule Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games ","title":"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (video game)"},{"id":"2528670","title":"Reginald Bamford"},{"id":"2528675","text":"Return to Krondor is a role-playing video game set in Raymond Feist's fictional fantasy setting of Midkemia. A sequel to 1993's Betrayal at Krondor, it was released for Windows 95 on the PC in time for the 1998 Thanksgiving and Christmas season. It was re-released on GOG.com in 2010 and again for Steam in 2016. Within the game, the player commands a group of heroes with different attributes, strengths, and weaknesses which the player may upgrade over the course of the game. Feist later wrote a novelization of this game, entitled Krondor: Tear of the Gods. It is the third part of his Riftwar Legacy trilogy; the first part of which was a novelization of Betrayal at Krondor entitled Krondor: The Betrayal. Gameplay Starting in the city of Krondor and eventually venturing out into other specific parts of the Midkemia world, the game focuses on battling humans and evil creatures of various kinds. Although the story is very linear in nature, the game offers a range of possibilities while the player is adventuring in Krondor. While the computer graphics of the game is now visually outdated by games like the plotwise very similar Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, the game featured some unique or rarely seen features at the time of release, including elaborate alchemy and thieving. Using alchemical equipment, it is possible to brew custom potions from a variety of ingredients. In order to open locked or trapped chests and doors, a simulation of the process of disarming and lockpicking is initiated. Facing a variety of different mechanisms, it is necessary to pick the right lockpicking tools and then use them with care, simulated by carefully timed mouse clicking.

He is a thief who has become a squire by favor of Arutha, Prince of Krondor. *Jazhara is a mage from a distant, Middle-Eastern-inspired land called Kesh. *William is a Krondorian guard and exceptional fighter. *Kendaric is both a mage and an alchemist. *Solon is a priest using divine magic and a body that blocks all blows. Development In 1994 Dynamix, at this time a division of Sierra On- line, reorganized their staff and canceled a planned sequel to Betrayal at Krondor named Thief of Dreams. Computer Gaming World reported in April 1994 that Fans organized a letter/e-mail campaign to persuade Dynamix to reverse their decision, to no avail. 7th Level purchased the license for the game in 1995 and renamed it Return to Krondor. Shortly after, Sierra began work on an unlicensed sequel to Betrayal at Krondor called Betrayal in Antara, setting the two games up to be in direct competition. This is why Return to Krondor was billed as \\"The official sequel to the best selling RPG\\" [emphasis added]. Designer Andy Ashcraft stated, \\"Dynamix was a flight sim company, and their engine [for Betrayal at Krondor] was a flight sim engine that had been tweaked into an RPG. Our strength is in animation, so we're tweaking an animation engine into an RPG.\\" 7th Level developed the game basics, produced the screen backgrounds and added the character voices. They then turned to Cincinnati- based Pyrotechnix for the more technical aspects of the game development. Pyrotechnix was sold to Sierra On-line in 1997. In 1998 Pyrotechnix completed the game. It was published in November. The game was updated for compatibility with modern systems and re-released on GOG.com on March 4, 2010. Reception Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter reported in December 1998 that Return to Krondor was \\"selling well\\". Writing for PC Gamer US, Michael Wolf summarized Return to Krondor as \\"a fun, quick RPG with a good story.\\" John Altman of Computer Games Strategy Plus found the game to be \\"very engaging\\" and \\"a stunning return to form for the Krondor series\\". He noted that it features \\"some of the juiciest turn-based battles ever to grace a role-playing game.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"The game is well-made, and the plot will keep gamers on the edge of their seats. It's just too bad they won't stay there very long.\\" Computer Gaming Worlds Petra Schlunk called the game \\"completely underdeveloped\\" and \\"a lightweight RPG\\", which failed to match Betrayal at Krondors quality. However, she believed that it has \\"a good combat system, a fair story (for what there is of one), and a definite fun factor.\\" In PC Zone, Paul Mallinson wrote, \\"Return To Krondor [is] a slightly frustrating experience initially. If you're the patient type and are prepared to put the hours in, though, you may just warm to it. Just like I did.\\" Reviewing the game for PC Games, Barry Brenesal wrote, \\"Though Return doesn't retain the innovations of its predecessor, the newer game remains good fun, with attractive visuals, a solid plot, and an excellent combat system.\\" The reviewer from the online second volume of Pyramid stated that \\"I've eagerly awaited the sequel, Return to Krondor, since the moment I heard it was in development.

Etymology As per tradition, gold was mined near the origin of the river at a village named piska near Ranchi. This is why it was named Subarnarekha, meaning \\"streak of gold\\". Legend has it that traces of gold were found in the river bed. Even now, people look for traces of gold particles in its sandy beds. The name is a combination of two words meaning gold and line/ streak in Indian languages. Course Subarnarekha river in Ghatshila, Jharkhand After originating near piska/nagri, near Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, the Subarnarekha traverses a long distance through RanchiSeraikela Kharsawan and East Singhbhum districts in the state. Thereafter, it flows for shorter distances through Paschim Medinipur district in West Bengal for and Balasore district of Odisha. There, it flows for and joins the Bay of Bengal near Talsari. The total length of the river is . The basin of the Subarnarekha is smaller than most multi-state river basins in India. The rain-fed river covers a drainage area of =Tributaries= The prominent tributaries of the Subarnarekha are Kharkai, Roro, Kanchi, Harmu Nadi, Damra, Karru, Chinguru, Karakari, Gurma, Garra, Singaduba, Kodia, Dulunga and Khaijori. The Kharkai meets the Subarnarekha at Sonari (Domuhani), a neighborhood of Jamshedpur. =Hundru Falls= Hundru Falls Hundru Falls is created on the course of the Subarnarekha, where it falls from a height of . The spectacular sight of water falling from such a great height is a sight to behold. The different rock formations due to erosion by the constantly falling water have added to the beauty of the place. =Pollution= The Subarnarekha passes through areas with extensive mining of copper and uranium ores. As a result of the unplanned mining activities, the river is polluted. The Subarnarekha has been the lifeline of tribal communities inhabiting the Chhotanagpur region and water pollution affects their livelihood. =Flood= Several areas in the lower reaches of the Subarnarekha, particularly the coastal areas of Odisha and West Bengal, are within the flood hazard zone. The Subarnarekha in Odisha had crossed its previous Highest Flood Level (HFL) of in 2007, surpassing the earlier record of 1997. In 2009, the Subarnarekha witnessed flash floods following heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas of the river. During the flood, large areas of Jaleswar, Bhograi and Baliapal blocks and a small pocket of Basta block in Balasore district of Odisha were affected. Certain areas of Medinipur in West Bengal are also affected by floods. Projects =Getalsud= Getalsud reservoir is located across the Subernarekha, east of Ranchi and about from its point of origin. Completed in 1971, this multi-purpose reservoir was envisaged mainly to meet municipal water demands of Ranchi city and the adjoining industrial area. The height of the dam is . There are two power houses in Sikidiri with one unit of 65 MW each. Sikidiri Hydal Power Plants are the only hydal projects in Jharkhand. =Subarnarekha multipurpose project= The Subarnarekha multipurpose project envisaged the construction of two dams, one at Chandil across the Subarnarekha and the other across the Kharkai at Icha near Chaibasa, two barrages at Galudih across the Subarnarekha and the other across the Kharkai at Ganjia near Adityapur and a network of canals from these. Three small storage reservoirs and a network of canals from these reservoirs are in Orissa. Started in 1982‚Äì83, the multipurpose project was planned for irrigation, hydropower generation and water supply. While the Chandil dam and Galudih barrage are almost complete, the other components are still incomplete. Subernarekha Barrage project (West Bengal) envisages construction of a barrage across the Subarnarekha downstream of Chandil dam and Galudih barrage near Bhosraghat to irrigate annually in the Medinipur district of West Bengal through a left bank canal and its distribution system covering a culturable command area of . The project was taken up for construction in the year 1995‚Äì96. Completed Chandil Dam The Chandil Dam and reservoir required of land. Icha Dam submerged of land in Jharkhand and of land in Orissa. The Ganjia Barrage required of land. Galudiha Barrage required of land, of which was private land and 30 hectares was Revenue Land. The canal network required additional land. The project experienced protests from its inception in 1975 and, in 1978, some 10,000 of them demonstrated against the dam at the construction site. To address the protests, the government increased the compensation package for 12,000 families and 2,200 people got jobs in different government departments.http://jhr.nic.in/hcjudge/data/50-1538-2009-24012011.pdf The construction of Chandil dam, Icha dam and Galudih barrage are complete. This dam is one of the most visited places of Jharkhand. The museum located close to the Chandil dam has scripts written on rocks, which are 2,000 years old. Subarnarekha port Dassam fall on Kanchi River before it merges with Subarnarekha The Government of Odisha has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chennai-based Creative Port Development Pvt.

Although the major markets for Idlib's soap were at Aleppo, Antioch, and Hama,Porter, 1868, p. 580. the product was exported as far as the Ottoman capital of Istanbul. Idlib was also a major producer of cotton fabrics.Inalcik, 1997, p.501. Western traveler Josias Leslie Porter noted that Idlib was \\"encompassed in olive groves, rare in this bleak region\\", and remarked that its olive groves were larger than those of Damascus, Beirut, or Gaza. In the mid-19th-century, the town had an estimated population of 8,000, including 500 Christians. In the late 19th century, Idlib was \\"flourishing\\" and still contained a number of Christian families, according to German orientalist Albert Socin.Baedeker, 1912, p.376. =Syrian Civil War= capture by rebel forces in 2015. During the uprising since 2011, Idlib was the focus of protests and fighting in the early phase of the Syrian war. As the uprising descended into armed conflict, Idlib became the focus of a rebel campaign, which temporarily captured the city and the governorate, prior to a government offensive in April 2012. After this, government forces retook the city and the rebel-controlled province after a month of fighting, prior to the attempted enforcement of the ceasefire proposed by Kofi Annan. After the 2015 Idlib offensive in March, the rebel alliance Army of Conquest, led by the al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham, succeeded in the Second Battle of Idlib and captured the city, as well as besieging the Shi'a-majority towns of Al-Fu'ah and Kafriya to the north of Idlib city. In April 2015, the interim seat of the Syrian opposition's Syrian Interim Government was proposed to be Idlib, in Idlib Governorate.

The Idoma language is classified in the Akweya subgroup of the Idomoid languages of the Volta‚ÄìNiger family, which include Alago, Agatu, Etulo and Yala languages of Benue, Nasarawa and Northern Cross river states. . The Akweya subgroup is closely related to the Yatye-Akpa sub-group. The bulk of the territory is inland, south of river Benue, some seventy-two kilometers east of its confluence with river Niger. The Idomas are known to be 'warriors' and 'hunters' of class, but hospitable and peace- loving. The greater part of Idoma land remained largely unknown to the West until the 1920s, leaving much of the colorful traditional culture of the Idoma intact. The population of the Idoma is estimated to be about 4 million. The Idoma people have a traditional ruler called the Och'Idoma who is the head of the Idoma Area Traditional Council while each community has its own traditional chief such as the Ad'Ogbadibo of Orokam, Chief D.E Enenche. The Palace of the overall Och'Idoma is located at Otukpo, Benue State. The present Och'Idoma, Elias Ikoyi Obekpa was installed into office in 1997 and the position is for life. Origin Idoma territory in Nigeria =Traditional history= The history of the Idoma people precedes the history of Benue State (created 1976) and the history of the Republic of Nigeria (created 1960). Oral tradition and dance is the primary method through which history has been passed in Idomaland and is considered a central cultural institution. From a young age Idoma children usually learn from their elders stories of old and are brought up around extended families, which make multiple historical resources available. When prompted Idomas generally will proudly tell you where they are from, and it‚Äôs not uncommon for Idoma to be able to recite at least four generations of their progenitors. Historically, being unable to answer the emblematic question ‚ÄúWho is your father?‚Äù disqualified one from important roles and titles in Idomaland. Quite naturally, a number of villages trace origins to single ancestors and further, several Idoma groups trace their heritage to one common ancestor, considered the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of the different groups. According to traditional history, Iduh, the father of the Idoma had several children who each established different areas. Hence the expression: ‚ÄúIduh the father of Idoma.‚Äù ‚ÄúIduh the father of Idoma Iduh who begot all the Idoma He also begot the following children: Ananawoogeno who begot the children of Igwumale; Olinaogwu who begot the people of Ugboju; Idum who begot the people of Adoka; Agabi who begot the people of Otukpo; Eje who begot the people of Oglewu; Ebeibi who begot the people of Umogidi in Adoka, Edeh who begot the people of Edumoga and Ode who begot the people of Yala ‚Äù While there may be some truth to the above, the Idoma cannot be said to have a unitary origin. Many Idoma groups and village subsets have their own histories complete with stories about how their people arrived at their current location. The Otukpa people descended from three ancestors: Owuno, Ameh- Ochagbaha and Oodo. The first two were brothers who migrated from Idah in Igalaland while Oodo migrated from Igbo land. As one can imagine, the ever- changing of people through time makes it difficult to study Idoma history. =Scholarly history= Scholars have combined oral history with genealogical data and analysis of kinship totems to trace the roots of the Idoma people as a whole. One notable Idoma scholar E.O. Erim cites genealogical data, collected from most modern groups in Idoma suggesting that they derive from several ethnic groups, each with different historical origin. Furthermore, the available genealogies indicate the existence of diverse ethnic groups who descended from ancestors other than Idu. In several of these cases, the claim of common descent is backed by both extensive genealogical connections and possession of common kinship totems. Erim contends that while Idu was certainly a migration leader‚Äîhe was not the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of the Idoma in the sense implied in the above traditions. These two considerations make it difficult to simply accept the view that every group in Idomaland is descended from Idu. Many Idoma kindred claim an ancestral homeland called Apa, north-east of present-day Idomaland due to pressures of Northern invaders as recently as 300 years ago. The historical Apa was part of the ancient Kwararafa Kingdom (Okolofa Kingdom), a confederacy of several peoples. Informants in other ethnic groups have corroborated existence of this kingdom, chiefly the Jukun who also believe they once ruled a confederacy called Kwararafa. In the Hausa book Kano Chronicle it is mentioned that Zaria, under Queen Amina conquered all towns as far as Kwarafara in the 15th century. At present, there is a Local Government Area in Benue State called Apa and is said to be the home of those who made the first migration from the historical kingdom. For many Idoma nationalists today, the name Apa elicits sentiments of a past glory, and some in the political sphere have gone as far as suggesting it should become the name of a new Idoma state. Other scholars point to historical and linguistic evidence that suggests that Idoma have ties with the Igala people to the west, concluding that the two nations came from a common ancestor. Angulu(1981) note that Igala and Igbo have important historical, ancestral and cultural relationships. Eri is said to be the original legendary cultural head of the Umu-eri, a subgroup of the Igbo people. Eri migrated from the Igala area and established a community in the middle of Anambra river valley (at Eri-aka) in Aguleri where he married two wives. The first wife, Nneamak·ª•, bore him five children. The first was Agulu, the founder of Aguleri (The ancestral head of Eri Kingdom clans) (the Ezeora dynasty that has produced 34 kings till date in Enugwu Aguleri), the second was Menri, the founder of Umunri / Kingdom of Nri, followed by Onugu, the founder of Igbariam and Ogbodulu, the founder of Amanuke. The fifth one was a daughter called Iguedo, who is said to have borne the founders of Nteje, and Awkuzu, Ogbunike, Umuleri, Nando and Ogboli in Onitsha. As one of the children of Eri, Menri migrated from Aguleri, which was and still is, the ancestral temple of the entire Umu-Eri (Umu-Eri and Umu- Nri). His second wife Oboli begot ·ªån·ªçja, the only son who founded the Igala Kingdom in Kogi State.Angulu (1981) An Igbo Civilization: Nri Kingdom and Hegemony Hardcover ‚Äì 1 Apr 1981 by M.Angulu Onwuejeogwu Among this group, there are those who believe both ethnic groups fled the same kingdom at some point in history. Many traditional Idoma spiritual chants and ‚Äúsecret‚Äù tongues spoken during traditional ceremonies are actually Igala dialects and there are some Idoma themselves who assert their Igala ancestry. There are yet other Idoma groups notably in the southern regions, which claim their ancestors arrived at their present location from Northern fringes of Igboland as a result of land disputes. Scholars believe these people had most likely fled Apa too, settled and resettled. As suggested, a number of factors make it difficult to study Idoma historical origins of the Idoma people as a whole. In any event, it could be said that despite their heterogeneous origins, trading, marriage, language and other interactions among the Idoma have cultivated traditions and shaped a rich cultural identity distinctly their own. Outside of Benue The popular idea is that the Idoma are an ethno-linguistic group primarily found in the western areas of Benue State, Nigeria. This is because they are the second largest group in the state and occupy 9 local government areas (L.G.A.‚Äôs) which include: Ado, Agatu, Apa, Obi, Ohimini, Ogbadibo, Oju, Okpokwu and Otukpo. Aside from the western parts of Benue, this tribe have settlements in other parts of the country, including Nassarawa, Kogi, Enugu and Cross River States. The men are obliged by tradition to pound yam for their wives, Unlike other cultures where the woman is expected to perform all culinary chores, the Idoma men are not always exempted. Idoma Traditional Colours Young Idoma woman wearing traditional colours preparing yam. The traditional colours of the Idoma people are red and black stripes. This has only been around since the 1980s to foster a distinct Idoma identity. Idoma Traditional Dance The most famous traditional dance of the Idoma people is known as Ogirinya dance. It is a highly energetic dance that requires jumping (at regular intervals) on the toes in short period of time. A video of the Ogirinya dance can be viewed on YouTube. Dancers putting on the Idoma attire (traditional colours) can be seen in both links. A Digital Art of elegant and energetic dancers from the Idoma speaking tribe of Benue State, Nigeria in their cultural attire of Red and Black strips. Traditional Food (Okoho Soup) The Idoma people are known for their love of food, as there is an annual food festival in Benue State to celebrate women and the various traditional cuisines. Most popular among their delicacies is the Okoho soup which is made with the peculiar Okoho plant, bush meat and many other ingredients. Idoma Traditional Religion With the advent of Christianity, Islam, and other foreign religions, the traditional belief systems of most ethnic groups in the country has been influenced by western practices. However, a majority of the Idoma people still believe strongly in the Alekwu, which is seen as the ancestral spirits- a link between the living and the dead. They host an annual ‚ÄòAje Alekwu‚Äô festival where traditional religious practitioners commune and make sacrifices in worship of their ancestors across the land. The Idomas have strong attachment to the Alekwu-spirit of the ancestors which is believed to stand as an invisible watchdog of the family and communities while checkmating vices like adultery, theft and murder. =Marriage= While the marriage rites and customs of the Idoma people is not unlike that of the Igbos and some other south-eastern cultures, there are specific aspects that clearly distinguish their tradition. In some Idoma subcultures the groom and his family have to present the bride with a rooster and some money on the marriage day after the bride price has already been paid. If she accepts, it is a sign of approval and disinterest if she rejects the gift. While there are no certain reasons to justify the need for a rooster, it remains an interesting part of the ceremony.

The seed cones are the largest of any juniper, berry-like but hard and dry, green ripening in about 25 months to dark purple-brown with a pale blue waxy coating; they are ovoid to spherical, 20‚Äì27 mm long and 20‚Äì25 mm diameter, and have six or nine fused scales in 2-3 whorls, each scale with a slightly raised apex. The three apical scales each bear a single seed, but with the three seeds fused together into a single nut-like shell. The male cones are produced in clusters (unlike any other juniper) of 5-20 cones together, yellow, 3‚Äì4 mm long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in early spring. Because of its distinct cones with the seeds fused three together and the clustered male cones, it has sometimes been treated in a distinct genus of its own as Arceuthos drupacea (Labill.) Antoine & Kotschy, but genetic studies have shown it is fairly closely related to Juniperus macrocarpa and Juniperus oxycedrus.

Alexandre Martin (27 April 1815 - 28 May 1895), nicknamed Albert l'Ouvrier (\\"Albert the Worker\\"), was a French socialist statesman of the French Second Republic. He was the first member of the industrial working class to be in French government. Early life Albert was born in Bury, in the Oise d√©partement to a peasant family. As a young man he moved to Paris, where he served as an apprentice in his uncle's machine shop; later, he worked as a machinist in a button factory. He participated in the July Revolution of 1830. Throughout his public life, he was known simply as \\"Albert the Worker,\\" and was closely associated with the socialist Louis Blanc. He was a member of a variety of secret revolutionary societies in the 1830s and 1840s. He was made leader of the revolutionary Nouvelles Saisons society in 1839, and editor of the l'Atelier the following year. 1848 He fought on the barricades in the revolution of 1848, and was a member of the socialist government that formed at the H√¥tel de Ville. When the socialists were included into the provisional government, Louis Blanc made Albert ‚Äì by this time a popular figure among the workers ‚Äì a secretary. He was sent to the Luxembourg Commission ‚Äì the provisional government's labor commission ‚Äì as Louis Blanc's vice-president, a position he held until the 15 May riots. Albert and Blanc were two of the six members of the Luxembourg Commission to be elected in the April elections. The socialists ‚Äì who, through the Luxembourg Commission ran a virtual state-within-a-state ‚Äì clashed with the Assembly. Blanc's proposal for a fully fledged ministry of labor in keeping with his ideal for \\"national workshops\\" was rejected on 10 May. By this time, Albert had lost faith in the provisional government, and, together with Louis Auguste Blanqui and Armand Barb√®s, attempted an insurrection of his own. On 15 May, they led a crowd, demonstrating against the government; the riot was bloodily suppressed by the bourgeois National Guards, and Albert and Barb√®s were captured at the H√¥tel de Ville. Trial, prison, and later life Albert did not defend himself at the subsequent trial at Bourges, in 1849. He was thus found guilty of treason and an attempt to incite revolution, and sent to prison on Belle √éle for four years. When he became ill in 1854, he was transferred to Tours, where he remained until he was released by the general amnesty of 16 August 1859. He returned to Paris as a working man, taking a job for the gas company. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, became a member of the Commission des Barricades in the Government of National Defense, and stood for election twice in the Third Republic ‚Äì but lost both attempts. He retired to Mello in his home d√©partement of Oise. Upon his death in 1895, he was given a national funeral, and his tombstone was given by the government.

Map of boundary expansion of modern Seoul (from 1914 to 1995) The history of Seoul can be traced back as far as 18 BC, although humans have occupied the area now known as Seoul since Paleolithic Age. It has been the capital of numerous kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula since it was established. Early history =Prehistoric= Amsa-dong Preshistoric Settlement Site in Amsa-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul. It is believed that humans were living in the area that is now Seoul along the lower reaches of the Han River during the Paleolithic Age and archaeological research shows that people began to lead settled lives starting in the Neolithic Age. Prehistoric remains that are unearthed in the Amsa Prehistoric Site (ÏïîÏÇ¨ÏÑ†ÏÇ¨Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ, Amsa Seonsa Yujeokji), located in Amsa-dong, Gangdong District, date back to about 3,000 to 7,000 years ago. With the introduction of bronze ware from about 700 BC, settlements gradually began to spread from the river basin toward inland areas. =Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla period= In 18 BC, the kingdom of Baekje founded its capital city, Wiryeseong (ÏúÑÎ°ÄÏÑ±), which is believed to be inside modern-day Seoul. Baekje subsequently developed from a member state of the Mahan confederacy into one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. There are several city wall remains in the Seoul area dating from this time. Among them, Pungnap Toseong (ÌíçÎÇ©ÌÜ†ÏÑ±), an earthen wall in the southeastern part of modern-day Seoul, (in Pungnap-dong, just near Jamsil-dong area) is widely believed to be the main Wiryeseong site. Yet another earthen wall, Mongchon Toseong (Î™ΩÏ¥åÌÜ†ÏÑ±), located nearby, is also dated from the early Baekje era. All of these sites are in the south of the Han River, and do not belong to the historic Seoul district (centered in modern-day Jongno District), which is well in the north of the river. As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region of the Korean Peninsula, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in 475 and from Goguryeo to the Silla in 553. Silla soon gained full control of the city and then the peninsula, and during the Unified Silla period, Hanyang (ÌïúÏñë; ) first referred to a district in the city, and later the city itself. =Goryeo period= It was thought that the kingdom that controlled the Han River valley would also have strategic control of the whole peninsula, because it was a center of transportation. In 1104, King Sukjong of the Goryeo Dynasty built a palace in Kaesong (Í∞úÏÑ±, ÈñãÂüé), which was then referred to as Namgyeong (ÎÇ®Í≤Ω; ) or \\"Southern Capital\\". Seoul grew into a full-scale city with political significance during this time. Joseon period At the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1394, the capital was moved to Seoul, also known as Hanyang and later as Hanseong (ÌïúÏÑ±, Êº¢Âüé, \\"Fortress city [on] the Han [River]\\"), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. Originally entirely surrounded by a massive circular wall (a -high circular stone fortress) to provide its citizens security from wild animals such as the tiger as well as thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (outside of the mountains north of the downtown area), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun, or South Gate) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun, or East Gate) but also Sukjeongmun (commonly known as Bukdaemun, or North Gate) and four smaller gates included Changuimun and Hyehwamun. During the Joseon Dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells. A capital prefecture, Hanseong, consisted of inner districts (i.e. ) and outer districts (; approximately off the city wall). The Jungnangcheon River, the Han River, Mount Bukhan, and Hongjecheon formed the administrative prefectural boundary.

Korean Empire period Seoul, capital city of the Korean Empire in 1905, showing contrast between tradition and modernity. In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to have electricity, trolley cars, water, telephone, and telegraph systems all at the same time. Much of this was due to trade with foreign countries like France and United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean-American owned enterprises. In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \\"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.‚Äù File:Streetcar1903.jpgStreetcar in Seoul during the Korean Empire (1903).

File:Hospital during the Korean Empire.jpgTaehan Hospital of Seoul during the Gwangmu Reform. Colonial Korea When the Empire of Japan annexed the Korean Empire, it utilized Seoul as the colonial capital. While under colonial rule (1910‚Äì1945), the city was called Keijo (); ( or Kyongsong, literally meaning \\"Capital City\\" in Hanja.). Keijo was an urban city (Î∂Ä/Â∫ú) that had 2 wards : Keijo itself and Ryusan-ku (ÈæçÂ±±ÂçÄ, , ). Gyeongseong was part of Gyeonggi Province, instead of being an independent city or prefecture as in Joseon and present days. In 1914, several outer districts of the prefecture were annexed to neighboring Goyang County (now Goyang City, reducing the administrative size of the prefecture. In 1936, Gyeongseong expanded itself as it annexed Yeongdeungpo from Siehung County (Now Siehung City) and recombined some parts of former Gyeongseong districts (Sungin, Yeonghee, etc.) from Goyang County. The Government-General Building served as the seat of the colonial government of Colonial Korea but was torn down in 1995.

File:Keijo Nippo Company Building.JPGKeijo Nippo Company Building. Division and Korean War After World War II and Korea's liberation, the city took its present name of Seoul. When the Republic of Korea (South Korea) was declared, the new state adopted the city as its capital. In 1949, Seoul administrative area expanded to Ui- dong to the north, and Guro-dong and Daerim-dong to the south, recombining some areas which were annexed from original Seoul to Goyang County in 1914. In 1950, the Korean War broke out and Seoul changed hands between the North Korean forces and South Korean forces four times, leaving the city largely destroyed at the end of the war. One estimate of the extensive damage states that at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, there were a flood of refugees from the North, swelling the city's population to an estimated 2.5 million persons. More than half of them were homeless. The government considered moving its capital city to Yeongdeungpo and Bupyeong, which are south of the Han River. Following the war, Seoul became the focus of an immense reconstruction and modernization effort. Rapid economic growth achieved during the industrialization of the 1960s and 1970s raised living standards of residents considerably in Seoul. In 1963, Seoul greatly expanded in size by annexing a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties in Gyeonggi Province, such as Bucheon, Siheung, Gwangju, Yangju, and Gimpo. However, many newly annexed districts were still rural until Gangnam area began to be developed into urban neighborhoods from the late 1970s. At the same time, Gwacheon Township (today's Gwacheon city) and the northern part of West Township (today's Gwangmyeong city) in Siheung County, parts of Ojeong Township in Bucheon County, and Sindo Township in Goyang County were also annexed to the Seoul Metropolitan Urban Planning Districts (), taking these areas as provisional districts for further official municipal annexation to Seoul in the future. In 1973, some parts of Sindo Township in Goyang County (today's Jingwan-dong in the Eunpyeong District) were officially annexed to Seoul. The remaining parts of Sindo Township, Goyang and the northern part of West Township, Siheung (today's Gwangmyeong City) were provisionally planned to be annexed to Seoul, but the municipal annexation plan foundered in the end, in which the symbolic event for this was the establishment of Gwangmyeong City (other than annexation to Guro-gu) in 1981, as the rapid growth of Seoul City was a great concern for governmental officials. High-rise office buildings and apartments began sprouting throughout the city during the construction boom of the 1980s. Pollution and traffic jams became major issues as urbanization in the country accelerated and more and more people began moving to Seoul and its surrounding areas. Despite a green belt established around the city to prevent urban sprawl, the Seoul metropolitan area soon became the third largest in the world in terms of population and one of the most crowded. Today, the population of the Seoul area comprises 20% of the total population of South Korea. Seoul was the host city of the 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. During the 1990s, the city began to attract many workers from other countries, changing demographics. Previously, nearly all of Seoul's residents were Korean. Today, there are an estimated 200,000 foreign nationals living in Seoul. These include tens of thousands of English teachers from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and other English-speaking countries as well as laborers from Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. In 1995, the boundary between Seoul and Gwangmyeong rearrangement was implemented, merging parts of Cheolsan 3-dong, Gwangmyeong in the Geumcheon District of Seoul. Around the time of the 1995 municipal annexation in South Korea, the government once seriously considered a division of Seoul into several municipal or metropolitan cities, but the division plan foundered as it would be expected to cause serious problems in aspects of metropolitan governance in Seoul. In addition, there are many language instructors from English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, United States, and the UK, as a major business and financial center, Seoul also has many executives and analysts from North America, Europe, and Japan. Seoul ranks seventh in the world in terms of the number of Fortune 500 transnational companies headquartered there.Richard Child Hill and June Woo Kim. GLOBAL CITIES & DEVELOPMENTAL STATES.

Failed relocation of the capital On 11 August 2004, the South Korean government announced they would relocate the capital city from Seoul to the Gongju area as of 2007, to ease the population pressure on Seoul and to get the government to a safer distance from North Korea in case of a Northern military invasion.S Korea chooses new capital site ‚Äì BBC News Gongju is approximately south of Seoul. The Government estimated that the move would probably not be completed before 2012. Although part of the election manifesto, this plan ignited nationwide controversy. On 21 October 2004, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that mostly based on custom law, the special law for the relocation of the capital is unconstitutional since the relocation is a serious national matter requiring national referendum or revision of the constitution, thus effectively ending the dispute. In late 2004, however, the South Korean government announced plans to move most of the national government branches, except the Executive Branch, to Gongju, thus evading violation of the Constitutional Court ruling and still allow Seoul to be a National Capital. Since this plan was supported by the late president Roh Moo-hyun and bitterly opposed by the current ruling party and the former president (Lee Myung-bak ‚Äì the former mayor of Seoul) the planned move was scaled back dramatically when Lee Myung-bak took office. As of 2011, some preliminary work has begun on construction of new government buildings in the Gongju area. No government agencies want to move away from the center of power in Seoul, so which agencies will be forced to move is the subject of intense behind-the-scenes debate. Sejong City was founded in 2007 as part of efforts to relocate the national capital. It was created from territory of South Chungcheong and North Chungcheong provinces to ease congestion in Seoul and encourage investment in the country's central region. Since 2012, the Government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities - namely Seoul where the National Assembly, the Blue House and many important government bodies remain.

Critical reception and legacy  Upon release, Melody Maker wrote a favourable review: \\"Parts of it are so wistfully carefree that it's impossible not to credit Robert Smith as the talisman ‚Äì his irreverence seems to course through everything. 'Take Me Back' is the Banshees rollicking like some primitive jazz combo drunk on the Good Lord's wine. On 'Belladonna', Smith's liquid guitar relaxes Sioux to the extent that she drops a few masks to reveal her vulnerability. When the siren sings 'daylight devours your unguarded hours', she's illuminating her own predicament so acutely it surely can't be coincidence. 'Dazzle', too, is naively daring: Siouxsie's voice, framed alone against the firmament of strings. [...] You can get impressed, wrapped up and lost in this'\\". In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Cook gave Hy√¶na a 4.5-star rating and wrote: \\"The emphasis here is on layered arrangements and pop tunes disguised as art-house production numbers (\\"Dazzle\\"); tasteful horn and keyboard parts expand the group's guitar-dominated sound and provide Siouxsie with an airy and dreamlike backdrop in which to fully display her considerable vocal talents\\". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave a 3 out of 5 rating saying that Smith brought a \\"surprisingly disciplined influence\\" to the band, which they recognised in the album's \\"best cuts: the liquid-mercury 'Dazzle', the sparse 'Swimming Horses', and a lushly appointed cover of the Beatles' 'Dear Prudence'\\". When the album was reissued, The Quietus praised it saying: \\"[It was] their most experimental work, Smith's presence is keenly felt on the disciplined execution of the grandiose 'Dazzle' or the starkly seductive 'Swimming Horses'. But the real treasures were buried deep within the album. The lysergic Spaghetti Western twang of 'Bring Me The Head of the Preacher Man' is evocative in its execution while the densely epic 'Blow The House Down' finds Smith indelibly stamping his mark on the track courtesy of some his finest guitar work\\". Hy√¶na was namechecked by Brett Anderson, the singer of Suede. James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers hired producer Hedges because he loved the sound on lead single \\"Swimming Horses\\". Bradfield stated: \\"Swimming Horses' by the Banshees ‚Äì what a fucking record that is! [...] I remember thinking 'You really care about that record. I'm gonna have to chase that record down.\\" He also mentioned the importance of the drums: \\"I loved [...] Banshees records [...] where everything starts with the drums\\".

The National Shooting Centre The National Shooting Centre is a wholly owned trading subsidiary of the National Rifle Association. The original centre was at Wimbledon, but in the late 1880s the National Rifle Association began searching for a new site. In early 1888 it seemed that Cannock Chase was to be selected from several locations under consideration. However, that plan fell through a few months later, and the other potential venues again put their cases, with the Middlesex Chronicle newspaper suggesting that a large site at Staines was a likely home for \\"The New Wimbledon\\". Eventually, though, Bisley was selected. The principal ranges used at Bisley today are as originally laid out in 1890 to accommodate modern full-bore rifle shooting.

In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related organisms that are so similar in appearance that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms that are sometimes used synonymously but have more precise meanings are cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species that live in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. Two or more taxa that were once considered conspecific (of the same species) may later be subdivided into infraspecific taxa (taxa within a species, such as bacterial strains or plant varieties), that is complex but it is not a species complex. A species complex is in most cases a monophyletic group with a common ancestor, but there are exceptions. It may represent an early stage after speciation but may also have been separated for a long time period without evolving morphological differences. Hybrid speciation can be a component in the evolution of a species complex. Species complexes exist in all groups of organisms and are identified by the rigorous study of differences between individual species that uses minute morphological details, tests of reproductive isolation, or DNA-based methods, such as molecular phylogenetics and DNA barcoding. The existence of extremely similar species may cause local and global species diversity to be underestimated. The recognition of similar- but-distinct species is important for disease and pest control and in conservation biology although the drawing of dividing lines between species can be inherently difficult. Definition A species complex is typically considered as a group of close, but distinct species. Obviously, the concept is closely tied to the definition of a species. Modern biology understands a species as \\"separately evolving metapopulation lineage\\" but acknowledges that the criteria to delimit species may depend on the group studied. Thus, many traditionally defined species defined, based only on morphological similarity, have been found to be several distinct species when other criteria, such as genetic differentiation or reproductive isolation, are applied. A more restricted use applies the term to close species between which hybridisation occurred or is occurring, which leads to intermediate forms and blurred species boundaries. The informal classification, superspecies, can be exemplified by the grizzled skipper butterfly, which is a superspecies that is further divided into three subspecies. Some authors apply the term to a species with intraspecific variability, which might be a sign of ongoing or incipient speciation. Examples are ring species or species with subspecies, in which it is often unclear if they should be considered separate species. =Related concepts= Several terms are used synonymously for a species complex, but some of them may also have slightly different or narrower meanings. In the nomenclature codes of zoology and bacteriology, no taxonomic ranks are defined at the level between subgenera and species, but the botanical code defines four ranks below genera (section, subsections, series and subseries). Different informal taxonomic solutions have been used to indicate a species complex. Identification Distinguishing close species within a complex requires the study of often very small differences. Morphological differences may be minute and visible only by the use of adapted methods, such as microscopy. However, distinct species sometimes have no morphological differences. In those cases, other characters, such as in the species' life history, behavior, physiology, and karyology, may be explored. For example, territorial songs are indicative of species in the treecreepers, a bird genus with few morphological differences. Mating tests are common in some groups such as fungi to confirm the reproductive isolation of two species. Analysis of DNA sequences is becoming increasingly standard for species recognition and may, in many cases, be the only useful method. Different methods are used to analyse such genetic data, such as molecular phylogenetics or DNA barcoding. Such methods have greatly contributed to the discovery of cryptic species, including such emblematic species as the fly agaric or the African elephants. Evolution and ecology =Speciation process= A species complex typically forms a monophyletic group that has diversified rather recently, as is shown by the short branches between the species A‚ÄìE (blue box) in this phylogenetic tree. Species forming a complex have typically diverged very recently from each other, which sometimes allows the retracing of the process of speciation. Species with differentiated populations, such as ring species, are sometimes seen as an example of early, ongoing speciation: a species complex in formation. Nevertheless, similar but distinct species have sometimes been isolated for a long time without evolving differences, a phenomenon known as \\"morphological stasis\\". For example, the Amazonian frog Pristimantis ockendeni is actually at least three different species that diverged over 5 million years ago. Stabilizing selection has been invoked as a force maintaining similarity in species complexes, especially they adaptat to special environments, such as a host in the case of symbionts or extreme environments, constrains possible directions of evolution: in such cases, strongly divergent selection is not to be expected. Also, asexual reproduction, such as through apomixis in plants, may separate lineages without producing a great degree of morphological differentiation. Possible processes explaining similarity of species in a species complex: a ‚Äì morphological stasis b ‚Äì hybrid speciation A species complex is usually a group that has one common ancestor (a monophyletic group), but closer examination can sometimes disprove that. For example, yellow-spotted \\"fire salamanders\\" in the genus Salamandra, formerly all classified as one species S. salamandra, are not monophyletic: the Corsican fire salamander's closest relative has been shown to be the entirely black Alpine salamander. In such cases, similarity has arisen from convergent evolution. Hybrid speciation can lead to unclear species boundaries through a process of reticulate evolution, in which species have two parent species as their most recent common ancestors. In such cases, the hybrid species may have intermediate characters, such as in Heliconius butterflies. Hybrid speciation has been observed in various species complexes, such as insects, fungi and plants. In plants, hybridization often takes place through polyploidization, and hybrid plant species are called nothospecies. =Range and habitats= Sources differ on whether or not members of a species group share a range. A source from Iowa State University Department of Agronomy states that members of a species group usually have partially overlapping ranges but do not interbreed with one another. A Dictionary of Zoology (Oxford University Press 1999) describes a species group as complex of related species that exist allopatrically and explains that the \\"grouping can often be supported by experimental crosses in which only certain pairs of species will produce hybrids.\\" The examples given below may support both uses of the term \\"species group.\\" Often, such complexes do not become evident until a new species is introduced into the system, which breaks down existing species barriers. An example is the introduction of the Spanish slug in Northern Europe, where interbreeding with the local black slug and red slug, which were traditionally considered clearly separate species that did not interbreed, shows that they may be actually just subspecies of the same species. Where closely related species co-exist in sympatry, it is often a particular challenge to understand how the similar species persist without outcompeting each other. Niche partitioning is one mechanism invoked to explain that. Indeed, studies in some species complexes suggest that species divergence have gone in par with ecological differentiation, with species now preferring different microhabitats. Similar methods also found that the Amazonian frog Eleutherodactylus ockendeni is actually at least three different species that diverged over 5 million years ago. A species flock may arise when a species penetrates a new geographical area and diversifies to occupy a variety of ecological niches, a process known as adaptive radiation. The first species flock to be recognized as such was the 13 species of Darwin's finches on the Gal√°pagos Islands described by Charles Darwin. Practical implications =Biodiversity estimates= It has been suggested that cryptic species complexes are very common in the marine environment. That suggestion came before the detailed analysis of many systems using DNA sequence data but has been proven to be correct. The increased use of DNA sequence in the investigation of organismal diversity (also called phylogeography and DNA barcoding) has led to the discovery of a great many cryptic species complexes in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan Celleporella hyalina, detailed morphological analyses and mating compatibility tests between the isolates identified by DNA sequence analysis were used to confirm that these groups consisted of more than 10 ecologically distinct species, which had been diverging for many million years. Evidence from the identification of cryptic species has led some to conclude that current estimates of global species richness are too low. =Disease and pathogen control= The Anopheles gambiae mosquito complex contains both species that are a vector for malaria and species that are not. Pests, species that cause diseases and their vectors, have direct importance for humans. When they are found to be cryptic species complexes, the ecology and the virulence of each of these species need to be re-evaluated to devise appropriate control strategies. Examples are cryptic species in the malaria vector genus of mosquito, Anopheles,the fungi causing cryptococcosis, and sister species of Bactrocera tyroni, or the Queensland fruit fly. Curiously, that pest is indistinguishable from two sister species except that B. tyroni inflicts widespread, devastating damage to Australian fruit crops, but the sister species do not. =Conservation biology= When a species is found to be several phylogenetically distinct species, each typically has smaller distribution ranges and population sizes than had been reckoned. The different species can also differ in their ecology, such as by having different breeding strategies or habitat requirements, which must taken into account for appropriate management. For example, giraffe populations and subspecies differ genetically to such an extent that they may be considered species. Although the giraffe, as a whole, is not considered to be threatened, if each cryptic species is considered separately, there is a much higher level of threat.

He spent nineteen seasons with Eintracht Frankfurt, appearing in 413 official games over the course of 13 Bundesliga seasons. Club career Born Erbach im Odenwald, Hessen, West Germany, Nikolov grew up in Sandbach in Hessen, starting playing football with local SG Sandbach. Nikolov started his senior career as backup, first to Uli Stein and then Andreas K√∂pke. After the latter left the team in June 1996 following the team's relegation from the Bundesliga he became first-choice, losing that status in early 2002 to newly-signed Dirk Heinen; he made his debut in the top division on 9 September 1995, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3‚Äì1 home win against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In the following years Nikolov played in every season. In February 2007, after Pr√∂ll received a rib injury, he was reinstated by manager Friedhelm Funkel, contributing with 20 games during the team's 2006-07 season. In January 2010, it was announced that the 35-year-old Nikolov would not renew his contract with Eintracht that was due to expire in the summer, but he eventually signed a new deal until 2012, and later until 2013. In June 2013, Eintracht revealed that the goalkeeper's contract would be cancelled, effective immediately to allow Nikolov to fulfill his lifelong dream to play in the United States. On 19 June 2013, Nikolov signed with the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer. He made his first start as a Union player on 30 July 2013 in a friendly against Stoke City playing 45 minutes. Nikolov signed with Fort Lauderdale Strikers on 19 February 2014 on a contract for the nine-game Spring season. Nikolov started and played eight matches in goal for the Strikers, posting two clean sheets. The team ended up as runners-ups.

The episode is set in Scotland in 1879. In the episode, a group of warrior monks intend to use an alien werewolf (Tom Smith) to take over the British Empire and start an \\"Empire of the Wolf\\" by turning Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins) into a werewolf. Plot While attempting to get to an Ian Dury concert in Sheffield in 1979, the Tenth Doctor and Rose accidentally land in the Scottish moors 100 years earlier in 1879. They encounter a carriage carrying Queen Victoria, who has been forced to travel by roads to Balmoral Castle as a fallen tree has blocked the train line to Aberdeen, which is feared to be a potential assassination attempt. The Doctor poses as the Queen's protector using his psychic paper, and he and Rose join the Queen as she travels to the Torchwood Estate, a favourite of her late consort Prince Albert, to spend the night. The royal party is unaware that the Torchwood Estate has been captured by a group of monks led by Father Angelo, forcing its owner, Sir Robert MacLeish, to play into their ruse as they take the place of the house's servants and guards. The monks, having arranged for the fallen tree to force the Queen to the estate, have brought a man infected with a form of lycanthropy, hoping to pass its nature to the Queen and create a new \\"Empire of the Wolf\\". The costume and set of the werewolf, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. The Doctor soon realises the trap they have fallen into, and helps to save Rose, the Queen, and Sir Robert from Father Angelo's men and the werewolf by taking shelter in the estate's library, its wood coated with oil of mistletoe wood to stave off the beast. They study the library and discover evidence collected by Sir Robert's father, a polymath, and Prince Albert which indicates the werewolf is really the current form of an alien species that survives by passing its lycanthropic form from human to human. The Doctor also realises that the estate was designed as a trap for the werewolf, as by use of its strange telescope along with the Queen's Koh-i-Noor diamond, its cut fashioned by Prince Albert, they can destroy the alien lifeform. Sir Robert sacrifices himself to allow the Doctor, Rose, and the Queen to prepare the telescope in the observatory. They are able to trap and kill the werewolf in the concentrated light of the full moon collected by the diamond. The next day, the Queen gives the Doctor and Rose knighthoods before banishing them from the British Empire, with an order to never return. In honour of Sir Robert's sacrifice and his father's ingenuity, she orders the creation of the Torchwood Institute to help defend Britain from further alien attacks, declaring that, if the Doctor should return, he should beware, because Torchwood will be waiting, ready to deal with him. =Continuity= The Doctor introduces himself as \\"James McCrimmon\\". Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) was a young (fictional) Scottish piper from the 18th Century, and a companion of the Second Doctor. Production In the scene where the Doctor and Rose meet the Queen's guards, the Doctor slips into a Scottish accent, which is a reference to actor David Tennant's heritage. Michelle Duncan and Jamie Sives were unable to attend the readthrough for this story, and their parts were read by Tennant's parents, who happened to be visiting the Doctor Who set. Tennant told reporters at the series' press launch, \\"Because it's set in Scotland they were delighted to be asked to read in. My mum played Lady Isobel and my dad played Captain Reynolds and they were in seventh heaven. And they were genuinely cheesed off when they didn't get asked to play the parts for real! I was like, 'Chill-out, Mum and Dad, back in your box!'\\" Treowen House in Dingestow, Wales, was one of the sites for filming this episode, representing Torchwood House in the Scottish Highlands. Exterior shots were filmed at Craig-y-Nos Castle, Swansea Valley. The monk fight scene was filmed at a courtyard in Dyffryn Gardens, St Nicholas. At one point during filming, Billie Piper's hair caught fire. Interviewed in Doctor Who Confidential, director Euros Lyn said that various martial arts films were viewed in researching the opening fight sequence, including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The werewolf in this story is computer-generated. Pauline Collins stated in a BBC press release that there were two performance artists who demonstrated the movements that the werewolf would do and talked about the problems of overacting in a situation where one was simply reacting to a green screen.BBC Press Office (7 April 2006), Programme Information: Network TV Week 17, 22‚Äì28 April 2006. Press release, PDF, pp. 4‚Äì5: \\"By Royal appointment\\". A deleted scene was included on the boxset DVD, where the Doctor and Rose, after being knighted, run off towards the TARDIS. =Cast notes= Pauline Collins appeared previously in the series as Samantha Briggs in the Second Doctor serial The Faceless Ones (1967). This makes her the third actor from the classic series to appear in the new series, following William Thomas (Remembrance of the Daleks and \\"Boom Town\\") and Nisha Nayar (Paradise Towers and \\"Bad Wolf\\"/\\"The Parting of the Ways\\"). Collins had been offered a role as a companion in 1967, but had turned this down. According to the accompanying episode commentary, actor Tom Smith, who played the Host, attended drama school with David Tennant. When Sir Robert offers to precede the Queen out of the window, she calls him \\"my Sir Walter Raleigh\\". Actor Derek Riddell had played Raleigh in the BBC drama The Virgin Queen, screened earlier in the year. The script originally had Victoria refer to Sir Francis Drake, until Riddell pointed out that this would have been incorrect for the reference the Queen was making. Broadcast and reception Overnight ratings for the episode peaked at 10.03 million (during one five-minute segment). The audience Appreciation Index was 83.Tooth and Claw Overnight Ratings (23 April) The episode received an average of 9.24 million viewers, taking the timeshift into account.UK Ratings and AI Report (May 3) The Defending the Earth! site update for this episode features another \\"live\\" message from Mickey Smith to the viewer. Mickey mentions how he was tracking satellites on the Torchwood website but was kicked out. He then re-directs the viewer to the Torchwood House site, telling them to access the telescope feed by using the password \\"Victoria\\" and help him search for the satellites. This episode was released on 5 June 2006 as a basic DVD with no special features, together with \\"School Reunion\\" and \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\", and as part of a second series boxset on 20 November 2006. This release included an audio commentary by writer Russell T Davies, visual effects supervisor David Houghton and supervising art director Stephen Nicholas. Ian Berriman of SFX was highly positive of the episode, calling it \\"frigging ace\\" and praising Collins' portrayal of Queen Victoria. He particularly praised Davies' writing and the tone of the episode. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating, highlighting the cinematography and special effects used on the werewolf. However, he thought that the story was \\"entertaining\\" and had a \\"few exciting moments\\", but it was unsatisfying with elements such as the werewolf chase feeling out of place for Doctor Who. For the website in 2010, Matt Wales named \\"Tooth and Claw\\" the seventh best Tenth Doctor episode. However, Dek Hogan of Digital Spy was less positive about the episode, finding it a let- down after the series opener, though he thought the wolf \\"looked great\\".

First patented in 1928, it was revived during the 1980s. Although perceived as an environmentally friendly material due to the significant recycled content, this is offset by the presence of cement. The material lacks standardisation, and proper use therefore requires care and experience. Eric Patterson and Mike McCain, who have been credited with independently \\"inventing\\" papercrete (they called it \\"padobe\\" and \\"fibrous cement\\"), have both contributed considerably to research into machinery to make it and ways of using it for building. Manufacture The paper to be used can come from a variety of sources, including newspaper, junk mail, magazines, books. A mixer is used to pulp the mix. Depending on the type of mixer, the paper may be soaked in water beforehand. Standardization and commercial acceptance As of 2007, papercrete lacks approval from the International Code Council. This limits its range of use within the city limits of most incorporated United States cities where building codes apply. It is not used as a load-bearing wall where building codes apply. However, its strength in model structures has been proven, and homes and small commercial buildings are being constructed. There is little or no evidence of its long- term durability at present. In these small building projects, papercrete is being used as an in-fill wall in conjunction with structural steel beams or other load-bearing elements. Papercrete gets its name from the fact that most formulas use a mixture of water and cement with cellulose fiber. The fiber is usually acquired from recycled newspaper, lottery tickets and phone books. The mixture has the appearance and texture of oatmeal and is poured into forms and dried in the sun, much like the process for making adobe. Dried papercrete has very low strength, but fails by slow compression (due to the large air content and hence compressibility) rather than in a brittle manner. Concrete and wood (though dry soft wood can be as high as R-2 per inch, high moisture content reduces this value markedly) are not known for their insulating qualities; however, papercrete also provides good insulation. Papercrete's R-value is reported to be within 2.0 and 3.0 per inch (2.54 cm); papercrete walls are typically 10 to 12 inches thick (about 25‚Äì30 cm). Unlike concrete or adobe, papercrete blocks are lightweight, less than a third of the weight of a comparably-sized adobe brick. Papercrete is mold resistant and has utility as a sound-proofing material. Research tests into papercrete have been carried out by Barry Fuller in Arizona and Zach Rabon in Texas. Fuller directs government-funded research on papercrete through the Arizona State University Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. He is also head of a subcommittee for the American Society for Testing and Materials, and it is his goal to set standards that will lead to acceptance of the product within the architectural community and commercialization of the product, especially for affordable housing. Structural tests have been completed on several papercrete formulas and Fuller claims the compressive strength of papercrete to be in the 140-160 psi range (0.96 - 1.1 MPa), while others like Kelly Hart claim 260 psi (1.7 MPa).http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/papercrete.htm For comparison, the compressive strength of concrete ranges from 15 MPa to over 70 MPa (2200 - 10000 psi) depending on the application. A more useful measure of papercrete's properties is its stiffness - i.e. the extent to which it compresses under load. Its stiffness is many times less than that of concrete, but sufficient for the support of roof loads in some low-height buildings. Dried, ready-to- use papercrete has a rough surface. This increases its surface area and provides a very strong bond from one block to the next. Papercrete has also been tested for its tensile strength. Fuller notes that a papercrete block is the equivalent of hundred of pages of paper - almost like a catalog. Papercrete has very good shear strength as a block. Lateral load involves sideways force - the wind load on the entire area of an outside wall for example. Because papercrete walls are usually a minimum of twelve inches thick, and usually pinned with rebar, they may be strong laterally. Zach Rabon founded Mason Greenstar in Mason, Texas for the purpose of producing and selling a commercially viable papercrete block. His product, Blox Building System, is at present the only mass-produced commercial papercrete block in the market. He has built several residential structures with it. The Mason Greenstar block had its genesis in a journey Rabon's father, Kent Rabon, made to Marathon, Texas. The elder Rabon made the acquaintance of Clyde T. Curry, the proprietor of Eve's Garden Organic Bed & Breakfast and Ecology Resource Center. Mr. Curry was an early proponent of papercrete and benefited from the lack of building regulations in the small mountain community of Marathon. Curry built four of the rooms at the bed and breakfast either partially or entirely out of papercrete and is in the process of building two more, in addition to a library and reception area, entirely out of papercrete. Papercrete's ready moldability provides considerable flexibility in the designed shape of structures. Domed ceilings/roofs may be commonly constructed with this material. Along with Fuller's work at Arizona State University, Curry's establishment has become a resource center for people interested in papercrete, and workshops are intermittently held there. The Rabons had prior experience as homebuilders and are owners of a ready-mix cement plant in Mason. They have invested in research and testing on their product for several years. However, they consider their product a proprietary formula. They have filed for a separate patent even though a patent for papercrete had already been filed in 1928. The block developed by Mason Greenstar is known for its uniform shrinkage (all papercrete blocks go through a lengthy dry-time that involves some shrinkage), giving it a sharper edge. Fuller has remarked that in tests he has performed on the Rabon block, it has outperformed other formulas. Papercrete is claimed to have benefit of being a project that involves little cost to start. The materials are claimed to be cheap and widely available. Machinery suitable for small-scale construction is simple to design and construct. When properly mixed and dried, the papercrete wall can be left exposed to the elements. In its natural state, it is a grey, fibrous- looking wall. For a more conventional look, stucco can be applied directly to it. A study model home made of papercrete has been built at the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies. This study model is a sample of homes to be built for a sustainable community in Tijuana by students of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Since 2006 a small company based in England, Econovate Ltd has developed, with the support of Cambridge and Bath University, a papercrete formula and production process for breeze blocks to be accepted by British Standard and a green certification for Europe. This new mixture of papercrete is to withstand the wet and harsh English weather. As of 2009 Econovate was in the process of developing this product and reaching manufacturing trials stage. A patent was filed in 2011 for the production process of breeze blocks with this material. The design of machinery was necessary to achieve a successful scale up of production. In January 2013 Econovate became fully funded to set up its first demonstration plant capable of producing up to 1.5m blocks a year which expected to achieve certification by October 2015. The company has tested the product at UKAS register testing houses for 18 rigours test such as fire, strength, moisture movement, acoustics, thermal, durability and others toward the product certification. This certification by LABC was achieved in dec 2015. The company was also in the process of achieving ISO 9001, 14001, 18001 and BS eN 6001 (responsible sourcing). Its ISO 9001 certification was achieved in October 2015. Econovate with its product Econoblok is producing a breeze block, UK standard size (440mmx215mmx100mm) with 5Mpa and another with 7Mpa. The difference between the two will be the amount of fibre within the mixture and this can range between 55% to 79%. The more strength the less fibre thus less thermal. After gaining Certification the company has increased production and the product is called \\"econoblok¬Æ\\". Initial commercialization will be in the UK until the production process is fully tested and ready for up scaling to a full size plant. From January 2017 the company will start preparing for the full size plant of 5-6 million block production, this will be based in the UK. Econovate plans to expand to other region of the world where some basic recycling system exist. Compressive test on papercrete block reveals that papercreate can withstand load up to its 30% axial compressive strain. Do it yourself Papercrete is rapidly gaining a groundswell of support among \\"do it yourself\\" builders. It is claimed to be a very attractive building material due to its very low cost, light weight, and high performance. Many owner/builders are contributing to furthering the technology and sharing their experiences over the internet through resources such as \\"Papercreters\\".

Early life and education Thwaites was born in Brisbane, to Yorkshire immigrant Robert Ernest Thwaites who taught at Brisbane Grammar School and Jessie Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Hugh Nelson, a previous premier of Queensland. He was educated at Geelong Grammar School, entering Trinity College at the University of Melbourne from which he graduated in 1937. As a student he came into contact with the Oxford Group (later Moral Rearmament), whose ideas greatly influenced him. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to attend the University of Oxford where he won the Newdigate Prize (1938) for poetry and the King's Gold Medal for Poetry (1940). He was the first Australian to win either of these prizes, and is still the only Australian to have won the Newdigate Prize. Naval and intelligence career Thwaites joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and served as an officer in World War II. In 1999 he published Atlantic Odyssey, an account of his war service on an anti-submarine escort trawler. After the war he returned to Oxford to complete his studies, then returned to Australia, becoming a lecturer in English at the University of Melbourne in 1947. Despite having no background in intelligence work, Thwaites was recruited in 1950 to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) by its director- general Charles Spry. Unlike the British tradition of university recruitment, in 1950 almost all ASIO staff were from military intelligence and police operational backgrounds, and Spry had been encouraged to recruit senior staff with higher educational credentials. Thwaites proved to be a highly competent intelligence officer and encouraged more analytical recruitment policies. Despite some outside criticism that ASIO staff was an \\"old boys' club\\" (perhaps based on the assumption that ASIO was modelled on MI5), military and police backgrounds dominated ASIO staffing into the 1970s and Thwaites eventually resigned believing that the analytical resources were undervalued.Michael Thwaites, Truth Will Out: ASIO and the Petrovs, William Collins, Sydney 1980 In 1954 Thwaites played a leading role in the defection of the Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov to Australia, which led to the celebrated Petrov Affair. When Petrov first defected it was Thwaites who debriefed him, and he later spent 18 months with Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov at an ASIO \\"safe house\\" in Sydney. Thwaites always insisted that the timing of Petrov's defection was determined by Petrov, and was not orchestrated to coincide with the 1954 federal election, as the Labor Party leader, Dr H.V. Evatt said at the time and as many people in Australia still believe. He also maintained that Petrov was a genuinely important source of intelligence in the Cold War context, revealing the names of about 600 Soviet operatives around the world. Thwaites recorded his part in these events in Truth Will Out: ASIO and the Petrovs.Michael Thwaites, Truth Will Out: ASIO and the Petrovs, William Collins, Sydney 1980 He also ghost-wrote the Petrovs' book Empire of Fear.Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov, Empire of Fear, Andre Deutsch, London, 1956 Literary life and career Thwaites left ASIO in 1971 to become Assistant Parliamentary Librarian. This position enabled him to devote more time to poetry, which was always his first love. His best known poems include The Jervis Bay, The Prophetic Hour, and Message to My Grandson. His collected poems spanning 1932 to 2004 were published as Unfinished Journey which won the 2005 ACT Writing and Publishing Awards for poetry. With his wife Honor, he wrote the patriotic hymn For Australia, to a tune by Henry Purcell. Honours Thwaites was made an officer of the Order of Australia in 2002. He was an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Melbourne.  References   External links  * . Trinity Today.

The single was not an album track, though it was written at the same time, and possessed a similar sound. \\"Gotta Stop Messin' About\\" marked the first time Prince released non-album tracks, which, especially as B-sides, would become a prominent part of his career. The song is keyboard dominated, and the lyrics speak of a woman who's constantly \\"messin' about\\" with other men. The song contains familiar Prince themes of sexual frustration, masturbation and sexual metaphors. The track consists of two verses and multiple repeats of the chorus. It was played live on the Dirty Mind Tour with an extended instrumental section at the end. \\"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\\" was released in the UK as two separate 7\\" singles, one with the Dirty Mind track \\"Uptown\\" as a B-side, and the other with \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", from Prince. Each single also had an accompanying 12\\" single, both with the same tracks as the 7\\" and both including the song \\"Head\\", from Dirty Mind. Despite an extensive advertising campaign and promotion, and coinciding with Prince's first UK gig, neither issue of the single charted.

His research includes the U.S. foreign and national security policy and causes and prevention of war. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.https://www.cfr.org/membership/roster Biography Van Evera received his A.B. in government from Harvard and his Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. During the 1980s he was managing editor of the journal International Security. Van Evera is the author of Causes of War: Power and the Roots of Conflict (Cornell, 1999). He has also co edited Nuclear Diplomacy and Crisis Management (1990), Soviet Military Policy (1989), and The Star Wars Controversy (1986). Academic work Van Evera is considered a defensive realist, which is a branch of structural realism.Stephen Walt, \\"International Relations: One World, Many Theories,\\" Foreign Policy 110 (Spring 1998), 29-45. =Offense- defense theory= In Causes of War: Power and the Roots of Conflict, Van Evera proposed Offense-Defense theory, which attempts to discern what factors increase the likelihood of war. Van Evera states three main hypotheses: 1\\\\. War will be more common in periods when conquest is easy, or is believed to be easy, than in other periods. 2\\\\. States that have, or believe they have, large offensive opportunities or defensive vulnerabilities will initiate and fight more wars than other states. 3\\\\. Actual examples of true imbalances are rare and explain only a moderate amount of history. However, false perceptions of these factors are common and thus explain a great deal of history. The causes of World War I provide a good example of Van Evera‚Äôs theory in action. Although trench warfare, poison gas, and the development of the machine gun and air support meant that defensive strategies should have prevailed, many European nations were under the illusion that conquest was easy or that they were valuable.Keir A. Lieber. (2007). \\"The New History of World War I and What It Means for International Relations Theory\\", in International Security Vol. 32, No. 2: 155-191. This misconception resulted in a drawn-out, bloody conflict. Recent discussion in international relations theory questions the idea of explaining outbreak of World War I. with the offense-defense balance.

Leonnorius was one of the leaders of the Celts in their invasion of Macedonia and the adjoining countries. When the main body under Brennus marched southwards into Macedonia and Greece (279 BC), Leonnorius and Lutarius led a detachment, twenty-thousand strong, into Thrace, where they ravaged the country to the shores of the Hellespont, compelled the city of Byzantium to pay them tribute, and made themselves masters of Lysimachia. The rich Asiatic shores of the Hellespont afforded them a tempting prospect; and while Leonnorius returned to Byzantium, in order to compel the inhabitants of that city to give him the means of transporting his troops to Asia, Lutarius contrived to capture a few vessels, with which he conveyed all the force remaining under his command across the Hellespont. While Leonnorius was still before Byzantium, Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, being in want of support in his war with his brother Zipoetes II and the Seleucid king, Antiochus I Soter, agreed to take him and his troops, as well as those of Lutarius, into his pay, and furnished them with the means of passing over into Asia (278 BC). They first assisted him against his rival brother, Zipoetes II, in Bithynia; after which they made plundering excursions through various parts of Asia; and ultimately established themselves in the province, called thenceforth from the name of its conquerors, Galatia (region before known as part of Phrygia).

Plot  A woman, Ellen, takes the elevator from her workplace on floor 38, and presses the button to head for the parking garage. A burly workman named Ben gets on several floors below. His silent behavior creeps out Ellen, who intently stares at the lift display hoping for the ride to end. At floor 4, the lift opens but both find nobody outside. As the elevator is about to close, a man shouts for them to let him in and Ellen manages to press the button in time to allow him into the elevator. The panic-stricken man, whose name is Hank, is a security guard in the building. He desperately uses his security card to override the controls and take the elevator back up. Ellen and Ben protest at what Hank is doing but are stunned to see Hank's shirt covered in blood. Visibly shaken, Hank quickly explains that something outside (which he claims looks like an alien) is killing people and was about to get him. Ben disbelieves the guard's story and attempts to send the elevator back down but finds that he can't control it. Hank reveals he used the card and Ben angrily tries to grab it from him, but is repelled back when Hank takes out a spring-assisted knife to defend himself. Eventually, Ben restrains Hank while Ellen tries to call the lift telephone for help, to no avail. The elevator rocks and the lights go out, causing the three to stop. Ben reveals he has claustrophobia and uses Hank's knife to open the elevator panel and fiddle with the controls in order to operate the lift, but Hank stops him. Ben then tries to get the lift ceiling hatch open, but Hank stops him and tells him and Ellen that the monsters outside will get in and kill all of them. The lift becomes operational once again and Ellen manages to wrestle the card away from the men and use it to send the elevator down to the garage. Ben, desperate to be out of the lift, presses the button for floor 39. As the trio watch, the elevator doors open but there is no sign of any monster/alien outside. Ben steps out and invites Ellen to join him in leaving the building via the stairs. Ellen initially accepts but becomes fearful of Ben when she sees Hank's knife in his pocket. She dashes right back into the elevator before Ben can stop her. While the lift goes down, Hank presses the stop button to halt the elevator and Ellen becomes panicked, saying that she wants to go down. Before they can argue, someone attempts to open the lift hatch. Hank keeps the hatch shut while instructing Ellen to send the elevator to floor 44. This causes the thing outside to stop its attempt to enter, but dents the hatch. Before the two can react, they're startled by Ben's mutilated corpse which comes tumbling down into the elevator. Ellen blames Hank for not allowing Ben to enter as she believes he was trying to rescue her. Hank unsuccessfully tries to calm her and the two struggle to gain possession of the security card. They accidentally push the card out the elevator via the hole between the door and the floor. Ellen then uses the knife to open the panel like Ben did earlier. Hank tries again to convince her it's much safer to stay in the lift, but Ellen accidentally stabs the knife into him when she swings it in anger. Stunned by what she has done, she takes the knife out of Hank, but then proceeds to murder him by stabbing him repeatedly. The elevator once again operates and goes to the parking garage. When the doors open, Ellen drops her knife and faces the garage. She hears voices ahead telling her to hold the elevator open for them, and soon a large group of people run toward her direction shouting and screaming, fleeing from something behind them, implying that what Hank first told Ellen and Ben was true and monsters were indeed attacking. The people squeeze past Ellen as she grins emptily, implying they will be Ellen's next victims instead.

Since 2010, he has worked in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, including serving as the Blue Jays' quality control coach in 2018. He is currently the head baseball coach at Northside Methodist Academy in Dothan, AL. School and minor leagues Mordecai graduated from Hewitt-Trussville High School, Trussville, Alabama in 1986 where he played baseball, basketball and football. During his time in college at the University of South Alabama, he was a two-time All-American and named to the All-Sun Belt Conference team each year. In 1987, he helped the Jaguars to the conference title. Mordecai majored in criminal justice and minored in sociology. In 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. With their sixth round selection of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft, the Atlanta Braves drafted Mordecai. He began his minor league career at Class A Burlington and eventually worked his way up to Greenville. In 1992, he made his way to Triple-A Richmond on June 19. In 1993, he was selected as Richmond's Most Competitive Player. He played every defensive position with the exception of center field and pitcher that season. Professional career =Atlanta Braves= In 1994, Mordecai made it to the majors but only for four at bats. His first tour was from May 3‚Äì20 for the Atlanta Braves, when he replaced Jeff Blauser on the roster. Mordecai's first hit was a three-run home run in the ninth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. Mordecai continued to torment the Phillies throughout his career. He received the John M. Zwack III Memorial Award for being the most community-minded player. Mordecai played on the 1995 World Series team as a bench player. He made his first start at second on July 16 at San Diego. In the NLDS he went 2-for-3 with a double and 2 RBI. His pinch-hit single in the ninth inning of Game 2 gave the Braves the go-ahead run. In the World Series, he went 1-for-3. Unfortunately for Mordecai, the Braves had Mark Lemke at second base, Chipper Jones at third and Fred McGriff at first preventing him from getting more than a reserve role with the team. Mordecai was the Braves' starting third baseman on opening day 1996, though only because Chipper Jones was on the DL with an injury. On August 30, he collected the first three-hit game of his career at Chicago. =Montreal Expos= Mordecai's inability to stay consistent while a member of the Braves frustrated the front office and, in 1998, he joined the Montreal Expos. Mordecai made 53 starts the next year. He then enjoyed his best seasons there in 2000 and 2001. On April 2, 2001, Mordecai demonstrated his versatility by playing catcher in the tenth inning of a game against the Cubs after Montreal's first catcher, Michael Barrett, was ejected and their second catcher, Sandy Mart√≠nez, was injured. =Florida Marlins= In the midst of the 2002 trade deadline he was traded to the Florida Marlins. His statistics for the season drastically improved after the trade. The following season, he was again a key part in helping the inexperienced Marlins win the 2003 World Series. In Game 6 of the NLCS, the Marlins were five outs away from being eliminated when Cubs fan, Steve Bartman, prevented a foul ball from being potentially caught by extending his arms over Mois√©s Alou while Alou attempted to field the pop-up. Mordecai's subsequent three-run double blew the game open, highlighting the Cubs' historic collapse in what is sometimes referred to as simply \\"The Inning\\". Mordecai would go on to win his second World Series, as the Marlins handily defeated the Yankees in the World Series. On June 1, 2004, Mordecai again filled the role as emergency catcher, this time for eight innings after Ram√≥n Castro was injured. Mordecai took a job as manager with the Marlins minor league affiliate Jamestown Jammers in December 2004. A few days later, the team announced that they would give him a chance to join the team in September so he could reach ten years of Major League service; Mordecai played two games in 2005 before retiring for good. Mordecai also worked as a batting coach for MLB before turning to coaching for a private High School in Dothan, Alabama. The school is Dothan is Houston Academy. His last high school game was against the Leroy Bears on the road in the first round of the Alabama State High School Playoffs in 2009. Coaching In 2010, Mordecai was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays as a minor league infield coordinator. In 2015, he was promoted to coordinator of instruction, and on January 10, 2018, Mordecai was promoted to the quality control coach position. In 2019, Mordecai was once again reassigned within the Blue Jays organization, to his current position as manager of the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Personal life Mordecai was married on February 5, 2000, to his second wife, Jennifer. Later that year, she gave birth to the first of their three sons. He also has a daughter Taylor, born in 1995, from a first marriage.

Upon his return to Europe he wrote an enormously popular travelogue. In it he recounted his voyage up the \\"Long River,\\" now thought to be the Missouri. He wrote at length and in very positive terms about Native American culture, portraying Indian people as free, rational and generally admirable.  Early life  He was born into the aristocracy and inherited the title Baron Lahontan upon his father's death in 1674. De Lahontan joined the troupes de la marine and was sent to New France in 1683 at age 17 along with two other officers and three companies of troops.Lanct√¥t, Gustave. The Oakes Collection.

Having already faced the reality of settler life in Beaupr√©, de Lahontan again led his men to Boucherville to live with local habitants between 1685 and 1687 ‚Äì himself dividing his time between hunting and classical literature. Just prior to a decision to return to France, Lahontan was ordered ‚Äìat least in part because of his knowledge of the Algonkian language- to head a detachment of French and native troops towards Fort St. Joseph where he would launch another attack on the Iroquois. He was a restless commander and spent much of his time exploring the region. In 1688 following news of the abandonment of the post at Niagara and renewed attacks of the Iroquois, he burned his fort and led his men to Michillimackinac in search of supplies and possibly entertainment for his men. De Lahontan felt that without supplies from Niagara his dwindling stores would not be enough to last the winter. During the winter and spring months he explored the upper Mississippi valley where he ascended the ‚ÄúRivi√®re Longue‚Äù; some scholars consider this a fanciful tale, others argue that he had discovered the Missouri River.Lanct√¥t, Gustave.

Further, he led a successful offense against five English frigates of Phipp's invasion fleet in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1690 under Frontenac. Though his proposal for a Great Lakes flotilla was ultimately rejected on the basis of cost, de Lahontan would be promoted to King's Lieutenant. At Placentia, he defended the capital from a siege in 1692.https://archive.org/stream/newvoyagestonort03laho#page/184/mode/1up On 13 December 1692 following a conflict with the governor of Placentia (Newfoundland), Jacques-Fran√ßois de Monbeton de Brouillan, de Lahontan decided to abandon his office and New France altogether.

Ottawa: J.O. Patenaude, 1940. 17. During an unknown period of time in Saragossa, Spain until at least 1696, de Lahontan recorded his memoirs for the English government explaining how and why they should take French controlled Canada.  Author  Upon return to Amsterdam in 1703 he published his three most famous works: Nouveaux Voyages dans l‚ÄôAmerique Septentrionale, Memoires de l‚ÄôAmerique Septentrionale, and Supplement aux Voyages ou Dialogues avec le sauvage Adario. Nouveaux Voyages dans l‚ÄôAmerique Septentrionale provides a thorough and detailed account of de Lahontan's life and stay in New France, while Memoires de l‚ÄôAmerique Septentrionale describes his observations of geography, institutions, commerce as well as information about native tribes. Finally, Supplement aux Voyages ou Dialogues avec le sauvage Adario lambasts institutional Christianity by means of a dialogue between de Lahontan and a Huron Chief named Adario (The Rat). The author attempts to contrast the injustice of Christianity with the freedom and justice of native people. His idealized view of \\"natural humanity\\" as a vehicle for criticizing European civilization was a forceful early expression of the \\"noble savage\\" trope associated with the Enlightenment.

He seems to have been an earlier supporter of astrology, which, though derided by many Greek intellectuals, came to be accepted after Alexander the Great conquered major parts of the Near East.Beck R., A Brief History of Ancient Astrology, Blackwell, 2007, p.15. Gilbert Murray has written earlier 'astrology fell upon the Hellenistic mind as a new disease falls upon some remote island people' (Five Stages of Greek Religion, NY:Doubleday, 1955, p177) The sources for the life of Epigenes are Seneca the Younger (c 65 AD), Pliny the Elder (c. 77 AD), and Censorinus (c. 238 AD).W.

Pliny the Elder writes that Epigenes attests to the fact that the Chaldeans preserved astral observations in inscriptions upon brick tiles (coctilibus laterculis) extending to a period of 720 years. Pliny calls Epigenes a writer of first-rate authority (gravis auctor imprimis).Pliny. Historia Naturalis, vii. 56. Smith interprets this to mean that Epigenes came before Berossus.

On 24 June 1982, the route was flown by the City of Edinburgh, a Boeing 747-200. The aircraft flew into a cloud of volcanic ash thrown up by the eruption of Mount Galunggung (approximately south-east of Jakarta, Indonesia), resulting in the failure of all four engines. The reason for the failure was not immediately apparent to the crew or air traffic control. The aircraft was diverted to Jakarta in the hope that enough engines could be restarted to allow it to land there. The aircraft glided out of the ash cloud, and all engines were restarted (although one failed again soon after), allowing the aircraft to land safely at the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta. The crew members of the accident segment had boarded the aircraft in Kuala Lumpur, while many of the passengers had been aboard since the flight began in London.Episode \\"Falling from the Sky\\" from the TV series Mayday (Air Emergency, Air Crash Investigation) [documentary TV series]. Accident Shortly after 13:40 UTC (20:40 Jakarta time) above the Indian Ocean, south of Java, the flight crew (consisting of 32-year-old Senior First Officer Roger Greaves, 40-year-old Senior Engineer Officer Barry Townley-Freeman, and 41-year-old Captain Eric Moody) heading to the lavatory first noticed an unusual effect on the windscreen similar to St. Elmo's fire. Despite the weather radar showing clear skies, the crew switched on engine anti-ice and the passenger seat belt signs as a precaution. As the flight progressed, smoke began to accumulate in the passenger cabin of the aircraft; it was first assumed to be cigarette smoke. However, it soon began to grow thicker and had an odour of sulphur. Passengers who had a view of the aircraft's engines through the window noted that they were unusually bright blue, with light shining forward through the fan blades and producing a stroboscopic effect. At approximately 13:42 UTC (20:42 Jakarta time), the number four Rolls-Royce RB211 engine began surging and soon flamed out. The flight crew immediately performed the engine shutdown drill, quickly cutting off fuel supply and arming the fire extinguishers. Less than a minute later, at 13:43 UTC (20:43 Jakarta time), engine two surged and flamed out. Within seconds, and almost simultaneously, engines one and three flamed out, prompting the flight engineer to exclaim, \\"I don't believe it‚Äîall four engines have failed!\\" Without engine thrust, a 747-200 has a glide ratio of approximately 15:1, meaning it can glide forward 15 miles for every mile it drops. The flight crew quickly determined that the aircraft was capable of gliding for 23 minutes and covering from its flight level of . At 13:44 UTC (20:44 Jakarta time), Greaves declared an emergency to the local air traffic control authority, stating that all four engines had failed. However, Jakarta Area Control misunderstood the message, interpreting the call as meaning that only engine number four had shut down. After a nearby Garuda Indonesia flight relayed the message to them, air traffic control correctly understood the urgent message. Despite the crew \\"squawking\\" the emergency transponder setting of 7700, air traffic control could not locate the 747 on their radar screens. Many passengers, fearing for their lives, wrote notes to relatives. One such passenger was Charles Capewell, who scrawled \\"Ma. In trouble. Plane going down. Will do best for boys. We love you. Sorry. Pa XXX\\" on the cover of his ticket wallet. Owing to the high Indonesian mountains on the south coast of the island of Java, an altitude of at least was required to cross the coast safely. The crew decided that if the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude by the time they reached they would turn back out to sea and attempt to ditch into the Indian Ocean. The crew began engine restart drills, despite being well outside the recommended maximum engine in-flight start envelope altitude of . The restart attempts failed. Despite the lack of time, Moody made an announcement to the passengers that has been described as \\"a masterpiece of understatement\\": As pressure within the cabin fell, oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling ‚Äì an automatic emergency measure to make up for the lack of air. On the flight deck, however, Greaves's mask was broken; the delivery tube had detached from the rest of the mask. Moody swiftly decided to descend at 1,800 m per minute to an altitude where there was enough pressure in the outside atmosphere to breathe almost normally. At , the crew was approaching the altitude at which they would have to turn over the ocean and attempt a risky ditching. Although there were guidelines for the water landing procedure, no one had ever tried it in a Boeing 747. As they performed the engine restart procedure, engine number four finally started, and at 13:56 UTC (20:56 Jakarta time), Moody used its power to reduce the rate of descent. Shortly thereafter, engine three restarted, allowing him to climb slowly. Shortly after that, engines one and two successfully restarted as well. The crew subsequently requested and expedited an increase in altitude to clear the high mountains of Indonesia. As the aircraft approached its target altitude, the St. Elmo's fire effect on the windscreen returned. Moody throttled back; however, engine number two surged again and was shut down. The crew immediately descended and held . As Flight 9 approached Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport, the crew found it difficult to see anything through the windscreen, and made the approach almost entirely on instruments, despite reports of good visibility. The crew decided to fly the instrument landing system (ILS); however, the vertical guidance system was inoperative, so they were forced to fly with only the lateral guidance as the first officer monitored the airport's distance measuring equipment (DME). He then called out how high they should be at each DME step along the final approach to the runway, creating a virtual glide slope for them to follow. Moody described it as \\"a bit like negotiating one's way up a badger's arse.\\" Although the runway lights could be made out through a small strip of the windscreen, the landing lights on the aircraft seemed to be inoperable. After landing, the flight crew found it impossible to taxi, due to glare from apron floodlights which made the already sandblasted windscreen opaque. Investigation Damaged engine parts from BA 9 on display at Auckland Museum Post-flight investigation revealed that City of Edinburgh's problems had been caused by flying through a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. Because the ash cloud was dry, it did not appear on the weather radar, which was designed to detect the moisture in clouds. The cloud sandblasted the windscreen and landing light covers and clogged the engines. As the ash entered the engines, it melted in the combustion chambers and adhered to the inside of the power-plant. As the engine cooled from inactivity, and as the aircraft descended out of the ash cloud, the molten ash solidified and enough of it broke off for air to again flow smoothly through the engine, allowing a successful restart. The engines had enough electrical power to restart because one generator and the on-board batteries were still operating; electrical power was required for ignition of the engines. Aftermath Engines one, two and three were replaced at Jakarta, as well as the windscreen, and the fuel tanks were cleared of the ash that had entered them through the pressurisation ducts, contaminating the fuel and requiring that it be disposed of. After the aircraft was ferried back to London, engine number four was replaced and major work was undertaken to return the 747 to service. Although the airspace around Mount Galunggung was closed temporarily after the accident, it was reopened days later. It was only after a Singapore Airlines 747 was forced to shut down three of its engines while flying through the same area nineteen days later (13 July) that Indonesian authorities closed the airspace permanently and rerouted airways to avoid the area; a watch was set up to monitor clouds of ash. Flight 9 was not the first encounter with this eruption ‚Äì a Garuda DC-9 had encountered ash on 5 April 1982. The crew received various awards, including the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air for Moody, and medals from the British Airline Pilots' Association. G-BDXH's engineless flight entered the Guinness Book of Records as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built aircraft (this record was later broken by Air Canada Flight 143 in 1983 and Air Transat Flight 236 in 2001). One of the passengers, Betty Tootell, wrote a book about the accident, All Four Engines Have Failed, having managed to trace some 200 of the 247 passengers on the flight. In 1993, Tootell married fellow passenger James Ferguson, who had been seated in the row in front of her. She later noted: \\"The 28th December 2006 marks the start of our 14th year of honeymoon, and on the 24th June 2007 many passengers and crew will no doubt gather to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our mid-air adventure.\\" 237x237px British Airways continued to operate the Flight 9 route from London Heathrow to Sydney but in March 2012, the route was curtailed to Bangkok, and the aircraft operating this route is now a Boeing 777-200ER. City of Edinburgh, later renamed City of Elgin, continued to fly for British Airways after the accident, before being sold to European Aviation Air Charter. The aircraft was taken out of service in February 2004 and in July 2009 the then 30-year-old aircraft was broken up at a breaking facility at Bournemouth International Airport (BOH). It has been reported that in September 2009 the environmental group 10:10 bought the fuselage of City of Edinburgh to be made into tags. Despite a BBC report of this, the remains of the fuselage had been removed from the facility by that time. The tags, bearing the campaign's logo, were reportedly worn as necklaces or bracelets to raise awareness of 10:10's work: the organisation aimed to persuade individuals, organisations and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010. Captain Eric Moody gave an interview to the July 2010 edition of Flaps Podcast, where he recounted his experience.  In popular culture  The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series Mayday featured Flight 9 in a 2007 episode titled Falling From the Sky or All Engines Failed which featured interviews with the flight crew and passengers, and a dramatization of the flight.
